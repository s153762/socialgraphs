Of course, the armor in the actual Elemental Workshop III better be good, as Mind and Elemental aren't as good and you cannot wear them all at the same time (as they are both shields and helmets).Quest Requirements: Starting  Go to the elemental workshop, where a seer will be. You will speak to him and he will be surprised that you are there, but you reassure him, and tell him that you have been here before. He calms down, then tells you about mind shields and helms, which you tell him you have already made. The seer then produces a key that you have never seen before. He tells you he thinks it's a key to a door in the elemental workshop.The Room and the Library  You walk downstairs, past the mind door room, and use the key on the door. The key sinks into the door, and opens. The seer appears at the bottom of the stairs and tell you about a book he has found in the library in seer's village. Then he runs inside the body door room to looks around. You go to the library and find the book, called \"Mind, body, soul\" and take it to the body room. Inside the room there is a broken magic anvil, which the seer asks you to fix. You have to use a bodythe anvil to fix it. Next to the anvil is a Lake of the Body.Creating the armour  For this bit you need 2 elemental bars, a hammer and \"Mind, body, soul\". Run down to the Body room and use the elemental metal on the lake of the body. This will create Body metal. Use the body metal on the magic anvil, and using the instructions in the book, you can create \"Body platebody\" or \"Body platelegs\" . after creating both, talk to the seer.

Dragon defender  Dragon defender is obtained as a drop from Cyclopes in the Warriors' Guild, only after obtaining a Rune defender and completing the Weer Nawt Stoopd. Dragon defender requires 60 Defence and 60 Attack to wield. It is the third strongest defender in the game (proceeded by the Barrows defender and Crystal defender).Dragonite dragon  The Dragonite dragon is the third most powerful metal dragon, at level 129, and has 30,000 hp, beaten by the Barrows dragon and the Crystal dragon. As with all metal dragons, the creature is weak to magic, especially water attacks. It's also slightly weak to stab attacks, but water spells would be preferred as they are very effective against the creature. Few players dare to fight this monster, and even less players accomplish this task, this dragon can break down an Anti-dragon shield, because of this the player is advised to use a Dragonfire shield since this is the only shield that cannot be broken by the dragon. This monster can hit through prayer and armour with melee, although its max hit is cut by 66% with an anti-dragon shield. Its fire can hit through any prayer and still retains its original maximum hit. However the anti-dragonbreath potion and dragonfire shield will stop it. It's weak to water spells. Locations:Trivia Dragon pickaxe (Zarseus)  The dragon pickaxe is one of the strongest pickaxes in its class and is only available to Members. As with all axes, it is both a weapon, requiring 60 Attack to wield, and a mining tool, requiring 61 Mining to use. While typical pickaxes have a metal handle that goes through the pick head, this pickaxe's handle is made from pure dragon tooth, which is stronger than any metal. If broken, it can be repaired at Bob's Brilliant Axes in Lumbridge for 1,800 coins. As with all Dragon equipment, this item cannot be made using the Smithing skill. The Dragon Pickaxe is more efficient than the rune pickaxe at mining rocks; it is about 15% faster than a rune pickaxe. Like other dragon weapons, the pickaxe has a special attack called \"Split.\" When used on an opponent, it lowers their defense by 15% and stuns them for as long as how much the special attack took, which takes 100% of the special bar. The Dragon Pickaxe can only be obtained as a rare drop from a Dragonite dragon .Barrows defender  The barrows defender is the strongest defender available (tied with the Crystal defender). It is used for its attack bonus and is held in the off-hand slot, in place of a shield. It requires 70 Attack and 70 Defence to wield. Barrows defender is dropped by the powerful Barrows dragon after players have shown their Dragon defender to Kamfreena. Ring of wealth does not affect the chances of getting it as a drop. A barrows defender is commonly combined with a Dragon scimitar, Abyssal whip or a Chaotic longsword for its strength and attack bonus.Rune dragon  Rune dragons are located in the depths of Radiver's Dungeon. These dragons are extremely dangerous, and with their special attack Rune Smash, they are capable of hitting over 5,500, although this is rare to occur. You will also need 85 Slayer to kill these. Since they are made of metal, rune dragons have extremely high defence, but are relatively weak to magic, especially against air spells. Drops are any kinds of Dragon items, including the dragon kiteshield (still very rare) and the Ancients set. It is known for dropping rune items very often. It also drops dragon runes more often then any other monster, maybe this could be because of the word game Rune dragon and Dragon rune (see examine text). It is hunted by many high leveled players, due it's 100% drop of a runite bar, making it a good way of making money, but some more skillful players still prefer to hunt down Dragonite dragons, or even Crystal dragons. Locations:Barrows dragon  The Barrows dragon is an extremely dangerous and strong monster to fight and shares the position of strongest metal dragon with the Crystal dragon. It is advised to only take what you know you are most likely going to lose if attempting to fight the dragon. This dragon is even able to break down Dragonfire shields. With each hit, the charges of the dragonfire shield is decreased by 1. After it has reached 0 charges, it will break after the next hit (the draconic visage will appear in your inventory with an anti-dragon shield left on your hand). Due to this, it is advised to bring two, or even three fully charged Dragonfire shields each trip, and repairing them after the fight. Unlike other metal dragons, this dragon will run towards you and stunning you for 5 seconds if you are a distance away from it. So no matter what, you'll have to tank it's melee hits, which can hit as high as 2,300. You need a Dragonfire shield to resist the dragons long ranged dragon breath attacks. A normal anti-dragon shield will not work. Alternatively, you could use a Supreme dragonfire shield to protect against the Barrows dragons as it does not lose charges like the Dragonfire shield, but it is very expensive. The dragon can hit very high damage and it has incredibly high accuracy, so any armor with high level melee and range is a must, since the dragon rarely attacks with its magic attack and because its melee and ranged attacks are much stronger. However, the dragon doesn't have much lp and its defence is very low. Players should be able to hit constantly with a chaotic weapon\u00a0(or better). The Crystal dragon is on the other hand, the complete opposite, as it has lower accuracy and damage, but its defence and hp are very high.Location Phases  While fighting the dragon, you would have to fight through 6 different phases.The Blighted phase  In this phase, each of the dragons attacks will have a 20% chance of lowering the players strength down by 5 levels, so bringing an overload or super overload, will make this phase easier to get through. Players who do not have the Herblore level to make these will just have to bring a lot of super restores.The Wretched phase  In this phase, the dragons attacks slow down to an attack speed of 3 (which is half as fast as it usually attacks), but its attacks become incredibly powerful, whereby its melees maximum damage rises to 4,000, ranged maximum rises to 3,500 but its magic attack remains the same. On the bright side, the dragons defence lowers, so the players main motive is to kill the dragon through this phase as fast as they can.The Infested phase  In this phase, each of the dragons attacks will have a 20% to regenerate half the damage it dealt to the player.The Tainted phase  Similar to the blighted phase, the dragon will have a 20% chance to lower one of the players stats, this time being the players magic stat. So again an overload or Super overload will help counter this.The Corrupted phase  The dragon drains all of the players adrenaline and stops the layer from regenerating any more adrenaline, so players are unable to use abilities throughout this phase.The Defiled phase  The dragon starts hitting through the players armor, meaning that even with very good gear, the dragon will be constantly be hitting 2000 damage on the player. After killing the dragon in this last phase, it collapses to the ground and its drops appear.Recommended Equipment  Inventory:Drops Charm drop percentages  Always 11 dropped at a timeTrivia Adamant dragon  Adamant dragons are level 115 monsters found throughout RuneScape. They're known to proceed the mithril dragon in terms of strength. These dragons have extremely high defence, but since they are made of metal, they are relatively weak to magic, with fire spells being their primary weakness. Adamant dragons are often killed for their possible drops, which includes the Draconic visage and several dragon item drops. Adamant dragons also drop green and gold charms regularly and 6 at a time.Locations: Drops Charms  Always drops 6 at onceDragon kiteshield  Since this was released in May, 2012, no new Dragon kiteshield articles will be accepted. If you were to have made an article before the official Dragon kiteshield was released into the game, then it would be fan fiction. Making an article about a Dragon kiteshield after the release is just being unoriginal. There are multiple works of fan fiction of a Dragon kiteshield, each created by different users before it was actually released.Article List Crystal dragon  The crystal dragon is one of the strongest dragons in RuneScape. It can drop all Crystal weapons, which each require level 70+ in a certain skill.\u00a0You need an Agility level of 50 and a slayer level of 95 to be able to hurt this monster. You also need to have done the Plague's End quest to kill it. This dragon is one of the few types of mineralic dragons in the game, along with the clay, granite and golden dragons. This monster has extremely high defense, but you will find that you're able to hit it more often with a higher agility level. It has a long range \"Crystalbreath\" attack. This attack has been known to hit as high as 4600, 2000 with a dragonfire shield\u00a0(an antifire shield will not work) or a super antifire potion, only 500 damage with a supreme dragonfire shield\u00a0(using a super antifire along with the shield will not further reduce the damage). However, a crystal (normal or attuned) shield, ward or deflector will completely block the attack. It can attack with either melee or ranged, melee being stronger, so it would be advised to attack the dragon from a distance. On the bright side, the dragons accuracy isn't too high and its damage is not much when compared to the Barrows dragon. The dragon has no weakness, but it is advised not to melee it, as its defence against melee attacks is extremely high. A good tactic is to use the protect from range prayer and the\u00a0Bloodfire barrage\u00a0spell\u00a0to heal yourself. The dragon can however teleport right next to the player, and then stun the player, meaning that the player will have to tank the dragons melee attacks for a few seconds, but unsurprisingly, using the teleblock spell stop the dragon from teleporting for a few seconds, making it much easier to kill the dragon. This dragon is sometimes set as a slayer assignment, giving 5000 Slayer exp, but you only have to kill one each task. The Crystal dragon (along with the Barrows dragon) has an very rare chance of dropping the Supreme draconic visage, and it is also known do drop Elemental runes (These are still not tradeable). The drop rate for a normal Draconic Visage however is high, compared to other, lower leveled, dragons.Locations  Currently, the only locations where it can be found are in the Slayerdungeon of Prifddinas, the The Forgotten Cavern and in Radiver's Dungeon. The Slayer dungeons are still a better way to slay them, as the dungeon is individual for each player and only the Dragons in the Slayer dungeon may drop the Crown of Seren and the Amulet of Seren and have a higher chance for any other rare drop. But however, in the slayer dungeons, there is no guarantee that the player will encounter the crystal dragon.Drops Charms  Always 11 dropped at a timeTrivia Void rune  Void runes are a form of noncraftable rune. They can be obtained as a drop from Dragonite dragons, Rune dragons, the Barrows dragon, the Crystal dragon or as a reward for beating the Grim Reaper in a fight when you're in The Void, with only 5% against the Reaper and 2% against the dragon, which is why they cost so much. They are only used in Loste Magicks, in the spells Annihilate and Steal Life. The new spell book, Noob Magicks, also needs a void rune in it's most powerful spells.Gilded Saradomin dragon platebody (g)  The Gilded Saradomin dragon platebody (g) is a platebody only obtainable through Level 5 Treasure Trails. Its stats are the same as a normal Dragon platebody, except for a +5 prayer boost.Dragon platebody  Since this was released in November, 2008, no new Dragon platebody articles will be accepted. If you were to have made an article before the official Dragon platebody was released into the game, then it would be fan fiction. Making an article about a Dragon platebody after the release is just being unoriginal. There are multiple works of fan fiction of a Dragon platebody, each created by different users before it was actually released.Article List Level 4 Treasure Trails  The Level 4 Treasure Trails is another type of treasure trail. It usually involves going into places deep in the Wilderness. Like all other Treasure Trails, it is available to members-only. This version of Treasure Trails has the smallest amount of rewards, though, the ability to play the song, Walking Disaster and the Black dragonhide body (g) are the hardest rewards to achieve.Rewards Dragon kiteshield (karmew32)  The dragon kiteshield is an extremely rare drop from Yellow dragons found in Carmadon Dungeon. Since they are so hard to defeat, and since it's an extremely rare drop, not many people have this legendary shield. When the Yellow dragons were first released, this shield was released along with it. Prices fetched up to 1 billion coins on the first day of release, and eventually went down to 50 million coins.Yu-Gi-Oh!: RuneScape Expansion  Yu-Gi-Oh!: RuneScape Expansion was an expansion pack of the popular card game, Yu-Gi-Oh!, featuring all-RuneScape players, items and locations. It was released on May 1, 2008, and had over 105 all-RuneScape cards. Any cards numbered more than 105 were promos from various events. Many RuneScape players who had never bought a Yu-Gi-Oh! booster pack before bought their first because of this set.Types  With this new set being RuneScape-related, new types had to be created to fit the cards. The seven new types introduced are:Cards Planet of the Lost Limited Edition Boosters  Limited edition booster packs were released, covering the Planet of the Lost series (role-plays), Time Fractures, Two Worlds, and Torchwood Gielinor. There was also a couple of decks released on this subject, one about the bad guys and the other about good guys.RuneScape The Movie: Promo Cards  A movie for RuneScape was released and came with several promo cards. It contains also bands featured in RuneScape Pking Videos.References and notes Zaros godsword  Since this was released in June, 2016, no new Zaros godsword articles will be accepted. If you were to have made an article before the official Zaros godsword was released into the game, then it would be fan fiction. Making an article about a Zaros godsword after the release is just being unoriginal. There are multiple works of fan fiction of a Zaros godsword, each created by different users before it was actually released.Article List Yellow dragon  Yellow dragons are powerful dragons that can be found in Champions' Guild Dungeon. They're found in the deeper half of the dungeon, and you need to get a Stone key which can be obtained by using Stone key loop and Stone key tooth together. The yellow dragonhides they drop can be crafted to make Yellow dragonhide armour, however this armour requires 65 Ranged to wear. They also drop components from the Ancients set. It can also drop a Dragon kiteshield if you're lucky. These dragons have extremely high defense, so killing one is an accomplishment.Bestiary  This category contains pages related to the monsters that appear in RuneScape Fan Fiction Wiki's content. To quickly find an article about a specific monster, type the monster's name (as it appears in RuneScape) into the search box in the sidebar to the right.Level 4.5 Treasure Trails  Level 4.5 Treasure Trails is a Treasure Trail which features really rare gold-trimmed stuff. The chances of a monster dropping a Level 4.5 Clue Scroll are very slim, so players are considered lucky if one is picked up.Rewards (current) Cockroach Queen  The Cockroach Queen is a low-level boss located in the Stronghold of Player Safety. She is widely considered to be a f2p version of the Kalphite Queen.Dragon platelegs (g)  The Dragon platelegs (g) can be obtained from Level 4 Treasure Trails. The only difference between the Dragon platelegs (g) and the normal Dragon platelegs is that there is a gold trim on the knee pad section of the dragon platelegs. The Dragon platelegs (g) cannot be made through any skill, including Crafting and Smithing. The Dragon platelegs (g) have the exact same stats as its counterpart, the standard dragon platelegs.Gielinor (Series)  Gielinor is an ongoing RuneScape-based story serial on the RuneScape Fan Fiction Wiki that was created by Mr. Garrison in 2008 and initially continued until Summer 2009. After a two year hiatus, the series was revived in late 2011, picking up from the exact point it left off under new 'showrunner' Mister Garrison. Gielinor is set in the Gieliverse and is intended to be truer to the game itself than the Runiverse-based projects of the timeframe the first three volumes were written in took place, with Gielinor being set in a \"present day\" 5th Age RuneScape. It is split into \"volumes\" rather than seasons or series, taking inspiration from the television series Heroes. There have been three volumes so far, Economy, Elements and Origins respectively, while the fourth volume Conflict is currently being released. The use of volumes to connect chapters allows for several short-term and long-term story arcs to play out, with each volume having a main arc and theme to it. Each volume consists of varying numbers of chapters, the longest being Elements which had 32. The following volume, the fifth, is currently entitled Foundations and is set to begin soon after the conclusion of Conflict. Gielinor has had a variety of writers over the course of its history including The evil dude and Ugozima, but currently the series is only being written by Mister Garrison. This has led to the creation of several characters, more than any other story serial on the RuneScape Fan Fiction Wiki \u2014 which has also contributed to it having the most stories as well, at 65 as of December 2011.History Creation  After limited success experienced with the wikia's series Morytania in mid-2008, which was hindered by its scope and enjoyment of contributing to Runiverse-based serials such as Time Fractures, Mr. Garrison wanted to create a popular new series on the wikia. The main rule would be however that unlike Runiverse-based projects, the series would not pretend to be a television programme, but simply be prose-based and exclusive to the wikia. Initially he aimed to make a lighthearted tongue-in-cheek series entitled Tarqinder the Dragon Slayer, based on a humorous forerunner of Gielinor's Tarqinder. Deciding on a more serious tone, Mr. Garrison abandoned these plans and set on making a more serious story serial.Early days  After toying with names such as The People, Gielinor was finally chosen and the series page was created, announcing the first volume (then untitled) would revolve around an economic crash in present-day RuneScape, and that anyone wishing to write should contact Mr. Garrison. With Tarqinder already established as appearing, (debuting in the first ever chapter, \"He Who Slays Dragons\") Veedi Limstrood was next to appear leading the way for a variety of different characters to feature. With The evil dude, Fegaxeyl, Jigo22 and Ugozima all signing up to write, many more characters came into play such as Tony de Fillo, Bruce Brysworth, Jake Rottham and Dancus Frumac. Expanding from 18 to 22 chapters, the first volume was a success, and as the storylines began to tie together they were finally rounded off in the series finale \"The Battle of Ardougne\". This set the scene for the next volume which Mr. Garrison already announced would pick up two months later.The \"Golden Age\"  The second volume commenced writing not long after in Summer 2008, and all the writers returned. ToaBionicle also signed up to write, but due to time constraints was unable to continue, transferring his completed work to Runiverse-based serial Before the Storm which he created not long after. An unused plan for this volume would have seen every story being written by at least two writers, to weave in ongoing storylines to every chapter, but Mr. Garrison abandoned this for the sake of timing. It also introduced the naming of volumes, with the first one being named Economy and the second Elements. This volume based itself on the real world topic of global warming which was given a RuneScape twist while The evil dude introduced the Sea Life Army's rise and rebellion against humankind as the main threat, which had been hinted at in the first volume. At 32 chapters it became the longest volume and finished writing in Autumn 2008, and had seen the introduction of several new characters such as Sir Raef, the villainous Sharkros, Hecate and Iyla, while properly introducing Raiah Gestoff and Falsotine Vadas who had cameoed in the first volume's conclusion. Ultimately it had the highest death toll to date, and by the final chapter \"The End of Days\", nearly all of The evil dude's characters had been killed off while the fate of Veedi Limstrood at the hands of \"Husband\" was left ambiguous, paving the way for the next volume...Beginning of the end  The third volume was announced as Origins and was written from Winter 2008 to 2009. Initially proposed to contain seven chapters, this was shortened to six as Ugozima did not put his story forward, and this became the short story \"Remembrance 134\". This meant all original writers aside from Ugozima returned. Basing itself on the premise of flashbacks into several main characters' origins, it brought many full circle outlining their pasts while also setting up the Human-Gnome conflict that would take center stage in the fourth volume. This formed the story arc of the volume, as we discovered Veedi's narrow escape from \"Husband\" who we discover to be plotting the extermination of gnomekind due to his bad experiences revealed in \"The Dawn of Dark Times\". It also introduced new gnomic characters Ronthin and King Boelryn while establishing Paula Hidrigg from the first volume's \"Gnomic Relations\" as a main character. The series seemed to have hit a stride on the wikia, gaining a forum to discuss series plans and the successful deal with the main RuneScape Wiki to promote Gielinor stories (and the Fan Fiction Wikia) through story excerpts in their Wiki Post. The first such story was \"Coming of Age\", and plans were outlined for \"Stories of Hemenster\" and the first chapter of volume five to do the same. On top of this, a set of short stories were written by Mr. Garrison and The evil dude to hint towards the events of the next volume. Mr. Garrison however announced that the 14 chapter fourth volume Conflict would become a solo project, would only involve the Human-Gnome conflict as the arc rather than storylines such as the rise of General Grotesque as outlined by The evil dude. Mr. Garrison then stated the fifth volume, Foundations, would be the longest yet with at least 50 chapters, and would effectively be \"a revamp\" to the series. All five writers were set to return, with 4ndrepd also joining the writing team. This move proved to be a fundamental factor in Gielinor's end, as with the amount of time taken to get round to writing the fourth volume in Summer 2009 and the prospect of writing 14 chapters alone facing Mr. Garrison, he decided to give creative writing a break. On July 15th 2009, following the writing of \"Sins of the Father\", Mr. Garrison announced that the series would officially become rated at an age of 13+ due to the introduction of scenes which some readers may find particularly unpleasant.The hiatus period  Taking time out from the wikia to pursue other projects, Gielinor reached its end with the third chapter of the volume, \"The Fool on the Hill\" being partially written. Story arcs had been set up with the introduction of Veedi's father and brother Arthur and Stanley respectively, but Garrison's departure in late Summer suggested an end. By the end of 2009, Gielinor was classed as a discontinued series and Mr. Garrison an inactive user. This marked the start of the hiatus period which would last for over two years.Out of the ashes  In late October 2011, Mister Garrison, a successor to the series' creator Mr. Garrison joined the wikia, although all the other Gielinor writers had long since departed. Aspiring to redevelop the writing skills from younger years, Mister Garrison hoped to continue this work and put Gielinor forward as now being a continuing series, picking up where the incomplete Volume Four left off. With \"The Fool on the Hill\" finally released and the next chapters announced, the series officially returned, and in November the first official logo was released to promote the return of the fourth volume from \"late 2011\". In December 2011 it was finally decided (after several changes) that the volume would be 15 chapters long. It is also known that there are preparations afoot for the fifth volume which will likely commence in 2012, suggesting Gielinor has a secure future ahead of it.Characters Primary characters Current characters Minor characters  Minor characters also appear, these are characters who have made a significant impact in one chapter or have appeared in non-important roles on several occasions. An example of the former being Chinelle, and an example of the latter being Dalmius.In-game characters  In some chapters, characters from RuneScape either cameo or serve a minor role, adding to the authencity of the series. These are not characters who serve as important characters, but are merely seen doing their recognised roles.Volume One: Economy  Volume One introduces the principal characters over the course of the first few chapters who are all hit by an economy crisis. As the story progresses they converge in Ardougne and discover that it is linked to a rogue monarch.Volume Two: Elements  Picking put two months after the battle which struck Ardougne at the end of the economy crisis, the cities of the world have begun to repair themselves and the world is getting back on its feet once more. However, a number of deadly storms have been hitting various regions of Gielinor which has provoked much fear among the people of the world, and also the Sea Life Army are preparing to take revenge on mankind for their constant fishing and disruption of the world's seas. Volume Two features 32 chapters and the authors remain the same as Volume One.Volume Three: Origins  Volume Three: Origins is set six months after the events of Volume Two, and now the world is finally at peace and our characters can look back on their pasts and how they got to where they are. Volume Three is primarily flashbacks, but these may be linked by scenes set in the present. The volume has one chapter per writer plus two more which begin and end the volume with a storyline which is a lead-up into Volume Four. An incomplete story exists entitled \"Remembrance 134\" written by Ugozima. Also, two short stories were written to be loosely connected to this volume as part of the competition Music to my Eyes set up by The evil dude. The stories were set in the present day, but still provided background information for characters. The first story \"Psycho Killer\" by Mr. Garrison and \"Indestructible\" by The evil dude.Volume Four: Conflict  Volume Four continues the storyline which begins during the final moments of \"The Dawn of Dark Times\". It takes the series in a new direction and offers a much darker tone to the stories, as well as being the only volume to date to involve one important storyline, the purgury of gnomekind. This volume was to be solely written by Mr. Garrison, and its primary character is Veedi Limstrood who was noticeably absent from Volume Two but returned in Volume Three. It was to be 8-12 chapters long and began writing in June 2009 and was expected to last until August 2009. The hiatus lead to a two year gap in the writing, although new writer Mister Garrison will be picking up from the exact point the series was left off and following the same premise from October 2011. The volume has however been shortened to 10 episodes for the sake of time constraints.Volume Five: Foundations  Volume Five was to mark a revamp in the series, according to creator Mr. Garrison. Several characters had been confirmed to be returning, though a significant amount would be appearing to finish their storylines to allow new characters to be introduced. It would involve the aftermath of the previous world problems and marked a new era in the world which is said to involve a change in attitude and some sustainable development in the world. It was said to contain at least 50 chapters, making it what would have been the longest volume to date and would have had at least four writers; Mr. Garrison, Ugozima, The evil dude and Jigo22, all having signed up to it on The Gielinor Forum, with 4ndrepd also joining as the first new writer since Volume One. This would also have been the first volume to utilize the newly created forum as a place to discuss plans and storylines. It was expected to commence writing in Summer 2009 when Volume Four reached its end. With the Gielinor hiatus of two years (2009-2011), these plans have now been abandoned due to writers leaving the wiki, although new head writer Mister Garrison will be following the same premises outlined, though it is likely the series will be shorter than planned.Dragon platebody (Zarseus)  Dragon platebody is a platebody requiring 60 Defence to wear. It is dropped by a Dragonite dragon. It is widely considered to be the best platebody in RuneScape, as it offers bonuses that is stronger than the Bandos chestplate which was belived to be the best armour on RuneScape.", "Starcraft Fan Fiction Wiki": "Starcraft Fan Fiction Wiki Main Page  Starcraft Fan Fiction Wikia\nThe wiki for original Starcraft fictional works\n1,099 articles since November 2007 \n\n\n Create a new article! About this wiki | New pages | New files | Active users | Categories | Wiki tutorial | Help pagesXel'Naga  The creators of two of the dominating races of the Koprulu Sector, the Zerg and Protoss.Overview Influence  The Xel'Naga are a psionically-attuned, ancient, cosmic race. They were occasionally referred to as the most powerful species known in the universe. While there are vague references of the Xel'Naga conquering worlds and uplifting species, their most notable involvement was with the Protoss and Zerg. Their interest in these two species was due to the Xel'Naga's cyclical life cycle. When the incredibly long-lived Xel'Naga were due to come to an end, the Xel'Naga would use these two species to be reborn. Ironically their survival was severely jeopardized when the Zerg turned on them. The Xel'Naga cherished all life and refused to kill anything, not even the entity at KL-2. The Protoss eventually followed a version of this philosophy, called the \"Dae'Uhl\". The etymology of the word \"Xel'Naga\" has been described as a Protoss language term meaning \"Wanderers from Afar\" but has also been described as their true name. The Protoss referred to the Xel'Naga as the \"Ihan-rii\", meaning \"Eternal Protectors\". The Xel'Naga have also been called the \"Great Teachers\", the \"Makers\", and the \"Guardians\", as well as \"Gods\".Biology  The Xel'Naga were incredibly long-lived by Protoss standards, but not immortal; eventually their species would come to an end. In the interest of survival they planned to create new Xel'Naga by uplifting two species. A pair of qualities was required and these were defined by the Xel'Naga as the purity of essence and the purity of form, and each uplifted species would be targeted for one of them. Over an extraordinarily long period of time, the two species would naturally come together and merge, forming the next generation of Xel'Naga.Vaul Units  The following lists Vaul units and basic stats.Expansion Units  These units hybridize more alien technologies to keep up with the ever changing fields of battle.Hero Units  These units are customized to be more powerful than standard forces.Campaign  These are more specialized and cannot be constructed by normal meansGantrithor II  Sable's flagship, the Gantrithor II, is patterned after Xel'Naga Worldship designs found in the ruins from Char, Aiur, and other worlds. His head researcher and expert in Xel'Naga artifacts, Xel Hassodin, aided him in the creation. It is five times the size of a normal Protoss Carrier and is equipped with the newer model of robotic interceptors. Still in development these newer models; aptly named: \"Destroyers\", are faster and have built in EMP repulsers (which negates EMP, as well as Lockdown attacks). This allows them to fight more effectively against the mechanical weapons of the Terran. The Gantrithor II, naturally, is also equipped with this technology, as well as a built in Prismatic Beam armaments. This is due to the crystal reactor within, which has a plethora of different crystal types. It is rumored to harbor other beam-based attacks, though there has been no confirmation to these rumors. The Gantrithor II also uses a highly sought after weapon, which is the result of terran and Protoss technologies merging: The Phaeros Field. The Phaeros Field combines the Warp Field technology of the arbiters and the EMP technology of the Terran; thus disabling all energy in the area and warping in reinforcements. The pinnacle however of this mighty warship is the built in Jal'Ras crystal which powers it's engine. The Jal'Ras lining in its armor, as well as it being the source of it's power, prevents any templar, Zerg, or other entity from warping in near it, or on it without using a Phaeros Jump.Dark Swarm  In response to the death of the Overmind on Aiur, a number of Cerebrates led by Zhartuus began merging together to form a new Overmind on Vera 9. In the interim this left the Swarm divided between the new Overmind and Infested Kerrigan. As the new overmind grew, Protoss forces attempted to destroy the growing Overmind, whose Zerg swiftly struck back against the outlying Protoss fringe worlds of Khalim and Gheldir and sent the Templar limping to Shakuras with heavy losses. The new Overmind, calling itself by the name \"Mastermind\", withdrew its forces and ascended into the unknown reaches of the galaxy. Immediately the new overmind began to organize a deadly fighting force it termed as the \"Dark Swarm\". The savage new faction expanded and evolved, forming a strong mercenary collective that spread fear across the galaxy. The Dark Swarm has been intelligently tearing away at the infrastructure of Terran, Protoss, and even Zerg enemies, causing them to weaken eachother greatly before the Manticore and Basilisk Broods thunder down and finish off the weary armies. The Dark Swarm has been crippled by the loss of the Charybdis Brood, it's appointed assimilation and hunter-gatherers, and is attempting to replace the lost Charybdis Brood with the Harpy Brood.Zerg Broods Command Wing Attack Wing Minor Broods Special Strains Trivia  Cerebrate Kaloth's cryptic referance to the \"New Swarm\", refers to the new Dark Swarm, and implies that the Dark Swarm has covertly seeded itself on many secret worlds.Lilith Naamah  Terran Spectre (Lapsed), Leader of the Succubus Brood Lilith Naamah was a Terran Spectre of the Terra Firma Protectorate, and daughter of Admiral Lamech Naamah, who defended Earth against the Carpenters Brood in the First War. She was infested by the Succubus Brood in the final stages of the First War and rose to take control over it after the Overmind was destroyed. Lilith is a ruthless and sinister commander, and takes prisoners only for bargaining purposes, usually going back on her deals anyway. She is attributed as the \"scourge of the galaxy\" and has been responsible for the fall of many Terran colonies.Abilities  Lilith has the unsettling ability to spawn small Zerg units, aptly called Spawnlings. These swift units resemble small Zerglings, with Broodling-like mouth appendages. She maintained the ability to cloak as well. Lilith has the mental capability to unleash deadly psionic storms and psychicly control the minds of her enemies, although this dominion is temporary on more mentally adept individuals.Koprulu Sector  The Koprulu Sector, nicknamed the Terran Sector, is a sector in space colonized by the Terrans in the shadow of Protoss space. It is the prevailing \"battlefield\" of the First War and Brood War, and ultimately all interstellar battles waged across the galaxies contained within the known universe. Although other Sectors exist, such as the Ra'Sekael Sector, these are lesser known and rarely even mentioned. The Koprulu Sector comprises several planets, distributed around a number of stars. The initial colonization took place in a large star system with many habitable (but mostly wasteland) worlds. Korhal is in the same star system as Tarsonis, and Vyctor 5 was stated to be in the Koprulu Star System.History  Following a period of social anarchy and the \"fall of western civilization\", a new world-government is re-asserted over Earth: the United Powers League (UPL). A police-state, it encompassed almost all of Earth. Rounding up \"undesirables\", cyborgs, geneticly \"impure\" individuals, hackers, political dissidents\u2014 Project Purification was instituted: a mass genocide campaign in which millions died. However, the dynamic scientist Doran Routhe wanted to explore deep space. It was very risky, but he had no problem with sending political prisoner lab rats to their deaths; 56,000 prisoners were secretly prepared for transport. Of these, 40,000 were loaded into four sleeper-ships designated the Reagan, the Argo, the Sarengo, and the Nagglfar and were sent on a 1 year journey into deep space to Gantris VI, an outlying planet. The Nagglfar was also equipped with an artificial intelligence called ATLAS. Routhe believed they would set up a colony and mine new resources for the United Powers League. ATLAS scanned the prisoners, and discovered something unusual about them - a high proportion of them had a mutation leading to psionic potential. While currently weak, it would manifest in only a few generations. This information was logged and sent back to Earth. This may explain how the United Powers League came to know of this experiment. However, the guidance computer failed, and they traveled at faster than light speeds for 28 years, travelling 60,000 light years to the far edge of the galaxy. The ships emerged at the edge of a habitable star system. When they awoke, the survivors had no idea where they were or where Earth was: all hope of making contact again was lost. The Sarengo crashed on Umoja, killing 8,000 prisoners, the Reagan, which landed softly, founded the colony of Umoja, the Argo founded the colony of Moria, and the Nagglfar built the main Terran colony in the sector: Tarsonis. As the Tarsonians had access to ATLAS, they had a technological head-start on their stellar neighbours. Even so, it took them sixty years to build second-generation subwarp engines and eventually discover the other two colonies. The Terrans of Tarsonis eventually created an interstellar Terran Confederacy, mainly through the creation of new colonies. They also came into conflict with Moria over its own colonies. The Morians founded the Kel-Morian Combine to fight back, sparking the Guild Wars, but lost. There were roughly thirteen important Terran colony planets in the sector by the 25th century. However, war broke out with the Zerg invasion and subsequent clashes with the Protoss at the dawn of the 26th century.A Violent Place  Various Terrans have commented on the amount of violence in the Koprulu Sector. Not every locale in the Koprulu sector is a hotbed of violence and mayhem. There are actually areas that are quiet, peaceful places to relax as the problems of the universe just pass you by. - Uran Golenko, leading stress therapist and featured guest on the popular Universe Today talk show. TRAVEL NOTE: A sudden influx of tourists, coupled with the discovery of considerable mineral wealth on the planet, has left the ecology of Helioc III in a less than optimal state. Once the use of tactical nuclear weaponry has subsided, geologists expect a high level of planetary recovery. \"What is it with the Koprulu Sector, anyhow? It seems like every week there's another skirmish, insurgency, sortie, planned offensive, counter strike, police action, border conflict or plain old-fashioned war breaking out. While the chaos and anarchy are great for a spacefaring merchant vessel that's willing to transport certain cargo of questionable legality, I sometimes have to stop and wonder if this madness will ever end. -Personal entry of First Mate Norris Bailey, Recovery Vessel Starheaper.\" The Koprulu Sector is a violent place, with even the smallest pirate militias armed with everything from nuclear missiles to advanced battlecruisers and equipped with bootleg labs and large numbers of troops.Locations Regions and Star Systems Planets  Note: There are many planets which can not be definitively said to be within the Koprulu Sector or situated just outside it, but will be listed here for simplicity.Outlying Planets  A number of planets are located within the Koprulu Sector's outlying reigons or thereabouts.Non-Koprulu Planets  Some planets located without the outer boundaries of the Koprulu SectorAnnexed Units  Annexed Units are ground and air forces reformatted by the Vaul. Part of the process causes units to lose health in exchange for different and/or enhanced versions of their original powers. Their color schemes also change to white armor with purple markings to distinguish them from regular forces.Terran  Many biological units are clones or Terrans who have had their minds wiped with advanced technology. If starting from scratch, the Annexed Command Center is renamed as a Command Hub:Protoss  As the first \"creations\" of the Xel'Naga, the Protoss genome is something the Vaul are very familiar with. The fact that they rely on multiple robots is also something that works in the Vaul's favor. With the addition of the Purifiers, the annexation process becomes even easier.Zerg  By infiltrating Project Simulant, the Vaul gained a rough blueprint on how robotic versions of the Zerg would behave and how to compensate for many flaws. After being converted into cyborgs, Annexed strains gain +50% attack strength and nanotech health regeneration to compensate for their destabilized genetic structure (Transformers: Key to Vector Sigma; Sonic: Roboticizer). In addition, their nanobots convert biomass from any form of Creep to bolster many other abilities. Like simulants, they replicate most of the strengths and powers of the original counterparts. From monomolecular claws to explosive numbers by mass production, this strain arguably matches the ferocity of any brood without the weakness of losing themselves in primal impulses.Notes Succubus Brood  The Succubus Brood is an independant Zerg faction lead by the Infested Terran, Lilith Naamah. The Succubus Brood's Faction color is pearl.Overview  The Succubus Brood excels at the arts of scouting and reconnaissance. Lacking the destructive capabilities of most of the larger Zerg Broods due to its relatively small size, the Succubus Brood has directed its attention to the Fringe Worlds and other small Terran settlements. The Brood would usually implant itself behind enemy lines, striking at infrastructure until the enemy collapsed in on itself, at which time it would assimilate the entire colony into its massive forces of infested prey. Due to its specialized nature, the Brood makes extensive use of Queens and Chokers. Direct confrontation is mostly seen as a last resort for the renegade brood.History  The Brood launched an invasion of the planet Grus but was stymied by the efforts of the Rhel'Kaeli Protoss protecting the planet under the dictates of the Dae'uhl. The counterstrike, masterminded by the Saven'rii Praetor Rhevnis, effectively crippled the Succubus forces, and sent them retreating back to their scattered hives. The current whereabouts of the Succubus Brood are unknown. It is thought that Lilith is planning some new invasion scheme.Special Strains Trivia  The Succubus Brood is named after the Succubus; a demon in female form said to drain the life-force of men through intimate physical contact.Kraken  The Kraken is a specialized Corruptor strain, utilized specifically by the Kraken Brood of the Dark Swarm.Overview  Krakens are an extremely advanced Corruptor strain, used primarily to exert great control over the minions of the Dark Swarm, greater even, than the Dark Lords and Sphinxes used by the Dark Swarm. However, the Kraken may also attack, utilizing its specialized \"Impaler Tentacles\" against air targets, and descending to the ground to attack ground targets. The Kraken is a genetic marvel that can cover targets in a black ooze-like substance, dubbed as \"Ink\", causing biological targets to quiver and writhe, and mechanical targets to undergo electrical failure for a short time. Fortunately for the Dark Swarm's enemies, these giant brain-like creatures, with their snapping beaks and dangling tentacles, are usually found near only the most advanced Hive Clusters of the Kraken Brood, unlike the Dark Lord strain, which is utilized by the entire Dark Swarm.Trivia  The Kraken strain was actually engineered by the Charybdis Brood shortly before its Cerebrate's defection to the Protoss, and as such, the Kraken is also used by the Scylla Brood.Vaul Buildings  Vaul buildings are\u00a0based off\u00a0a combination of Xel'Naga\u00a0technology and innovations from all three major races in the Koprulu Sector. Because of this, many of their structures share traits such as Plasma shielding and Psionic power. They do have one ability making them unique: Firewalls. This renders buildings immune to attacks like nuclear strikes and random biological agents. Assimilation of technology from the other races does come at a cost. Some Vaul buildings are Neutral once constructed and require Encryption to prevent being used by enemy forces.Plug-ins  Plug-ins serve to support basic and advanced buildings with new and unique abilities. Like Terran Add-ons, they need to combine before the effects can be used. If interfaced structure is destroyed, Plug-ins become dormant and neutral allowing them to be captured by any race's worker unit.Campaign and Unique Buildings  (*) Notes buildings that do not need EncryptionZerg Evolutionary Advancements Scylla Brood  Primary Strains Special StrainsSuccubus Brood  Primary Strains Special StrainsThe Dark Swarm  Primary Strains Special StrainsSwarm of the Torrasque  Primary Strains Special StrainsSolar Jade  This is my own video game in the making... PLEASE do NOT steal my work.Zerg  The Zerg are one of the three dominant races of the Koprulu Sector originating from planet Zerus. As the end of Kerrigan's infection, it was revealed that Zerg was turned back into their original and primitive form; the\u00a0Primal Zerg\u00a0because of Xel'naga alters the race.Overview  For more detailed information see Zerg on parent site.Protoss  The Protoss\u00a0are one of the\u00a0three dominant races in the Koprulu Sector originating from planet\u00a0Aiur.Overview  For more detailed information see Protoss on parent site.Sable  High Commander of the Gantrithor II, Leader of the Sakile Tribe Sable is a legend, both seen and unseen. A complete enigma to even his closest comrades. It is unknown what his full power, origins, or even his species are, although it is widely accepted that he is a male. He has been seen in many forms, and commands a Zerg Brood, as well as a Terran Squadron. Some believe him a vastly powerful Templar and a teacher of Tassadar, others believe him to be a Xel'Naga. His most prevalent form is that of a Protoss, although even then his specific faction is a mystery (High Templar/Dark Templar). What is known is that he is the leader of an elite Tribe known as the Sakile. This tribe is just as mysterious as it's ruler, appearing in times of great need to salvage dire situations before vanishing into the void. His second in command is Patriarch Darr, whom is in charge of the bulk of the Sakile Tribe's vast fleets. It is also rumored that Kassandar, Tassadar's son, is his executor for the tribe. Sable's immense understanding of histories and energies are thought to exceed that of any known being in the universe, making him an invaluable ally to the Protoss. Sable has pioneered the engineering of new crystals that can be fused into Protoss battle armor and vehicles, some giving the Protoss the ability to hover, while others allowing them to cast illusion/discrepancy fields which alter how or where they appear. The \"Jal'Ras\" crystal is the newest of his discoveries, which emits a negative zone of anti-psi, thus rendering telepathic and Khala senses (as well as all mechanical sensors) useless. Although Sable's origin is unknown, his faction and command center currently reside on the chaotic frost and fire world of Vaegos. The unpredictable Sakile enjoy the constant weather changes that include massive blizzards and atmospheric fire storms, as well as sudden vaporous eclipses of light. Sable is devoted to destroying all who have sought to tear down the unity of the Protoss since Adun's death. He is a strong supporter of Zeratul and his efforts to unify the race; and a staunch enemy of Ulrezaj. Surprisingly, however he is not as opposed to Kerrigan. He has struck a temporary treaty with her, saying that if she will not harm the Protoss outright, he will stay his forces and agents. Rumors of Zerg stirring on Char after four years of peace however spell ill will toward that treaty and Sable has recalled his forces for the protection of Shakuras.Known Forms  Protoss Executor Zerg Hunter Killer Terran GhostXel-Hassodin Talk Page Quick Links  User_Talk:Celebrate_seeker User_Talk:theonlyGregen User_Talk:Necrosis103 User_Talk:4thepiUser:Xel-Hassodin  This is Xel-Hassodin's personal cateogory, you can find all his fan-fiction in here.Scylla Brood  The Scylla Brood were a Hunter faction for the Dark Swarm, until their cerebrate leader was mind-controlled, causing it to drastically switch roles. The Scylla Brood's numbers have grown so large that they are now considered an entirely unique species only related to that of the Zerg. -See:Scylla Statistics The Scylla Brood's faction color is cerulean blue.History  In the latter end of the Brood War, the Charybdis Brood's Cerebrate was mind-controlled by Patriarch Darr, and the Brood was renamed the Scylla Brood. The Scylla Brood, having been severed from the psychic control of the New Overmind, has evolved separately from members of the Dark Swarm and Kerrigan's Swarm, having it's evolutionary and anatomical processes being steered by a Protoss master. This has set it apart as a strikingly efficient and successful faction. Staying true to the ideals of its leadership, The Scylla Brood has become a powerful agent in removing Zerg taint rather than adding to it, and its ever-expanding ranks pursue evermore to tap into all known energies and use them against their former comrades. This is very specific asNerazim  The Nerazim are the Great Tribe to which all Dark Templar belong. Dark Templar that are recognized by all Nerazim tribes are given a special honorary garb to signify their stature, being a shawl or a shroud of sorts understood to be a verdant Teal/Green.Overview  Having cut themselves off from the Khala, the Dark Templar are driven by individuality and a thirst for knowledge. Willfully independent, the Dark Templar hold their allegiance primarily to their warrior clans and then to the Nerazim. They tend to be motivated more by personal and tribal bonds than by authority, and hold individuals accountable for their actions. The clans have scattered across dozens of star systems, often living on small ships. They frequently feud, but band together in the face of threats such as the Zerg. The clans distinguish themselves from each other through unique styles of weapons and armor. The Dark Templar have \"sharper\" features than the protoss of Aiur, and perceive things differently. Nerazim often cut off their psionic appendages, and use clamps to control the energy bleed. The Nerazim maintained the same system of writing as the Protoss from Aiur, and their technology is similar enough to Aiur technology that these Protoss can intuit how to use the technology. Dark Templar, alone or in groups, have sought Xel'Naga artifacts, especially the Savriel Tribe.Psionic Abilities  Dark Templar were taught to hide from the Conclave by the powerful Templar Adun. This ability has been described as \"bending light\" and \"merging with shadows\". Dark Templar wield the energies of \"the Void\". These energies are harmful to the Zerg cerebrates and Overmind due to the similarities of the cosmic energies they wield. The Dark Templar consider their powers to be the \"true gifts\" of the Protoss, and consider the Khala to be diluted and narrowed by the (former) leaders of the Protoss. Their own powers are considered \"wider\". Anything that \"taints\" the Void is considered unholy by the Dark Templar. Dark Templar are cut off from the preservers; they have no preservers of their own, and their memories cannot be accessed by the preservers. Savrai preservers are an exception to this rule, due to their ability to track an individual's psionic essence. A group of Protoss survivors stranded on Aiur, the Tal'darim, were cut off from the Khala and developed abilities similar to those of the Dark Templar.Shadow Walk  The Shadow Walk is an element of Dark Templar culture. Protoss must pass it before officially becoming a Dark Templar. It requires the aspirant to walk down a valley and keep only to the shadows, out of which Dark Templar will spring out unexpectedly to assault him/her. Once making it to the end of the valley without being incapacitated, the Protoss passes the test. Those who have followed the path of the Khala find it far more difficult to complete the trial and to date, only three individuals who have followed Khas' philosophy have passed, one of which was Tassadar, managing to pass the test through combining his Templar energies with those that Zeratul had taught him.Notable Protoss who have passed Dark Templar Organizations Tribes within the Nerazim  These are the major organizations of Dark Templar that have gathered together from common interests and/or origins.Clan Philosophies  Clans are not bound to a single tribe, but are simply a way of distinguishing certain styles of life.Warbands  The Dark Templar often operate in independent warbands. Known warbands include;Other Organizations Darr  High Commander of the Jezepher, Leader of the Rhel'Kaeli Tribe, Prelate of the Sakile Tribe Dark Templar High-Patriarch Darr is renowned throughout Shakuras for his psychic mastery, and is revered by his students as the 121,989 year old grandmaster of the Rhel'Kaeli Tribe. Although he also is responsible for the formation of the Savriel Tribe, he leaves his prelate, Xel Hassodin, in charge of it's direction and organization.Overview  Every aforementioned ability that his student Xel'Hassodin has at his disposal is exemplified three-fold by the Patriarch of the Rhel'Kaeli Tribe. Darr is responsible for the creation of the Khaydarin Crystals known as \"Savraj\", \"Alliram\" and \"Talram\" (Meaning \"Enlightenment\", \"Heaven-Shard\", and \"Mending-Shard\"). The Savraj Crystal contains the energies of the Khala and the Void alike, and embodies the fury of the Twilight Templar, a faction also organized by Darr. The Talram Crystal possesses the healing energies of the cosmos, and is weilded by those who wish to personally restore life to Aiur. Not only does Darr tap into all known energies, but he is personally tought by the enigma known as \"Sable\". Darr uses his teachings to further his burgeoning mind. He possesses the ability to convert his body into pure psionic energy to travel \"at the speed of thought\" and unleash waves of psychic energy that tear asunder the very fabric of his enemies. In this form, Darr has been described as a burning maelstrom of \"glowing twilight\". His hand is said to be able to produce and manipulate such things as wind, rain, and thunder. His very stare is said to \"reduce his foes to glowing embers of unraveled flesh\", and he is able to send shadowy tendrils of dark starlight that grasp or attack enemies within reach. A most notable example of his psychic power is displayed in his mind-control over the cerebrate Zzantith, which gave him complete dominance over the self-named Scylla Brood, whose latent anotomical and evolutionary processes have been steered in a different direction than that of Kerrigan's swarm. Darr possesses the gift of prophecy, and his mental predictions are seldom if ever wrong.Trivia  Darr has two major ships that he uses to travel with the luxury of quiet meditation: The Bengalaas and The Jezepher.Creepling  Creeplings are created from Zzantlings following a brief chrysalis phase.Overview  Unlike Banelings, Creeplings do not tuck into a tight ball and roll around the battlefield. Instead, Creeplings evolve a lighter hooked carapace with more muscle tone within that allows them to scurry more swiftly as well as move while burrowed. The Creepling possesses the ability to not only produce creep, but to trigger a reaction within its psionic chemical payload that causes it to manipulate the creep it touches, making it caustic to enemy forces. These psychically reactive creatures are highly effective against ground forces; in fact, a clutch of them is capable of wiping out a group of vehicles and infantry surprisingly fast. The Creeplings' lethality is further enhanced by the Scylla predilection for burrowing. An apparently safe area can soon turn into a deathtrap as these monstrosities spread toxic creep beneath unsuspecting enemies. The Creepling is descended from the Zzantling during the four years following the Brood War, created through the advanced ability of the Naiadi to manipulate their offspring. The Naiadi have engineered a morph that use cosmic energies to alter its material state.Terran  The Terrans are one of the three dominant races in the Koprulu Sector originating from planet Earth, or Terra. Simply put they are far more advanced than they once were and their primary Starfleet is controlled by the Terra Firma Protectorate. The white house is no longer in Washington, D.C., Now it orbits earth as an artificial White Moon.Overview  For more detailed information see Terrans on parent site.Scarab  The Scarab is a particularly tough Scylla breed engineered by the Naiadi to possess a high speed regeneration ability.Overview  One-on-one, a Scarab will generally win in a fight against its enemies, as it regenerates a good amount of damage per second, often faster than damage can be delivered. A Scarab can heal fast enough to retain approximately 50% of its hit points if hit by a Psi Storm, and over 80% of its hit points after its regeneration has been upgraded. Scarabs work well in small skirmishes rather than large encounters, because they are vulnerable to focus fire. Scarabs have the ability to spit a poisonous substance a great distance that ignites upon contact with relatively low heat signatures. Although the Scarab is very similar to the Zerg Roach, It lacks the ranged attack of its \"cousin\". Scarabs are also vulnerable to sustained damage. Scarabs are strong against opponents that attack slowly and do low damage per attack, such as Protoss Zealots.Savra History  The theory of the Savra formed the foundation of future Protoss psionic techniques, especially powerful abilities such as the Sci-Rift.The Modern Savra  Darr proposed that the unification of the Protoss's \"two worlds\" was necessary for the path to \"true healing\", and thus ended the Templari Division and brought on the third Age for the Protoss. The Savra structured a society composed of three Castes: the Patriarchal Caste, the Khalai Caste, and the Templar Caste. The Protoss supervise and protect the lesser life forms without major interferance. Protoss who follow the Savra are often referred to as SavraiBasic Teachings  Savrai Protoss are taught to close their minds to the outside world to promote mental calm, and are extensively trained in martial discipline and inner focus. The Savrai are taught to visualize each action before it is committed, and to feel each movement in a flow of perfectly controlled axillary response, giving them augmented reflexes and skillful precision with each strike. The Savra is understood to be the ideal of existence and the \"path to enlightenment\". The holy Khala and cold Void represent the contrasting qualities within reality and experience. For example, light contrasts with darkness, providing them both with context and therefore meaning, but still being connected through twilight. Savra is not perceived as a simple list of all things and potential things, but rather a complex interconnection of all things in all possible contexts. This concept is often used to illustrate the doctrine of cosmological unity. It is also used to explain the creation of the \"myriad things\" (i.e., everything in existence) through the dialectical process of alternating polarity between Khala and Void. Savra is not only representative of what exists, but also that which has existed, will exist, and could potentially exist. The teachings of the Savra support the study of all things and the continual conduit of flowing knowledge between past, present, and future.Uses of the Savra  Protoss who follow the Savra may link to any other of the Savrai Caste with the other's mental permittance, or forcibly connected to the Savra through powerful scionic force, although this force is rarely used. The depth of this link varies, however, according to the personal choices of the Protoss. It is difficult for any Protoss to fully immerse themselves in a state of unity all the time. Members of the Savrai Caste feel a gentle flow of spiritual calm, and may intensify this link to commune freely with those that have passed on, \"nourishing\" themselves through the rich contact and emerging refreshed and invigorated. The discipline of the Savra is required to control abilities such as Sci-Rift.Accessing Memories  Dead Protoss who follow the Savra enter the Duat upon death. Their spirits live on as scionic entities and may communicate with the living. Protoss can access memories and experiences of those long dead within the Savra, and commune with the spirits of their fallen.Communication within the Savra  Protoss can communicate using a mental link (which transmits emotions and strong feelings) or simply through \"speaking\" (another form of mental link). Protoss can create a special kind of mind-meld deep within the Savra, where desception is impossible. Protoss performing this kind of mind-meld simply close their eyes and enter a state of mental collectivism known as \"Dreamspeak\".", "Mass Effect Fan Fiction Wiki": "Mass Effect Fan Fiction Wiki Main Page Featured Article  Sheila Lawson is the biological sister of Miranda Lawson.

Both canon and fanon factions are present.Alliance Navy (CF2182)  Alliance Navy is the branch of the Systems Alliance Military responsible for naval operations in outer space. Alliance Navy is the branch of the Systems Alliance Military responsible for naval operations in outer space. Its roles include ship-to-ship combat, orbital bombardment, the deployment of atmospheric and space fighters, and the delivery of Alliance Marines into combat.Doctrine and Composition  The Navy is a peacekeeping and space combat force, charged with protecting human colonies and territory. Alliance military Doctrine is the culmination hundreds of years of violent conflicts. While the Alliance Fleet sometimes stations small military garrisons on important planets such as Eden Prime, its strength is centered upon powerful fleets and armed taskforces. These Fleets are based in systems with Mass relays nexuses that can rapidly respond to any colony and or territory under attack. The Navy lives by the ancient Chinese General Sun Tzu's teaching, \"He who tries to defend everything defends nothing.\" Garrisons of marines station on key Alliance worlds are intended for scouting rather than defence of the area. The idea is for the garrison to avoid direct confrontation of the hostile force invading the world so to observe and report back to the sector fleet. Once informed of the attack, the fleet stationed at the sectors nexus of mass replays are able to respond with an overwhelming amount of force. Retaking the planet and then taking the fight to the Enemy. Naval operations, wither in direct combat or supporting ground forces the Alliance Militaries strengths lies within a doctrine of fire support, flexibility, and speed. They Alliance make up for lack of numbers with sophisticated technical support (VIs, drones, artillery, electronic warfare) and emphasis on mobility and individual initiative. This doctrine is not based on absorbing and dishing out heavy shocks like the Turians and Krogan But rather bypassing enemy strong points and launching deep into their rear, cutting supply lines and destroying headquarters and support units, leaving enemies unable to continue effecting military operation. The human devotion to understanding and adapting to modern space warfare stunned the Council races. For hundreds of years, they had lived behind the secure walls of long-proven technology and tactics. The Council regards the Alliance as a \"sleeping giant\". Less than 3% of humans volunteer to serve in their military, a lower proportion than any other species.Naval Tactics  The Alliance Military has adapted to the galactic stage tremendously, having adopted and improved the overwhelmingly effective ship-to-ship combat practises see across the galaxy. This is do to the creation and utilisation of Mass Accelerators. Ship mobility dominates space combat; the primary objective is to align the mass accelerator along the bow with the apposing vessel's broadside. Battles typically play out as artillery duels fought at ranges measured in thousands of kilometers. Practical gunnery range is determined by the velocity of the attacker's ordinance and the maneuverability of the target. Beyond a certain range, a small ship's ability to dodge trumps a larger attacker's projectile speed. The largest-ranged combat occurs between dreadnoughts, whose projectiles have the highest velocity but are the least manoeuvrable. Alliance Naval doctrine has relieve on try and true combat practises that the Citadel races have been utilising for centuries. Although this is not always the case and Fleets of varies commands my employ additional tactics and manoeuvres to off balance and flank opposing fleets, ship to ship combat roles and responsibilities play out as the following: Opposing dreadnoughts open with main gun artillery duel at EXTREME ranges of tens of thousands of kilometers. The fleet close, maintaining evasive lateral motion while keeping their bow guns facing the enemy. Fighters are launched and attempt to close to disruptor torpedo range. Cautious admirals weaken the enemy with ranged fire and fighter strikes before committing to close action. Aggressive commanders advance so cruisers and frigates can engage. At LONG range, the main guns of cruisers become useful. Friendly interceptors engage enemy fighters until the attackers enter the range of ship-based GARDIAN fire. Dreadnoughts fire from the rear, screened by smaller ships. Commanders must decide whether to commit to a general melee or retreat into FTL. At MEDIUM range, ships can use broadside guns. Fleets intermingle, and it becomes difficult to retreat in order. Ships with damaged kinetic barriers are vulnerable to wolfpack frigate flotillas that speed through the battle space. Only fighters and frigates enter CLOSE' \"knife fight\" ranges' of 10 or fewer kilometers. Fighters loose their disruptor torpedoes, bringing down a ship's kinetic barriers and allowing it to be swarmed by frigates. GARDIAN lasers become viable weapons, swatting down fighters and boiling away warship armor. Neither dreadnoughts nor cruisers can use their main guns at close range; laying the bow on a moving target becomes impossible. Superheated thruster exhaust becomes a hazard. Most ship-to-ship engagements are skirmishes between patrol vessels of cruiser weight and below, with dreadnoughts and carriers only deployed in full-scale fleet actions. Battles in open space are short and often inconclusive, as the weaker opponent generally disengages. Once a ship enters FTL flight the combat is effectively over; there are no sensors capable of tracking them, or weapons capable of damaging them. The only way to guarantee an enemy will stand and fight is to attack a location they have a vested interest in, such as a settled world or a strategically-important mass relay.Planetary and Mass Relay Assults  The crucial choice for any attack through mass relays is how to divide the fleet for transit. The accuracy of a relay's mass-projection depends on the mass being moved and how far it\u2019s going. Any long distance and/or high mass jump will see \"drift\". That is, a ship may be hundreds or millions of kilometers from its intended drop point, in any direction from the relay. Distance can't be chosen by admirals, but a relay is told how much mass to transit. For example, if told to move a million metric tons of mass, the relay will scan the approach corridor, find four 250,000-ton freighters, and transit them together, maintaining their relative positions.A commander has the option of moving his fleet as one large, coherent formation that may be wildly off-position, or breaking it up into many smaller formations that will be individually closer to the intended attack point, but could be widely dispersed. Conservative assault doctrine holds that fleets should be moved en masse, maintaining concentration of force and reducing the chances of collision. The only time it is reasonable to split up a formation is during blockade running. Once a fleet chooses how move the fleet into the attacking system the initial battle out of FTL commences. More likely then not assaulting through a defended mass relays often occur at CLOSE ranges(see Alliance Naval tactics above). \"knife fights\" as it has been coined, accurse do to the close to medium proximity of opposing vessels stationed in the assaulted system. It is impossible to know where the exact location of the opposing vessesl in relation to the incoming Fleet, which it self can not positively know its exact exit of FTL. This means that Short-range combat vessels such as fighters and Frigates are crucial and should always be present to support and defend more valuable vessels such as Cruisers and Dreadnoughts. This is never more evident then in the opening minutes of the assault, when the fleet needs to redeploy and move into safe firing lines. Additionally, Planetary assaults are complicated if the target is a habitable world. Do to strict Citadel Conventions the attackers cannot approach the defenders straight on. This is do to the concern that any large kinetic impactors against habitable would result in catastrophic damage to the world and the civilian populace. Therefore the Alliance is forced to rely on unto minute intelligence reports as to the location and deployment of opposing vessels so not to be caught in the open. The fleet needs to determine where the enemy's defences are, so they may approach from an angle that allows them to fire with no collateral damage. Note this is not necessary for hostile worlds that cant support life forms. Common disoplin and doctrines state that once control of orbit has been lost, the defending garrisons should disperse into the wilderness if not properly defended by heavy fortification and artillery able to attack incoming vessels. This military doctrine is held because once a fleet has orbital superiority, that fleet can bombard surface forces with impunity. The best option for defenders is to hide and collect reconnaissance in anticipation of relief forces. This is a key doctrine and outstanding order to all ground personnel in the case of attack by an outside force. Given the size of a planet, it is impractical to garrison entire conquered worlds. Fortunately, colonization efforts tend to focus on building up a dozen or fewer areas. Ground forces occupy the spaceports, industrial facilities, and major population centers. The wilderness is patrolled by unmanned aerial vehicles1 and satellite reconnaissance. If a defender unit is spotted, airmobile rapid deployment units and satellite artillery are used to pin down and destroy them.Fleets Composition  In the Alliance Navy, a Fleets is a large contingent of warships assembled and put in charge of defending a specific sector of Alliance space. Stationed at a key mass relay capable of traversing multiple replies to reach a system within hour of deployment. Although certain fleets may diver slightly in make and size, most Sector Fleets\u2019 numbers 75 Naval Vessels. The Fleet can then be subdivided into a number of Flotillia that fill the rolls of combat, support, and reconnaissance. The Flotillas\u2019 can then be again divided into squadrons and from squadrons into individual vessels.Notable Alliance Fleets  First Fleet Based at Arcturus Station, the First Fleet guards the mass relay connecting to Earth and serves as a reactionary force able to respond to any attack across three different clusters. Second Fleet Commanded by Admiral Kastanie Drescher during the 2157 First Contact War, the Second Fleet was responsible for the liberation of Shanxi from turian occupation. Fifth Fleet The Fifth Fleet is also known as the Arcturus Fleet, as it is based at Arcturus Station. Admiral Hackett is the current commanding officer of Fifth Fleet operations.Personel Naval Ranks  The Alliance Military Vocational Code system or MVC for short classifies the career path of all serving personnel within the Alliance Fleet, this includes both the Commision and Enlisted personel. The MVC consists of one letter and one number. The letter represents the role or career path the personel is in and the number indictated how perficient he or she is in the role or skill. Therefore a soldier's MVC indicates proficiency and not rank. All 26 letters are used, and numbers run from 1 to 7. Please see Military Rank under System Alliance: Military Ranks for further details concerning military rank structure withing the Alliance Military and Navy.Commisioned Officers  In the Systems Alliance, any officer is a member of the Fleet who holds a position of authority, charging them with the duties and responsibilities of a specific office or position. Commissioned officers are typically the only persons able to act as the commanding officer of a Naval vessel of any posting. Officers are often commissioned at Alliance Fleet Academy. The Academy commission approximately 700 second lieutenants and ensigns each year during peacetime. Another route to becoming a commissioned officer is through direct commission. Graduates from the service academies are commissioned immediately upon graduation; credentialed civilian professionals such as scientists, nurses, doctors and lawyers are also directly commissioned upon entry into the military or another federal uniformed service.Enlisted Personel  Enlisted personnel occupy the largest percentage of servicemen and women in the Military to perform the day to day operations in the Alliance fleet. In most cases, enlisted service personnel perform jobs specific to their own occupational specialty, as opposed to the more general command responsibilities of Commissioned officers.Uniforms  Uniforms of the Systems Alliance are a distinction of the service within the MIlitary branch of the Systems Alliance Fleet (SAF).Equipment Navy Vessels  According to record the Systems Alliance Military possessed over two hundred vessels by the out brake of the First Contact War. This number include seven newly design heavy combat vessels designated as \u201cdreadnoughts\u201d after the 20th century sea ships. Its individual vessels range considerably in size and firepower, varying from hundred-meter-long frigates to nearly kilometer-long dreadnoughts. Fleet units are also supported by fighters and dedicated interceptors. Today the Alliance Fleet was comprised of over 2,500 warships, 1,000 logistical ships and 14,000 Interstellar Fighters.Logistic and Support  Ships under this category are the most divers in size and purpose. Any ship not filling a direct combat role such as recognisant vessels and troop transports fall under this section. Athabasca Class Freighter 'Kowloon'''' Class Freighter Kodiak Drop Ships Grizzly Drop Ship Polar Heavy Task TransportFightercraft and Bombers  Fighters are single pilot small combat craft. Their light frame and elemental zero cores make them capable of greater acceleration and manoeuvring then other starships. They are armed with disrupter missiles capable of penetrating kinetic shields. Fighters primarily serve a support role in space battles, either by defending their fleet or swooping in to attack the critical systems of a larger enemy vessel. Arrow Fighter Bomber Razor InterceptorsFrigates  These light escort and scouting vessels are roughly 50 meters long and carry a crew of 20. Frigates such as the Normandy are too small to carry fighters, but are equipped with modest main-gun mass accelerators and often have extensive GARDIAN systems to provide anti-fighter screening for larger vehicles. Their drive systems make them more maneuverable than larger starships and allow for higher faster-than-light (FTL) cruise speeds. A squad of marines is carried on board for security and ground-side duty. Unlike larger vessels frigates can land on planets. Alliance Frigate's are named after great battles in human history. Thermopylae Class, Heavy Frigate Hastings Class, Frigate Vally Forge Class, Gun Boat Normandy Class, Stealth ReconnaissanceCruisers  The cruisers are the infantry of fleets. They are faster than dreadnoughts and more heavily armed than frigates. Fighters are housed in the cruiser's baffles. Their main weapons systems are mass accelerator cannons which can be used at long ranges and as broadside guns. In small engagements they lead frigate groups and in larger ones screen the broadsides of the dreadnoughts. They are fitted with ablative armor and protected by kinetic shields. Alliance Cruiser's are named after cities on Earth. Berlin Class Cruiser York Class Cruiser Mumbai Class Semi dreadnoughtsCarriers  Carriers are dreadnaught sized vessels that carry a large array of small fighter craft and embaraking vessels. Carriers are deployed in a supporting role to the fleet it is assigned to, their armaments are light and they tend to stay in the rear of the fighting. The carrier is a mobile supply and refueling base capable of housing Frigate sized vessels in their hold. Einstein Class CarrierDreadnoughts  These are the biggest ships in fleets. They are usually 800 meters to a kilometer in length. A squadron of fighters is carried on the dreadnoughts for protection and support. The Alliance System have six with one more under construction. Alliance Dreadnought's are named after mountains on Earth. Under present Citadel law, Alliance navy can only have a set maximum number of 7 Dreadnought in service at any one time. Although this number may change slightly do to the Geth Crisis; the number is only likely to rise to 9 and the most. Everest Class Dreadnought Kilimanjaro class DreadnoughtNotable Actions  Although the System Alliance have not been active among the stars as long the Salarian or the Asari, the Alliance have distinguished themselves on multiple occasions. Listed below are just a few of Alliance military action that have served to strengthen Human interest and they political presence on the galactic stage.Military Jargon  Please see Military Jargon under the Alliance: Military Jargon System Alliance: Military Jargon for a list of common naval slang and military lingo used throughout the Navy and Alliance Military.Related Links Behind the Scenes The Reaper War  The Galaxy is built on a cycle of extinction. For an undetermined length of time, possibly since the beginning of it all, a struggle has gone on between organisms, and machines. The Reapers , apex of evolution and existence, the most powerful beings in the known universe, harvest us for reasons beyond our understanding. Every 50,000 years, a civilization rises to its zenith and is destroyed. Nobody knows why. At first it was believed the Reapers did this so they can harvest our genetic material to substitute for Reaper reproduction, but this is not so. Reapers leave behind a vanguard, if that vanguard fails, they create a new one, the real reason probably equates to something having to do with metaphysical essences. A theory is believed to exist that says the Reapers are actually metaphysical beings trapped inside metallic shells, literally a spirit inside a machine. Perhaps the Reapers' technology and nature blurred forming a second nature, they became so dependent on technology that they became it, and over many millions of billions of years they became something else, so far along the path of a new evolution, they cheated death, lived for so long they could not remember what they once were, they could not fathom ever once being mortal, or ever having a beginning, so they could not even begin to imagine having an end. In order for their metaphysical energies to survive and live, they must prey on the energies of others, and this requires the energy of an entire galaxy. This is only theory, however. The battle came to its highest point, when organics had the best chance to defeat the Reapers in 50,000 years. Every 50,000 years, the forces of the Milky Way come closer to defeating the Reapers. The ProtheansThe Eden Prime War  The short but bloody conflict known as The Eden Prime War, is a series of battles named after its place of origin, a human colony once known as Eden Prime , where an attack instigated by a rogue council spectre by the name of Saren , led to an intergalactic battle with the arch-nemesis of the Quarian Geth . This led to the induction of Commander Shepard into the spectres to pursue Saren. The conflict took place over a period of time slightly longer in length to the First Contact War , only more lives were lost. Saren and his flagship Sovereign Feros , Therum , Vimire , Noveria , and finally a capitol of the ancient Prothean Ilos . Over the course of his investigation, Shepard learned that this wasn't about humanity fighting for survival, but it was about all races of the Galaxy, and that this wasn't Saren trying to destroy humanity, but the fate of all Galactic civilizations was at stake. Shepard learned that the Citadel Reapers Benezia . However, the most startling discovered he makes, is that Sovereign is actually not a ship at all, but a Reaper vanguard left behind to activate the Citadel relay. Shepard and his team then managed to track Saren back to the Citadel through a backdoor known as \"The Conduit\". Saren has now almost been completely indoctrinated, but Saren eventually overcomes the indoctrination, and kills himself. Shepard finally faces off against Sovereign controlling Saren's Avatar. When the Systems Alliance Arcturus Fleet arrives and saves the Council, Shepard destroys The Avatar, momentarily stunning Sovereign, allowing Alliance Ships, including Shepard's ship, the Normandy , and Ambrose's, the Pegasus, to deal the killing blow to Sovereign once and for all. The Reaper threat has momentarily been stalled, but not for long, as a few months later, a new threat surfaces, known as The Collectors .The Collector Crisis  Two years later, 2185, Shepard, who was among the KIA list of the SSV Normandy, is reanimated by the black ops division of the Alliance gone rogue, known as Cerberus . This does not change Shepard's grudge against Cerberus for the deaths of his unit on Akuze, in fact, it makes him even more angry, the fact that they would not even consider his feelings towards them. It just made them seem all the more soulless. Nevertheless, Shepard reunites a majority of his original crew, with a lot of new faces, and manages to build up the loyalty of his team. Shepard manages to acquire a Reaper IFF, Geth Technology, and discovers the Collectors, the ones behind the attacks on Human colonies, are in fact re-purposed Protheans for use as husks by the Reapers. They also discover upon entering the Omega 4 relay and boarding the Collector Base, which just so happened to lie at the galactic core, that they were building a new Reaper to replace Sovereign.

Developed just after their father lost Oriana, she was meant to be the perfect heir to his dynasty along with her twin sister, [Lawson]. Everything, from her intelligence, physical constitution, biotic abilities, to her appearance were designed before birth to be excellent and even greater than Miranda's. Sheila also heals faster than other humans and will live two lifespans longer.Dossier  Sheila Lawson is the second and youngest of Miranda Lawson. Like her sisters, Sheila was created to carry on his dynasty. Soon after Commander Shepard helped Miranda protect Oriana, their father made his third and final attempt at an heir, this time creating twins. Sheila was just one of the twins while Mira was the other. Their father made certain to make the twins far more loyal but once Sheila discovered the existence of her other sisters, she quickly became uncontrollable. Sheila managed to run away from her father, though Mira remained with him, and began to search for them. To make it easier to hide from her father, Sheila travelled to the Terminus Systems to hide out while she tracked down information about her sisters. Not long after arriving on Omega Sheila learned that she had a natural affinity for combat as she was attacked and managed to kill the four assailants within a matter of seconds. She got a rush from this incident, so she joined the newly-formed human mercenary band, Phantom. As the youngest mercenary in Phantom and the youngest known mercenary in the galaxy, no one thought much of her. The underestimation of others worked in her favor and she managed to forge a reputation as the greatest Human mercenary on Omega. She helped Phantom grow from a small squad of mercenaries to a large organization. Soon after, Phantom had gained enemies on Omega, namely being Shadow Fox. The two organizations were in a three year war up until the Phantom's eventual defeat. Nearly everyone was killed, with Sheila being one of the only few exceptions. While the other survivors wanted to start a new mercenary band, Sheila disagreed and left Omega. She started a solo career as a professional mercenary for awhile, but quickly learned of the location of one of her sisters. She learned that Oriana lived on Illium after meeting her informant, Liana Peria. Soon after arriving on Illium, Sheila discovered that Oriana had gone missing and was presumed dead. Sheila was also intercepted by Miranda Lawson, her other sister that had been investigating Oriana's disappearance. At first, Miranda attacked her stating that the last person seen with Oriana was a blond woman of similar appearance to Sheila. It became evident to Sheila that Mira was behind the disappearance of Oriana and must've been ordered by their father to track them down. Sheila and Miranda banded together to track down Mira, obviously making their way to the most likely place; their father. After meeting their father, he claimed that their arrival was part of his plan. He had Oriana captured in order to get all of them back in the same place. He wanted Sheila to rejoin her twin and he wanted Oriana and Miranda executed to get rid of the \"rejects\". Mira had other plans and didn't want to share her fortune with someone who turned against her and her father. Mira challenged Sheila to a duel, and the ensuing battle caused catastrophe to the surrounding area. Miranda and Oriana managed to escape in the battle but their father was killed. The facility that the battle took place in began to collapse and the two twins were forced to escape. As Sheila escaped with Miranda and Oriana, Mira makes her way to an unknown location. A few months later, Sheila has been able to form a tight bond with her two sisters but was still curious of her twin's whereabouts. Sheila did some searching and had discovered that Mira had begun doing business with a mysterious krogan. It would later be revealed that the same krogan was linked with multiple criminal elements and dangerous people. Though Mira previously tried to kill her, Sheila still cared about her twin sister so she began searching for her in an attempt to save her before the krogan, who was known for his ruthless nature, decided to eliminate her as he had with many others he worked with.Ability  Sheila Lawson is faster, stronger, smarter, and more agile than the average human making her strategic ability and overall combat effectiveness far above some of the best human warriors. She also heals much faster than ordinary humans and is still 100% combat effective with a broken arm. Sheila has a natural affinity for combat, something added by her father as she was meant to inevitably hunt and kill her older sisters. She is incredibly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, mastering Shadowken and Veradas. Her marksman skills are also incredible and she is most proficient with sniper rifles and pistols. Her infiltration talents are amazing and her biotics are impressive as she has mastered many biotic talents.Image Gallery Races  Races-related articles created by users.Mass Effect: The Awakening  Mass Effect: The Awakening is a book written by Daniel Rodriguez and is a lnk between Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.Main Characters Plot  The story takes place three years after the incident at the Citadel. The Reapers are still coming and it is up to Commander Shepard to stop them, but he is going to need all the help he can get. The story's main character is a turian named Avisto. He had been inducted into the military at age 15 as their tradition goes. And has recently been inducted into the Spectres and made many new friends like a krogan named Gort who is the first character introduced into the story. His first mission is to spy on a turian female named Adriusa. He and Jessy Phist and Jon Richards travel to Akuze where she was last spotted and discover that most of the colonists had been killed. They journey deeper into the facility to discover turian and volus mercenaries are present. They fight through the heavy merc resistance and come across the geth and the mercs had forged an alliance. They fight throught floors of geth and merc resistance until they come across Adriusa sitting at a computer desk. They realise that she wasn't on their side when they find out that the geth aren't trying to kill her. And when Avisto find a recording that proves she was a traitor. Geth come to her aid and she escapes. They track her throughout the facility and eventually enter the mines. This is where they realise she has ressurected the Rachni once more and she flees leaving the alone to deal the Rachni and the Rachni Queen. They deafeat the Rachni and chase Adriusa into some caverns. Where she traps them in there with a bomb. Since Jon Richards was an expert hacker he manages to disarm the bomb and save the colony. Jon and Phist are rewarded with Spectre status and Phist becomes the first krogan to be accepted into the Spectres. Avisto's new mission is on a gas giant known as Dartmoor. Strangely enough the atmosphere is completely beathable and they travel to a floating colony known as Dartmoor Alpha, naming it the first colony. They travel to Hiliat, the capitol and discover an old dockworker and find out that it is Admiral Stephen Hackett, now retired. He tells them that he thinks that a company known as Allen Corp is looking for ways to cure obesity by salvaging the Thorian's blood and that a Reaper may be behind the recent rebellions springing up across the galaxy. They meet with Captain Leoa Lenius in the Hiliat town forum and she tells them that their objective is a small scale mass relay constructed underneath the city, it would take them straight into the geth overship where they'll discover who's behind the attacks. On their way more rebels attack them and the city and they are forced to defend the city, they then board a train where they journey into the underbelly of the city. They kill the geth on the train where it then crashes into a wall after going off the rails. The admiral tells them as they continue on foot that it was founded by a now insane human criminal known as Eric Allen. He was obese himself and when none of the cures helped he went insane and dissappeared for over five years and Allen Corp turned into a military empire bent on capturing foriegn entities and turning them into bioweapons, this was also true with the Thorian. They came across heavy geth resistance at the end of the tunnel and weakened their defenses by pummeling them with a nearby Mako. They made a run for the next train when the geth defenses had iightened up and started the train. They discovered dead human corpses on the train and soon foundout that these corpses had been infected by the Thorian. They arose and attacked the shore party where Avisto was then forced to purge the remaining train cars. The train came to a stop in a massive underground facility which consisted of a truly mammoth cylindrical room where Thorians were being held in pods that stretched all the way up the room. The architecture did not seem human at all. They are confronted by Eric Allen himself who had fused himself with the Thorian and was a grotesque freak of nature, with tentacles in place of his right arm and leg and half of his face had been dissolved into the mort plant, where he tells them that he has seen god and that god told him to take them all to heaven. The Shore party then have to go disable the three generators keeping the Thorians alive. When they are all destroyed Eric Allen is killed as he has fused himself with them. When they activate the portal in the center of the room Leoa and Codus stay behind while Avisto, Hackett, and Nathan enter it to arrive on the other side in a giant geth structure. They travel along the halls while staying out of sight until they come to what appears to be the bridge. Avisto sees a krogan sitting in a chair his face out of sight who is talking to a turian. This turns out to be Adriusa who angers the krogan who points a large blade at her and tells her to get the job done, so they know now that Adriusa isn't in charge. She exits the room via an elevator and the krogan gets up revealing his face. Avisto remembers the scar on the krogan's throat and realizes that it is his friend Gort. Gort walks out onto a catwalk where a red VI interface appears, and Avisto's fears a brought to life. Gort begins talking to it and referring to it as 'Dark Energy' and Avisto realizes this is a Reaper. Gort and Dark Energy converse about some sort of central relay located on a planet known as Ghandi that will open the portal to Dark Space and is quicker than the Citadel's way of travel. Dark Energy tells Gort of the Shore party's presence and they battle through hordes of geth and rebels who Gort referred to as 'The Galactic Rebellion'. The Trio escape via a geth dropship and return to the Citadel. The Citadel Council immediately react to their new information and send ships to the Isis Cluster where they set up a battle cluster in the planet's orbit. Avisto, Jon, and Nathan along with a large convoy of ground troops are deployed onto the planet's sruface searching for the relay. They are confronted by geth, rebels, thresher maws, rachni, Thorians, and other nonsentient beings. Avisto suspects that Adriusa's father was Saren and that she is following in her father's footsteps but the Council denies this and simply insists that Saren had no daughters. The Shore part splits up with the convoy and journeys into the bowells of the planet and discover Reaper statues where they find a sort-of control panel, when they activate it the whole planet shakes and splits right down the middle. They find out that the planet itself is the relay and that is on standby mode, only Dark Energy himself can activate it. Dark Energy along with the whole geth fleet show up from behind the battle cluster and begin bombarding them. Avisto arrives on the surface to see a wounded (if you could call it that) Dark Energy plummet out of the sky and crash on the planets surface. The fleet cheers and celebrates but not before the machine awakens and Avisto climbs onboard the Reaper before it takes off. Avisto finds himself inside of Dark Energy looking for a weak spot. He finds it, but is found out by Adriusa. She tells him that what he is doing is in vein and that the Reapers are unstoppable. Avisto tells her she is just like her father, Saren and she merely shakes her head and they engage in a dual. Avisto triumphs by throwing a grenade at a structre on the ceiling which comes crashing down onto Adriusa. Her last words are, \"You, are the son of Saren. My father died because of your father...\" Avisto falls to the ground in disbelief, at hwo much unlike his father he was. Avisto then slams his fist into the Reaper's core just as it is about to activate the relay. He is burnt badly and in the second he was connected with it he received a transmission, a message. Avisto yanks his fist out of the Reaper's core and activated his pressure suit where he punchs a hole in the hull and jettison's himself out of it. The explosion sends him flying into the SSV Apex where he is rescued and patched up. When he wakes up he is brought before the Council where he tells them of the message he recieved. It was a call for help to the other Reapers.Comic  A list of comic strips and cartoons on this wiki.Planets  This page has a list of the planets of the Mass Effect universe.

He also serves as the pivotal character of Mass Effect: Destination and it's predecessor story's.Biography Early Life  Sal was born in 2169 CE, as the son of Rami Polaris, and his father, Hunnigan Polaris, who was not present during the birth. Sometime after, Rami was notified of Hunnigan's death consequently leaving her as the sole parent. For the next 2 months, she struggled to raise her son along with the impending financial issues. Her problem was eventually solved when she was approached by Aliana T'Nola, an asari who offered to take care of him until Rami's current status improved enough for her to care for her own son. Aliana was given full custody of Sal and raised him as her heir to the T'Nola fortune after she herself was given it in accordance to her grandmother's will. Throughout his childhood until the age of 14, Aliana cared for her only son away from the influence of her family who she deemed corrupted to raise him around. When at a certain age, she and him traveled to Thessia where he was secretly given the family mark, making him worthy of the T'Nola name.Eezo Exposure  When 10 years of age and while playing with friends, a ship carrying eezo-filled cargo, crashed. The eezo, in dust form, was exposed to the nearby area through a ventilation duct. Sal inhaled massive amounts of eezo because he was sprinting, in turn caused him to breathe harder including the other children he played with. After this, he started experiencing a fever and fainted from exhaustion. His step-mother rushed him to a hospital after his symptoms started worsening. Doctors were able to reveal he inhaled eezo which could have killed him. Knowing he will develop biotics and in fear it will endanger him, his step-mother bribed the staff 5 million credits to keep the matter confidential.Training  Influenced by a hand-to-hand combat demonstration after a visit from his biological mother, Aliana used her wealth to hired several close-combat experts from around the galaxy to train her son in self-defense. However, all of his live combat exercises would be simulated.Battle of the Citadel and Personal Quest  The Battle of the Citadel was a pivotal moment of Sal's life that would define his future to a great extent. This was the first ever live combat situation he has ever been in whereas most his training was simulated. During a close-encounter with a husk, he discovered his biotic powers, much to his surprise. After helping Vayla Demrega, and Dail'Kanaar find somewhere to wait out the attack, he stumbled upon Yana'Naaman nar Qwib Qwib, who was looking for safety and temporarily took Sal under her safety unaware of his combat experience. During their search, by accident, they came across a geth patrol and Yana was shot in the stomach area as a result, puncturing her stomach lining and enviro-suit. Sal, in vain, tried to stop the bleeding but could not save her and because of her death, seriously traumatized him then drove him to kill any geth by mutilating them with the power of his biotics, getting serious injuries in the process. After Alliance forces retook the Citadel, he personally carried her body to the Migrant Fleet to honor her commitment to him during their escape. Following the emotional scarring of her death, Sal was placed back the care of his birth mother after the 14 year separation. Shortly he was purposed a place within the Citadel Security Special Forces as the first human to join by Mira T'Gosa, a surviving C-Sec member to which he refused at first but took the proposal after discovering a photo of his mother and a man he never met before, taking the lack of any emotional support from her since coming back, as a justification to defy her. Sal was escorted to Vayla Demrega to be given a psychological evaluation, giving her some much needed details on his actions.Becoming the Quarian Defender  Sometime after his psych evaluation, Sal had gained a renown for protecting any quarians anywhere on the Citadel from those who would harass, threaten or even utter a single racist remark would be met out with personal retaliation. Eventually, pilgrims who were spared the social abuse would tell their people of a 'defender' among the council races.Returning Home  A year later on the day Yana'Naaman died, Sal visited the place where she bled out and payed tribute to the memorial he built himself. Upon arriving home he finds Mira who has come to confront his parents on their abuse to him. Stark quickly saw Sal enter and proceeded to smack him across the face prompting Mira to throw Rami with her biotic powers. Stark in response punched Mira in her stomach causing damage to her child. Sal quickly entered a fit of rage and proceeded to beat him to near-death. Mira was quickly taken to the hospital where she gave birth to a healthy baby. Soon after the subsequent struggle, Sal was placed in an foster home where Caelus Derolus and Mira would proceed to fight over the custody of him until the arrival of his step-mother, Aliana T'Nola, who used her political influence to end the dispute.Reaper War and the Aftermath  In Russia and enjoying the view of St. Basil's Cathedral, Sal spotted a reaper descending down and destroyed the Cathedral instantly. He rushes for the village to warn them, only to be too late. Sal goes through the destroyed village and manages to find Vayla. At the same time, Kurlo is seen running from a reaper about to shoot it's laser. Sal watches helplessly as Kurlo is killed and begins to experience a more serious toll on his mentality. Meanwhile, the surviving villagers and remaining nearby Russian military forces, hide in a nearby underground Cold War bunker outfitted with current-gen technology. Sal commands the operations along with the Russian forces remaining commander. Then several transmissions are recovered and are revealed to be Mark Petcher and Wade Valen, along with an unknown signature. Because of the emotional toll of Kurlo's death, Sal stays awake for 4 straight days. After Sal is forced to sleep to ensure he is prepared for the coming retaliation to retake Earth, Wade Valen and Mark Petcher are killed and the next day, Nephamus, an awakened collector, is killed when a piece of falling building debris drops on him. On the day of retaking Earth, with the help of the SSV Stuttgart, Sal damages Eternal, a reaper. But he loses his grip on trying to make the finishing blow and is tossed out into space. Desperately trying to stay afloat in space after being caught in the Earth's gravity, he is hit by a piece of debris which knocks him unconscious. Suddenly waking up in a garden, he finds a quarian planting flowers who turns around reveal herself to be Yana'Naaman, without her mask. Following his question if he is dead, Yana ensures him he was founded by an alliance ship after they were given secret coordinates to his location while drifting in space. Before leaving, she expresses one last hug before Sal re-awakes back on Earth. Despite the solace given to him during his unconsciousness, he refused to accept this as an acceptance to Naaman's leave. He became increasingly withdrawn as the years went on, eventually secluding himself to the memorial safe-house he visited frequently.Rannoch Residence  In 2192, Sal received a request to \"visit\" Rannoch by Admiral Zaal'Koris for his honesty for bringing the body of Yana'Naaman to the migrant fleet after she died, a rather very rare eulogy to find among the council races. Several preparations were undertaken to cultivate him into quarian society such as, changing his name along with a household name, curing any side-effects left by his sickness which then would lead to the removal of his interface suit and the implanted nodes, and offering him a home. Despite the welcome by the quarian people, however, Sal was still left unchanged by the emotional toll set on him 9 years before his arrival.Appearance  Sal is the normal height of a simple teenager and bears a different appearance than normal teenagers by skin tone, eye color, and body frame. His skin tone has turned into a sickeningly pale tone with short to long trails of veins appearing marked evidently across his entire body and currently, remains unknown on the exact cause of it. His eyes became fully white following surgery on them, and bears black-colored asari republic emblem embossed on his forehead. His body frame is slim due to the lack of daily bodybuilding and occurrences of self-starvation. When not wearing his armor, he is often seen in a more concealed appearance. Following his sudden change in appearance in 2184, he wears a white robe that covers every part of his body from neck to toe including hands. In order to conceal his face from others who may contempt him, he wears a white hood with a mask to cover it. Further increasing the physical parallel between him and quarians. Given the slim appearance of his body, somewhat matching a female human's body frame, aforementioned little bodybuilding, and lack of revealing skin, Sal could be mistaken for a woman.Personality  Main article: Psychological Profile: Sal Polaris See also: Yana'Naaman's Memorial and Yana'Naaman's mask Before the attack on the Citadel, Sal was formerly a sympathetic, out-going, and giving human. He was kind to anyone that could be his friend as well as free spirited often believing he could change anything should he give enough devotion to it as his mother stated to him. After the attack on the Citadel, but more specifically Yana'Naaman's death, Sal transformed from a good child to a daily depressed, inactive, non-talkative teenager who suffered frequent outbursts of anger ranging from passive to violent. He no longer used his training exercises as an outlet for anger, preferring to vent swallowed rage on random individuals who don't share his sympathy for quarians or mock him for holding such beliefs. The only surviving personality trait, which is rare to find from people in the galaxy, is Sal harbors a deep care of quarian kind, preferring never to express common racism to any one of them he meets rather greeting them in a kindhearted way. Since the reconstruction of the Citadel, he was taken it upon himself to defend the rights of quarians everywhere by counteracting any forms of racism against them with the full extent of his power regardless of the outcome or trouble that tends to befall him. Many quarian pilgrims who visit the Citadel are often encouraged to find him if they journey there due to his openly nature to assist in pilgrimages.Skills  At a young age Sal was taught certain forms of martial arts by several masters who originated from Earth after watching techniques from his birth mother. He demonstrates a plethora of knowledge in hand-to-hand techniques to utilize in and out of combat. As a result of his slender-like body frame, this makes him exceptionally light when handling against quick-moving enemies. The one thing he fails to excel at is pure strength. During his fight with Berkan Payak, Sal visibly struggled to counteract Berkan's immense strength, therefor was easily defeated despite gaining the early upper hand.Biotics  Due to his exposure to eezo at age 10, Sal developed biotics through his childhood, unknown to himself as it happened. During the Battle of the Citadel, he discovered his biotic potential and performed with impressive skill but soon began to re-act the practice, unsuccessfully. The extent of his biotic skill go into his acrobatics. Being able to launch himself into the air or towards a specific target. The power of his biotics can be amplified with his high anger levels (Most notably around his feelings for quarians) but at the cost of impaired judgment which can lead to a destructive outcome. He mostly uses his biotic potential to compensate for his poor strength, making it the second use being his armor.Family Trivia SSV Antietam  The SSV Antietam was a Systems Alliance Navy Normandy-class Frigate . The ship was first commanded by Captain Rasputin Cherkov and then by Commander Manuel Guerra. The SSV Antietam was constructed at the Arcturus Shipyard near the Arcturus Station The ship first saw action during the Siege of Logasiri in late-2185. It led 'wolf-pack flotilla' formations of other frigates and fighters into battle against batarian Not long after, Commander Guerra became the commanding officer of the SSV Antietam and after the ship completed repairs and a few upgrades, the Antietam took part in Operation Lancer, a major naval campaign against batarian raiders Exodus Cluster . After Commander Guerra became a Spectre , the Antietam remained a member of Seventh Fleet, however, it's rarely with the main fleet formation.Turian.jpg SSV Ascendancy SSV Ascendancy  Currently under the Command of Admiral Jacob Sieghard. The Ascendancy is a technologically advanced near dreadnought class ship, developed by human and salarian scientists in respose to the attack on the Citadel by a Reaper Dreadnought. The Ascendancy was built to be just as powerfull as a dreadnought , without the size and crew requirements of a dreadnought-class ship like the Destiny Ascension. To this end the human and salarian scientists working on the Ascendancy have mounted masive mass accelerator. cannons. The Ascendancy also carrys one super weapon based on the main weapon mounted on Sovereign, using an electromagnetic field to shape and accelerate a stream of superheated molten metal to relativistic velocities, which then impacts its target and deals horrendous damage. The weapons fire appears as a bright blue beam, very similar to the deadly red trails seen firing from the tips of Sovereign's 'arms' during the Battle of the Citadel. In combat, the Thanix Cannon is strong enough to destroy a Collector cruiser in two shots. Some anti-Human partys feel that The Ascendancy is a blatant attempt by the Systems Alliance to \"Cheat\" the Treaty of Farixen , that stipulates the amount of dreadnoughts a navy may own, with the turian peacekeeping fleet being allowed the most. With the amount of controversy currently around the creation of The Ascendancy, The ship has seen no real combat, and is currently patroling the Systems Alliance core worlds, most notably Earth.Weaponry Edit  The Makalu makes use of very powerful weaponry, most of which have never been used on any ship until the creation of the SSV Makalu.Defense Edit Illegal Technology  Because The Ascendancy is limited to Systems Alliance space, there have been rumors that Alliance scientists have been testing illegal AI technology. That in theory would give the large ship un-paralled reaction time, and allow for near flawless ship to ship electronic warfare.Systems Alliance Terra Corps  The Systems Alliance Terra Corps is a branch of the Systems Alliance Military A rugged and diverse assortment of well equipped and well trained men and women, one of the Terra Corps's most notable conflicts was fighting against the turians First Contact War .Uniform Dress Uniform  The Terra Corps Dress Uniforms are similar to those worn by their Navy counterparts.

A golden trim lines the jacket and trousers.Battledress Standard  The standard battledress of the Systems Alliance Terra Corps is the commonly seen bodysuit armor system. Depending on their environment they are either outfitted with the standard and common dark-gray battlesuit, desert camouflaged suit, or arctic camouflage suit.

An armored bodysuit which enhances every aspect of the wearer's performance integrated with kinetic barriers twice the strength of the average. The hard-sealed, fully-armored suit is equipped with advanced combat support software.Equipment Armament  The standard issue weapon for Terrans is the M-Series of assault rifles. Most Terrans were issued the M-8 Avenger M-3 Predator M-5 Phalanx . Suppressive fire is provided by the MC-109 Monarch and it's lighter cousin, the MC-110 Overlord.

James Christianson is also the third Human Spectre, following the induction of both Commander Shepard, and Lt. Commander Ashley Williams following the Reaper Incursion. Christianson soon fights in what would be known as \"The Second Galactic War\" following Shepard's Decisions from Mass Effect 3. Though keeps the rank of Lt. Commander throughout the saga.Profile  James Christianson was born on June 30th, 2157 on Planet Earth. As a young child, James was exposed to massive amounts of Element Zero after an incident in New York City involving the explosion an experimental Element Zero reactor in 2160. His mother was killed in the accident, and he was forced to live with his father; Colonel Robert Christianson of the SSV Kangchenjunga, which was stationed in New York Harbor at the time. From age 3, he grew up in space with his father on board multiple ships. Though he returned to the SSV Kangchenjunga occasionally and at the age of 17, signed up for the Systems Alliance. Though he trained a whole year before basic training until he became 18 in 2175, following in his father's footsteps. In 2176, Christianson enlisted in the Alliance Navy as a Marine after high school and was assigned to the Recruit Training Depot in San Diego. During training, Sgt. Christianson was certified proficient with the M-8 Avenger Assault Rifle and standard to heavy-weight combat hardsuits. He also completed certification in zero-gravity aboard Gagarin Station in the Sol Cluster. For Hostile Environment Assault Training, He was assigned to Fort Charles Upham on Saturn's moon, Titan, where he was awarded two commendations: for his boldness in assault techniques in a field exercise simulating an attack on turian point defense emplacements, and for expert survival skills on an unknown hostile environment simulating surviving a crash landing. Drill Instructor Gunnery Chief Ellison noted his constant endurance and brash instincts, and promoted him to Lieutenant and squad leader of the 205th Infantry after observing how he taught less skilled marines. His platoon had logged numerous complaints that his training was rigorous and tough, though these were ignored by Ellison as he was following the rules. Christianson soon began to receive positive feedback and even praise from his units after basic training. After basic training, he arrived at Jon Grissom Academy for six weeks of Military Biotic Training, it was an experimental program for military personnel to train the use of biotics to military officers and soldiers. Though this was the first and final time this would happen, James opened accepted the classes and surpassed greatly compared to other Adepts and Vanguards. James soon was certified as a Military Biotic Marine (MBM) which only included 45 other graduates and held little to no degree to the Alliance brass.Battle of the Citadel; 2183  During the Battle of the Citadel, The SSV Midway was part of Tenth Fleet following the SSV Kangchenjunga into battle. The Midway, being the fastest ship, was to provide a distraction while the main guns of the Kangchenjunga charged. The Midway did a splendid job until a rogue laser ripped through the Fifth Fleet and struck the SSV Midway's flight path causing major damage to the side. At that time, Christianson was getting ready to fight fires aboard in the Drive Core when the side of the ship ripped open and sucke out into the Citadel. He landed on a building roughly and sprained his leg, His oxygen breather mask protected him from death as husks began to take the roof. He held them off, and eventually made it to ground floor where a group of geth were waiting. James blew open the door and threw a grenade, one exploded and catching two in the blaze. He then charged out and used a Nova charge, the geth were destroyed. He fell to the ground and remembered his leg, he began to crawl and saw the whole fight. He laid against a nearby wall, killing any geth that came towards him. An unknown man found him and took him to safety. After Soviereign was destroyed, his crew found him and told him that the SSV Midway would be undergoing repairs and would be grounded for the next two years.Horizon; 2185  In 2185, Christianson was assigned to a garrison on Horizon during the Collector Crisis. At this time he was still leading the 205th Infantry. He, along with Ashley Williams, were on a covert assignment to see who was abducting colonists throughout the Terminus Systems. Ashley suspected it was Cerberus, having meet them the previous year. She also mentioned a lot about Shepard around him and telling him how much she reminded her of him. Ashley and him soon had a dropping out after an intense argument about suspicions. She suspected him of being a worker of Cerberus after he revealed he believed rumors that the colonists were being abducted by someone else. During an unscheduled evening patrol, he began to realize that the power was out and that communications were down, both of these being signs of disappearing colonies. Soon, the swarm came. He tried to call Ashley and the Alliance but got no response (As mentioned before, the radios were down). In a bit of heroism, he managed to gather a group of colonists into an Alliance Vehicle Garage and lock the door and preventing the swarms from entering. He told the colonists to enter the M35 Makos inside the garage in case the doors didn't hold and don't open until he said so. Afterwards, He, along with five armed civilians, swept the colony for survivors. After finding most of them, Christianson waited until Alliance Military arrived to take them off world. He was the only surviving soldier of the 205th Infantry, and was less than proud of it. He earned a commendation and medal for his bravery and sacrifice, the surviving colonists soon built a memorial on Horizon calling it \"The Christianson Wall\" which held the names of all those abducted.  He and Williams managed to clean up the colony before Christianson was sent to another post to begin training the new 205th Infantry, as the previous ones were all confirmed missing in action. Shortly after returning to the Citadel, Christianson was given the SSV Midway to investigate the Collectors in the Terminus Systems and was told about Shepard who was doing the same thing. He traveled around the Terminus Systems until finally finding a Geth/Reaper ship, from what Alliance Brass was hearing that the only way to defeat the Collecters was to get Reaper Technology and soon boarded the ship. Aboard the Reaper they realized what the colonists were being used for, and that Kingfish had been removed from his core long ago to be placed in a Human-Reaper. Shocked at this, Christianson ordered that they find the Reaper IFF as soon as possible as their was now a chance that the colonists were still alive. They soon found it, but it was cracked and fractured. Angered by this, he placed it in his pocket and walked back to the ship and letting A.N.I.T.A. handling it. She was able to fix and test it, unlike the Collector Ship and other Reaper there was no security code and thus it was fully operational. The Alliance Military wouldn't let the SSV Midway enter the Omega 4 Relay though, due to the \"High Chance of Death\". He managed to sneak passed and enter the Galactic Core, only to see the Normandy recieve heavy fire. Keith managed to redirect that fire onto them as they were more built for it and causing a distraction, but got more damage than expected and was forced to retreat once the Normandy crashlanded on the Collector Base back to Omega. Where the SSV Midway was repaired, there Admiral Mikhailovich showed his displasure of disobeying orders and stripped him of his rank and ship, grounding him on Earth with the Alliance Earth Defense Force as a Gunnery Chief.Reaper Incursion of 2186  Before the Reaper assault on Earth, Christianson was grounded to serve with the Alliance Earth Defense Force under the command of the Systems Alliance. Unable to do much else as the SSV Midway was being prepped for battle against the Reapers by getting newer plating and stronger cannons. Christianson, having fought Reapers before, knew they would be there soon. Stationed in Queens, New York City, He served as an analyst as well as soldier for the Defense Force on Earth while the SSV Midway received extensive modifications to help it fight the Reapers. When the United Kingdom was struck without warning, New York soon followed as Reapers took control of the Empire State Building and the Harbor.  Christianson, along with his grounded team, ran out of the Defense Building before it was torn in half and blown up by a Reaper Laser. While trying to reach the SSV Midway, James was caught off guard by the explosion of the SSV Kangchenjunga. He became seriously injured by burns by the nearby explosion, and told the Midway to come back for him and ordered them to leave and help Shepard. His crew left to find Shepard while he fought off Cannibals in the harbor. He was soon saved by his commanding officer, Cecil Zachary and brought to the New York Library which was now a military operations base. After a few days, Christianson recieves a video of Cecil killing innocents outside the Stock Market Building. When he confronted him, Cecil threw a shock wave at him and turned his omni-tool asking for an extraction. As James chased Cecil to the roof, he overheard their conversation about the Reapers and how Cecil was actually an agent for Cerberus. James met him on the roof and Cecil shows that he has a bomb and isn't afraid to blow the whole building up. James shoots the detonator out of his hand and the two fight. After the fight, Cecil is breathless and laying on the ground as James places his foot on his chest and says a prayer before shooting him in the head, killing Cecil. He deactivates the bomb and gets a message of a massive assault in London, led by Shepard and Admiral Anderson. He loads the bomb onto a shuttle and gets a few soldiers, the rest hold their last stand as survivors are shuttled off Earth, about 22% Survive. When he arrived, the bomb was dropped on a Reaper, killing it but the shuttle was caught in the blast and was thrown into the ground. Christianson survived, but was nearly struck by a Reaper laser. He saw the huge force heading for the tower to retake the Citadel and followed, suddenly a barrage of Reaper Lasers struck near the tower devastating the whole unit including Shepard and Anderson. Christianson got the worse of it, both by the heat of the laser and the explosion of a Mako. As he regained consciousness, he found a piece of shrapnel had broke into his hip and his leg. Using the last ounces of will he had, he stood up. He called for Shepard who he saw laying on the ground unconscious and bleeding out. Christianson walked over and introduced himself for the first (and final) time. He helped Shepard to his feet through talking, and told him that he lost a lot of good men and wasn't afraid to die anymore. Shepard handed him a pistol and the two shot their way into the beam of light to the Citadel. James didn't fully make it and collapsed on the ground. He told Shepard to go without him and that he'll have his back here on Earth. As Shepard disappeared into the light, a Reaper's leg crashed nearby and James looks up at it leaning against the leg of the tower with just a pistol and loads a thermal clip and fires at it as it readies to fire. On his last shot, the Reaper's face explodes from a missile and his eyes glaze over as Systems Alliance members retake London. A medic finds him and as his voice fades in blurriness, he can be heard saying his condition is critical and he's not gonna make it. Christianson then sees the Crucible's effect, annihilating the Reapers but destroying the Citadel. The Mass Relay's remain and a new DNA is created in which contains human and synthetic properties. The galaxy is saved as James passes out, only to reawaken in a med-bay hospital in New York Harbor.Second Galactic Conflict; 2194  At this time, Christianson retired from the Systems Alliance and was staying on Earth helping rebuild. At this time, the Citadel had been long destroyed and a newer form of satellite called \"Thermopylae\" was being built, and near completion. As the rebuilding process halfway to completion and no more sign of retaliation from the Reapers (since they were neither Destroyed or \"Converted\" as a workforce), only one species stood. Since the end of the Genophage Tuchanka recovered faster as it believed, the krogan now masters of their homeworld began to question their \"aid\" to the Systems Alliance and voices were raised especially by Urdnot Wreav/Wrex that the krogan be given a seat for their services as well as a role in the Galactic community. But the Council recovering itself from the Reapers and Cerberus are reluctant to sponsor a krogan councilor due to their demanding and aggressive nature that could off balance the rebuilding process and would soon try and take on the Salarian Union as a punishment for creating the genophage, Urdnot Wreav/Wrex perceived this as a betrayal and began to pressure the council to consider it as an obsolete issue and the krogans have in fact risen from their own Dark Chapter and be given a role in par with the turians as peacekeepers, but the Council could'nt trust krogan judgement due to their wreckless reputation. With no incoming response Urdnot Wreav/Wrex declared an all out war targeting first the Salarian Union then their former ally, the Turian Hierarchy initiating the Second Galactic Conflict or the Krogan incursions.\u00a0Appearance  James Christianson is a musclar well built man with an average height and blue eyes. He has a shaven head and stubble covering his chin and upper lip. He has a large tattoo on his right arm that resembles a unit of men, and a group of names and ending on the back of his hand, a planet with a banner that reads \"Remember Horizon\" on it. Through, there are names of those that weren't on Horizon so it is suspected that it is a list of people he knew at one point. Christianson's outfit remains the same, when onboard the ship it is a classic Colonel's uniform. A dark blue uniform with three silver bars on each shoulder and three medals on his right pocket and his name plate on the left. During combat, he relies heavily on his shields as his armor is thin. It is a heavy golden colored steel over a black tanktop and black pants. His belt holds ammo and a holster for his M-5 Phalanx.Personality  ---Biotic Abilities  James shows a mastery over his biotic abilities.

For years Cloud did the bidding of his master until eventually he met and fell in love with Tifa Lockhart who showed him what he was doing was wrong. Cloud confronted his master telling him he would no longer do as he commanded. Enraged Iblis attacked him and after beating Cloud went through the process of extracting his darkness and with it created an Unversed of Cloud, the one-winged angel Sephiroth. He faced no difficulty in taking out Cloud's darkness, since Cloud offered no resistance, fearing his darkness. Afterwards Cloud escaped and eventually turned his life to fixing the mistake he made by allowing Sephiroth to be created. Sephiroth acted as Iblis' apprentice, and continues to act as one of his top servants. Later on Iblis adopted a new apprentice that Sephiroth brought to him named Zack Fair, and together they trained him.Kingdom Hearts  During the Platinum Match at Olympus Coliseum, Sephiroth appears and fights Sora. He is a secret boss available in all but the regular Japanese version. After having been defeated by Sora, Cloud finally meets Sephiroth. In silence, Sephiroth implores Cloud to turn to the darkness, which Cloud refuses. The two engage in a high-speed battle in the air, the outcome of which is unknown (however, this is only in the Kingdom Hearts Final Mix. In the original, it is never shown that Sephiroth and Cloud ever meet, or that Cloud is even aware Sephiroth is a challenger in the Coliseum).Kingdom Hearts II  Right before the invasion of Hollow Bastion, Cloud warns Sora and company about Sephiroth, and his ways of the darkness. Later, as Sora exits the castle to go help defend against the invasion, Sephiroth appears. He asks about Cloud's whereabouts, but Sora doesn't answer, though he and his friends reveal that Cloud realizes that Sephiroth is the manifestation of Cloud's darkness. Seeing that Cloud is becoming enlightened and desires to fight him, Sephiroth takes his leave. During the battle, Cloud is surrounded by Heartless, but Sephiroth intervenes, defeating them all in one swipe. Cloud intends to defeat his nemesis to escape the darkness, but Sephiroth only replies that Cloud will never be able to do so, and will always cower in the light. Cloud vehemently denies his dark half's claims, but Sephiroth is undeterred, and leaves just as Tifa arrives. After the Master Control Program is defeated, Sora encounters Sephiroth at the Dark Depths. The villain again asks about Cloud, but Sora and his companions don't reveal anything. He then inquires about Sora, Donald, and Goofy's identities, but again, they refuse to answer. Sephiroth then notices Sora's Keyblade, and attacks, intending to test Sora's power and that of the Keyblade. Sora appears to overcome him, but Sephiroth just shrugs off the battle. Sephiroth complements Sora on his skill with the Keyblade but says that Cloud is the only one that can \"eliminate him\". Sephiroth then tells Sora to find Cloud so that they can settle their feud. Cloud arrives later, and a battle begins, with Sephiroth desiring to draw Cloud into the darkness. However, Tifa protects Cloud, saying that Cloud does have light in him, and that, even if he doesn't, then he just needs to be surrounded by light. Nevertheless, Sephiroth and Cloud start off for another battle, and after Tifa's intervention, Cloud glows in light, surprising Sephiroth and letting his guard down. The two disappear in a brilliant flash of light. Nobody knew where they had gone. Kingdom Hearts III: The Return of the Chasers After the flash of light the two ended up in the Keyblade Graveyard where they continued their battle until Sephiroth beat and brutally injured Cloud and left him unconscience. Shortly afterwards his master Iblis (Chernabog) found him and recruited him to help in his cause. He gave Sephiroth the mission to build a powerful dark army for him while he had his council look for the Fantasia Gate. Sephiroth accepted. Eventually using the darkness within Sora and Riku he created Unverses of them named Kyoei and Hokori and began to train them for the sole purpose of having them help him overthrow Chernabog and having him attain power.Kingdom Hearts: Aqua's Journey  Kingdom Hearts: Aqua's Journey is a spin-off game to the main Kingdom Hearts series that involves Aqua as a main protagonist as she is looking for her friends, Terra and Ventus with the help of Ansem the Wise, Marco Bellies and Suki Higurashi as they explore various worlds, Disney and Non-Disney in hopes to save them.Summons or D-links (Dimension Links) Worlds Characters  Heroes Allies VillainsBoss battle music Zira  The Lioness, and Cruel Villain, Zira Appeared In Kingdom Hearts Series Such as The Universe XP Kingdom Hearts Series, Kingdom Hearts 3: The Return of the Chasers, Kingdom Hearts: Dark Of The Wars, and Kingdom Hearts: Aqua's Journey.Story Role The Return of the Chasers  Before Simba overthrew his uncle Scar, Zira was one of his mates.

But Primoris' vengeance cannot be contained for long, as he begins to turn villains within Xehanort's group to his far more sinister cause. He will not rest till Sora and all the worlds suffer for their \"crimes\" against the darkness. Meanwhile, Maleficent is back as well, gathering a rag-tag group of villains that oppose the forces of Xehanort. Kingdom Hearts is on the backburner, for Maleficent wants one thing alone, vengeance on Sora. Either way you look at it, Sora has three groups of villains all out for blood, all wanting vegeance.Story  Act I Act II Act IIIMain Characters Main Heroes Main Villains The Cabal  Nearly a hundred years ago, the demonic agent known as \"Primoris Carmina\" influenced a young keyblade wielder about to become a master. This young man came to be known in later years as \"Master Xehanort\", a keyblader corrupted by darkness sought to control the power of Kingdom Hearts, and in doing so caused the events that unfolded in Birth By Sleep, KHI, Chain of Memories, 359/2 Days, KHII, and coded. When he returned, he immediatly reunited with Primoris, who for ten years had gathered power and influence across the worlds, building an empire from which they could use to finally conquer Kingdom Hearts. It was then that the \"Cabal\" was born. Over the next year, Xehanort, alongside revived minons Xigbar and Vanitas, gathered like-minded villains from across the galaxy. They sought powerful individuals in the fields of super-science and sorcery, those that had amassed great criminal enterprises, and those that wielded great military strategy. Combined, the villains sought to secretly influence numerous important worlds, making it easier to overthrow and destroy them. Using Heartless, Nobodies, Unversed, and personal henchmen, the Cabal would stop at nothing to gain the power of Kingdom Hearts. By any means necessary, that includes going after the friends, family, and allies of a cerain keyblader that is always interferring their plans, Sora.The Syndicate  While the Cabal is well-organized and elite group of villains, Maleficent's Syndicate is the exact opposite. She organized a group of villains long before the Cabal came to power, and manged to lead heartless from world to world, in her quest to use the darkness to harness Kingdom Heart's power. After it collapsed, thanks to Sora killing most of the members, Maleficent died but was resurrected. Now twisted by revenge against Sora, and still devoted to her own goal, she, Pete, and his son PJ gathered a new group of foes to aid her. The Cabal operates on a covert level, gathering vast intel and coming up with cunning and manipulative plots to further their goals. The Syndicate on the other hand, commits acts of destruction and mayhem in broad daylight, not caring if their cover is blown and the worldy residents realize they've been invaded by outsiders and monsters. Because of the Syndicate's less than professional nature, Xehanort and Primoris have made an enemy of the witch, making it part of their operations to put her and the Syndicate out of commisson. The Syndicate consists more of heavy-hitters than genius machiavellian schemers. All the plots and plans are formulated by Maleficent, the rest of the villains are used as enforcers, using their heartless and minions to by all means kill Sora. Once Sora is gone, step two of their plan begins, the abduction of the Princesses of Heart.Worlds Main Theme  Just like KHI and KHII had Utada Hikaru songs for their main themes, Vengeance will have one as well. thumb|left|325pxZack Fair - (KH3:RotC)  Zack Fair is a Final Fantasy character that made his first official appearance in Final Fantasy VII and first Kingdom Hearts appearance in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep.

She possess a palpable lust for shiny objects (jewels and precious metals) and brand-name goods, being able to discern a real jewel from a simple piece of imitation (and throwing away the latter). She emulates her mother in her utterly stubborn pursuit of handsome young men who catch her eye, not unlike her brother, who soon discovered that a way to pacify her was to put on a cutout mask of a known handsome actor. In her family, she is an icon of adoration and annoyance, causing trouble she cannot be blamed for given her infantile innocence. She can be extremely fast crawling, tiring out even Shin-chan, and often uses Shiro as a toy. Her name, which is Japanese for \"sunflower\", was chosen by the show's viewership and not the creator.Worlds  The Worlds who is Based off The Disney Anime, Star Wars/Star Tours, Non-Disney, and More.Genesis Rhapsodos (Darkness and Light)  Genesis Rhapsodos, known as the Crimson Soldier, is one of Sephiroth's \"Friends\" and a High Ranked individual in the Dark Empire.Appearance and Personality Based off Crisis Core: FF7 - Copied from the Final Fantasy Wiki  Genesis's physical appearance is based on Gackt, who is one of the most famous Japanese Pop/Rock idols. Gackt also wrote and performed Dirge of Cerberus's theme song, \"Redemption\" and actually wears the Genesis costume in the music video, though his hairstyle has changed.  Beyond this, Genesis's design bears similarities to Sephiroth, including the long coat, black clothing underneath, black boots, shoulder guards, and a large sword. Genesis is right-handed and bears a large wing on his left side, in contrast to Sephiroth, who is left-handed and has a wing on his right side. While Sephiroth's uniform and design are predominantly black and white, Genesis's is red and black. Gackt had a small amount of input on the costume design, mostly to ensure it would allow for easy movement, but also to help settle on the color scheme, which had previously been intended to be either white or black. In the Game: Crisis Core's beginning portrays Genesis as a deserter, arrogant and childish. He even plays a trick on Zack after they meet in Banora. At first, he seems to be a simple character, but as the story progresses, the conflict within Genesis becomes increasingly visible. Genesis was adopted, causing him to feel betrayed by both his true and false parents, one of the reasons for his departure from SOLDIER. His main source of turmoil comes from the secrets of his birth he discovers after the injury he sustains during training, that leads him to resent Shinra and all those associated with it. His seiyuu, Gackt, says that his narcissistic and destructive personality make Genesis an interesting character and makes him authentic.Darkness and Light  In Darkness and Light, his destructive and narcissistic personality remain but more from revenge against the Realm of Light for attempting a Darkness experimented Project on them to create Darkness combating Supersoldiers, Genesis and his \"friends\" have revealed that they are a genetic mutation of Black Blood. Due to being a mutation, they don't have the Black Blood themselves however their attributes are greatly advanced compared to other Denizens of Darkness whom lack Black Blood, allowing Genesis to be very destructive indeed.Biography History Creation  Genesis' History is similar to Sephiroth's, he was adopted from a young age and was revealed to have been the offspring of Project G which was one of two projects to create Darkness fighting Supersoldiers by mutating Black Blood with the Element of Light, this however proved to be too dangerous as all the Element of Light did was to mutate the Darkness and in the process made the being not only a Denizen of Darkness but also stronger than most organisms.Meeting Blaid and Joining the Dark Empire  Genesis hid out with Angeal and Sephiroth at Villain's Vale prior to it being occupied by Dark Forces, Sephiroth led Blaid to their safe Haven after facing Blaid in a fight and learning of Blaid's connection as heir of the Dark Empire causing three powerful allies to aid the Traitor Keyblade Wielders, eventually they would follow after Blaid whom had formed the Dark Empire once again in the Realm In-Between.Kh3 kairi keyblader.jpg Villains  Some of the Evil Villains of the Series.Spyro  Spyro is one of the many characters encountered by Sora in Kingdom Hearts II \u00bd.Role  Spyro is a young, brave dragon from Dragon Shores. Somewhat headstrong and sarcastic, but also fearless. He is always accompanied by his best friend Sparx. They join forces with Sora on several occasions, fighting villains such as Gnasty Gnorc, Ripto and the Sorceress who are using the Heartless to plunge their worlds into darkness.In Battle  Spyro is capable of a wide array of physical and magical attacks, most of which are carried over from the original Spyro trilogy. His main attack, Fire Breath, is exactly what it sounds like - Spyro breathes fire which damages enemies. Charge involves Spyro running headfirst into enemies, ramming them with his horns. With Head Bash, Spyro jumps on top of an enemy, leaps into the air and slams down headfirst. Superflame is essentially a supercharged version of Fire Breath with greater attack power and a far greater range. A rarer attack is Ice Breath, which acts much like Blizzard magic, temporarily freezing enemies and damaging them as the ice cracks. Spyro's limit, Dragon Flight, has Sora ride on Spyro's back and fly across the arena. Spyro will spit Superflame fireballs, Sora will shoot bolts of Fire magic and hit nearby enemies with the Keyblade. The finish, Kamikaze, is a dive bomb into a pocket of enemies which causes an explosion and a shockwave. If Sora is in the path of one of Spyro's fireballs, he can use the direction command Redirect to deflect it towards a nearby enemy.Battle Quotes ", "Star Fox Fan Fiction Wiki": "Star Fox Fan Fiction Wiki Star Fox Fan Fiction Wiki  The wiki about Star Fox Fanon that anyone can edit!

She then joined Starfox, serving as a pilot and the teams' telepath. 2 years later after the events in Command, she married Fox McCloud and had one child, a son named Marcus.Star Fox\u00a0  After being rescued by Fox in Starfox Adventures, served as the team's telepath as seen in Starfox Assault when the squadron was battling in the Aparoid Wars. She was generally respected by the rest of the team, and even had a romantic relationship with Fox McCloud.Later life  2 years after she married Fox, they moved to an unknown forest planet, a place where they hoped they would finally find peace. However, due to a surprise mission, they set a course for Corneria. Along they way, they stopped on another unknown planet to rest. Reminiscing their earlier days in the Star Fox team, Krystal began to worry about once again separating from Fox. Fox assured her, telling her that nothing would happen as long as they were together. Asleep in her bed, Krystal experienced a vision of Andross's return in a dream she was having, disturbed by how real it seemed. She feared that this was indeed a sign of Andross's rebirth.\u00a0 Not too long after, while Fox was away on Corneria to meet with Peppy Hare,\u00a0 Krystal discovered she was pregnant with what was soon to be Marcus McCloud. Indeed however her vision came true, but somehow Andross had a clone body and possibly more, this triggered another Lylat war although strangely the former home base of Andross Venom had no sign of the Venomian Army or Andross at all, this started worrying Krystal awfully as she said to Peppy who now was the current General of the Cornarian Army that she has always knew that he would come back to haunt the Lylat system. Four weeks later on board the Great Fox, Andross made an ambush on the Star Fox team and brutally damaged the ship and attempted to lure Fox into his death but was not deceived by his foul actions, so he ordered the ship to hyperspace out of the trap and so they did but during the battle Andross said to Fox that he only wanted to take what was rightfully his, meaning Krystal and her unborn child, Fox had to hide her until he could find Andross and kill him and destroy the Venomian Army, so Fox sent Krystal to the planet Gev, an oasis with grassy plains and towering spires which she had been for a week until she was nearly kidnapped by a spy who threatens to kill her if she did not go to Andross but successfully had Fox arrive in time to rescue her from abduction. Fox knew that he was being spied on by a Cornarian agent who had information on Krystal's whereabouts, and told Andross so that he could get payed by him but immediately Fox knew that the agent was up to something and threatened to injure him so the agent told him about the plot to abduct Krystal so Fox reached to Gev and just when Krystal was brawling with the Venomian assassin who had a tranquilizer to knock her out but gets shot by Fox who immediately barges into her room and came to her aid and Fox told her that she was no longer safe there and they left the next day, but Fox knew he had to be with her at all times.Mccloud Family (0) Mac Cloud, the great  The First Mccloud.

Their representative color is Violet.History  Often overlooked by high school guidance counselors as a viable career option, witchcraft is nonetheless an extremely effective means of combat and self-actualization. One such circle in the heart of France has mastered this nuanced art form with far more skill than their peers, turning an otherwise harmless practice into full-fledged combat viability. Each member of the group has her own area of expertise, whether it be love, symbols, demons, potions or curses. Together they form a world-renowned team, though their motives remain unclear. Men who've made the mistake of becoming intimately involved with Eva, Margo and Sadie nonetheless report them as being \"completely crazy, messed up witches.\"Amazons  The green amazons tend to use a combination of physical attacks and light magic attacks to take down their foes. They tend to use pretty direct attacks--not fancy, but effective! Helene and Ashi are tough front row fighters, while Andromeda, Phoebe, and Anex shine at range. Most have a powerful nuke, an attack that puts the enemy in a very bad scenario. Their representative color is Green.History  Amazon women were a force to be feared in ancient Greece, female warriors who stood toe to toe with their male enemies and slaughtered them without mercy. Though their kingdom has greatly diminished as civilization bred the savagery from their culture, the land of Amazonia still burns with the unrealized ambitions of their ancient grandmothers. A new generation has come to power, one not content to rule what land has been left them by years of polite wars and table politics. These women armed themselves in their ancient armor and brutally killed the first foreign ambassador who came to their court. \n\n They plundered the old treasuries and museums, searching for weapons that would strengthen them for battle. Only five of the True Relics their ancestors had used still held power, but they were more than enough to push the warrior women toward victory. \n\n The Amazons once again went to war.Character Matchups  This page (will) list all possible character matchups and explains why and how certain matchups work.Martial Artists Amaya Amaya vs Onimaru  Amaya takes some damage from Sword Flurry, but can't be damaged by Double Slash due to Ninja-Port. Onimaru will try to use Ancestral Curse, then save up energy to move close and Sword Flurry for 36 damage before Amaya can Ninja-Port away. Amaya should aim to keep energy saved up to prevent Onimaru doing this, then using a Dark Chi Blast when Onimaru is too low on energy to close and attack.Amaya vs Ashi  A bad matchup here for Amaya. Ashi will choose to use Bleeding Slice, which will hit even if Amaya uses Ninja Port. It only takes two of these to kill Amaya. Even using Dark Chi Blast if the battle starts at range is dangerous as Ashi can survive the damage and a following Ninja Port. This battle may be salvageable if Amaya gets lucky with Shadow Curse and causes Ashi to mishit often. However, nine times out of ten this is an Ashi victory.Amaya vs Helene  Again a bad matchup for Amaya. Helene will either Shield Bash and interrupt your Ninja-Port or Enchant Blade, to give her the additional Choice of dealing 60 damage with Frenzied Strikes. Shield Bashing Amaya's Ninja-Port will kill Amaya in four attacks. Luckily this uses too much of Helene's energy, allowing Amaya to Ninja-Port and threaten with Dark Chi Blast. Unfortunately, Helene can survive a Ninja-Port and Dark Chi Blast, but then only requires another Ninja-Port to defeat. If Amaya Ninja-Ports when Helene uses Enchant Blade, Helene can close range and use Frenzied Strikes, or Sword Slash (which can still defeat Amaya in two attacks, and uses less energy). If Amaya Ninja-Ports away after Helene closes range and attacks, then Dark Chi Blast can threaten while Helene rests. Starting at long range increases Amaya's chances, but is still at a disadvantage.Amaya vs Juju  Ninja-Port out-speeds all Juju's close attacks and Hex only causes 10 damage. However, Juju survives a Dark Chi Blast on full health, and can defeat Amaya in five turns at range with four Curse of Juju. Amaya can wear Juju down with resting and multiple Dark Chi Blasts winning a battle of attrition against repetetive Healing Touch by Juju. Also, Shadow Curse can be used to make Curse of Juju miss more often. This is generally an Amaya win, unless Amaya gets unlucky.Amaya vs Cornelius  Amaya has the advantage due to the fact that Ninja-Port is faster than Pilebunker. Amaya may also disable certain moves that Cornelius absolutely needs in order to put up a fight against Amaya. A clever opponent will close range when possible to avoid a Dark Chi Blast, and use Voidstream to wear down dark resistances and cause increasing damage. Scroll of Inner Focus turns the advantage more towards Amaya, whereas a Ring of Curses or a Necronomic Tome turns the advantage toward Cornelius.Amaya vs Vanessa Voss  Double Slash can defeat Amaya in a single round if it lands a critical hit. The outcome of this battle relies mainly on luck with Amaya disabling Vanessa's Double Slash at close. Amaya should Ninja-Port away and threaten with Dark Chi Blast. Vanessa may well choose to use Ray of Light after Amaya Ninja-Ports, followed by a Radiance Burst, which will kill Amaya. Hope to disable a part of this with Amaya's Innate too.Onimaru Onimaru vs Cornelius  Very one-sided matchup for Cornelius. Cornelius can constantly switch to far range to blast away with Voidstream and even do quite a bit of damage close range with Pilebunker. In addition, Double Slash is dangerous to use because of Hypnotic Stare. Because of Cornelius's innate, Onimaru cannot use Ancestral Curse, making Sword Flurry only capable of dealing 18 damage. Ancestral Spirit is also fairly ineffective against Voidstream, because it is slower and has a chance to miss. It is possible - though statistically unlikely - to cause a Stalemate with repeated castings of Ancestral Spirit, allowing Onimaru to get close at full energy. All in all, it's a very hard matchup for Onimaru.Yoshiro Yoshiro vs Amaya  Chi Blast is faster than all of Amaya's moves. At close range, Yoshiro should have no trouble winning. Amaya's Ninja-Port is rendered close to useless because Rising Dragon deals 21 damage, setting up Chi Blast for the kill. The best chance for Amaya is to use Shadow Curse and, like always, try to get lucky.Amazons Andromeda Andromeda vs Yoshiro  This one Andromeda should take. Despite Yoshiro's dodging, Rain of Arrows is very effective against him as it does massive damage against Yoshiro. At long range and without an Scroll of Inner Focus, Yoshiro can only use Chi Blast\u00a0once, which doesn't do enough damage to kill Andromeda and leaves him vulnerable to a follow up Rain of Arrows. With a Scroll of Inner Focus, Yoshiro still has to worry about Andromeda's Lightning Arrow as it interrupts Yoshiro's Chi Blast. Even starting from close range, Andromeda should take this matchup as she has enough energy to run to long range (once or twice), and shoot Rain of Arrows twice without needing to rest or switch. If Yoshiro gives chase, this deprives him of possible Chi Blast\u00a0tactics and can be very risky if he doesn't stun Andromeda. Yoshiro may sometimes try Chi Reflect at long range because Yoshiro could be worried about a Lightning Arrow or Trueshot although Andromeda should rarely ever use Trueshot against Yoshiro. Andromeda vs Rathbone This matchup mostly relies on the rate at which Rathbone uses Domination, although it is mostly in Andromeda's favor. Rathbone doesn't always stay close in the first turn, so that should give Andromeda an oppritunity to get far and attack. If Rathbone stays close, however, he can either Dominate for a bench-blaster or do major damage with Heart of Darkness. After this, his energy will be too low to change range, allowing Andromeda to get far. At long range, Andromeda has several options. She can either use Rain of Arrows to hit Rathbone if he flees, or chance a one-hit-kill with Trueshot. Beware, however, that a Domination can stop both of those. The best bet in that situation is to use Lihgtning Arrow. It costs nothing, can outrun all of Rathbone's attacks, and does a modest 18 damage. If Rathbone Dominates and Andromeda used Lightning Arrrow, Rathbone can't dominate and Andromeda has enough energy for all of her attacks. This allows Andromeda to kill with Trueshot. During this fight, Andromeda can also use Crippling Shot to prevent a possible Heart of Darkness.Ashi Ashi vs Cornelius  An incredibly difficult fight for Ashi as she has to guess when Cornelius will throw out his Hypnotic Stare as it reflects Ashi's most damaging attacks. Basically, Ashi has to rest or throw an Axe Handle whenever Cornelius uses Hypnotic Stare and use Bleeding Slice or Signature Slice when he doesn't. One slightly good thing for Ashi is that Hypnotic Stare can't be used two rounds in a row. Things go a little better for Ashi if she has the Valkyrie's Charm(+1 speed to attacks), as now Bleeding Slice can't be reflected by Hypnotic Stare. Ashi can force Cornelius out of play with Power Swing. This would avoid a Pilebunker, but beware that if Cornelius uses Hypnotic Stare, Ashi will be forced out of play. Another thing that makes this matchup difficult is Voidstream. Because it only costs 20 energy and works at both ranges, Cornelius can range dance and attack Ashi at far where she can't hurt him.Helene Helene vs Onimaru  A sure win for Helene. Although you might be tempted to try Enchant Blade, Onimaru will quickly negate it with Sword Flurry. Onimaru will most likely use Ancestral Spirit in order to lessen the damage from Frenzied Strikes, followed up by Ancestral Curse. After that, Onimaru gets to do 52 damage from Double Slash. In order to win this, start off with Frenzied Strikes to do 42 damage. If Onimaru uses Ancestral Spirit, follow it up with Enchant Blade. Onimaru will then use Sword Flurry in an attempt to stop a huge amount of damage. Simply use Sword Slash, and then finish Onimaru off with a Frenzied Strikes. In the beginning, if Onimaru instead uses Ancestral Curse, use Shield Bash to stop a Double Slash, and then finish him off with Frenzied Strikes. As long as you play smart, it should be a sure-win for Helene. (Assuming both characters are at full hp, full energy.) Helene vs Rathbone An ok matchup for Helene. Rathbone won't take much damage unless you use Enchant Blade. However, if Rathbone opens with Domination, it will be interupted. He can also use Domination to force an enchanted Helene to do massive damage to her team, but this works best at far where Helene can't use Frenzied Strikes. At close, Rathbone's Heart of Darkness can do some massive damage, but it also leaves the door open for an Enchant Blade. Once she does, Frenzied Strikes can do 60 damage to Rathbone, making it an instant kill. However, Heart of Darkness has a 50% chance to reduce your damage, which will prevent a 60 damage instant kill. Items are important in this matchup as Ring of Bravery can allow Rathbone to kill Helene by using Heart of Darkness twice, if the debuff procs. Sacred Candle can make Helene immune to Heart of Darkness's debuff.Phoebe Phoebe vs Rumiko  Phoebe should win this matchup. The only chance of Rumiko winning is to get close with Phoebe and Eviscerate. If all goes well, Phoebe should be stunned, allowing Rumiko to rest and repeat. After two Eviscerates, Rumiko should then go with a Poison Dart, and allow Phoebe to switch ranges. However, the major flaw in this strategy is that Eviscerate only has a 70% chance of stun. If Phoebe and Rumiko start at far range, this is a sure win for Phoebe-if they both start at close range, Rumiko has a 49% chance of winning. Not bad, but the odds go to Phoebe in both close and far range.Villagers Juju Juju vs Ambrosia  At close, Juju needs one Touch of Doom, and can survive 4 turns, unless Ambrosia continually procs Spiked Boots. At far, Ambrosia needs 5 Bleeding Rituals for (6+12+18+24+24=84), whereas Juju needs 4 Curse of Juju. (Note that this will not kill Ambrosia until the end of turn 5.) Both Juju's innate and his Healing Touch effectively negate one Ritual each time they're used, giving him the advantage in this matchup. Note: Because of a new update, it has been suggested that this match up has been rendered useless.Tafari Tafari vs Tafari  Prepare for a long and boring match. This matchup will rely completely on luck. Basically, whoever gets Poison Dart to poison more wins. Do not try to use Hide or Leafy Trap, since Tafari can easily counter Hide by switching to far, and Leafy Trap by not using Hide. All in all, this will be decided by the items Tafari is carrying, and luck with Poison Dart.Vampires Ambrosia Thorn Ambrosia vs Onimaru  Onimaru can significantly damage Ambrosia with Double Slash if he can survive through her Spectral Choke for 40 damage. Spectral Choke is faster than Double Slash, though, which is a bonus for Ambrosia. Its probably best to switch out of this matchup as Ambrosia if she cannot do Spectral Choke and kill Onimaru to avoid taking a Double Slash. Moving long and hitting intercept can help against Onimaru in some situations because it disables his ability to move close and Double Slash twice unless he has Scroll of Inner Focus.Ambrosia vs Yoshiro  Ambrosia is not well suited to fighting Yoshiro on his own terms. He can stun her which hurts her very much with all of her low speed moves and he also does more damage at far than Ambrosia. Generally you want to switch her in as Yoshiro is at 40 or less life and 45 or less energy, as with most characters. If Ambrosia is Close and at 80+ energy, she has a slightly better than 50% chance of winning as two Spectral Chokes will kill Yoshiro from full HP. She would need 40-58 HP depending. Assuming both are at full HP this match is in Ambrosia's favor as even with General's as Yoshiro would need to get two stuns. If Ambrosia has Tome this match is even more in her favor. He will likely try to stun Ambrosia even though it is a low chance to succeed. If Ambrosia has Necronomic Tome equipped she can try to maintain parity by doing Vamp Kiss to heal the damage that Yoshiro does as Ambrosia gets him down to 40 or less in total life. Once Yoshiro is at 40 or lower life Ambrosia should try for the kill with Spectral Choke.Ambrosia vs Cornelius Constantine  Generally you do not want to be in this matchup as Ambrosia, feel free to switch out if you think you can get away with it at any point. Constantine will generally want to move close and Pilebunker if possible for a chance at a one shot kill. If you think he will do so try to switch out and if you don't think you can do so safely consider trying to use Vamp Kiss to get above 48 life or try to use Spiked Boots to stun him. If Ambrosia is at long range at the beginning of the encounter, she can do well by chain casting Bleeding Ritual. He will initially be doing less than 24 from Voidstream while she gets the whole 24 from Bleeding Ritual. It is possible to get a small lead in life this way and it may transpose into the previous case after a few voidstreams from Constantine.Ambrosia vs Helene  Generally another matchup that you are not thrilled to be in. Ambrosia can tank Helene if she has Girdle of Iron Will by using Spectral Choke without fear of Shield Bash. Since Ambrosia's normal item is the Necronomic Tome, consider going far and resting followed by going far the next turn after she enchants and tries to move close. This will give you the best chances as she does not know whether to rest or intercept. If both are used as leads, go far and rest. She will either Switch or Enchant and move close. Once close use Kiss. Unless she Slashed and it proced you'll be at advantage and have a chance to win (higher if using Tome or Iron Will). You'll get one more Kiss and a Choke and if she didn't bash one of the Kisses you win, also it's likely she'll be expecting a switch and might mess up. As with most characters, its better to sub her in when Helene is low on life and energy.Ambrosia vs Ashi  Because Ashi's most damaging move is Signature Slice and with her most common item (Sharpening Stone) Bleeding Slice is a major threat, it is good strategy to try and go far, rest/intercept, go far, rest/intercept at the beginning of the match. This will put Ashi in the situation of having 50 energy and even if she rests and closes next turn she cannot single hit kill through Signature Slice. Again, as with most characters, the lower Ashi's energy when Ambrosia switches in, the much better it is for her.Cain Solomon Cain vs Amaya  At close range, Cain's Tackle attack deals serious damage and can interrupt Ninja Port and Shadow Wrath. Amaya can suffer the damage in order to build up Shadow Curses, as a long term strategy, or move to far range for a Dark Chi Blast. At long range it's difficult for Cain to damage Amaya, but the low cost of his attacks makes it easy for him to avoid the Blast. If Cain can keep close, this matchup should favor him. Bad luck can see Tackle disabled and Shadow Curses can cause it to miss, which can improve Amaya's situation a great deal. However, it's hard for Amaya to land a solid blow as long as Cain keeps his energy up, so the most Amaya will probably get is a few Shadow Curses to aid other members of his team.Cain vs Higashi  This is a very tricky matchup for both sides. Depending on the items, and other situational effects, it can go either way. At close range Higashi will rely on Open Palm, which only needs to cast once to give Higashi the advantage. However, if both sides use Tackle and Open Palm, and Open Palm doesn't cast, the advantage will go to Cain. Also, Open Palm uses more energy and can allow Cain to switch to long range without the threat of the Chi Blast. At long range the Light Chi Blast is a major threat, but mostly if Cain is already damaged. Long range favors Cain if he has the energy advantage (which is why Higashi will rarely switch to long range).Cain vs Onimaru  This matchup favors Cain. Onimaru can win if he lands a Double Slash, but Tackle has a 45% of interrupting a slash, and the attack is energy intensive. To win all Cain needs to do is keep Onimaru from hitting with a Double Slash, and slip the occassional Voidstream in. As such, Onimaru will usually switch out, but a well timed intercept can put an end to that, and ignore all of Onimaru's pretty armor.Cain vs Yoshiro  This is a brawl. On raw damage to damage, Cain beats out Yoshiro. However, a clever Yoshiro, especially one with the General's Insignia, can use Open Palm to avoid triggering Cain's innate. If he does that, then he can win with 3 hits to two Tackles. If the Palm casts and stuns Cain, then it's lights out. However, a straight across matchup is rare. Usually Yoshiro will be switched in to finish off a damaged Cain. If he has full energy and Cain has 20 or fewer HP, then Yoshiro can prevent Cain from range changing, switching out, or hitting with his innate enabled. Watch out for this trick! Don't let the opponent rob you of Cain's powerful last hit by bringing in Yoshiro.Cain vs Rumiko  When starting at far Cain wins this matchup because Rumiko needs 3 turns to kill Cain using Shuriken Barrage. Cain only needs 2 turns to kill Rumiko using Rush of Batstwice. But when at close Rumiko can try to stun Cain using Eviscerate and then use Ninja-Port to get far. Then she will only need 2 Shuriken Barrages to kill him. When in this situation you can either stay at far range and switch or get close and attack/intercept.Cornelius Constantine Cornelius vs Amaya  Repetitive use of going close and using Voidstream is Cornelius's best bet here. Although Amaya will Ninja-Port away each time, it slowly saps his energy and doesn't allow him to Dark Chi Blast Cornelius. The damage from Ninja-Port builds up over time, but so does Cornelius's Voidstream. Amaya using Scroll of Inner Focus allows the use of three Ninja-Ports to threaten with Dark Chi Blast turning the advantage towards Amaya; however, Cornelius equipped with Ring of Curses will turn the advantage in his favor due to the build up of miss percentage from Amaya's Ninja-Port. Keep in mind that Amaya always has the option of using Shadow Curse to make Cornelius miss more Voidstreams and Shadow Wrath if the match takes a long time.Vanessa Voss Vanessa Voss vs Knight Bestor  Generally considered to be in the advantage of Voss, due to her high light resistance, however voss' relatively low damage to bestor can be mitigated somewhat by bestor's engulfing flames. In the case that voss misses or fails an intercept, catching up with bestor's healing requires some luck with crits. Some people prefer to use feast of blood however asuming both characters are at full HP and energy (and close range) engulfing flames actually wins this one out. For best results a combination of both should be used. Items can have a significant effect on this matchup, if bestor has a prism or a ring of bravery, he gets an edge, and the same can be said for voss/tomes. Voss/tomes vs Bestor/Prism is mostly down to luck, with voss gaining an advantage due to her item doing and healing more damage.Knights Knight Bestor Bestor vs Onimaru  Bestor will win 1v1.Bestor vs Rumiko  Bad matchup for Bestor. Bestor Flaming Sword Frenzy and Rumiko Ports out (she has little to gain from eviscerate, as it is the same speed as FSF). Bestor Pyroclasm\u2019s and Rumiko uses Shuriken Barrage. Rumiko wins on turn 3 with 27 HP. Bestor can alternatively Force Close turn 2 and use Engulfing Flames, but will die turn 4. Can be useful to consider if switching is an option.Bestor vs Yoshiro  Item dependant matchup. Generally Bestor wins, but General\u2019s insignia makes the match favored to Yoshiro.Bestor vs Andromeda  Tossup, but Bestor favored (I think). The outcome is highly dependent upon correctly guessing range ranges and tactical rests. Bestor will likely come out ahead if switching is an option.Bestor vs Anex  Bestor slightly favored if close, Anex favored if far. Bestor and Anex trade blows, and Bestor will at worst trade with Anex if FSF procs off the 2 hit, and win if it procs off of the 1. Annex using Herbal remedy, getting a critical hit, or starting at far will allow her to have the advantage in this matchup.Bestor vs Ashe  Bestor favored. FSF kills on turn 2, Bestor taking 51 damage from Signature Slice and 17 from Axe Handle.Bestor vs Helene  Helene favored. Helene uses Frenzied strikes and kills turn 2.Bestor vs \u00a0Pheobe  Bestor highly favored. Bestor kills after 2 FSF, having taken little damage from Pheobe.Bestor vs Juju  Worst case scenario Bestor kills Juju on turn 3 (turn 2 if FSF does inflict burn), dies on turn 4 from ToD. Juju has advantages if switching is available, allowing him to potentially CoD and survive.Bestor vs Popo  Luck dependent, but Bestor Favored. Bestor should force close, FSF, rest twice and force close and FSF. Popo must get some combination of 2 slingshot critical hits or poison to win, and will have ~3 opportunities to do so.Bestor vs Tafari  Tafari achieves pyrrhic Victory outside of 1v1 scenario. Bestor forces close and hits with FSF, then Tafari forces far and trades Pyroclasm with Poison Dart. Tafari will likely kill Bestor first, but his bench will take a beating.Bestor vs Ubuntu  Bestor favored. Bestor forces close, uses FSF, Ubuntu goes far, uses Spirit Assistance, Bestor forces close and kills with FSF.Bestor vs Zina  Bestor favored. Bestor wins Pyroclasm/Tiger Frenzy trades if he lands FSF before Zina forcing Far.Bestor vs Ambrosia  Bestor favored. Ambrosia trades Vamp Kiss with FSF, allowing her to survive to turn 3 and being killed by a 3 FSF. Coming in at far Ambrosia wins, as she will kill Bestor by trading Bleeding Ritual with Pyroclasm. Forcing Close would not be advantageous for Bestor in this situation.Bestor vs Cain  Outcome depends on who range changes turn 1. If both or neither range change, Bestor will be able to land 2 FSF and take 59 damage. If only Cain or Bestor changes range, Cain will win. Cain favored if range starts at far.Bestor vs CC  Bestor highly favored. Kills on turn 2 after eating a Pilebunker to the face, or 2 voidstreams if CC forces far.Bestor vs MLM  Bestor wins on turn 3.Bestor vs VV  VV favored 1v1, but Bestor comes out ahead if he can switch successfully after trading blows. Bestor spams Engulfing Flames.Bestor vs Augur  Bestor slightly favored if starting at close, Augur favored if starting at far.Bestor vs Ranec  Bestor favored. Essentially a significantly more favorable VV matchup.Bestor vs Starbuck  Starbuck slightly favored. He can win if the Gigaton Punch activates, but otherwise they trade.Bestor vs Darla  Bestor favored. If Darla stuns with her Torpedo then she will win.Bestor vs Rathbone  Bestor favored. Rathbone will likely want to force far and then trade Firestorm with Pyroclasm, though this is still unfavorable as he will have to rest after 3 turns.Conventional Wisdom  OUTDATED after 1.8 changes** This table lists the conventional wisdom about how your character (left) will do against an opponent's character (top). This assumes that: Both characters are at full life and energy, at close range, and items are not in effect.Knights  The Brotherhood of Knights was the second set to be released in the 2nd generation of Kongai characters, on Friday 25th June 2010. The four \"good\" Knights use physical and light attacks whilst the fallen knight Rathbone only uses dark attacks. Their lack of dark resistance is evident, as Bracers is a popular item to equip, despite being strictly worse than Tiger's Claw. It's also a symptom that their items are relatively weak. Most of them have at least one hard-hitting move (\"nuke\") and can attack at both ranges, though most Knights prefer to be at close range. Their representative color is Blue.History  Little is known about the Knight Brotherhood; although the organization spans nearly every continent of the globe, its methods and true purpose have been kept a closely guarded secret for centuries. Whenever the knights appear, rumors flow in their wake. Some speculate that without the knights watching over mankind, an evil darkness would envelope the whole of human society. Rumors escalated when Rathbone began acting on his own accord, sometimes in conflict with his former knight allies. No one is certain whether Rathbone was ejected or if he left by his own free will, but a dark air seems to follow wherever he goes, and superstitious villagers have linked his appearance to locust infestations.Amaya Description  Amaya is the tricky, mysterious type.

Their representative color is White.History  When a portal to the future mysteriously appeared, humans across the world rejoiced, anticipating cures for diseases and blueprints for flying cars. Instead, future mankind used it to dump all their difficult-to-recycle garbage. But amid the piles of fax machines and iPads, other strange parts would sometimes be discovered that caught the attention of rummaging scientists. Once the parts were painstakingly reassembled, the sentient machines sprung to life, murdering their creators/captors and escaping to freedom (no one knows why the scientists kept assembling them after the first few incidents). While some machines were once peaceful servants in their own world, the shock of a primitive past and sketchy reassembly procedures have left them hostile toward humans. \"These are aggressive living things with no idea what century they're in, and they'll defend themselves, violently if necessary\" - Dr. SattlerSample Decks  Here you will find sample decks to use.

Their representative color is Maroon.History  For centuries a lost clan of warriors took refuge in the hidden mountains of Japan, honing their skills and biding their time until once again the Daimyo would call them to battle. As the years passed their numbers may have faltered, but never their resolve, their drive towards the perfection of bushido. When against all tradition a son of the village turned his back on his teachings and left the mountain, the last surviving master and his three remaining students were forced to follow, to try to stop whatever harm their wayward brother might do. With them they took the most sacred relics of their arts, the tools and charms that had been passed down through the centuries from master to student, some once used by the most valiant warriors of samurai legend, others by the darkest of ninja assassins. The world they found was a much different place than the one their forefathers had left.Deck Building Strategy  Deck building isn't just about getting a bunch of powerful characters together and hoping for the best. When you build a team, you want to have the characters cover for other's weaknesses. If possible, you also want them to enhance each other's strengths. For example, a team of Ashi, Helene and Onimaru would have glaring weaknesses. They are all characters that work at close range only. If your opponent has characters that fight well against them, you will have great difficulty. Juju or Andromeda could give that team great trouble, for example. however this can be overcomed by switching characters to get more energy for switching range. What are some common weaknesses? Here are some: There are also some common attributes of characters: Here's an example of building a team to cover weaknesses and to ensure a good range of attributes. We'll start off with the starter - perhaps Onimaru. He has strong attacks as well as high hit points and physical resistance, but can only fight at close and has no light or dark magic resistance. So we want a character who can fight well at long range or at both ranges, and has high dark resistance. Who can do this? Juju! Juju has 5 dark resistance, and he can totally kill guys that have low dark resistance with hex. He's also not bad up close with touch of doom. So already, this team is pretty well-rounded. Looking at this team already, it looks pretty good. We want a third character who is good at any lingering weaknesses. Can you see any? While light magic attacks aren't essential they can be handy. We'd also like someone who is good against dark resistance, since Juju does badly against someone with high dark resistance. Voss! Now, everyone covers everyone else well. If you look at the 'weaknesses' list, you can see that every area is covered by at least one character. Looking at the 'attributes' list, the only thing this team is missing is a 'hits fleeing' move, so you will have to be on your toes with intercepting. But overall, this team works well against any opposition!A five card deck  If you would like to play a 5 card game, you should consider a major difference: there are 5 characters to kill, thus those attacks that hits all enemies becomes extremely powerful. For an almost unbeatable 5 card deck would be: Amaya: decrease the hit rate by 20% of all players with shadow course, and hit everyone with shadow wrath. With ninja port you can switch to far and use dark chi blast... or intercept! He has only one important weakness: extremely low healt. Thus the perfect item for Amaya is jade figurine. With 70 hp he can cast more shadow wrath. Good against dark magic users. Zina: after mistress command a tiger frenzy can stun and cause bleeding. If you use her in the finishing you can also use her innate, as probably she killed 3 or 4 characters with a tiger frenzy. Generals insignia is a quite good item on her, to further increase the damage, but death mask can be useful as well, for a last strike. Vanessa Voss: with self healing, and radiance burst Vanessa also a must use. With a brutal close and long range hit vanessa can do a brutal damage, however in this deck Radiance burst is better. Against dark casters a brutal killer, against light magic users a good tank. as once everyone die Vanessa should use phylactery as an item, becouse in a game my vampire would die in the past 7! rounds, but he was still alive, with 1 hp. The opponent was angry. Bestor: his all player hit attack is spammable, and even has a chance to interrupt the enemy attack. With inner fire he can buff up the crit rate of all your characters to around 10% for a very long turn. As all of his moves are light magic elemental prysm is extremely good on him, so in every 3 pyroclasm 1 will hit 15 instead of 9. With the prism you can hit the whole enemy team with an inner fire, and in 5 card game this means 30 damage for 10 energy! and your crit rate increased... Gorbax: someone to handle physical attacks, and deal at most 1000 damege with death blossom even at close range. As everyone keeps Gorbax at close range this attack is extremely useful. As it costs a lot an a66 capacitor can come handy, to deal more damage to the enemy team. Especially fun when after a lock on you cast 2 death blossom, with additional damege. a z.phase converter is also useful, to double the innate of Gorbax, and give enough energy to activate his arsenal. General strategy: with the all character attack use as much as you can, and switch to Amaya against dark magic, Voss against light magic and Gorbax against physical attacks. Rarely intercept, as your attacks mostly hit the benched players, and if you see a knight with knight's emblem try to kill him as fast as you can. Nothing else can cause harm to this five card The person above obviously forgot Sophie Meroginvian...Eva Bovary Description  When an old mystic ritual called for men's tears, crushed hearts, wrinkled love letters and rain-soaked roses, Eva hopped back into the dating scene.Attacks Equippable Items Witches Items General Items Strategy Strengths Weaknesses Known bugs  None.Changes scheduled with next versions  None.Full Art Pirates  The Pirates was the first set to be released in the 2nd generation of Kongai characters, on Thursday 1st April 2010 (April Fool's Day). They attack mostly with physical attacks, and usually have poor non-physical defences. Of the Pirates, Starbuck and Ranec Vest prefer to be at close range whilst the rest prefer to be at far. Their items are largely interchangeable, with each item fulfilling a specific role should the character require it. Their representative color is Red.History  Cherishing freedom above all else (excluding treasure, booze, women, fighting, and more treasure), the scurvy pirates sail the seas in search of adventure and glory. One fateful morning, a violent storm blew Auger and his crew's ship off course. They sought refuge from the weather in a rocky cove of a small, uncharted island. It was there that they discovered an ancient treasure fiercely guarded by Ranec Vest, the ghost of a fabled captain from generations past. Ranec challenged Auger to a pistol duel, to which the mortal captain emerged victorious. Bullet-ridden but otherwise still sentient, Ranec relinquished his treasure to Auger's crew, then accepted an invitation to join their ranks.Andromeda Description  Andromeda is stunning at a distance, but she's not quite as pretty up close.Attacks Equippable Items Amazon Items General Items Strategy Strengths Weaknesses Known bugs  NoneChanges scheduled with next versions v. 1.8 v. 1.9f Full Art Vampires  Most of the vampires use powerful dark magic attacks, including many attacks that drain the opponent's life in order to restore their own life. Conversely, they are weak to light magic and tend to have only moderate physical defenses. Unlike the others, Vanessa Voss uses light magic, making her excellent at slaying the other vampires. Their representative color is Black.History  Vampires have roamed the world for ages, a steady line of ancient demons passing their bloodthirst on to their successors - most losing their precious immortality at the hands of those very same successors. One vampire, however, has put an end to this self-destructive cycle. Ancient beyond measure, he has hand-picked his children from among the centuries and bound them to a common cause. For now a hunter with their blood stalks their daylight resting places and their rule over the night is in danger of being broken. Once loners and rebels, the vampires joined together to face this unprecedented threat. The ancient one hoarded many dark, powerful items over the years, talismans that would lend his children vast and ancient power. The younger vampires took them, drinking in their strength like blood, less human with every breath. The vampires stalked out into the night, bringing death to meet their enemies.FAQ  This is a general FAQ for Kongai. If you don't find an answer to your question here, check out Quirks for more in-depth game oddities, or alternatively you can often find a helpful experienced player in Kongai Game Chat Room #1.What starters should I pick?  Don't pick starters yet! The system is a bit weird, so it's actually best to hold on picking starters at first, and instead play some games using a random deck. The odds of winning cards are greatly increased while you have fewer than 10 cards; playing random also helps you learn what cards you like. So for best results, win 10 cards playing random, THEN do the current challenge(s), THEN pick your starters to match the other cards you have. Note that, in order to be able to pick item cards as starters, you must own at least 3 character cards. Within a deck, multiples of the same character card are not allowed; but multiples of the same item card are allowed. As a consequence, picking item cards as starters is more beneficial in the long-run. This will only matter if you'll be playing Kongai for a long time, though: for most players, simply picking a combination of characters and items to match what cards you won will work fine. There are some items which are more overall useful than others (and thus, are more useful to have multiple copies of), Necronomic Tome and Scroll of Inner Focus being the prime examples of such items.I just won a card, but it messes up when I add it to my deck.  Refresh the game. There is a bug that causes cards you just won to not be correctly recognized by the game at first, but a simple refresh fixes the problem.Popo's Slingshot has 30% chance to crit right?  Critical hits do not work that way. The hit chance and crit chance are rolled on the same die. Think of someone rolling a 100-sided die, with 1-50 being a critical hit, 51-60 being a regular hit, and 61-100 being a miss. Therefore there is a 50% it would crit for 60 damage, 10% chance it would hit for 20 damage and 40% chance it would miss entirely for 0 damage.What is the best deck?  The simple answer is that no one deck is the best in all situations and match-ups. Even if certain characters are overpowered (which may not be true), a deck built with them can and will have other decks that counter it. The question you should ask is \"what is the best deck for me?\". As you get familiar with the characters find the ones that work well for you and have the abilities you want. Ask around for suggestions, but to build your best deck you are simply going to have to experiment and tinker until you find it.What do you mean Andromeda sucks?  Andro sucks for many reasons. She loses to the characters she fights the most, for instance, anex/phoebe/auger destroy her. Furthermore, Andro has an a very specific niche of cards she is good against: close monorangers and cards with 0 physical resistance. Andromeda is good against the former because innate+lightning arrow allow range dancing and poking; the latter, because RoA is devestating to them, and hits fleeing. However, dual rangers, and far focused fighters, destroy Andro. Andro has a problem with being able to counterattack far focused characters effectively with her weak nuke. Andromeda has some problems with her attack set as well: trueshot is weak for its energy cost and rain of arrows is ruined by physical resistance. Also, crippling shot is weak and unreliable. Gambling on its 50% proc is not a good strategy. Lightning arrow is Andro's unique attack that makes her very good vs some characters, but it can only be used every other turn (to stop it from being unbalanced). Another issue is that she's a monoranger, but unlike melee monorangers, she's not tanky. Other far focused characters have options at close range that can dmg or prolong their life. Not so with Andromeda.How did my opponent hit me after I cast Shadow Curse 5 times?  Hit rate debuffs do not work that way. If someone has an attack with a 95% chance to hit, for example, you multiply the debuff(s) by this figure -- you do not subtract it. So with a 95% to hit attack, 5 Shadow Curses means you would have a .95 * .8 * .8 * .8 * .8 * .8 = 31.1% chance to hit. (Note that Dodge effects, such as Elusive Feather and Popo's innate ability, ARE subtracted first, not multiplied.)I keep on getting matched with higher ranked opponents! It's not fair!  Believe it or not, highly ranked players hate playing you just as much as you hate playing them! This is because of how the ranking system works; it was based on Halo's system, a game which doesn't have the same luck factor. If you're playing someone 15 ranks above you (the highest possible difference), you stand to win 150 rank points if you win but you'll only lose less than 50 points if you lose. This makes it very difficult for the higher player to win rank points on average from someone of a lower level - in this example they'd need to win 75% of their games just to break even. Winning that often against a decent opponent is very difficult. So, you may be facing a tough opponent, but you will lose very little if you lose and win big if you do win. Also, as ranks increase very rapidly over low levels, there's a good chance that the person 5 ranks above you has only ever played about that many more games of Kongai than you have. If you are facing someone with a very high number of games played (i.e. level) but low skill rank (say, 25 or less), they're probably not very good at all, as anyone that's played a lot and is a good player should've made it to SR28-29 at least (or higher). (See also: next entry.)How good is Skill Rank ?  Skill ranks roughly compare to actual levels of skill as follows:Why can't we trade cards?  Trading cards would be far too abuse-able. Anyone could easily make a new account and earn some quick cards to trade around. Trading will simply never be implemented in Kongai.Something weird happened, I think it's a bug.  The most likely culprit is Phoebe disabling your item with her innate ability. If you're positive this isn't the reason, look at the Kongai Quirks page, which covers most of the existing game bugs. Others bugs may be included on the specific relevant page, such as Boomerang Chakkra.My opponent disconnected when he was about to lose.  Don't worry, he isn't avoiding anything. It still counts as a loss for him and a win for you. All it means is you have to wait a little bit. Feel free to take some satisfaction in causing a ragequit. Also, this behavior gets a lot less common as you get higher in rank. You can still win cards when an opponent quits in this fashion.What's the chances of winning a card?  You have a 3% chance to win a card per ranked game you win, and a 1% chance per unranked game you win. These odds are significantly higher (30% for ranked, 10% unranked) when you have fewer than 10 total cards, which is part of the reason why you shouldn't pick starter cards until you have 10 cards already. You can also get cards by completing the weekly game challenges, or by purchasing them.This game is all about luck!  The game is mostly skill and a bit of luck. If you are losing a lot of games, it's probably because you need more practice. If you lose the occasional game because of luck, you'll win the occasional game because of luck too, and it'll even out in the long run. Simply put, the same people wouldn't be able to consistently keep winning more than the rest if the game was all luck.There should be new cards.  There will be new cards. The new sets are Robots and Witches. Expect them in maybe 2 months or so. (Early August 2010) Pirates kicked off the release in the week of Thur. Apr. 1st, with the pirate set, and strapping first mate. (Pirates, Apr. 1, 2010)Rumiko + Flash Powder is a good idea!  Actually is isn't all that bad. The new Flash Powder increases her ability to evade intercept attempts to 90%. Rumiko does lose some options when she's not using Scroll of Inner Focus. ==Mindreader's Chalice on Higashi is awesome!  No, it really isn't. In almost all cases, Higashi isn't enough of a threat that someone will be trying to switch out at full health anyway, so the difference between 60 and 75 damage is almost always irrelevant.What item should I use with ?  NOTE: The best items list was devised prior to the stats of many items and characters being reworked. For the most part the recommended items are still good choices if not the best. But since the update balance is better so many more items are viable choices for a character than before. See the individual character pages for more item match-up info. Items in brackets are clearly inferior choices, generally only worth picking if you want to use the character but don't have any items listed before the brackets. \"Standard\" choices appear in bold. Other items can be used in a pinch (Totem is at least sort of good on everybody for example), but they should generally be avoided if you have the choice.This guy keeps taking the maximum time allowed and stalling the game.  Welcome to the internet! There's a good chance that he's actually thinking, though he might just be a jerk. Fortunately, Kongai doesn't take your full attention, so you can do other things while you wait - and even at the max time limits the game still goes quickly. As you gain ranks, the number of people who stall or disconnect reduces dramatically.Why would anyone waste money on virtual cards?  While not many people buy cards, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. In no way is \"earning\" cards better than buying them. All you're doing is exchanging money to increase your enjoyment of the game - if you are enjoying Kongai but would enjoy it more with better card access, then buying cards is a perfectly reasonable choice. Compare it with going to a movie -- instead of spending $10 for 2 hours of entertainment you could spend a couple bucks for dozens hours of entertainment. The fact that the cards aren't physical and cannot be resold is truly irrelevant.What does 'proc' means  It's the chance of a special effect happening. For example, Rumiko's Eviscerate has a 100% hit rate and a 70% proc. This means (assuming there aren't other outside factors) that she will always hit with the move and deal damage, but will only stun the enemy 70% of the time. To Hit and To Proc are separate rolls. Some attacks can miss but still proc (like Sadie's Demon Frenzy).Juju's Touch of Doom is cheap!  Not so much, no. It's slow, expensive, and need several turns before it activates. It IS powerful, but it can be interrupted, and even someone with ToD cast on them still has 4 turns alive to try and dish out some extra damage.Tafari is too strong  Tafari basically has an amazingly good innate and one moderately good move. While he can give certain characters trouble, most, in fact, have a good match-up against him - and some, such as Ambrosia, utterly dominate him. While he's a good character, he's far from being too strong. Also note that sometimes it can be a good idea to purposely set off his Leafy Trap, or even to let him Ambush you instead of going far. It's better to take damage to deal some damage than to sit back eating Poison Darts and die without dealing any damage. Characters such as Onimaru, for example, will often want to take the Ambush damage while they're using a strong move like Double Slash.Margo Curie Description  Dissatisfied with the potency of over-the-counter potions, Margo transformed her basement into a bathtub-brewing laboratory.Attacks Equippable Items Witches Items General Items Strategy Strengths Weaknesses Known bugs  None.Changes scheduled with next versions Version Number  None.Full Art Villagers  Cards affiliated with Villagers.

Their representative color is Dark Khaki/Brown.History  The world is an old place, and it is within the deep island jungles that the oldest and darkest of its secrets are tended. A tribe of hunters and lorekeepers has protected the wisdom of the earth since its creation, fighting tirelessly against the modern world that claws at their sanctuary. But progress, like water, wears on even the most powerful of structures. It is a battle the tribe is losing. With a solemn decree and a savage war cry, the tribe decided to leave the shelter of their island and take the fight to the bright, plastic world encroaching on their solitude. Before leaving, the wisest of them, knowing that the strength that was theirs inside the forest would fade as they left its borders, fashioned totems and weapons from the spirit of the jungle. Even the youngest of them knew what a sacrifice the island had made in giving these objects of power to the villagers. It would be defenseless until their return. The old world had declared war on the new.Helene Description  Helene dazzles at close range with her physical attacks, armor, and \"assets\", but don't try a long-distance relationship.Attacks Equippable Items Amazon Items General Items Strategy General Use  Frenzied Strikes and Sword Slash are Helene's main moves. Frenzied Strikes should only be used if it will be much more effective than Sword Slash, IE if it kills the enemy in 2 turns rather than 3. This is because of Sword Slash's ability to regenerate Helene's energy. Because Helene's moves cost a lot to use, Sword Slash is almost always better to use than Frenzied Strikes.Strengths Weaknesses Known bugs  NoneChanges scheduled with next versions v. 1.8 Full Art Knight Bestor Description  After a great warrior noticed Bestor snacking on flaming s'mores as a child, he was trained to master the burning arts.Attacks Equippable Items Knight Items General Items Strategy General Use  Bestor excels at close range but can switch to a supporting role at far if necessary, with a cheap deck hitting move and a crit buff.Strengths Weaknesses Known bugs  NoneFull Art Sophie Merovingian Description  A master of fire and shadow, Sophie can deal massive steady damage given a bit of setup time.Attacks Equippable Items Witches Items General Items Strategy General Use  Sophie should switch in against a character who is either low on energy or low-velocity (ideally both) and either range dance with her DOT damage moves or spam Circle of Shadows up close to destroy the bench. Sophie should be used relatively early in the game as her attacks take time to reach their full effects, while CoS reduces in effectiveness drastically if there are less opponents on the bench (or if there is a knight with Emblem on it) At far, Shadow Word: Pain does more damage overall for a low energy cost, but takes more time for its full effect and is a safer choice. Glyph of Fire can also be used at far and although it does less damage overall, it also takes less time to reach its full 32 damage and can scare an opponent into trying to range-fight with you rather than try to get up close as they might eat a Consume Glyph. At close, Circle of Shadows should be your move of choice as it deals surprising damage over enough time, hits fleeing and is free after the 1st attempt. However, if the opponent can threaten a kill, you may wish to throw a Glyph of Fire up on the first round. From then, you can either Consume Glyph or continue Circle of Shadows (if you think he will switch, which will give you a free turn)Strengths Weaknesses Known bugs  None.Changes scheduled with next versions  None.Full Art Gorbax-Mark 2 Description  Extremely powerful yet somewhat clumsy, Gorbax must lock on to targets before unleashing his arsenal with any reliable accuracy.Attacks Equippable Items Robot Items General Items Strategy Strengths Weaknesses Known Bugs  None.Full Art B9 Description  Originally developed by Child Protective Services, B9 doubles as an oddly effective combat machine.Attacks Equippable Items Robot Items General Items Strategy Strengths Weaknesses Trivia Full Art Angelan Series D Description  A stealthed, deadly, unpredictable killing machine, Angelan just might be behind you RIGHT NOW!Attacks Equippable Items Robot Items General Items Strategy Strengths Weaknesses Known Bugs \u00a0References Full Art Cards  All Cards and Card Groups.", "Super Mario Fanon": "Super Mario Fanon Wario  Wario is Waluigi's big brother.

He doesn't look very different either except for his black mustache. He has blue eyes and brown hair. In Mario's Adventure, Mario and Luigi both have black hair. In the even older game Super Mario Bros 2., Mario has a brown mustache, brown overalls, and a red shirt. But all in all, Mario hasn't changed much in nearly three decades. But his fighting style has indeed changed. Mario's fighting abilities were punching and kicking. But now, his abilities are like Star spins, or other powers that can be granted. His first appearance still has his classic hat, but now gives him a red t-shirt with a coin on it, blue overalls, brown sneakers, and white golf gloves.

After fighting off an entire leigon of Koopa Troopas and sewer creatures, Mario and Luigi fell down Warp Pipes which warped them to the Mushroom Kingdom in the Grand Finale Galaxy in the Mushroom Universe. Mario and Luigi defeated Goombas, Koopa Troopas, and even Bowser himself before rescuing Princess Toadstool. Mario quickly fell unconcious, and dreamed he went to Subcon. In Subcon, he battled the 8-Bits and their leader Wart along with Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool (along with Wario and Waluigi in new version). After traveling through the different worlds, the gang finally made it to the sky where Wart's foretress was located. They then engaged in battle with the Tyrant Wart. In the middle of the fight, Mario notices a nearby crop of vegetables. Mario gets an idea and tells his friends the plan. They grabbed the vegetables and used them to choke Wart. Mario then woke up and went to the Mushroom Kingdom along with Princess Peach, Luigi, and Toad (along with Wario and Waluigi in new version). 1 year later, Bowser created the Koopa kids, and attacked the Mushroom World. Mario then had to travel the seven Worlds of the location and save their rulers, all of whom have been turned into animals. But eventualy, Mario reached Dark Land and entered Bowser's Castle. There he faced the Koopa King in battle. Every time Bowser jumped, he would destroy part of the brick floor below him. After a while of dodging fireballs and avoiding being squashed, Bowser destroyed the last Brick and fell. Mario opened the door at the other end of the chamber and found Princess Peach in a room. 3 years later, Mario and his friends went on a vacation to Dinosaur island. Everyone assumed Bowser was dead, but while they were there, Bowser captured the princess yet again! This time, Mario stayed in the same world, but traveled to different areas such as Donut Plains, IceCream cave, and the Forest of Ilusion. After a long journey, Mario made it to Bowser's Castle. When Mario entered, he saw three doors, each labeled \"1\",\"2\", and \"3\". Every time Mario chose a door, it always lead to a room with a challenge inside. After many close calls and lots of enemies, Mario reached the top of the castle. There he fought Bowser on his Koopa Clown Car. Bowser kept on throwing Toys at the hero and Mario threw them back. After the sixth thrown toy, Bowser fell of his copter along with Peach who unlike Bowser, landed safely on the roof. 4 months later, Mario built a house so he wouldn't have to live in Peach's castle. Just as he was addig the finishing touches, a Toad burst through the door and told Mario the Princess has been captured. Mario then rushed to the rescue and arrived 1 month earlier! When he arrived, a small legion of Bowser's newest infantry was waiting for him. However, Mario had been practicing his punch awhile and not even the baddies tough armor could stop it! 1 year later, Peach invited Mario to attend her birthday. After a decently long walk, Mario arrives at the Castle. But when Mario enters the door, he hears Bowser's voice saying he had captured the Princess. At first, Mario thinks he his message was \"just a childish prank\". But then a Toad appeared out of another door and told Mario that what he said was true. Every Toad along with Toadstool, were put apon a spell that trapped them inside the paintings. Toadster was the only one that survived the onslaught. Mario then realizes the seriousness of the event and begins collecting power stars in places such as Bob-omb Battlefield, Whomp's fortress, and Cool,cool Mountain to free the Toads from their prisons. Once Mario collected 123 stars, he journeyed to Bowser's last obstacle course where he battled Goombas, the Thwomps, and many more baddies. He finally made it to Bowser's arena. There he challenged the Koopa King and won. He grabbed the last power star and flew home where he freed everyone from their prisons. Friends/family: Luigi-brother.

Fawful-bitter enemy.Personality:  Mario is somewhat of an everyman, with no distinct personality. He is usually heroic, although there have been a few examples in the section bellow. Mario is brave and fearless, having been in more dangerous situations than any other character in HISTORY. Mario is a skilled combatant, having fought millions of beings, and always seeming to come out on top. However Mario is reckless, preferring to fight rather than ask questions. Mario is a caring brother, and the hero of the mushroom kingdom. Despite these good qualities, Mario is not afraid to kill to get what he wants, which has been seen in the millions of members of Bowser's Army Mario has killed. ==\n Rivalry with Harold the Hero: == Mario has always been nearly sadistic to Harold the Hero. For example, in Harold's game, Mario blows up his house (With Harold inside it) and kidnapped his dog, forcing Harold to go and save his dog. This adds a darker aspect to Mario's personality.Appearences Super Mario Moose  Mario appears in Super Mario Moose as the main hero and one of the playable characters.Bowser's Story  Mario appears in Bowser's Story as the main villain and final boss.Mario All-Star Sluggers  Mario appears in Mario All-Star Sluggers is a team captain.

You're very good! Are you going to the Dune Ruins? -Yoshi, Yoshi's Biggest Death Day Yoshi is a dinosaur creature appearing in a lot of Mario games. He is good friends with Mario. They say that he is also known as God in the Mushroom Kingdom.Background  Yoshi made his debut in Super Mario World. Contrary to popular belief, Yoshi was, in fact, NOT born on Yoshi's Island. His egg was laid in the jungles of an unknown distant land by a green yoshi named \"Yoshika\". His egg was found by a pig from Glitzville, and he took the egg back to his hotdog stand, because Jungle Yoshi eggs are a delicacy in the town of Glitzville. But, luckily for Yoshi, Mario (Or \"Gonzales\" as he's known in Glitzville.) was able to save him from the pig chef. Yoshi's egg hatched in the locker room of the Glitzpit, and him and Mario became a team. They battled thier way to the top, even defeating the champion of the Glitzpit, Rawk Hawk. Later, they together defeated the dreaded Shadow Queen and saved the world from destruction. After this, Yoshi went back to the Glitzpit to keep on defending his title. But after many years of fighting, he retired and moved to Rouge Port. After 3 years of living there, People began to look suprised when they saw Yoshi. Apperantly, Rawk Hawk had spread a terrible rumor saying that Yoshi had died. Yoshi wanted revenge badly, so he murdered the Rawk and spent the next 5 years of his life wandering the world alone. Eventually, he found a place called Yoshi's Island. The Elder of the people, Eldyosh, adopted Yoshi as his third son. Yoshi became the brother of Nick the red yoshi and Darko the blue yoshi. 3 years later, a terrible war broke out between the Koopa people and the Mushroom people. The yoshis sided with the Mushroom Kingdom. Eldyosh led the yoshi army, along with his two brothers, Yesh the blue yoshi and Yoshk the red yoshi. Yesh betrayed them and sided with Bowser. Yosk continued to fight, but was eventually killed. His soul was preserved in what is now the great Yoshi Sword. The war ended, and the Mushroomites just barely claimed victory. Since Eldyosh would never see his brothers again, he broke up the brotherly Triforce that he and his brothers held dear, and he gave the three shards to his children. They became the great Yoshi Dietys, and swore to protect the land from all evildoers. Darka, the terribly evil black yoshi, became angry at this and attempted to plunge the island into the ocean. But Yoshi and his brothers defeated Darka and saved the island. Yoshi now lives peacefully on the island, with his wife Yushi and his son Yoshiko. He has befriended other yoshis over the years, like Dan the yellow yoshi and Alek the pale blue yoshi. He still has many adventures. When he needs to save the world, not only do his brothers help, but he can count on Alek and Dan to help him too. His father, Eldyosh, is still alive to this day, and is presumed to now be 1005 years old. After going to the treehouse, Yoshi will bump, but it's Yesh's one. Yesh tells Yoshi about attacking the Yoshi's Island. Then, Yoshi and Yesh will go into the boat, and they go into the Dune Ruins, a desert-themed world. Yoshi has to fight Prince Goombe using Yesh's steel gun. After 100 quickscopes, Yoshi will throw the gun into Yesh, and quickscoped Yoshi.Abilities  Yoshi can flutter jump, shoot eggs and ground pound.Appearances Mario All-Star Sluggers  Yoshi and different colors of himself appear in Mario All-Star Sluggers.

His home is hidden, and he is brothers with Builderman.Places Created Robloxia  Robloxia, also known as Blox, is the homeworld of the Humans and, in ancient times, five other sentient races. It was comprised of three continents: Ro (home of the Robloxian Humans, Noobish Humans, Dwarves, Treefolk, and Elves), Kor (home of the Korbloxian Humans), and Gob (home of the Goblins and Orcs). There were also a number of large islands including Redcliff (colonized by Robloxians) and Noobland (colonized by the Noobs). Robloxia's core was home to a civilization of ghosts and undead Humans that were transported there by Korbloxian necromancers, who intended to one day use the undead army to conquer Robloxia.History  Robloxia was initially home to six races: the Robloxians, the Orcs, the Goblins, the Elves, the Dwarves, and the mystical Treefolk. Following a massive war between these races, the Robloxians were the last left standing. Following this event a civil war broke out between four Human nations: the Robloxians, the Noobs, the Korbloxians, and the Kingdom of Redcliff. It was during this civil war that an alien race known as the Overseers invaded Robloxia, though were soon driven off-world in the fighting. While the Korbloxians and Redclifflings were driven to extinction in the subsequent Blox Crusades and the Great Magic War, the Noobs remained a semi-autonomous nation as a vassal of the Kingdom of Robloxia. Another civil war occurred between three political factions known as the Royalists, the Imperialists, and the Federalists. The Federalists and Imperialists united to form the Imperial Robloxian Federation, while the Royalists reformed the Kingdom into the Robloxian Republic; this event ushered in the Modern Era. A number of independent nations continued to exist on Kor and a number of outlying islands, though conflicts between these nations and the Republic were few and far between for the following decades. The most notable conflict of the Modern Era was the World War, which involved every nation, clan, and city-state on Robloxia. The Noob Insurgencies also occurred during this time. Soon after the Republic's foundation, the planet was visited by an advanced alien race - possibly a descendant of the Overseers - who provided the Robloxians with technology far more advanced than their own. This resulted in the Great Space Colonization, in which numerous Robloxian clans established colonies on other worlds and formed interstellar empires including the Sky Clan, the Vaktovian Empire, the Immortal Sovereignty, the Moon Legion, the Robine, the Nighthawk Imperium, the Prime Legion, the Astric Imperial, the Royal Invictus, the Galactic Empire, the Avarian Confederation, the Cobalt Nation, the Veloxic Empire, Team Domino, Evictus, among many others. These colonial empires resulted in the Robloxians becoming the most numerous and powerful race in the galaxy.Roblox Logo.png Flywish  Hi I am the founder of here.

Recommended Cards: Kizan Kagekijeux jeux  \u00a9 All Rights Reserved. jeux jeux [32] Kagemusha Leg-Enishi Hand\u00a0 etc etcTele dad  This deck resolves around the card \"Dark Armed Dragon\" and the card \"Emergency Teleport\". This deck has the power to eliminate a card on the field by removing a Dark card from the graveyard. The emergency teleport summons \"Krebons\" or \"Psycic Commander\". Power: DAD (dark armed dragon) has 2800 atk strengh, also the numerous synchros in this deck have impressive atk strengh. Draw: Allure of Darkness, draw 2 cards hen remove a Dark card in your hand from play. Drawbacks: This deck needs to use the graveyard and to remove cards from play. \"Imperial Iron Wall\" and the Gravekeeper's \"Necrovalley\" can realy screw up this deck as they prevent both graveyard effects and removing cards from play. This deck abviously needs alot of Dark cards to run. Possibly the single best deck in the current \"Meta\".Lightsworn  Lightsworn are a series of monsters introduced in the \"Light of Destruction\" booster set, with extra support added in \"The Duelist Genesis\". Their \"theme\" is sending cards from the top of their owners deck to the grave to activate effects. \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast\" is an example of a lightsworn card that's effect activates when it is sent from the deck to the graveyard, in this case, \"Wulf is \"Special Summoned\" to the field. Power: Lightsworns have decent atttack strengh, with \"Wulf, Lightsworn Beast\" being a 2100 atk monster that is special summoned. Also they have Judgement Dragon, a 3000 atk monster that, by paying 1000 life points, destroys all other cards on the field. Draw: Lightsworns have \"Solar Recharge\", discard a lightsworn, draw 2 cards and then send the top 2 cards of your deck to the graveyard. Drawbacks: In one word, decking out. A lightsworn duelist must be careful to win fast, or the milling abilities of the lightsworn turn full circle and you run out of cards in your deck. Lightsworns are among one of the best decks in the current \"Meta\". References: My own personal knowledge and www.yugioh.wikia.comGravekeepers  The Gravekeepers are an anti-meta deck that revolves around removing the ability for the opponent to use their graveyards, a thing almost all meta decks require. The main card \"Necrovally\" stops either player from using the graveyards, this allows them to make powerful creatures to win.Crystal Beast Decks Dark Creator Deck S See also Templates  There are many templates in use in Yugioh Meta-Decks Wiki; these are only a subset, representing some of the most important and commonly used ones.

Each effect changes Madotsuki's appearance and some provide special abilities.\n Gathering all 24 effects is considered to be the primary objective of the game, and only when all effects have been gathered can the player see the game's finale by leaving them all in The Nexus and waking up. The effects are scattered throughout the dream world, and some are more easily found than others. Some are found by touching particular objects whereas others are received from interacting with characters.\n While none of the effects are mandatory to progress through the game, many events and locations are unreachable without them. They can be collected in almost any order, except for the 'Poop hair' effect, which requires either the Yuki-onna or Umbrella effects. It is also recommended to get the Lamp effect before attempting to get the Knife or Witch effects, which require traversing dark areas. Descriptions and names on this article are given in the order of fan translation first, official translation second.Effects Frog (\u304b\u3048\u308b\uff09  Become a frog / Transform into a frog.

Practical Uses: Notes: In most cases, this allows you to move characters out of your way without using the Knife Effect to kill them. This may be in tune with the Maneki-Neko being loosely associated with Gyuanin, who is revered in Japan as Kannon (\u89b3\u97f3), the goddess of mercy and compassion.Lamp \uff08\u3067\u3093\u3068\u3046\uff09  Become a lamp / Change into a lamp.

Appearance: None Passive Effect: None Action: (Equip) A basic tutorial on how to play the game Location: Madotsuki starts with this effect Practical Uses: Learning how the game worksPseudo-effects  These are actions that work like effects, but are not added to Madotsuki's inventory and are not required to finish the game.Chair  The chair in Madotsuki's dream room can be ridden when Madotsuki sits on it then pulls the chair away. Instead of writing in her diary, sitting at the desk and pressing Z (facing the desk) will let Madotsuki scoot the chair around her bedroom. She can ride the chair to almost anywhere in the dream world (albeit very slowly), but will not be able to get off it until she returns it to her desk.Crick in the Neck  The only involuntary effect, Madotsuki has a random chance of waking up with a crick in her neck. She will constantly be looking left. As she does with no effect, pressing 1 will cause her to sit down. She is unable to write in her diary or play NASU. Going back to sleep and waking up again should solve the problem. Madotsuki will not dream that she has a crick in her neck, and yet there is a matching FC world sprite.Effect Glitches Speed Glitch  A useful glitch that quadruples Madotsuki's walking speed. Although Madotsuki will appear as her normal sprite (except in the FC world), the glitch will be active. The bicycle is the most commonly used effect for this, as it allows for quadruple speed. The Speed Glitch is an oversight caused by allowing the player to use the menu in the chair. Instructions The glitch will now be active. The effect will disappear if you equip any effects. Madotsuki will sit if 1 is pressed, but the other action will happen as well (e.g. with the bike, the bell noise will play).Hyperspeed Glitch  A related glitch that is slightly more complicated, but allows the effect to stack allowing for movement eight times faster than the walking speed, which is equal to that of the Candle World Toriningen. InstructionsNoclip Glitch  Disables most collision, allowing Madotsuki to walk through objects and walls. Instructions This will allow Madotsuki to walk through anything with any effect equipped, however some loading zones don't trigger.Broken Instructions  A somewhat convoluted glitch that allows you to be able to move, and enter a new area while the instructions are open which leads to a variety of glitches. InstructionsSub Glitches  Invisible Madotsuki: This glitch is a side effect of broken instructions, and requires no extra setup beyond what's listed above. BGM storage: Another side effect of broken instructions. The way this one works is that when you open the instructions the music stops, but it starts again after you close it. If you close the instructions in a different area it will take the music from wherever you opened the instructions and play that. This is because the game still has it stored. Glitched movement: Glitched movement is a glitch that occurs when you close the instructions while sitting down. Your movement will be cycling between 4 of the sitting animation sprites. Left is the first sprite and then it continues in order clockwise. Broken save: This is a glitch that makes a save file unplayable. To do this glitch do broken instructions and wake up with the instructions. Press 1 so you are sitting, then press Z to reopen the instructions. This will give you glitched movement. If you save with glitched movement your save will be unplayable. Broken witch event: If you do broken instructions and close the instructions in the witch event the game will put you in the center of the witch event where you can work around. This works because the game stores Madotsuki when you open the instructions, so if you close the instructions in the witch event the game will think it needs to put you back into the game in the same way you were when you opened the instructions. This causes there to be two Madotsukis you control at the same time. As well as enables menu use. Video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIPXeCRhY2s&t=1sUnused effects  These are effects that exist in the sprite sheets and have limited handling in the game's coding, but are not accessible in the game. These may be added in a future version of Yume Nikki.Blindfold  Appearance: Madotsuki wears a black blindfold. Speculation: Some kind of effect that affects what Madotsuki can (or can't) see. This sprite was used in Yume Nikki 3d (a Yume Nikki fan game).Grayscale  Appearance: Madotsuki appears in monochrome. Speculation: It's possible this was intended to be the appearance Madotsuki takes on in the White Desert, as there is no counterpart FC world sprite. If this is the case, then it's likely that it was dropped since it could cause confusion as to whether the White Desert was really white, or whether the effect was a result of a problem with the player's perception of it (as is the case with old monochrome photos).\n Allowing Madotsuki to retain her hues makes it clear that the player's vision is normal and that the world is white. Another idea is that this is an effect that you get from the White Desert that makes Madotsuki (And possibly the room you are in) monochrome. Do note that this sprite\u00a0is in fact used for Madotsuki's Ghost.Will o' the Wisp  Appearance: Madotsuki transforms into a flame-like spirit wearing the Triangle Kerchief. Speculation: A possible alternate form considered for the 'ghost form' of the Triangle Kerchief, as spirits are commonly depicted as blue wisps in Japanese folklore (They're called \"Hitodama\" [\u2600\u4eba\u9b42, \u3072\u3068\u3060\u307e]). Note that the sprites below the mugshot have (to date) only been found in version 0.04, but are still unused in that version. It appears that it would have been able to change colors.List of Characters  Madotsuki meets many characters in her dreams, ranging from \"ordinary\" humans and animals to bizarre monstrous creatures. Regardless their appearance, none mean harm if one does neither.\n The strange behaviour and expressions of the characters in Yume Nikki seem to exhibit certain personality traits. They influence a lot of the atmosphere of the game, even if they don't actually do much at all. Many characters play a particular role in the game. Some give Madotsuki effects when she interacts with them whereas others may teleport her to different places. Others may ignore Madotsuki completely and simply loiter in the world of her dreams. Note: Certain characters, such as\u00a0Madotsuki, Monoe, and Monoko, have official names. These characters also have their official name listed.\u00a0All other dream characters were named by the fan community. (See talk page).Player Characters Madotsuki Nasu Effect NPCs  These characters give effects when interacted with, although not all effects are received from characters.\n Listed in order of the effects on the menu screen.Non-Effect NPCs  These characters do not give effects when interacted with. Listed in alphabetical order.Decorative Characters  These are unusually large characters that do not roam around like the NPCs. Most are made up of background graphics and have limited or no responses to Madotsuki's effects. Listed in alphabetical order.List of Locations  Yume Nikki has many interconnected locations that vary wildly in theme and size. They house the 24 effects also may also contain events. The dream world is an intricate labyrinth of openly looping regions and obscure pathways, but most regions of the game can be considered as part of an individual 'world' with connections to other worlds. This is a list of all the central worlds of Yume Nikki. Note that in this wiki, the commonly-accepted fan names are used so that they are easier to find, although each area has an official name that is also listed (which are the map names when viewing the game in RPG Maker).The Real World Madotsuki's Room The Original Locations The Nexus Yume Nikki  Yume Nikki (\u3086\u3081\u306b\u3063\u304d) (pronounced /ju\u02d0me nikki/) is a 32-Bit freeware game created by Kikiyama, a mysterious Japanese game designer. The game was made using RPG Maker 2003. The game is regarded as one of the most original applications of RPG Maker 2003, and the start of a possible new genre of games. It was initially released on June 26, 2004 (under version 0.00), and received numerous updates until October 1, 2007, when version 0.10 was released. \"Yume Nikki\" means \"Dream Diary\" in Japanese (and thus the word can be written as \u5922\u65e5\u8a18, although the title is normally in hiragana), and the game follows a young girl named Madotsuki as she dreams. The goal is to seek out and acquire all 24 'Effects'. The game otherwise has no plot, and nearly the entire game is left up to speculation. Yume Nikki was added to the Playism distribution platform on February 12, 2012 under version 0.10a. This was followed up by an official English localization releasing worldwide on July 13, 2012. Kikiyama built version 0.10a on October 6, 2007 to incorporate bug fixes for version 0.10 that were released in separate patch titled Yumesyuusei. The download link on their website was never replaced to host version 0.10a, leaving its distribution to AGM Playism. On the 9th of January 2018, it was released on Steam for free by AGM Playism and Kadokawa. Note to Windows Users: You may need a good file archiver to extract some of the below games. Please consider using 7-zip. Locale Emulator is also useful for the games only available in Japanese.Games Yume Nikki Fangames (Traditional)  Check out the Yume Nikki Fangames Wiki for more specific information. An extensive list of fan-made Yume Nikki games can be found here.Yume 2kki .flow Miserere v1.02x Uboachan Community Project \"Solitude\" (Not Released) LCDDEM v0.030 Fangames (Original) Dream vs. Dream (Fighting game) Yume Nikki Half-Life Mod Yume Nikki Soul Dream v2.1b Yume Nikki Gensou Game Mods Alternate Endings Madotsuki  Madotsuki (\u7a93\u4ed8\u304d, lit. windowed) (pronounced /m\u0251\u02c8d\u0252tsu\u02d0.ki\u02d0/) is the playable protagonist of\u00a0Yume Nikki. She is one of the characters in Yume Nikki with an established name, since playable characters require a name for the menu screen in RPG Maker games. As with virtually everything else in the game, Madotsuki's identity and life are a mystery. Only what can be seen in-game can be considered canon, although there are many varying interpretations of her. Although there is no indication nor canonicity of age given in the game, she is often depicted as a young person.Name  The word \"Madotsuki\" means \"windowed\" (as in a box or envelope) or \"aperture\". The name appears in the menu as the name of the player character, and (in the Japanese original version) is one of the two instances of kanji writing in the game. Nearly all the text in the game\u2014the game menus, instructions, the \"menu has changed\" notice, NASU, and even the title screen of the game\u2014is written using the hiragana alphabet. The only other time kanji is used is for the message that appears when sitting in Madotsuki's desk chair in the dream world. 'Madotsuki' is not a word used as a name in Japan\u2014in fact, it may not even be her true name at all. It could be thought of as being a metaphor; more a description of the character as the 'player's window into the dream world' rather than a literal name. It could also be a way to preserve the game's theme of loneliness by giving the character a functional, dehumanizing name, rather than a personal name. It is similar to the colloquial Japanese term for 'windower', a person who spends a long time looking out the window; that is, a daydreamer. It has been noted that when you reverse her romaji name (Madotuki in Kunrei-shiki romanization), it becomes Ikutodam: \u884c\u304f\u3068\u99c4\u76ee or \u884c\u304f\u3068\u30c0\u30e1 (\"iku to dame\"), a commonly used phrase that means \"it is useless to go/leave.\" This may be a coincidence.Real Life  Madotsuki doesn't have much to do in her room. Her television set doesn't receive any channels, so she can only use it to play a single Famicom game, NASU. She can go outside on the balcony, but the balcony itself must be rather high as her view always seems to be blocked by fog.Madotsuki's Dreams  Elements in Madotsuki's dream world seem to hint at her mental or emotional state. Some Effects seem to show her unhappiness. The knife, in particular, appears to hint at her misery. However, the player ultimately controls Madotsuki\u2014it is unknown whether she would use the knife on her own or not. Since many dreams are disturbing when shared, Madotsuki may just be a typical lucid dreamer trying to find a release from her sadness by exploiting her dreams for fun and self-discovery.Fan Speculation  See the Theories page for theories regarding Madotsuki and Yume Nikki in general.Trivia Poniko  Poniko (\u30dd\u30cb\u5b50, \"Ponytail girl\") is a character that appears in Madotsuki's dream. Her house is found in The Pink Sea, which is accessed by diving into a pool located in an igloo in the Snow World.Description  Poniko is a blonde girl with a ponytail, green shirt, a brown skirt and red shoes. In the game, she has either open blue eyes which are constantly looking to her left side (giving a somewhat annoyed expression), or her eyes are closed, crying blue teardrops. In the manga her design is interpreted to have open eyes. She lives alone in a single room, like Madotsuki herself. She may prefer solitude, as she is located in one of the deeper dream locations and is the only NPC present in The Pink Sea.Interaction  Poniko does not seem to pay any attention to Madotsuki when entering and exploring her room. She only reacts to the Knife Effect, which makes her flee, and the Cat effect, which draws her towards Madotsuki. Most NPCs react similarly to these Effects. At her house there is nothing to interact with except a light switch. There is a 1/64 chance that Poniko will change into Uboa after flicking on and off the lights.Trivia Seccom Masada-sensei  Sentimental Komuro Michael Sakamoto Dada-sensei (\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u5c0f\u5ba4\u30de\u30a4\u30b1\u30eb\u5742\u672c\u30c0\u30c0\u5148\u751f) (or simply Masada, or Seccom Masada) is a character found in Madotsuki's dreams. He is found by sleeping in any one of a number of beds present in the dream world, going down the staircase, walking past the elevator, and using either the Umbrella or Yuki-onna effect to extinguish the fire.Appearance  Masada is a humanoid NPC who appears to be wearing a black suit or jumpsuit. He has pale skin and medium-length black hair, and his eyes point in two different directions (from a front view, his left eye is pointing up, and his right eye is pointing down.)Description  He is found in a monochromatic spaceship, apparently the pilot. He stands next to a large organ. He slowly turns to all of his four directions in no specific pattern. When Madotsuki interacts with him, he makes a trilling noise, similar to the sound Super Mario makes when he loses a life. When interacting with him during the Spaceship crash event he will make a higher-pitched sound. He will also spin around much faster, thus appearing to be panicking. When the ship lands on Mars, his 'voice' is much more low-pitched, possibly expressing remorse or relief. When the Knife is equipped, he backs away from you. You can use this or his normal reaction to the Cat Effect to play the piano key he is otherwise standing in front of.Name  As for most characters of Yume Nikki the names are created by fans. \"Sekomu/Seccom Masada-sensei\" (\u30bb\u30b3\u30e0\u30de\u30b5\u30c0\u5148\u751f) is a shortened combination of the full given name\n\"Sentimental Komuro Michael Sakamoto Dada-sensei\" \"Seccom\" is a result of an English-langage simplification of \"Sekomu.\"Trivia Sound Files  Sound Files associated with Seccom Masada-sensei. Soundtrack associated with Seccom Masada-sensei. Repetitive noise warning with the second track.Hell  \"Hell\" is the name given to one of the largest areas in the game, also known as The Red Maze.Point of Interest  It is one of the most significant deeper locations in the dream world. Many routes from The Nexus will eventually lead here, allowing for many connections between remote areas. There are even some locations that are only reachable by finding its one entrance through this maze. Entry to Hell is almost always achieved by locating one of the strange geometric NPCs that can be found in various 'dead end' passages deep inside certain original locations. Some Toriningen may also send Madotsuki into isolated spots between pathways here. The navigational difficulties created by the intricacy of the maze are compounded by a number of lunatic Toriningen wandering the narrow passages. Many of the paths appear similar in shape to those elsewhere in the maze, which can be disorienting - even with the benefit of a map. A similar area, known as Mini Hell can be found in The Bed Room of the Number World.Trivia Connections Monoko  Monoko (\u30e2\u30ce\u5b50, \"monochromatic girl\") is a character in the White Desert. She appears to be a black and white girl with cross-shaped eyes and an open mouth. Her name comes from the Picture/\u30e2\u30ce\u5b50.xyz file from the game, and is thus one of the three characters with an official name other than Madotsuki and Monoe. Her usual appearance only remains until you use the Stoplight effect on her. She immediately stops moving and changes into a different form: She now has five arms, one of which sprouts out of the top of her head; her stomach grows what seems to be a bloodless wound or vortex; and her left eye and mouth begin to melt or dribble, which is usually interpreted as her crying and drooling. If you run into Monoko while she is in this form, a Full-screen Event shows a detailed picture of Monoko bouncing, spinning and zooming in and out on the screen to a beat similar of Kalimba music (BGM_022).Trivia KyuuKyuu-kun  KyuuKyuu-kun (\u30ad\u30e5\u30c3\u30ad\u30e5\u541b, \u30ad\u30e5\u30c3\u30ad\u30e5\u304f\u3093, Kyukkyu-kun) (named after the Japanese onomatopoeia of the rubbing noise, exact spelling varies) is a NPC character that can be found next to the Stairway, which can be reached from the Number World. Kyuukyuu-kun is a tall, constantly smiling worm-like creature whose two black eyes have googly red pupils. Its body is multi-coloured, with red being the dominant colour. It is shown with a small arm that slightly rubs up and down the handrail of the stairs. They can be accessed by stabbing an unhappy-looking Zippertile with the Knife effect. This method of entering The Stairway and the fact that the FACE event occurs when progressing further creates a certain discord with Kyuukyuu-kun being a smiling character. KyuuKyuu-Kun rubs the pole faster if you equip the Knife effect, similarly to how other NPCs flee or move around when you equip the Knife. It also stops rubbing the handrail when you use the Stoplight on red.Trivia Events  When exploring the dream world, Madotsuki will occasionally come across strange occurrences or activities, known as 'Events'. These make up most of the memorable content of the game and provide intriguing perspectives of the dream world. Many theories are developed to attempt to explain what the events represent, if anything. Some events happen as a result of a specific trigger (E.g. Madotsuki interacting with an object, such as the TV in her dream bedroom), whereas others (such as Uboa or Takofuusen) occur on a random chance when a certain action is performed.Gameplay Events \u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042  Location: The Number World Prompt: Trigger. Stab the Toriningen in the bed room with the Knife effect to turn her 'lunatic', then allow her to catch you. You will be randomly transported to one of two different enclosed spaces where the event occurs, with an equal chance of either. Description: The tile on the floor will either have a red eye or '\u3042' character (The alphabetical character for \"A\" in hiragana). Either will cause the whole floor to become flooded with that symbol once stepped on.Crick in the Neck  Location: Madotsuki's Room Prompt: Random Chance.\u00a01/64 chance of occurring\u00a0when Madotsuki wakes up. Description: Occasionally, when Madotsuki gets out of bed she will have a 'crick' in her neck, causing her head to be constantly turned to the left. In this state, she is unable to write in her diary or play NASU, and has no choice but to go back to sleep. The effect will wear off when she falls asleep again.The Falling Man  Location: The Stairway to the Sky in The Wilderness that leads to the Sky Garden. Prompt: Random Chance. Determined when Madotsuki sets foot on the Stairway to the Sky. Description: An object resembling a person appears in the sky in the distance. It spins as if falling downward, however the figure moves in a circular motion and never actually hits the ground. There is an extremely low chance of witnessing two 'falling men' at once. Video of an encounter with two Falling Men, achieved through hacking.Famicom Glitch  Location: The empty basement room of the dungeon in FC World A. Prompt: Random Chance. 1/3 chance of availability, determined when Madotsuki falls asleep. In the FC World Dungeon, travel to the deepest room. Unlike the others, this room is fully lit. Stand in the top-left corner of the room and interact with the west wall. Description: When interacted with, the wall tile produces a text box with a 'typing' sound like the Lizardmen, but no text is shown. Doing this repeatedly gradually causes the room to corrupt, until the game eventually 'crashes' with a nasty stuttering sound. This causes Madotsuki to wake up. Note that despite the event name, this is not an actual glitch and is intentionally programmed to happen. Video. This event is possibly a homage to two glitches found in Earthbound, the game which the FC Worlds seem to be based on:Melting Madotsuki  Location: The Blazing Corridor, in The Underground World Prompt: Random Chance. 1/5, Dependent on the random allocation of the Bed in the dream world which takes you to The Staircase of Hands. The first step for witnessing this event is to go to the Snow World and become a snowman using the Hat and Scarf effect. Next, find the bed and sleep in it as a snowman. If it does not take you to the Staircase of Hands, you must pinch yourself awake and try again. Once you have arrived in the Underground World, stand as close as you can to the fire in the Blazing Corridor. Description: Once You have arrived at the fire as a snowman, all you must do is wait as Madotsuki slowly melts away. Once completely melted, she cannot move and must return to the normal hat and scarf form. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply transform using the Yuki-onna snow as that does not cease after becoming a snowman, so it will persist in the Underground World and douse the fire. It is for this reason that the Snow World snowfall must be used.NASU  Location: Madotsuki's Room Prompt: Trigger. Interact with the Famicom in Madotsuki's Bedroom. Description: The most extensive event, NASU is a Famicom-style minigame, playable in Madotsuki's Room. In this game, players go for the high score by catching falling eggplants into the mouth of a red character. See: NASUSevered Heads in the Sky  Location: The third White Path in the White Desert Prompt: Trigger. Walk into the small building at the end of the path. Description: A severed head floats through the sky near the top of the\u00a0screen. There are two severed heads, one being a woman and the other being a man.Takofuusen  Location: The White Desert Prompt: Random Chance. 1/3600 chance of appearing in every 0.5 second interval when you stay in the White Desert, specifically the main map accessible from Block World. By probability, it may appear once in every half hour. Description: Takofuusen appears, floats past the screen making an odd sound that is similar to a drum beat, and is gone. See: TakofuusenUboa  Location: Poniko's House, in the Pink Sea Prompt: Random Chance. 1/64 chance of occurring when Madotsuki switches off the light, determined when she enters the house, or 5 seconds later after switching the light off.  Description: When the event is triggered, there will be a brief flash of light. Uboa will replace Poniko's sprite, and the entire house will shake and completely change its form. Madotsuki will be unable to turn the light back on or leave Poniko's\u00a0house. By walking\u00a0up to\u00a0Uboa, Madotsuki will be transported to a looped room with a bleeding creature in the background and the\u00a0music from the White Desert playing. The only way to get out of this room is to pinch yourself awake or use the Medamaude effect. When Poniko is killed while the event is triggered, Uboa will not appear (without Poniko's sprite), only Madotsuki trapped in the shaking reformed house. See: UboaUFOs on Mars  Location: The Martian Summit on Mars Prompt: Random Chance. 1/4 chance of appearing when Madotsuki meows with the Cat effect on the Martian Summit. Description: Strange objects appear from the sky and hover in the air when called repeatedly with the Cat effect. You have 35 attempts to meowing them to appear. By the probability, an average eight UFOs can be summoned each time you enter the screen. \u00a0The same object is seen over the distant city from the eastern edge of the Sky Garden.The Witch's Flight  Location: The Mall Rooftop Prompt: Trigger. Equip the Witch effect, mount the broom and fly off the edge of the roof. Description: Using the Witch effect and flying to the right side of the building will yield a flash. After the flash, you are able to control Madotsuki flying through the clouds, in the style of a 2D arcade game. Pressing the interact button lets the player return back to the rooftop. Pressing 1 causes the broom to disappear mid-flight, causing the screen to black out. The dream then ends prematurely with Madotsuki lying on the floor. There is also a black cat on top of the roof, which has 1/64 chance to appear on a place where Madotsuki can interact with while on the rooftop, which can be triggered by accessing the rooftop, either from the stairway or by returning to it from the event.Cinematic Events  There are a number of events that can be found across the many dream worlds that stop the action of the game and show full-screen pictures with music, similar to cutscenes in traditional games. Some of these events continue for a determined amount of time, whereas others must be dismissed by the player.The Aztec Rave Monkey  Location: The Rave Box, in the Wilderness Prompt: Trigger. Interact with the hollow Rave Box. Description: One of the most popular events is the \"Aztec Rave Monkey\" that appears when Madotsuki looks into a conspicuous hollow totem sculpture found in a certain area of The Wilderness. It shows the many iterations of a certain design repeated often throughout the game, that of an Aztec-style monkey-like image with four faces. A synth beat plays during this scene. The character can also be seen as backgrounds for the Block World and Forest World. See: The Aztec Rave MonkeyThe Drawings in the Sewers  Location: The Sewers Prompt: Trigger. There are several apertures in the walls of the sewers that lead to Big Red. Interacting with them causes several drawings to appear. More on these in the link above. Description: When interacting them, it will zoom in, giving you a chance to look at it, The drawings mostly represent Madotsuki's drawings.The Ending  Location: Madotsuki's Balcony Prompt: Trigger. Drop all Effects in The Nexus, then awaken and walk out onto the Balcony. Description: See The Ending for details.FACE  Location: The Staircase, in the Number World Prompt: There is a chance that the zipper wall on the south-east corner of the number world will, unlike the usual zipper walls, be discolored and have an angry/sad expression on it instead of the usual smile. Stabbing it when in this state causes it to bleed and reveal a pathway, similarly in fashion to the Guillotine Room. The pathway then leads to KyuuKyuuKun's Room. Description: \"FACE\" is an event that occurs when Madotsuki opens the door at the top of the Stairway, in the Number World. Known as the Red King (\u8d64\u306e\u738b\u69d8) by Japanese fans, FACE appears when one exits the stairway which is accessed from the Number World. It is often associated with KyuuKyuu-kun and used as evidence by some fans to support the theory that Madotsuki has some kind of trauma involving penises. The interpretation of FACE being a penis head further expresses this. This animation cannot be skipped and continues for approximately ten seconds before Madotsuki awakens abruptly. See: FACEThe KALIMBA TV Channel  Location: Madotsuki's Dream Room Prompt: Random Chance. 1/7 Chance of appearing when the TV is switched on in Madotsuki's Dream Room. The chance is determined once per dream. Description: When the event has been activated, the TV sprite will show the face of one of the \"Kalimba creatures\". The screen then fades to black and two oppositely-scrolling rows of tribal African-stylized figures are shown. The figures appear to be armless humanoids with their heads tilted sideways and long, zigzagging tongues spilling from their mouths. During the event, a tribal/electronic rhythm plays on a short loop. The name comes from both the background music track and the images being labelled as \"KALIMBA\" in the game's files, after the instrument used in the event's music.Monoe  Location: Monoe's Tunnel in the White Desert Prompt: Trigger. Stab Dave Spector with the Knife effect and enter the nearby tunnel from the left. Find Monoe and interact with her. Description: A detailed close-up of her fades in briefly as she vanishes, teleporting randomly to another position in the room. See: MonoeMonoko  Location: White Desert Prompt:  Trigger. There is a path that leads directly east/west within the main White Desert map that terminates/begins at a cave. Within this cave is an unassuming monochromatic young girl. Using the Traffic Light effect, however, causes her NPC to transform from a normal girl into a five-armed one. Interacting with her in this state triggers the event. Description: Monoko has a full-screen event in which a drawing of her bounces around the screen and changes size. A tribal sounding beat plays over this sequence. See: MonokoThe Spaceship Crash  Location: The Spaceship Prompt: Random Chance. When Madotsuki gets into bed on the Spaceship, there is a 1/6 chance she will fall asleep and the event will occur. Description: Madotsuki awakens to the sound of an alarm going off. When she gets out of bed, the red emergency lights are flashing and the Spaceship is losing altitude. Masada will be panicking at the organ, and after about 15 seconds a cutscene of the ship crashing on Mars will play.Theories  Yume Nikki is a strange game which has no dialogue and an unique art style. The creator of the game, KIKIYAMA, stated on their website that the game is meant to be an exploring game with a \"dark atmosphere\" but without plot or purpose. Still there are themes in Yume Nikki that fans collected to create different theories about the characters and locations. Those themes are displayed here. A theory unique to a character, such as them being a possible reference to something or having a specific theme may also be found in the Trivia section of their character pages.Themes of Isolation  Madotsuki does not leave  her apartment for the entirety of the game. Going outside her balcony at different points in the game shows that quite a bit of time passes - it turns night, then day again. When the door in the real world is interacted with, she shakes her head, making it impossible to exit it. In her dream world, she can not only leave through said door but is able to access the different dream locations through similar looking doors in The Nexus. This can mean that she has a desire to explore, is however not able to do so in the real world and thus feels comfortable to do it in her dreams. In her dream world, the themes of isolation and loneliness continue. There is no dialogue, most NPCs ignore Madotsuki and only few NPCs turn to her when the player tries to interact with them. The locations themselves feel isolating and lonely, thanks to being large and often looping, with, especially in the original locations, only few points of interests. The somber soundtrack of the game also contributes to this. Throughout the game Madotsuki encounters tall girls (called Toriningen by fans), who are considered enemies in the game due to their nature of trapping Madotsuki in inescapable locations when in a \"lunatic\" state. They also have the characteristic of having a group dynamic that goes beyond other multiple identical NPCs spawning in one location (such as the Wheelies). The most significant example of this is The Toriningen Party, where a group of Toriningen have a picnic together in The Wilderness, while dancing to cheerful music. This party cannot be accessed, as the plants of The Wilderness hinder Madotsuki from approaching any closer. This is commonly interpreted to tie in with a theme of social anxiety or isolation regarding Madotsuki. Other examples being all Toriningen going into the lunatic state when you use the Knife on one of them, or the Toriningen in the Bed Room, who is implied to watch over the beds, activating the \u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042 event when you use the Knife on her, a much more severe reaction than usual. It is notable that the NPCs thought to be the enemies of the game act as a team while Madotsuki herself is a sole figure. There are furthermore characters that seem to share Madotsuki's theme of isolation. Said characters are: Another important encounter in the dream world that may point to a theme of isolation is Closet Madotsuki, a sleeping version of Madotsuki hidden in a closet in The Checkered Tile Path. Relating to this may be the Hikikomori phenomenon, in which reclusive teens or adults abandon social life completely.Themes of Anxiety  The theme of being watched seems prevalent in Madotsuki's dreams such as eyes following you in Dense Woods, Barracks Settlement and more on the way to the Witch Effect. Hands are also scattered throughout the game ranging from a large theme of one world to appearing a few times within another. Some examples being the staircase lined with reaching hands on the way to Seccom Masada-sensei's spaceship, sprouting out of the ground in the Eyeball World and in the White Desert. The room Uboa teleports you to has a nightmarish landscape where a monster with multiple hands grasps hills in the background. The implication may be that Madotsuki dislikes being touched and prefers a great amount of personal space. A character who may tie into this is Organoid, who is the only NPC to swiftly teleport away upon approach.Body themes  In Yume Nikki, it is common for NPCs or backgrounds to resemble body parts or inner organs. See also Themes of Anxiety above for a description of hands in this game. Other examples are the Body Parts in Eyeball World, but also the uteri-shaped creatures on the Endless Road. Some fans suggest furthermore that KyuuKyuu-kun, a large colorful worm-like creature who is seen rubbing the handrail of a stairway, is phallic imagery, as to access them Madotsuki has to go through a zipper in the wall. For whatever reason, Madotsuki seems concerned or engaged with body related things with how frequently they appear in her dreams.  Another prominent body related theme found is various strabismic NPCs (strabismus meaning to be unable or having problems with fixating both eyes on one point at the same time, leading to the eyes not being aligned).  The most well known strabismic character of Yume Nikki is Seccom Masada-sensei, but other characters such as KyuuKyuu-kun are shown with strabismic eyes as well. A few fans suggest Madotsuki herself would be shown to be strabismic if she would open her closed eyes.Themes of Violence  Depending on the player's actions, Madotsuki can behave violently towards NPCs and sometimes inanimate objects. She is able to use the Knife Effect on almost all of the NPCs with varying results. While this makes the Knife a prominent effect in the game, it is nevertheless unnecessary for gathering effects and thus archiving The Ending, and most of the time can be replaced by the Cat Effect for exploring purposes. Still, the Knife stuck in the minds of fans, leading to many imagining Madotsuki or other characters from this game as characters prone to violence.Themes of traffic accidents  Different areas in Yume Nikki imply that Madotsuki often thinks about traffic accidents of some kind. Examples of this are Shitai-san, a dead person on the ground in Dense Woods, surrounded by traffic cones, of whom the Stoplight can be gained. Seccom Masada-sensei is troubled by his spaceship crashing onto Mars, while Mars-san cries near something that appears to be a crashed locomotive. In Dense Woods, Madotsuki can also board a Traincar, taking her to the Witch's Island where a creature similar to Mars-san can be found.Japanese Folklore  Madotsuki's dreams are influenced by japanese folklore, as various NPCS and Effects are connected to demons, ghosts and monsters from japanese mythology. This suggests that Madotsuki is interested in or feels personally involved with japanese folklore. NPCs that definitely relate to japanese folklore are: Some other Effects that are associated with japanese folklore are:Mesoamerican imagery  Mesoamerican imagery appears in many backgrounds in Madotsuki's dreams and even her real life room (the carpet). It could indicate that she feels connected with mesoamerican culture and history.Lucid Dreaming  As Madotsuki can wake herself up at any time in her dream and has control over her surroundings, she is by definition dreaming lucid dreams. Since she also keeps a dream diary, she remembers at least some things about them. Self-induced lucid dreaming is a successful therapy technique for dealing with sleep cycle affecting mental disorders or illnesses.   She may have been taught self-induced lucid dreaming to reduce frequency of nightmares and keeps a dream diary to keep track of her dreams as a self-care exercise.Separation of Dream and Reality  At all times during regular gameplay, and unlike some fangames that followed Yume Nikki, the dream world and the real world is kept separate. Meaning, no \"unreal\" dream elements are carried over during the awake moments. During the Witch's Flight Event Madotsuki even falls out of her bed in the real world to indicate that she moved around in her sleep while having a strong dream. However, after The Ending, two Jellyfish appear, while the ending supposedly takes place in the real world. This has raised doubts in fans' minds of The Ending being real and not another dream. In fact, some fans believe that Madotsuki is dreaming at every point in the game, citing her perpetually closed eyes and the unrealistic nature of living in an apartment without food or a bathroom as evidence.Theories regarding locations Hospital themes  The location dubbed The Mall by fans has several rooms that closely resemble a doctor's or therapy's office, complete with a reception, fitting wall posters, two couches and a a character sneezing. Entering a second room from the room with the reception leads you to O-Man, a character playing cheerful music. As the Flute can be found here, Madotsuki is able to perform music together with O-Man. This suggests the Flute Effect is given to you by O-Man themself. Tying into the hospital theme, this may be a reference to music therapy. In another room that is similarly structured to the above rooms, there is a character who has a large amount of red liquid coming out of its head and falls over when interacted with, spilling said liquid on the floor. Beating heart sound effects accompany this, adding to the hospital theme. This may tie in with traffic accidents, as people who survive said accidents are usually taken to a hospital to recover.The Pink Sea as a party  The dominating cheerful pink and pastel colours, the floating balloons and the conical structures that resemble Japanese-style party poppers in The Pink Sea may represent a party. And as Poniko is the only inhabitant of The Pink Sea, it might be thrown for or by her.Toriningen  The Toriningen\u00a0(\u9ce5\u4eba\u9593, \"Bird-humans\") are a certain group of characters in Yume Nikki. They have long pointed snouts for a noses that appear beak-like, hence their name. There are three variations, each with a different hairstyle: bunches, ponytail, and bobbed hair, who each have a respective demented state. Normal Toriningen will not harass Madotsuki, but those in a 'lunatic' state (identifiable by their purple eyes and tongue lolling out of their mouths) will chase her, teleporting her to an enclosed space in an area that is usually different to the one she is currently visiting if they catch her.\n The only way to escape from these areas is to use the Medamaude effect or pinching your cheek to wake up.\n Stabbing a normal Toriningen makes all Toriningen go into the lunatic state until Madotsuki is caught or wakes up. There is one particular odd lunatic Toriningen in The Mall behind a desk who will not be aggressive, instead changing the color scheme of your menu to a random preset when interacted with. Lunatic Toriningen can be avoided by using the active function of the Triangle Kerchief effect, which renders Madotsuki invisible to them unless she interacts with them directly. They may also be immobilised using the Stoplight effect, which freezes them in place when the light is red.\n Toriningen are unkillable, and it is possible to stab them one or two extra times during the transformation into a lunatic state to no avail. They share this trait with Uboa, the only other character considered to be an \"enemy\" in the game, since they both teleport Madotsuki to a closed-off area. The player character in NASU has a similar snout. Toriningen can be portrayed as tengu imagery present in Yume Nikki. Even more, a mythical Japanese creature called the Baku (or 'Dream Eater') is characterized as having a long snout, and can be seen as a dreamer's antagonist since it obviously eats their dream, although this dream eater is in fact meant to be a tapir-like creature.Locations  Toriningen are spread diversely throughout the Dream world, appearing in many different locations.Face Carpet Plaza The Snow World The Candle World The Checkered Tile Path The Number World The Guillotine World Hell The Wilderness  1-3. The three Toriningen here are having a party and are not capable of being made lunatic, due to the fact that Madotsuki is blocked from reaching them.The Mall Monoe  Monoe (\u30e2\u30ce\u6c5f), (derived from monochrome) lives in the White Desert and most players consider her to be Monoko's older sister. Her name comes from the \"Picture/\u30e2\u30ce\u6c5f.xyz\" file in the game, and is thus one of the three characters with an official name, other than Madotsuki and Monoko. She is located in a tunnel near Dave Spector. To meet her, you must kill Dave Spector with the knife and walk into the tunnel from the west. She will be somewhere in the darkness - it is a good idea to use the Cat Effect to locate her. Interacting with her will trigger a brief full-screen event, where a picture of her face will fade in and out upon the screen. After this, she vanishes away to another place in the area.   In YUMENIKKI -DREAM DIARY-, she is seen in a school crying. You have to collect four scraps of a photograph, assemble it and show it to her. She is next seen in the Staircase, sitting on the stairs next to KyuuKyuu. Approaching her will cause her to scream at you and a jumpscare-y full-screen event takes place.Interpretation  Monoe could be a vision of when Madotsuki was happy (or how she wants to be happy).\u00a0She is one of the only characters that smiles and doesn't seem hostile (like Uboa) but then she disappears. Monoe and Madotsuki also share similar appearances (shown by the picture above).Appearance  Monoe appears to be a tall girl with extremely pale white skin, black hair that extends over her shoulders a little bit with straight choppy bangs hanging on her forehead. She also has black eyes and wears a white dress shirt with short sleeves with her flaps showing. She also wears a black skirt, white ankle-length socks and black penny loafers.White Desert  The White Desert (\u30e2\u30ce, Mono) is an area reachable from Mafurako in the Block World. It is populated by a large number of notable NPCs, including Monoko, Monoe, Takofuusen, and The Thing with the Quivering Jaw. It is such a huge area that it is divided into two sections, White Desert A and White Desert B.Points of Interest White Desert A  The desert's name is based off of its color - or rather, its lack thereof: Everything in the White Desert is entirely black and white, save for striking bits of red. Various limb-like objects protrude out of the surface, some moving when interacted with effects, similarly to Eyeball World, in which animated hands and eyes are on the ground. Monoko can be found in a tunnel that has a horizontal path go through, using the Traffic Light effect will make her show her other appearance. Killing the Dave Spector near the circular path tunnel will allow the player to access two places from that tunnel: going to the east entrance leads you to a large looping area with Monoe inside; going to the west entrance leads you to a path that has huge body parts coming out of the ground and a small house at the end which causes the Flying Heads event. Stabbing the eye box has a one in thirty chance of teleporting the player to a small area filled with Eye People; getting back is done the same way. Not too far from there is a smiling tooth with two grasping hands that takes the player to Block World.White Desert B  The Dense Woods manhole leads to Roary Straw which has its appearance changed by how long you have been walking on the infinitely looping road. Climb up to the surface and you will be in a place that is surrounded by mountains with an entrance resembling a man's head. You can enter its right ear. Entering the ear, you will be in a cave which has a single pathway. In the middle there is a huge monster which is known as the Brain Creature. Pressing and holding the up arrow key will make the camera pan up so you can see its full appearance. If you keep walking along the path you will come out from a Buddha's left ear, and meet a giant monster called The Thing with the Quivering Jaw. If you came from the FC Dungeon, you will arrive at the Underground Lagoon which has a moving shadow arm. If you keep going up the stairway, you will be on the outside of the ring of mountains, which has nothing but a floating stair path and a tunnel near the entrance that has a path you can follow. Following the path will send you through a one way teleport to White Desert A's tunnel that is spraying lots of water. From outside of the mountains, you can see the red tentacle from Roary Straw, but can't see the entrance that looks like a head in the center. The outside of White Desert B is potentially the most difficult location to reach without a walkthrough in this game. This is because you need to go through 2 different mazes: the Teleport Maze and the FC Dungeon.Connections FC World Overview  The FC world (short for Famicom, the Japanese counterpart to the NES) is an area where the game's graphics change to resemble a 8-bit RPG. They contain both overworld areas and dungeons that are considered to be an homage to the game Mother. In the FC worlds the menu no longer fills the screen.\n In some English translations of Yume Nikki, the game may crash when entering an FC world with all effects due to a misnamed file. To fix this, rename FCM2ALL.xyz in the folder \"Picture\" to FCM\uff12ALL.xyz (with the superscript \"\uff12\" character).FC House  The FC house is accessed from the Static Maze in the Shield-folk World. The Demon effect can be found inside it. Staircases going up and right lead to a boss fight of sorts, as well as a dead end located in FC world A.FC World A  FC World A can be accessed by talking to the creature in the Mall section of the Dense Woods. By solving the Teleport Maze, you will end up in a Wilderness area with a box that takes you to this FC world. This section of the World contains one house that takes you to an underground complex which called FC Dungeon that connects to the White Desert B. This dungeon contains the Glitch event.FC World B  FC World B is accessed by talking to a certain Pirori, randomly selected each dream, in the Barracks Settlement. It contains a house with the Buyo Buyo effect inside. There's also a location with 6 pyramids with a FC Demon inside. The demon will teleport you to the FC house.FC World C  FC World C is unreachable without cheating; and refers to the large, inaccessible chain of islands to the east of the main FC worlds.Trivia Maps  (More Maps coming soon)Dave Spector  Dave Spector (a.k.a. Dali) is the name of two NPCs found in the White Desert. One stands in front of a tunnel. Killing them then entering the tunnel will grant the player access to one of two areas: Monoe's tunnel or one where white fires burn, arms and legs protrude from the ground, and severed heads spin in the sky. Another Dave Spector can be found several screens north of the tunnel, northwest of the entrance to the Block World.Trivia  Dave and Seccom Masada-sensei are the only two characters that walk backwards in the game, as evidenced here.Madotsuki's Room  Madotsuki's Room (\u73fe\u5b9f\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b, Real Room, \u30d9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0, Veranda) is where the player starts (and ends) the game. This room and its balcony are the only locations Madotsuki can access outside of her dreams. Although Madotsuki can go out onto the balcony, attempting to leave the room by the door results in her simply shaking her head. This may be either due to her being a hikikomori, or because Madotsuki is physically unable to open it. The balcony background changes depending on the time of day. It is a place of limited functionality until a later point in the game, and its dream world representation simply serves as a spawnpoint for the dream world. In the manga, her room is just the same and is the overall focal point of manga just as it would be in-game. However, the manga dwells on a theory that she cannot leave the room because someone locked her in.Points of Interest  Her desk is where she writes in the titular dream diary to save the game. She also has a television that receives no channels, but can be used to play NASU by interacting with the Famicom console. The Bed is the most important object in the room. When Madotsuki climbs into bed, there is a three second countdown in the top left corner of the screen. When it hits zero, the screen blurs out and Madotsuki starts to dream.Dream Representation  When Madotsuki goes to sleep, she finds herself on the dream representation of her balcony (\u5922\u30d9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0, Dream Veranda). The bedroom (\u5922\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b, Dream Room) is identical to the real one except for a couple of subtle differences - the Famicom is gone and the balcony backgrounds become slightly more surreal.Points of Interest  When switched on, the TV no longer displays the test card, but instead there is a large eye looking into the room, or the KALIMBA TV Channel event will activate, the latter being a 1/8 chance. Instead of writing in her diary, sitting at the desk and pressing the \"Z\" button (Interact) will let Madotsuki scoot the chair around her bedroom. She can ride the chair to almost anywhere in the dream world (albeit very slowly), but will not be able to get off it until she returns it to her desk. Sitting on the chair and equipping an effect can result in a glitch that increases Madotsuki's speed. Entering the dream bed does not cause her to fall asleep, but, like all the other beds, there is a 1/5 chance that it will transport her to The Staircase of Hands. The chance of this is determined when Madotsuki falls asleep, as one bed in the dream world is randomly selected to teleport her. Most importantly of all, Madotsuki can leave the dream bedroom via the door. This leads to The Nexus and every subsequent location of her dream world.Connections Gallery  \u00a0\u00a0The Mall  The Mall or Department Store is the popular name of an area in Yume Nikki. It is a black-floored, purple-walled complex. It is full of people, but when interacted with, they deform slightly and make rattling/hissing noises. The enviroments music is dark and industrial. This gives it an eerie, abandoned feel. The music on the upper and lower levels of the mall is the Shield-Folk World BGM at 50% speed. The Mall's layout is quite strange. It has several pathways, rather like a maze, with walls facing diagonally. There is a second floor, but what is on it changes depending on how you enter it.E-Man's room  Another room, located in the bottom left of the map, houses a harmless, lunatic Toriningen sitting behind a counter and e-Man chilling on a sofa. Interacting with the Toriningen will cause the color of your menu to change. E-Man frowns whenever the Cat effect is used and even sneezes if you stay long enough inside the room. The BGM in this room is the main menu theme at 50% speed.O-Man's room  The Flute effect is located here. To obtain it, you must enter the room in the bottom left in the map (the room where the harmless lunatic Toriningen and e-Man are found), then go to through the doorway on the left. The flute is found on the ground next to o-Man. This room has a special BGM. O-Man sits on a couch and plays music, and killing him with the Knife effect will stop the music abruptly.Wall Illustrations  There are some illustrations on the rooms' walls.\n The gallery below consists of fanmade enlargements of the art.Connections  The Mall can be accessed from the Graffiti World or by entering the elevator after falling asleep in a dream bed.   Near the elevator there has an escalator that is usually blocked by a traffic cone. There is a 1 in 4 chance there will be no cone here, allowing you to ascend to the Mall Roof, which allows you to trigger the Witch's Flight event given that you have the Witch effect. Part of the Dense Woods can be accessed from the basement. Talking to the Jellyfish there will transport you to a Teleport Maze, which leads to FC World A that connects to the White Desert B.Map  This map is an overhead of the main mall area. The door on the bottom left leads to the Flute effect. The door on the Middle Right leads to Tokuto-kun.Trivia  There is a place where you can go behind a wall to the point where Madotsuki is no longer visible in the back of the same wall where the escalator is. This could be considered a clipping glitch. Duplicating yourself with the midget effect or playing the flute effect while behind this wall will cause a mini Madotsuki/music notes to appear in front of the wall despite Madotsuki being behind itMadotsuki's Ghost Overview  Madotsuki's Ghost\u00a0is a translucent version of Madotsuki which can be found in the center of Mini Hell, which is similar to the giant red maze; Hell. The ghost can be passed through and can only be interacted with the Cat ability. The ghost always faces the direction the real Madotsuki is in.Finding Madotsuki's Ghost  From the Number World, go through the door at the far left into the room full of beds and cupboards. Go down until you see a Toriningen and stab her with the knife, turning her hostile. Quickly go to the left towards the row of cupboards and go into the third cupboard from the left. This will transport you to a different, smaller version of Hell which is much less confusing. Madotsuki's Ghost will be standing in the center of the map. If you have the Stoplight effect, then you can also freeze the Toriningen in place after stabbing her, to give you a bit more time.Trivia Characters  There are a large amount of characters in the Yume Nikki universe, some of which are more popular than others. Minor characters can be found on the List of Characters.Mafurako  Mafurako (\u30de\u30d5\u30e9\u30fc\u5b50, \"muffler girl\") (a.k.a. Hat-and-Scarf Girl) is an NPC who can be found in the Block World. Initially, Mafurako appears to be invisible except for the hat and scarf she wears. However, using the Stoplight effect causes her to appear completely, revealing her as a girl.Appearance  Mafurako wears a brown winter cap and a scarf, which are the only visible articles of clothing at first. She has dark brown hair that covers her eyes, a blue sweater, purple pants, and black shoes.Interaction  Interacting with Mafurako will teleport both her and Madotsuki to 1 of 5 normally inaccessible places atop one of the blocks in the area. On one of the possible destinations is a door that leads to the White Desert. Interacting with her again will return them both to the ground. Normally, Madotsuki will be teleported to a random spot away from Mafurako, and will have to seek her out again. However, if Madotsuki is using the snowman effect, she will always return to Mafurako's side on the return trip, shortening the process of finding the door. Besides transforming under the stoplight effect, Mafurako displays all the normal reactions to the Cat, Knife and Stoplight effects.Interpretation  It is possible that Mafurako represents Madotsuki's feelings of shyness. It is evident that Mafurako wants to be unseen, as even when she is visible her fringe covers her face.\n Furthermore, Mafurako seems to seek solitude. She is the sole resident of the very spacious Block World, and prefers to ditch Madotsuki in a distant location rather than teleport back together. She only seems comfortable around the inanimate Snowman, with whom she can relate to (They share a penchant for winter clothing) yet is also impersonal and non-threatening.Trivia  Interestingly, Mafurako's sprites are located in Madotsuki's sprite sheet in the game's files. She is the only NPC with this distinction other than Madotsuki's Ghost.Uboa  If you turn off the light in Poniko's Room, there is a 1 in 64 chance that the Uboa Event will occur. Whether the event will occur is determined when the player enters the room (leave and enter again for the next chance). Uboa was added along with the Pink Sea in Ver.0.08.Appearance  Uboa appears like a black blob or shadow-like creature with a white oval covering most of their front. The oval resembles the traditional Noh theatre masks, as well as the Greek comedy/tragedy masks that depict extreme joy or sadness. However, in regards to the Greek masks, Uboa's expression seems to be a blend of both, as their left eye is squinting, while their right eye is resting. Accordingly, the left corner of the mouth is turned up, while the right corner is turned down. In the right upper part of the oval, the black colour invades it slightly, making the \"mask\" appear \"cracked\". In the manga, Uboa was given a ponytail and arms, probably to resemble Poniko.Event  There is a chance that the event is triggered when you turn off the light. When the event happens a bright flash fills the screen, then the entire room changes and Uboa replaces Poniko. The background music changes to an alarming filtered \"aah\" noise. You cannot leave the room, and flipping the light switch only causes another flash. Some of the items in the room change. The dresser gets a \"face\" with googly eyes that may remind players of those of Masada and a smile. The two pictures change, the one over the desk turns from what looks like a mouse to a face which has googly eyes as well, and what could be either a moustache or another smile. The one over Poniko's bed changes from one shape to another. The window gets eyes and the rug's design also changes, showing a pattern with eyes as well. The lamp on the desk turns on, showing a light beam. If you interact with Uboa, their face will become warped and you will be sent to a looped area highly similar to the White Desert (with even its soundtrack playing). The area shows a monochrome background and a large decorative NPC that interacts with the white part of the background. This white part is shaped in a bubbly way and drop shapes are drawn on top of it, making it seem wet. When walking, Madotsuki's footsteps make the same \"water\" sound effects also heard when adventuring through the Pink Sea, so the white, wavy ground can be interpreted as the same sort of substance. Using the Frog Effect here will increase Madotsuki's movement speed as well. Uboa themself is seen motionless with the warped expression in the right down part of the area. It is impossible to interact with them. Despite this location's many similarities to the White Desert, there are no routes that lead away from this area and into the White Desert itself. The only way to escape this area is by pinching Madotsuki awake or by using the Medamaude effect.Sound Files  Sound associated with Uboa.Reception  Uboa is likely a major factor for the success of the game, especially in the English version. Many non-Japanese players were introduced to Uboa through YouTube. Uboa itself may very well be the number one inspiration to download and explore Yume Nikki by most fans.Fan Speculation  Isolation - Due to being trapped after making Madotsuki interact with Uboa, and the following area playing the dreary White Desert soundtrack, it could relate to the game's recurring theme of isolation. Poniko's True Form - A common interpretation is that Uboa is Poniko's true form, mostly because they replace her sprite. Revenge - Uboa could be an annoyed Poniko getting angry with Madotsuki, as she keeps switching the lights off and on, which could be seen as a prank.Trivia The Wilderness  The Wilderness (Official Name: \u7802, Desert) is an extensive deeper location consisting of a large expanse of curly plants and rocky sand.\n It is notable for being hard to navigate through all the plants that you see, with many passages difficult to notice. Despite its size, there is only one effect to be gained here, although there are numerous events to witness, including the Aztec Rave Monkey, the Falling Man, and the Toriningen Party. There are many connections to other locations, although the FC world exit is only reachable if you entered the area via the Teleport Maze. The music is Madotsuki's Dream Room played at half the speed.Points of Interest The Infinite Wilderness Eastern / Western Wilderness Areas Northern Wilderness Area Connections ", "Yu-Gi-Oh 5ds Wiki": "Yu-Gi-Oh 5ds Wiki Yusei Fudo  yusei fudo is my mom Yuesi Dfou si teh 18 ryea ldo otatogripns of Yu-Gi-Ho! 5D's dan oen of hte Serinsg.

Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was\u00a0English\u00a0(born in\u00a0London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was\u00a0Maltese.\u00a0Her siblings are\u00a0Bryan James\u00a0and\u00a0Jamie Lynn.\u00a0Britney was born in the\u00a0Bible Belt, where socially conservative\u00a0evangelical Protestantismis a particularly strong religious influence.\u00a0She was baptized into the\u00a0Southern Baptist Convention, but later in life studied\u00a0Kabbalist\u00a0teachings.\u00a0She sang in a\u00a0Baptist\u00a0church choir as a child. At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of\u00a0Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her\u00a0kindergarten\u00a0graduation. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.\u00a0She said about her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\". At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to\u00a0Atlanta,\u00a0Georgia\u00a0to audition for the 1990s revival of\u00a0The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the\u00a0Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical\u00a0Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show\u00a0Star Search\u00a0and was cast in a number of commercials.\u00a0In December 1992, she was cast in\u00a0The Mickey Mouse Club\u00a0alongside\u00a0Christina Aguilera,\u00a0Justin Timberlake,\u00a0Ryan Gosling, and\u00a0Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's\u00a0Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in\u00a0Clueless\u00a0with all the\u00a0cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\" In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager\u00a0Lou Pearlman\u00a0to join the female pop group\u00a0Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer\u00a0Larry Rudolph\u00a0for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a\u00a0Whitney Houston\u00a0karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of\u00a0Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a\u00a0sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the\u00a0Backstreet Boys\u00a0and the\u00a0Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another\u00a0Madonna, another\u00a0Debbie Gibson, or another\u00a0Tiffany.\" Two weeks later, executives from\u00a0Jive Records\u00a0returned calls to Rudolph.\u00a0Senior vice president of\u00a0A&R\u00a0Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation\u2014the 'eye of the tiger'\u2014is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"\u00a0Spears then sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.\u00a0They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\"\u00a0After hearing the recorded material, president\u00a0Clive Calder\u00a0ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow\u00a0music, but younger; more adult contemporary\" but felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it\u2014it's more me.\" She flew to\u00a0Cheiron Studios\u00a0in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers\u00a0Max Martin,\u00a0Denniz Pop\u00a0and\u00a0Rami Yacoub, among others.1998\u20132000:\u00a0...Baby One More Time\u00a0and\u00a0Oops!... I Did It Again  After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for\u00a0NSYNC.\u00a0Her debut studio album,\u00a0...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.\u00a0It debuted at number one on the U.S.\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200\u00a0and was certified two-times\u00a0platinum\u00a0by the\u00a0Recording Industry Association of America\u00a0after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.\u00a0It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist. The\u00a0title track\u00a0was released as the\u00a0lead single\u00a0from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl.\u00a0The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the\u00a0best-selling singles\u00a0of all time.\u00a0\"...Baby One More Time\" later received a\u00a0Grammy\u00a0nomination for\u00a0Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\u00a0The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.\u00a0It would later become the\u00a025th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.\u00a0Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country.\u00a0\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the\u00a0...Baby One More Time\u00a0album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is also the best-selling first album by any artist ever. The April 1999 cover of\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing a bra, shorts and an open top. The\u00a0American Family Association\u00a0(AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called to \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears responded to the outcry commenting, \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this\u00a0bubblegum pop\u00a0all the time.\"\u00a0Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a\u00a0virgin\u00a0until marriage.\u00a0On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining\u00a0...Baby One More Time Tour\u00a0in North America, which was positively received by critics,\u00a0but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.\u00a0An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show. Oops!... I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the\u00a0SoundScan\u00a0record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.\u00a0The album sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date, making one of the best-selling albums of all time.\u00a0Rob Sheffield\u00a0of\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0said that \"the great thing about\u00a0Oops!\u00a0\u2013 under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of\u00a0rock & roll\u00a0tradition.\"\u00a0The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.\u00a0The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for\u00a0Best Pop Vocal Album\u00a0and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively. The same year, Spears embarked on the\u00a0Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5\u00a0million; she also released her first book,\u00a0Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.\u00a0On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the\u00a02000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.\u00a0Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member\u00a0Justin Timberlake.\u00a0She also bought a home in\u00a0Destin, Florida.2001\u20132002:\u00a0Britney\u00a0and\u00a0Crossroads  In February 2001, Spears signed a $7\u20138 million promotional deal with\u00a0Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled\u00a0A Mother's Gift.Her self-titled third studio album,\u00a0Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as\u00a0Jay-Z\u00a0and\u00a0The Neptunesand wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.\u00a0The album debuted at number one in the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 12 million copies worldwide.\u00a0Stephen Thomas Erlewine\u00a0of\u00a0AllMusic\u00a0called\u00a0Britney\u00a0\"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"\u00a0The album was honored with two Grammy nominations\u2014Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"\u2014 and was listed in 2008 as one of\u00a0Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".\u00a0The album's first single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit worldwide. Spears's performance of the single at the\u00a02001 MTV Video Music Awards\u00a0featured a caged tiger and a large\u00a0albino python\u00a0draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization\u00a0PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.\u00a0To support the album, Spears embarked on the\u00a0Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the\u00a0pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\u00a0being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.\u00a0The tour grossed $43.7\u00a0million, becoming the second highest grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind\u00a0Cher's\u00a0Farewell Tour.\u00a0Her career success was highlighted by\u00a0Forbes\u00a0in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.\u00a0Spears also landed her first starring role in\u00a0Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success.\u00a0Crossroads, which had a $12 million budget, went on to gross over $61.1 million worldwide. In June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in\u00a0New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".\u00a0In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.\u00a0Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his\u00a0solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.\u00a0As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend\u00a0Annet Artani.\u00a0The same year,\u00a0Limp Bizkitfrontman\u00a0Fred Durst\u00a0said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that \"I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.\" 2003\u20132005:\u00a0In the Zone\u00a0and marriages In 2003 Spears opened the\u00a02003 MTV Video Music Awards\u00a0with\u00a0Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.\u00a0Spears released her fourth studio album,\u00a0In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.\u00a0Vibe\u00a0called it \"A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter.\"\u00a0NPR\u00a0listed the album as one of \"The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade\", adding that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.\"\u00a0In the Zone\u00a0sold over 609,000 copies in the United States and debuted at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.\u00a0It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.\u00a0In the Zone\u00a0sold over 10 million copies worldwide.\u00a0The album produced the hit singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"\u2014which won Spears her only Grammy for\u00a0Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\" and \"Outrageous\". In January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at\u00a0A Little White Wedding Chapel\u00a0in\u00a0Las Vegas,\u00a0Nevada. The marriage was\u00a0annulled\u00a055 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".\u00a0In March 2004, she embarked on\u00a0The Onyx Hotel Tour\u00a0in support of\u00a0In the Zone.\u00a0In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". Spears underwent\u00a0arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.\u00a0During 2004, Spears became involved in the\u00a0Kabbalah Centre\u00a0through her friendship with\u00a0Madonna.

He wears the poncho in the manga at the start of the D1 Grand Prix. However this poncho is white, lacks the Mark of the Dragon design, and is dirtier. During the WRGP, he gets a new Turbo Dueling outfit that is similar to his old clothes but is more form-fitting. The new outfit consists of the same blue jacket with amber gems, but the bottom right part is replaced by a black strap with an orange outline. He wears blue jeans with amber gems at the knees and knee-high boots.Plot  Yuesi wsa nobr ni eht Tops reaa of Ewn Nidoom Icty.

However, a bomb explodes and another bomb threat is issued, causing an evacuation of the building, but Yusei and Bruno become unable to escape. Finding Sherry, who set off the first bomb, they pursue her, but her butler Elsworth is able to stop Yusei and challenge him to a duel. Yusei defeats the butler, and convinces him to try and stop Sherry. As they enter the room where Sherry was attempting to analyze Zone's mysterious card, the analysis computer mysteriously begins to glow and the four are transported to a mysterious white space with a comma-shaped machine, which analyzes them. The four wake up on the shore shortly after the event. He later appeared to help Crow work out the kinks in his Duel Runner with Bruno's help, finding a strange circuit in the process. He later watched Crow's duel against Bolton and is the first to know that he is dueling with an Anti-Blackwing Deck. While watching the duel, his birthmark, along with Crow's and Jack's, began to glow as Crow summons his Black-winged dragon. Crow defeats Bolton, who is arrested but gives the three new, more powerful engines. Forming team 5d's for the WRGP, the group headed out to the practice track to get a feel for their new engines. During this practice run, Crow accidentally ran into a member of Team Unicorn. Andre, the team's ace, challenges Yusei to a Turbo Duel, which he accepts. During the Duel Yusei realizes that Andre can analyze every possible scenario before playing his cards, like himself. Summoning Stardust Dragon, Yusei attempts to seize victory, but the time limit for the practice run stops the duel. He also notices he did not have a confirmed victory because of Andre's unknown set card.  During the first round in the WRGP, Yusei faced off against all three members of Team Unicorn because Jack and Akiza lost to Andore. Yusei was able to claim victory over Andore, who managed to halve Yusei's Life Points before losing. He then struggles against Breo's Mill Deck, but manages to defeat him with \"Junk Destroyer\". Yusei then barely defeats Jean without any cards in his Deck. With this, Yusei pulled off a seemingly-impossible victory and won the first match of the preliminaries. He celebrated their first victory with his teammates when Sherry arrived to discuss what had happened to them up until now. They discussed the events about Ghost and the Meklord Emperor monsters, Lester, what she, Yusei, and Bruno saw that day at the Sector Security's compound, and the Fake Jack Atlas/Imposter Jack Atlas. Sherry believed that Yliaster is behind all this and that they are being targeted because they are the Signers, which everyone is shocked to hear that Sherry knows about. The next day, Yusei, Jack, and Crow decided to see how Team Unicorn is doing in their match. Once they got there, they discovered that they lost due to their Duel Runners crashing unexpectedly in their match against Team Catastrophe. While reviewing the duel, they figured out that when ever a player crashes, they managed to have the monster \"Hidden Knight -Hook-\" out on the field. While deducing this, Akiza got involved in an accident similar to the one Crow was in and fell into a coma. They know that Team Catastrophe was behind this and decided to beat them fair and square in the tournament to pay them back. Yusei and the rest of Team 5D's watched Crow's duel very closely to see what is the relationship between the crashes and the monster, Hidden Knight -Hook-. They soon discovered that after its effect activated, a hooked hand appeared from the shadow of its opponent's Duel Runner and caused their wheel to lock up. Even with this deadly monster on the field, Crow managed to stay in the game long enough, despite his still wounded shoulder, to win the Duel, destroying Hidden Knight -Hook-, and trading places with Jack. After the first two turns of the duel, Team 5D's managed to win the second duel due to Nicolas's Duel Runner being destroyed by his own card's effect. Both of the cards were given to Team Catastrophe by Primo, who attempts to eliminate Team 5D's from WRGP. After his plan failed, he unleashed an army of Duelbots into New Domino City. Because of that, Yusei and others decided to fight against the Diablo army. Yusei teamed up with Sherry and Elsworth. After they defeated some of them, Primo sent all Ghosts to the trio. They quickly defeated Elsworth and Sherry, leaving Yusei to fight alone. Bruno, who saw this, wanted to help Yusei. A voice in his mind reminded him of his \"task\"; this prompted him to get his Duel Runner and go to help Yusei. Transforming into Vizor, he helps Yusei escape from the Ghosts. Fed up, Primo faces Yusei on his own. Vizor stalls Primo with a duel so Yusei can obtain the last element needed to obtain his Clear Mind. Yusei overcomes his fear of \"Meklord Emperor Wisel\", causing a tablet to fall from the sky. Touching the tablet transports him to the white space where the machine stood, which gives him a blank card. Returning to the city, Yusei duels Primo, who merges with his Duel Runner.  Primo, determined to win, used stole Skiel parts to boost the power of his Meklord Emperor. This gives Primo an advantage, and his remarks prevents Yusei from using Clear Mind. Primo's Wisel absorbs Stardust Dragon, but Yusei is able to retrieve it and finally Accel Synchro Summon his new \"Shooting Star Dragon\", whose effect destroys Wisel and eliminates Primo's Life Points. With Primo's body destroyed, Jakob and Lester appear to take his remains. Jakob explains the team's purpose to Yusei, Jack, and Crow, obtains his Granel tablet, and leaves. Yusei then accompanied Jack to Greiger's hometown after receiving an e-mail from him saying that Jack needed to find a new method of fighting. While Jack was absent, Yusei talked with Greiger, who realized that he was used by The Crimson Devil. Later he went with Greiger and Max to temple where Jack was dueling the Familiar of Red Nova, and witnesses as Jack obtains Burning Soul and defeats the familiar. Later, he went with Jack, Crow and Bruno to search for cup ramen, Jack's favorite, because they were sold out. There they met a disguised Lazar, but before Yusei could ask him about Yliaster, he disappeared. Yusei, Jack, and Crow lure Lazar into a trap, and Yusei uses a tracking device to corner him as he escapes. After Crow defeats Lazar, Yusei helps interrogate him about Yliaster, who takes them to an arcade game with stored information. Yusei helps complete the puzzle needed to enter the password, and they see that the Momentum Express Development Organization was involved in the scheme. Yusei and the others then went to Rick, Bolton's former associate, in order to find information about the Momentum Express Development Organization. He agreed to help them infiltrate the headquarters under the guise that they were testing their Duel Runner-sized Momentum engines. Yusei, Sherry, and Bruno enter the building and began investigating the company, including their mysterious Infinity machine. Sneaking into the office of Clark Smith, the Momentum Express President, Bruno and Sherry obtain an access key to the highest-security checkpoint at the facility while Yusei distracts him with a Concentration Duel. Yusei is barely able to defeat Clark, who used underhanded techniques to gain an edge. Clark then activated an alarm and trapped the three in a shuttle, forcing them through a wormhole using Infinity. Sherry is sucked into the wormhole while Yusei and Bruno are transported to the future, where Dr. Fudo appears and sends them back. Because Clark revealed his plans to the three, Yliaster promptly changes history to erase Momentum Express from existence. When Yusei and Bruno return to their own time, they realize that Yliaster has entered the finals as Team New World, and Lazar is promoted as the new Director of Sector Security to keep the WRGP in operation. Yusei, Jack, and Crow decide to train in order to defeat Team New World, and in the process meet Team Taiyo, a kind group who they help to fix their Duel Runner. However, they quickly realize that their next match is against the very same team. In the wake of Team Taiyo's \"Zushin the Sleeping Giant\", Yusei was able to defeat the team using cards left over from his friends. After some time, Yusei, Jack and Crow met Team Ragnarok. Leader of the team, Halldor, explained to them how they got Aesir. After Yusei asked to combine their strength with them, Halldor refused, saying that Yusei's father made Zero Reverse and they believe Yusei might be trying to continue the destruction his father left behind. Halldor challenged Team 5D's tomorrow, saying that team who win will have right to duel Team New World in the final. Yusei accepted, saying that he and his friends cannot afford to lose. Yusei enters the final stretch of Team 5D's match against Team Ragnarok against Harald. Even though Jack and Crow manage to defeat their opponents, Dragan and Broder, their ace cards, \"Thor, Lord of the Aesir\" and \"Loki, Lord of the Aesir\" remain on the field due to their ability to Special Summon from the Graveyard. In his first turn, Harald Synchro Summons \"Odin, Father of the Aesir\" and starts a powerful assault on Yusei. Odin's effect nullifies Yusei's Spell and Trap Cards, but Yusei is able to Summon \"Majestic Star Dragon\" and later \"Shooting Star Dragon\", finally stopping the Aesirs and defeating Team Ragnarok. During the duel between Team 5D's and Team New World, Yusei watches the first two duels and feels that both Lester and Primo held back considerably, eventually realizing their strategy revolving around their \"Infinite Spirit Machine\". When Jack fails to destroy it, Jakob quickly summoned \"Meklord Emperor Granel\", which promptly destroyed and absorbed \"Red Nova Dragon\", defeating Jack in one turn. Crow attempted to fight back with his Blackwings, but also fell to the colossal monster, sacrificing his Life Points to pass his \"Black-Winged Dragon\" to Yusei. Jakob then reveals the destroyed future to Team 5D's, but Yusei chooses to continue the duel, using Black-Winged Dragon to summon his own \"Stardust Dragon\" and Accel Synchro Summon \"Shooting Star Dragon\", which destroys \"Granel\" with its effect. With \"Granel\" destroyed, the Three Pure Nobles merge into Aporia, who summons his \"Meklord Astro Mekanikle\" and absorbs \"Shooting Star Dragon\". Yusei struggles against this new monster, but is finally able to call on his friends' best monsters to his side, and destroys \"Meklord Astro Mekanikle\" with Crow's \"Black-Winged Dragon\", Jack's \"Red Nova Dragon\", and his \"Shooting Star Dragon\". With this, the WRGP is finished with Team 5D's as the winner after a long tournament. However, the Grand Design is completed and the Divine Temple appears in the sky, ready to crash into New Domino City. Yusei resolves to stop the giant structure, but Sherry returns and warns him that death will await him if he boards.Ark Cradle: Final Confrontation  Despite knowing what future he may have if he went, Yusei decides to go up to Divine Temple. At first, he planned on going alone, but the rest of the team convinced him to let them go with him and fight by his side. With the help of Team Ragnarok and Vizor, they make it to Divine Temple. They were suddenly separated into three groups because of Z-one's trickery. Yusei travels with Vizor to the center of Divine Temple. Vizor and Yusei reach their Planetary Gear and find that there was no opponent there to face them. However four orbs float towards Vizor and engulf him in light, forcing a complete return of his memories. Vizor then faces Yusei and removes his visor, revealing his true identity. He identifies himself as Antinomy, who is an ally of Z-one and Yusei's opponent. Yusei is reluctant to face Antinomy, knowing that he was Bruno, but thinking of his mission and everyone that was relying on him, he accepts the Duel. ]Antinomy and Yusei mount their Duel Runners and the setting changes to outer space, where the two of them ride along a white path near a star, which becomes a black hole that the loser would be sucked into.  Antinomy begins his assault quickly by Synchro Summoning on his first turn, allowing him to draw 1 card for each . Though Yusei tries to destroy it by Synchro SummoningJunk_Berserker Junk Berserker], Antinomy blocks that attack and, during his turn, performs an Accel_Synchro_Summon Accel Synchro Summon bringing out his T.G._Blade_Blaster T.G. Blade Blaster which does a great amount of damage to Yusei, putting his life at 1600. After that, Yusei does an Accel Synchro as well and counter-attacks, decreasing Antinomy's Life Points to 1800. Antinomy then tells to Yusei that Accel Synchro is nothing more than a mere exhibit and, by putting T.G. Blade Blaster back to the Extra Deck and bringing back its material monsters, along with Synchro Summoning T.G. Recipro Dragonfly, Antinomy performs a Delta Accel Synchro, bringing out T.G. Halberd Cannon. Due to its effect, Antinomy was able to prevent Yusei from banishing his \"Shooting Star Dragon\", as well as allowing Yusei to summon a monster. However, Yusei then pulls off a combo with his weakened \"Shooting Star Dragon\" with \"Balance Shooter\" and \"Endure Soul\" to successfully defeat Antinomy. Yusei looks upon the changes of Neo Domino before entering the Cradle]As the black hole starts to absorb Yusei and Antinomy, Antinomy tells Yusei to save the world. Yusei, confused, seeing how Antinomy was trying to destroy New Domino City, asks why. Antinomy responds that despite him getting his memories back, he has seen Yusei's possibilities, and thus believes in him. Yusei calls to Antinomy as Bruno, to remind him that he was a part of Team 5D's, as well as their friend. Remembering his memories with the team, Bruno tells Yusei to master the Delta Accel Synchro. As Bruno's Duel Runner falls behind, Yusei tries to save Bruno, but Bruno reminds him that only the winner could escape. Bruno then removes his visor and uses his Runner to push Yusei out of the dimension, and falls back himself after doing so. After Yusei escapes the dimension, he sees Bruno's damaged visor and mourns over his death.  Once he caught up to his friends, he informed them of his duel with Bruno and that he showed him a way to defeat Z-one. They all found in a strange room filled with junk. Once they confronted Z-one, Aporia appeared and challenged him to a duel. However, Aporia quickly falls to the might of Z-one's and gives Yusei's Duel Runner the power of flight to fight Z-one with. Yusei receives the other from his friends and begins his battle against Z-one. Yusei battles Z-one with great skill and power, summoning his friends' Signer Dragons despite Z-one's tactics. When Yusei deals damage to Z-one, however, his mask breaks, revealing a mark similar to Yusei's mark. After Z-one explains his appearance, he Summons and overwhelms Yusei with 5 Timelords. Yusei struggles to defend himself with , but a shockwave from the Divine Temple colliding with New Domino city thrusts him off his Duel Runner. Yusei was close to giving up, but seeing his father one last time before he recovered gave him the inspiration he needed. With this he achieves and uses his friends' Signer Dragons to his final monster, , which decimates the Timelords. When Z-one counterattacks with the final Timelord, , Yusei uses his final card, . It allows him to summon his . Yusei declares that his dragon is the combined form of everyone's wishes, and it will not lose. He activates another effect of Clustering Wishes, which increases his monsters ATK by the total number of attack points for every Dragon-type Synchro Monster in his graveyard, raising his Stardust Dragon's ATK to 23000, and by sending the Signer Dragons back to his deck, he can force a battle with Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord. Thanks to his friends' dragons, Z-one's final defense has been destroyed. With the combined wishes of everyone in New Domino City, Yusei attacks with Stardust Dragon, obliterating Z-one's life points and winning the duel.  After the Crimson Dragon transports his friends away from the Divine Temple, Yusei flies at its core with the intent of sacrificing his own life to stop the structure (Believing it will be his final role to the city). Z-one then appears to redeem himself, rescuing Yusei and sacrificing himself instead. Yusei then returns to his friends, who become overjoyed to see him after his supposed death.Team 5D's Future  After his Duel with Z-one, Yusei becomes a researcher for New Domino City. However, he is unsure if he wants to continue as a researcher or continue on as a duelist. After a call with Crow, he decides to throw for all his friends. During the party, Jack challenges Yusei to a duel to regain his former title to which Yusei himself accepts. Despite a valiant effort on Jack's part, Yusei defeats Jack, who decides to leave New Domino to pursue his own future. The night before everyone goes their separate ways, Yusei shares one last moment with Akiza, who is trying to confess to him her feelings' before they leave each other. Yusei takes her hand, and the two stare into each other's eyes intimately. Yusei decides to stay in New Domino to protect it, as he says farewell to Akiza, who has decided to study medicine abroad, Crow, who has decided to leave to return to dueling, and to Leo & Luna, who are leaving to live with their parents. With one last ride together, Crimson Dragon appears and removes all the Signer marks, allowing the heroes, including Yusei, to move on to their respective futures, without the heavy destiny of protecting the world anymore.3D Bonds Beyond Time  Yusei appears in Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time, where he joins forces with Yugi Muto and Jaden Yuki to face off against Paradox, a Turbo Duelist who can travel through time, and to save \"Stardust Dragon\", who was stolen. While Yusei is riding with Jack Atlas and Crow Hogan, he is suddenly challenged to a Turbo Duel by Paradox. Yusei quickly Summons \"Stardust Dragon\" by tuning his Junk Synchron with Junk Warrior. Paradox, however, has been waiting for this, as he uses his powers to capture \"Stardust Dragon\" and turn him to a \"Malefic\" monster. Paradox bids Yusei farewell & tells him to perish along with his era, as he disappears into the past. Yusei, Jack and Crow look through the archives to find where Paradox disappeared to, until they find a record of \"Stardust Dragon\" attacking a duelist named Jaden Yuki in Venice. Bringing all of the Signers together, they summon the Crimson Dragon, who opens a hole in time into the past. Yusei then follows the dragon into the past to Jaden's time. The Crimson Dragon intercepts \"Stardust Dragon\"'s attack at Jaden and \"Elemental Hero Neos\", disappearing in the process. Paradox is confused by Yusei's appearance in the past, as Yusei looks at \"Stardust Dragon\" before Paradox takes his leave. Jaden, glad to have survived, tells Yusei what Paradox's true intentions are to kill Maximillion Pegasus, thus preventing the creation of Duel Monsters to change the future. Using Jaden's powers, the two travel to the time of Yugi Muto, only to find Paradox attacking an event where Pegasus was giving away cards to young children. Paradox attacked the crowd with Cyber End Dragon, killing almost everybody, including Pegasus, and Yugi's grandfather, Solomon Muto. Yugi was the only survivor amongst the ruins, as he mourned over his grandfather's death. Yusei and Jaden confront Yugi and ask for his help against Paradox. Yugi agrees to help. The three travel 30 minutes back in time. Paradox arrived at the event again, but this time, was confronted by Yusei, Jaden, and Yugi. Although they tried to persuade him to stop, Paradox refuses to do so, and a 3-on-1 Duel begins with Yugi, Jaden and Yusei sharing 4000 Life Points. Yusei shows his skills as a Synchro duelist by Summoning \"Junk Gardna\". However, after Yugi manages to rescue \"Stardust Dragon\" and destroy Paradox's \"Malefic Paradox Dragon\", Paradox Special Summons his most powerful card, \"Malefic Truth Dragon\". He then fuses himself with the dragon, and destroys all of Yusei, Jaden and Yugi's monsters on the field. Yusei loses hope and prepares to surrender, until Yami Yugi and Jaden manage to convince him to keep fighting until the end. With new hope, Yusei manages to re-Summon the monsters Paradox destroyed in his last turn and gets a power boost from trap cards played by Yami Yugi and Jaden, increasing \"Stardust Dragon's\" ATK to 10000, allowing him to destroy \"Malefic Truth Dragon\" and defeat Paradox. With Paradox defeated, all the damage he caused is repaired. Yusei bids farewell to Yugi and Jaden, before returning to his own timeline, where his friends await. Yusei vows to protect the future so he can meet Yugi and Jaden again. In this non-canon episode, Yusei has a nother Turbo Duel with his rival, Jack Atlas. During the duel, both Yusei and Jack summon their ace monsters and evolve them with Assault Mode Activate, creating Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode and Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode. Although Jack struggles to defeat his rival, Yusei still ultimately wins, by attacking Red Dragon Archfiend with the combo of Stardust Dragon with Skill Successor and Synchro Destructor. This episode was also released to help promote the Crimson Crisis set, as many of the cards used in this duel was from the Crimson Crisis set.Jack  Jack Atlas Jack jack Jack jack jack jack jack jack jack jack jack jack. He Big  Both Yusei and Crow have been friends since they were kids growing up. The two trust each other as much as Jack and Yusei trust each other. However, there are instances where Yusei and Crow will disagree with each other. Despite this though, Yusei and Crow still respect the other's decision and support each other. Kalin KesslerKalin  Yusei met Kalin back at a young age when he was in a group known as The Enforcers with Jack and Crow. Kalin was the leader of this group, and it is said by Jack that all three of them thought of Kalin as their \"Savior\". Yusei has a higher respect and concern for Kalin than Jack and Crow, as he was the only one who stayed when The Enforcers separated. He tried to give himself up to Security in order to save Kalin from punishment. Even after Kalin attempted to take his life, Yusei continued to try to save him. Later in the series, after Kalin's Resurrection, Yusei received a letter and headed out to Crash Town to bring Kalin to his senses, after he claimed he wanted to die in a duel.Crow  Yusei and Crow have been friends since they were children. The two trust each other as much as Jack and Yusei trust each other. However, there are instances where Yusei and Crow will disagree with each other. Despite this though, Yusei and Crow still respect the other's decision and support each other.Leo and Luna  Leo and Luna helped Yusei have a place to stay after he escaped Sector Security. The two look up to Yusei as an older brother or father figure, since their real ones are not with them most of the time. In the English dub, however, Yusei lost his memory and Leo called him, \"Mister Amnesia Man\". Leo also said that he was a superhero, while Luna insisted that he was a knight in shining armor. Leo seems to idolize Yusei, as he is always trying to help Yusei. When Yusei was going to Turbo Duel Greiger, Leo snuck into his garage to see his Duel Runner to help Yusei. The twins both look up to Yusei for his strength, courage, and protectiveness of his friends.Akiza  akis a lesbian i know this because i work at konamiSherry  Starting from Season 2, Sherry showed an interest in having Yusei joining her WRGP Team and seen in later episodes trying to convince him to join. However, despite her attempts, Yusei refuses, saying that he will win the tournament with his friends. Despite this, the two are on good terms with each other and can even work together in a Duel. Yusei cares for her safety, always trying to convince her to not get too close to the tournament because of the danger; he even tries to save her when he, her and Bruno are launched into space. In short, the two are good friends despite their agendas.Bruno  husbab \"leaving Yusei in tears screaming his name\" unlike the other times he screamed bruno's name if you knowwhati meanTrivia  - Yusei's catchphrases: \"Is that so?\" in the Japanese version, usually before making his game winning move. \"Let's rev it up!\" in the English dub, typically when summoning Junk Warrior.  - Yusei's summoning chants: \"Clustering hopes will become a new shining star! Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Take flight, Stardust Dragon!\" \"Clustering the shine of stars will illuminate a new miracle! Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Arrive in light, Savior Star Dragon!\" \"Clustering crystal dreams open the door to a new evolution! Become the path its light shines upon! Accel Synchro! Be Born, Shooting Star Dragon!\" \"Clustering stars become one, as new bonds will enlighten the future! Become the path its light shines upon! LIMIT OVER ACCEL SYNCHRO! Light of evolution, Shooting Quasar Dragon!\" \"Clustering stars will call upon a new force! Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Show yourself, Junk Warrior!\" \"Clustering minds will now become a new force! Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Blaze on, Nitro Warrior!\" - Yusei's defeat at the hands of Akiza sparked much contraversy in 5D's. As the protagonist, Yusei is arguably the best duelist, boasting a near perfect record. His loss to Akiza is depicted in a way to clearly show a strong and valient Yusei defeated in a most disgraceful manner. The match ended Akiza defeating and humiliating Yusei, forcing him to assume a pose that involves him getting on all fours and begging for mercy. Fans often ridicule Yusei, joking that when Akiza cracks her whip, Yusei gets on knees, bend down, and sticks butt up. Yusei shares this trait with his predecessor, Yuma. Both Yusei and Yuma demonstrates \u00a0pride and arrogance, which resulted in their \u00a0defeats. To balance his arrogance, every time they lose a duel, Yusei and Yuma are forced to assume shameful pose where they fall IM GOING TO TELEPORT INSIDE OF OPS SKIN AND MASSACRE THEIR BONES - Yusei is prone to One-Turn Killing his opponents, notably with Nitro Warrior. At the beginning of the Crash Town arc, Yusei does a One-Turn Three Kill with his Nitro Warrior. - He is named after the Planetary Particle (Yuusei Ryuushi) which his father discovered. Like the particle, which joined every other particle together, his father wanted Yusei to be someone who could join other people together through bonds - which is exactly what he became.  - Yusei has several signature moves: Always changes across the series. Junk Warrior, then the entirety of the Stardust line, and finally Junk Warrior again. In the series' finale, it becomes apparent that they symbolize Yusei's current position. Back when he used Junk Warrior at the Satellite, he was focused on being the center of his friends' bonds. Throughout the series, his regrets and self-sacrifices make him closer to the Stardust theme of self-sacrifice, while still having the characteristics from Junk Warrior. At the end of the show, with every problem solved, he's closer to Junk Warrior again. - In the dub episode 2, it was revealed that Yusei has a phobia to insects. He overcame the fear at the end of the episode - In the Japanese version, Yusei's criminal mark was added by a laser, causing him to scream in pain. After the mark is in place, the machine retracts upwards and Yusei falls forward on his face. the two attendants pick him up (with one of them grabbing him by the hair); The judge tells him that this mark means he has no rights to livelihood. Yusei looks at him angrily, almost growling. In the English, it sprays a dye on his face. Yusei asks if it's supposed to tickle; the judge replies that it's supposed to make sure they can keep an eye on him. - Yusei is quite skilled in karate, as shown in episode 25, when he single handedly fought through several security guards.  - Between the 3 protagonists, Yusei shares the most similaritties with Yugi, in terms of personality, while directly contrasting Jaden. He's is geneerally much more calm and less impulsive than Yugi. When Turbo Dueling, he becomes a much more composed individual, and several times when he is or has been in danger. Like Yami Yugi, he also exihibit much pride and confidence, to which, at certain points, can be percieved as arrogance.Yu-Gi-Oh 5ds Wiki  HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHWelcome to card games on bikes.

See Help:Administrators' how-to guide for a guide on using admin functions.Becoming an administrator  For you to become an administrator, someone with bureaucrat access must make you one. On larger Wikia, there will usually be a community page for requests, with a page name such as \"Yu-Gi-Oh 5ds Wiki:Requests for adminship\". On a smaller wiki, you may simply ask on the community portal or Forum, or ask a bureaucrat directly on his or her talk page. If there are no active bureaucrats and you wish to become an administrator or adopt the wiki, please contact the community staff. If there are other active editors but no active bureaucrats/admins, you should first discuss with them on who should become an admin, whether it be one of you, or all of you.What can administrators not do?  Administrators should not use their administrator powers to settle editing disputes; for example, to lock a page on a version he or she prefers in an editing dispute that isn't vandalism. Administrator powers should be used to help keep the wiki clear of vandalism, spam, and users who make malicious edits, but not for simple disagreements between users acting in good faith. Ideally an admin shouldn't be considered \"in charge\". The ideal admin is just someone who is trusted to have a few extra buttons and to use them for the benefit of the Wikia community.", "Ultimate Yugioh 5D's Wiki": "Ultimate Yugioh 5D's Wiki ", "\u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "\u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "N Terraria Wiki": "N Terraria Wiki ", "More Stuff Mod Terraria Wiki": "More Stuff Mod Terraria Wiki ", "Gente para jugar terraria Wiki": "Gente para jugar terraria Wiki ", "Information of Terraria \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "Information of Terraria \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "Michaels Terraria Wiki": "Michaels Terraria Wiki ", "\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0441\u044b \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0438--\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0441\u044b \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0438--\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "About Terraria Wiki": "About Terraria Wiki ", "More terraria Wiki": "More terraria Wiki ", "The Unofficial Terraria Wiki": "The Unofficial Terraria Wiki ", "Lostlorn Mod Terraria Wiki": "Lostlorn Mod Terraria Wiki ", "Wiki Terraria Wiki": "Wiki Terraria Wiki ", "\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0438!

Bureaucrats can also give users the ability to \"rollback\" edits not made in good faith.Staff and Janitors  Some Wikia staff members have full access to all Wikia. They will be shown in Special:Listusers/staff on any wiki. Wikia janitors have limited administrator access to all Wikia for cleanup purposes. These users will be shown on Special:Listusers/janitor on any Wikia. Please see Help:Contacting Wikia for details on how to contact Wikia staff.Who are this wiki's administrators?  The \"founder\" of a wiki, the person who first requested it, is given administrator access automatically. Founders are also given bureaucrat access so they can make any other user on their wiki an administrator or bureaucrat. For a complete list of users with administrator access, see Special:Listusers/sysop. You may also wish to list them on this page.How do I use administrator powers?  See Help:Administrators' how-to guide for a guide on using admin functions.Becoming an administrator  For you to become an administrator, someone with bureaucrat access must make you one. On larger Wikia, there will usually be a community page for requests, with a page name such as \"Project Gotham Racing Wiki:Requests for adminship\". On a smaller wiki, you may simply ask on the community portal or Forum, or ask a bureaucrat directly on his or her talk page. If there are no active bureaucrats and you wish to become an administrator or adopt the wiki, please contact the community staff. If there are other active editors but no active bureaucrats/admins, you should first discuss with them on who should become an admin, whether it be one of you, or all of you.What can administrators not do?  Administrators should not use their administrator powers to settle editing disputes; for example, to lock a page on a version he or she prefers in an editing dispute that isn't vandalism. Administrator powers should be used to help keep the wiki clear of vandalism, spam, and users who make malicious edits, but not for simple disagreements between users acting in good faith. Ideally an admin shouldn't be considered \"in charge\". The ideal admin is just someone who is trusted to have a few extra buttons and to use them for the benefit of the Wikia community.Richard1990  Hi.Site administration  Content regarding the administration of this site.About  This page is used to tell visitors all about Project Gotham Racing Wiki.

The Horde, a faction led by off-worlders and composed of outsiders has survived these obstacles by bonding together, fighting as family, comrades, or even uneasy allies. During Garrosh Hellscream's reign, the faction was plunged into a state of civil war, divided between Hellscream's pan-orc government he referred to as the \"True Horde\" and the Darkspear Rebellion, comprised of the remaining Horde races, as well as orcs that have decided to oppose Garrosh, under leadership of Vol'jin. After the Siege of Orgrimmar upon the defeat of Garrosh, Vol'jin was chosen as the new Warchief of the Horde with every leader supporting the choice, even Thrall himself. This also marks the first time, when the Warchief's position was held by a person that isn't an orc, signifying a sense of a unity between all the member races of the faction, in Vol'jin's own words - The Horde is a family. Following the disastrous Battle for Broken Shore at the start of the third invasion of the Burning Legion, Sylvanas Windrunner was named the new Warchief by a dying Vol'jin, who with his last breath said she must step out of the shadows to lead.History  In the past, the Horde referred to the orcs and their battle thralls from both Draenor and Azeroth, such as trolls and ogres. Following its utter defeat at the end of the Second War, the Horde's dark power was broken, allowing Thrall to awaken the dormant spirituality of his people and free them from the Burning Legion's control. During the events of the Third War, Thrall has made lasting bonds with the tauren chief Cairne Bloodhoof and the troll shadow hunter Vol'jin of the Darkspear tribe. The ties between the three races are very close, as both share many similar cultural views. With the help of the tauren, both the orcs and the tribe of trolls have established a place for themselves in Kalimdor. Since then, certain ogre tribes, as well as the Forsaken and blood elves have chosen to affiliate themselves with the Horde. The present Horde is mostly about surviving in a land that has come to hate them. The orcs are hated because, much like the Forsaken, they were manipulated by corrupt forces that channeled their aggression on unsuspecting foes, thus leaving behind a legacy of brutality and domination. In fact, many races of the Horde have a history of being unscrupulous. Though redeemed and trying to make amends or simply trying to survive, they are not forgiven nor trusted by many members of the Alliance who believe them to be their old selves still. The trolls, tauren and their other allies are the ones who understood them, and so they are hated for that. In the Third War, before the liberation of the Forsaken from the Scourge and the defection of the blood elves, the Horde allied themselves with the Alliance to rid Azeroth of the Burning Legion. Since then old animosity has risen again, resulting in open conflict on several battlefields, keeping relations between the Horde and Alliance in a state of Cold War. However, the two factions still officially kept a truce despite the rising conflicts until the Battle for the Undercity, when King Varian Wrynn officially declared war. By the time the mists concealing Pandaria dissipated, cracks within the Horde started to emerge. The war had intensified with the surprise mana-bombing of Theramore Isle on Garrosh's orders, the actions of which Baine Bloodhoof and Vol'jin openly disapproved of. In response, Garrosh ordered the Kor'kron to suppress any potential dissent, going as far as subjugating the Darkspear trolls on their own territory. Horde leaders were weary of Garrosh's attempts to harness the sha for his own ends, and the blood elves became increasingly discontented with Garrosh treating them as expendable in his attempts to do so. The exposure of Sunreaver agents taking orders from Garrosh eventually led to the Sunreavers' expulsion from Dalaran, stoking further recriminations from the blood elf leadership towards Garrosh. After the Thunder King's death the Darkspear Rebellion began in earnest and Horde leader after Horde leader joined it. When at last even Gallywix and the Bilgewater Cartel joined the Rebellion due to Garrosh refusing to pay them for excavating the Heart of Y'Shaarj, Garrosh re-organized his orc forces into the True Horde and, with the power of Y'Shaarj, began a genocidal campaign to conquer Azeroth and exterminate all non-orcish life. Garrosh and the True Horde were defeated in the ensuing conflict the revels and Alliance forces and Vol'jin was declared Warchief of the Horde. Under Vol'jin's command the Horde would engage against the forces of the Iron Horde and later the Burning Legion on Draenor. During the Battle for Broken Shore the Horde and Alliance worked together to prevent the Legion from securing the Broken Shore as a staging ground for their invasion. Both armies would be pushed back, King Varian Wrynn slain, and Vol'jin mortally wounded. In Vol'jin's dying moments he named Sylvanas Windrunner the new Warchief of the Horde and faced with combating the armies of the Burning Legion and the hostility of the Alliance the Horde moved forward to combat the armies of the Burning Legion. The forces of Azeroth ultimately succeed on defeating the Burning Legion during the third invasion of the Burning Legion and the Horde soon after gain the allegiance of the Highmountain tauren tribes of Highmountain and the Nightborne of Suramar.Alliance Guild  Below is a list of Alliance Guilds, listed alphabetically.Alliance  The Alliance, also known as the Grand Alliance, is one of two major political factions of the mortal races in Azeroth, its counterpart being the Horde. The Alliance consists of powerful cultures and groups bound not by desperation or necessity, but by their deep commitments to abstract concepts like nobility and justice, and, striving to represent these high ideals, its many different peoples all contribute their technical, arcane, and spiritual wisdom \"toward the goal of a just and peaceful world.\" The memories of the allegiances and idealism of the Alliance of Lordaeron -centered in the homonimous continent- served as the ultimate inspiration for the new Alliance of the present day. The modern organization has the bulk of its forces on Northern Kalimdor and the south-eastern continents of Khaz Modan and Azeroth. Some of the members of the previous Alliance are members of the Grand Alliance.History  The Alliance of Lordaeron was the union of the seven human kingdoms, along with the dwarves of Khaz Modan (which also included the gnomes of Gnomeregan) and Aerie Peak, the high elves of Quel'Thalas, and others with major political influence including the Church of the Holy Light. Aftermath of the second invasion Events of the Third War led to an alliance with both the night elves, Alliance refugees, and the Horde. This alliance of Azeroth's defenders defeated the Burning Legion at the Battle of Mount Hyjal. While the night elves and Kalimdor Alliance, led by Theramore, became permanent, tensions began to erupt with the Horde. At the crux of the Third War, the corrupted scion of Lordaeron Prince Arthas Menethil laid the Alliance of Lordaeron to waste - beginning with the murder of his father and the annihilation of Lordaeron itself. He attacked Quel'Thalas shortly after, ransacking the elven homeland and nearly scouring the high elves from Azeroth. The survivors of this massacre proclaimed themselves blood elves in honor of their peoples' fall, and joined the Alliance resistance in Lordaeron prior to abandoning it due to racism on behalf of its commander. The Alliance resistance also fell apart after falling to treachery from Sylvanas and her Forsaken. With Lordaeron's fall and the devastation of the northern kingdoms, the rebuilt city of Stormwind became the new base of the Alliance, with the Ironforge dwarves becoming their staunchest and closest geographical allies. The gnomes of Gnomeregan had been unable to help in the Third War as they were dealing with their own issues closer to home \u2014 namely a trogg invasion of their city. Because an invasion of troggs paled in comparison to the might of the Scourge, the gnomes decided they would fight their war alone. In the end they were forced to flee Gnomeregan and with their king, Gelbin Mekkatorque, settled in Ironforge with the dwarves as refugees. Indebted to their allies for their hospitality in their time of need, the gnomes again offered their services to the Alliance. The night elves, dealing with the loss of their immortality and having been exposed to the world outside their forests once more, decided they would have to make alliances with the wider world. Because of the animosity with the orcs for their continuing lumbering of Warsong Gulch, the night elves in the end joined the Alliance. In the absence of his liege Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider, the regent of Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar Theron, looked into a number of potential alliances, though after failed renegotiations with the Alliance, opted not to rejoin it a third time\u2014instead allying with the reformed Horde. A small number of high elves who did not become sin'dorei have chosen to rejoin the Alliance in recent times. However, the night elves in particular took it upon themselves to warn their new Alliance allies of the high elves; the Highborne's part in bringing about the War of the Ancients figured heavily in the night elves' retelling of high elf history. A few years later, the draenei joined the Alliance. Stranded a world away from home, they are trying to establish a new base on Azeroth from the wreckage of the Exodar as well as gain the trust and cooperation of the Alliance. During the events of the Cataclysm, another race joined the ranks of the Alliance: the worgen of Gilneas, and upon the parting of the Mists of Pandaria and concurrent to full-scale global escalation of the Alliance-Horde war, the Tushui Pandaren also joined.Blood Elf  Blood elves (or sin'dorei, \"children of the blood\" in Thalassian \u2014 pronounced [\u02c8si\u02d0nd\u0254ra\u026a], [si\u02d0n\u02c8d\u0254ra\u026a] or [si\u02d0nd\u0254re\u026a]) are high elves who changed their name after the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas. Their new name is a dirge, referencing both the blood of their many brethren who fell during the Third War, and their royal lineage. For nearly 7,000 years, high elven society centered on the sacred Sunwell, a magical fount that was created using a vial of pure arcane energy from the first Well of Eternity. Nourished and strengthened by the Sunwell\u2019s potent energies, the high elves\u2019 enchanted kingdom of Quel\u2019Thalas prospered within the verdant forests north of Lordaeron.Blood Elf History  During the Third War, however, the high elves were nearly scoured from Azeroth. Led by the death knight Arthas, a Scourge army stormed into Quel\u2019Thalas, slaughtering almost ninety percent of the kingdom\u2019s population. Arthas then used the mystical Sunwell to resurrect the fallen necromancer Kel\u2019Thuzad, irrevocably tainting the fount in the process. Fearing that the befouled well would obliterate his dwindling race, Prince Kael\u2019thas Sunstrider gathered a group of Quel\u2019Thalas\u2019s defenders and destroyed the fount to avert catastrophe. Although the high elves were spared from continued exposure to the Sunwell\u2019s dark energies, in the fount\u2019s absence they suffered terribly from withdrawal. As a result, Kael\u2019thas desperately searched for a means to help his people\u2014whom he had renamed the blood elves\u2014and thus he set out for the shattered world of Outland. There he allied with the renegade demon Illidan Stormrage in the hopes of finding a cure for the blood elves\u2019 crippling withdrawal. Kael\u2019thas had assured his people that one day he would return to Quel\u2019Thalas and lead them to paradise, yet time revealed that his promises were nothing more than lies. On Outland, the prince became twisted due to his reliance on fel energy, the dark and corrupting essence wielded by the demonic Burning Legion itself. Unbeknownst to Illidan, Kael\u2019thas also came under the sway of the Legion\u2019s commander, Kil\u2019jaeden. At the bidding of his new master, the wayward prince eventually returned to Azeroth and seized the site of the Sunwell, hoping to use the fount as a means to usher Kil\u2019jaeden into the world. Ultimately, Kael\u2019thas was slain before his recklessness could bring ruin to Azeroth. In the wake of Kil\u2019jaeden\u2019s defeat, the draenei prophet Velen purified the Sunwell with the Light-infused heart of a fallen naaru, transforming the fount into a source of both holy and arcane energies. Inspired by the Sunwell\u2019s rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race\u2019s history. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel\u2019Thalas. Yet only time will tell if the blood elves can avoid repeating the tragic mistakes of their past.Guilds and Groups Guilds  A guild is a group of people united under one banner, one name, and one cause.

The hearts and spirits that she has touched throughout her long lifetime will forever keep a piece of one of Azeroth's kindest spirits with them as the world goes forward into the cataclysmic abyss. Some might call her the lucky one not to have to know the horrors that now plague the land she once revered so greatly, but those who knew her would know that if she were alive today, she would be among the first at the front lines in defense of her homelands, both with her claws to her enemies and her spiritual healing words to those lost and seeking peace. Her long life was not without great tragedy, great honor, and great love. The Horde grows a little weaker with the loss of this enigmatic Shu'halo. Rest In Peace, Adalina Crowfeather. You will be missed.History  Adalina's history is hardly a mystery though it is complex which is why she only tells those wishing to know key points about it. She was born to a tribe of arctic-bred Tauren who roamed the snowy lands of Winterspring. They called themselves the Snowhoof Tribe. Adalina was the only daughter of Tiahu and Kucha Snowhoof, who gave her the birth name Pahoja. As a youth the Druids of the Snowhoof easily saw that the Earth Mother's gift was strong in her and so it was in her pre-adolescence that she was brought to Moonglade to begin learning the arts under the guidance of the Cenarion Circle. She spent into adolescence under the teaching of the Cenarion Circle until the pilgrimage of all young Tauren Druids to Thunder Bluff. Though many of her companions had originally come from Mulgore, she was awe inspired when first she stepped hooves into the towering capitol. There she met the Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem who gave her the task of accompanying his tribemate, Dela Runetotem, to the Sin'dorei land where she would begin the effort of healing Quel'thalas of the Dead Scar. Upon arrival in Silvermoon she parted ways with Dela Runetotem and found herself essentially alone in terms of companionship. To her surprise there were no other Druids assigned to Eversong Woods. It was not long in her stay that she was greeted by a young aspiring Sin'dorei priestess by the name of Aislin Morningfire and her sister, Seiria Morningfire. The fabric of frienship was soon woven and Aislin introduced Pahoja to her house's lords, paladin and mage brothers with the last name of Kaleron. The noble House Kaleron welcomed Pahoja with open arms and into their ranks she earned a place. Within the House Kaleron, Pahoja was educated in the history of the Sin'dorei where she begain to grow an admiration for their people. As time passed Pahoja's name and her efforts became commonplace among the Sin'dorei. She met Trolls, Orcs, and even became familiar with those who call themselves the Forsaken. Among the Sin'dorei her ability to learn quickly and gift to see things in a light brighter than most, she earned renown within the noble house. In the coming months the power of the noble houses prospered. That prosperity blossomed into greater alliances whereupon the Grand Council of Silvermoon was born and Pahoja was granted a voice among them, due mostly to her continued efforts at the Dead Scar. In her personal life she'd watched as her friend, Aislin, began to fall in love with one of the house Nobles, Raehvin Kaleron, and it was not long before she was requested to officiate the marriage between the two. As she had begun to grow familiar with the politicians and magisters of Silvermoon so, too, did she begin to learn of the Blood Knights. One aspiring knight in particular, Maelthas Bloodhawk, had since woven into the fabric of frienship that was held between Pahoja, Aislin, and Seiria. Time of prosperity among the Sin'dorei passed. Aislin Morningfire was nearing the honor of Silvermoon's High Priestess, Lady Liadrin had taking a shine to Maelthas Bloodhawk's loyal and powerful leadership skills, Seiria Morningfire had earned a place in command amongst the Farstriders, yet Pahoja's renown with the Cenarion Circle was beginning to wane. Her lack of success with the Dead Scar was beginning to frustrate the Night Elf leaders of the Cenarion who refused to accept that the corruption of the seemingly simple Dead Scar ran too deeply for Pahoja to discover how to heal. It wasn't until accusations and rumors within the Cenarion Circle that Pahoja was consorting with the Sin'dorei that she withdrew her commission from them. Though now without the support of the Cenarion Circle, she continued to work to try and heal the land. She was not entirely abandoned by several of the Tauren and Night Elves from the Circle, however, and it wasn't long before she was called upon to join the ranks of the Cenarion Expedition to assist with efforts in Draenor. Hesitantly and with skeptical ties, she agreed.  The shadow of misfortune began to fall over Silvermoon. Pahoja sat back to observe that the wall of prosperity she'd helped build began to crumble. Aislin and Raehvin Kaleron's relationship began to wilt,Seiria Morningfire had become nearly a criminal in the eyes of the Blood Knights now led temporarily by Maelthas Bloodhawk due to Lady Liadrin's reassignment to Shattrath City. With rumors of Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider possibly betraying the Horde and his people, the Sin'dorei society was unravelling. The noble houses were falling and, soon, the Grand Council was no more. Wisdom and experience not to be lost, Maelthas Bloodhawk welcomed Pahoja among the Blood Knights as an official agent. Wrought with despair over the loss of his nobility, unfactual rumors of his wife's infidelity, and the downturn of the people, Raehvin Kaleron surrendered his life to the Twisting Nether. Aislin Morningfire was then thrust into depression, longing for the return of her husband, and it was Pahoja she turned to for help though the young Druid could offer little solace. It was then that Aislin met a Forsaken of the Royal Apothecary Society in the Undercity. With the Forsaken's guidance and assistance, the two tore a hole in the Nether to bring Raehvin Kaleron back to the realm of reality. They were seemingly successful but Aislin hadn't realized the Forsaken's plot to release a dark, unseen force, which she had inadvertently helped him accomplish. In the events that followed it was discovered that the Raehvin they had released was, in fact, a dark remnant of the real Raehvin's conscious and with him had come a vicious demon that had begun a merciless slaughter by means of using others bodies in the fashion of a puppetmaster. Aislin, Seiria, Pahoja, and Maelthas banded together once again in the effort of destroying the demon and, though successful, the loss was great. The replica of Raehvin was destroyed but in doing so Aislin, too, was slain. It was Pahoja's difficult effort of officiating over the priestess' funeral at her cottage home in Ashenvale. Because the demon had devoured the priestess' very soul, she was heartbroken to tell a pleading Maelthas that she could not bring her back from the dead. Demon fallen and dead buried, the remaining three returned to Silvermoon with hopes that time would heal. Sadly time was not fortunate to them. The rumors surrounding the betrayal of Prince Kael'thas were finally confirmed. Chaos erupted on the streets of Silvermoon. The Blood Knights, still under the Knight Lord Maelthas' command, became targets of the very people they swore to protect. Civil war had nearly fallen upon the streets. Now two months since the High Priestess was buried, Maelthas came to Pahoja, pleading for there to be a way to restore Aislin's life. Unable to turn away her friend, she vowed to succeed and began research. In doing so she discovered that a soul could, in fact, be rebuilt from the foundation of a kin's soul. So it was with Seiria that Pahoja met, in secrecy, and informed her of Maelthas' wish. Seiria agreed to sacrifice herself to save the life of her sister, knowing that it would do so of the people as well. Knowing that Maelthas would not allow this, the two operated in secret, and Pahoja returned with Seiria to Moonglade where she put the hunter into a deep sleep to be guarded by what companions of the Cenarion Circle she still held. Pahoja worked quickly to gather the remaining reagents that would be required. After doing so she returned to Moonglade and performed the rite that would sacrifice Seiria's life. All in order, she returned with Maelthas to Aislin's burial site and the exhausting ritual was held. With success the priestess was risen though in a fit of shock she attacked Pahoja and took from the Druid her left eye. Upon returning to Silvermoon, Maelthas utilized his mastery over the crafting of gems and fashioned a prosthetic eye for Pahoja which she still wears to this day. Before long Maelthas and Aislin begain to question Pahoja about the whereabouts of the missing Seiria. Unable to keep the secret from her friends any longer, she submitted the truth of what she had to do. Despite everything, she was cast from the cloth of friendship. Her ties to the Blood Knights were stripped from her and Aislin turned her back. In time her grace in Silvermoon entirely, all she had worked for, fell. She was looked down upon, scowled toward, and cast out of the city to live in the woods. In time she abandoned Quel'thalas entirely, retreating to the rolling Hillsbrad Foothills where she adopted a life under her feline form with a group of leopards in the region. Spirit broken, she used this time to reattach herself to the land and the spirits, strengthening her resolve and making her anew. Months passed in the life among the Hillsbrad leopards before she felt reborn. With a fond parting to her feline companions she made the long pilgrimage back to Moonglade where she held audience with Keeper Remulos. Remulos, in the presence of the other high ranking Night Elves and Tauren of the Cenarion Circle, praised Pahoja's deeds in the past and her resolve to resume what she had begun. He rewarded her with a place among the Cenarion's coveted, elite Guardians of Cenarius. He noted, too, her reborn spirit and unto her gave the name Adalina Crowfeather. Old life abandoned though not forgotten she returned to Quel'thalas to find it a world she barely remembered. Her old friends were long gone and relative peace had returned to the city. There she has been living ever since, fighting alongside the Sin'dorei and the Horde on the front lines of Northrend, hoping that somewhere among the Scourge lies the answer to what the Lich King had done to Eversong Woods. An uneasy peace reigned for the majority of time after Adalina's return to Quel'thalas. She reconnected with the spirits of Eversong Woods and once again began building her renown among the Sin'dorei. It wasn't long before she became familiar with other Shu'halo who had found their way to the northern Elven country, particularly two Grimtotem known as Rothain Highmesa and Mik'aquo, whom was affectionately nicknamed \"Cedar\", and a mage learning Nature's path who was known as Eragios, who became her closest companions. After introduced to her aspirations of healing the Dead Scar, the other three were quick in their vow to join Adalina and assist her. Peace comes with war, however, and word of a rogue Grimtotem soon travelled to Quel'thalas. A Grimtotem who had discovered ways to bring the Emerald Nightmare from within its confines of the Emerald Dream, pent on purging the world of what he considered the Earth Mother's greatest sickness: the citizens of Azeroth. Given the low population of guardians, that Grimtotem targeted Quel'thalas to be the staging area for his attempts. It was not long before something began to emerge within the walls of Silvermoon. The Elves began to grow angered and violent, often lashing out at benign things, fighting each other without warning or preamble, and appearing to have lost their minds. It was then that Adalina met a representative of the Royal Apothecary Society in Silvermoon who came to her to warn her that he had discovered the source of the madness: a plague. Knowing that the Apothecary was well versed in plagues, Adalina had no choice but to believe him. Together, along with her companions, the Apothecary set out to discover the source of the plague only to find out that its origin was of nature itself, tainted with the madness of the Emerald Nightmare. It could be spread by any means of contact and worked so quickly to kill the host that Adalina wondered if a cure might even be possible. Not to be deterred by shattered hope, she began to devise a defense against the now dubbed Emerald Plague.  Attempt after attempt failed, Adalina and her companions began to grow worried. Though the mage among them had managed to devise a spell which would kill the spores of the fungus in an infected victim, the plague was spreading faster than they could cure it. Finding less and less outlets in which she could seek answers, she set out to Moonglade where she met with a council of Elders at theGathering of Druids. There she was introduced to an elder Plagueshifter named Wyldhorn. With reluctance, Elder Wyldhorn agreed to assist the troubled Druid. In Quel'thalas Wyldhorn was able to sanction a region of Eversong Woods where she blessed the land and made it a haven where the sick could come and await, safely, their salvation. Hope was upon Adalina once more until she began to see just how many of the sick were being brought to the haven. They numbered in the hundreds from all across the Eastern Kingdoms. Not to be undone, Adalina charged Eragios to train other mages in the painful curing of the sick while she and Rothain Highmesa wandered outside of Quel'thalas in search of an answer. It was during these travels that they came across a dragon of the Green Dragonflight who called herself Ysondre. Seeing Ysondre in such a state of madness, Adalina and Rothain suspected that she, too, had become infected by the Grimtotem's Emerald Plague and so set forth to free her from her torment. It was then that they met the Death Knights of the Forgotten Legion. A tenuous pact between the two Druids and the Death Knights was formed for the sole purpose of killing Ysondre. A battle like no other waged. Ysondre would not yield easily. The dragon could not contend with the might of the others, however, and fell to the ground, slain. The Death Knights, as a trophy, severed the head of the massive beast after the Druids performed their prayers. Something fell from the throat of the beast; a black sphere which Adalina and Rothain could easily sense was deeply corrupted by the Emerald Nightmare. Even with their warnings, the Death Knights assumed ownership of the corrupted orb. The Nightmare's magic worked quickly. By the end of that same night the Death Knights, feeling as though they had been cursed by their collection of the item, plead with Adalina to cure them. Adalina saw this opportunity of possibility the cleansing of the orb may unlock the mystery of the plague in her homeland. So, against Rothain's advice, the two Druids guided the Death Knights to Moonglade where Adalina came before Remulos once again to seek his help. Remulos took the corrupted orb with great haste and threw it vengefully into the waters of Lake Elune'ara. What happened next many have debated Adalina's sincerity regarding. An image of Malfurion Stormrage himself appeared from within the lake's depths. To Remulos and the Druids he warned that the Emerald Nightmare was seeking a new host to be freed from the Emerald Dream. Naturally it was only then made clear that the Emerald Plague's creator was the host of that corrupted power's attempt. Malfurion offered to the Druids passage into the Emerald Dream where he gave unto them Emerald Acorns. Curious and hope renewed, Adalina returned quickly to Quel'thalas and began to make the acorns into what could be used on others, then brought these salves to the haven where she administered them among the sick. To her great relief, the attempt was a success. Slowly but surely does the last remnants of the Emerald Plague settle into extinction. The creator of the Emerald Plauge, the mysterious Grimtotem, was never found. News of Adalina and her friends' efforts to defeat the Emerald Plague spread far and drew the attention of Shu'halo from all over. Many traveled to Silvermoon to meet her and some even stayed to join in the effort of healing the\u00a0Dead Scar which Adalina could once again place all of her focus on. Before too long the Eversong Tribe was born. Through a series of months-long trials and errors, the tribe discovered how to neutralize the Scourge corruption in the soil. It took a great deal of time to treat every inch of the Dead Scar, and Adalina will be the first to confess of her uncertainty regarding its success, but the haunted soil was prepared to allow nature to reclaim her land and grow anew. This mission complete, Adalina set forth to migrate the tribe out of her longtime home and rejoin her kin in the plains of Mulgore. It was a long and arduous journey but the tribe eventually managed upon Thunder Bluff where Adalina made it a quick purpose to introduce herself to the local tribal chiefs in an effort to secure friendship. What she discovered, instead, was a people with whom she had no relation. She was shocked to learn that many of the Old Ways of their peoples' culture to which she still dearly held seemed to be all but forgotten in the others. Coupled with her ties and habits brought upon by a lifetime among the Blood Elves, she began to feel increasingly alien among her own kind.  The tribesmen eventually began to separate, taking advantage of their newfound peace to pursue their personal endeavors. One by one the tribe became smaller and eventually Adalina was forced to call an end to the band of brothers that'd bonded for the sake of their Earth Mother. The decision was bittersweet, for Adalina had been contemplating returning back to the familiar people of Quel'thalas, unable to comprehend the new and more violent ways of the Kalimdor Shu'halo tribes. Feeling that the Orcs had influenced their culture too greatly, Adalina packed up her belongings and returned to the familiarity of the Golden City. Upon her arrival to Silvermoon she learned of a time-honored school for the Blood Elves had reawakened from hibernation and was seeking knowledgable minds and those eager to learn from them. She had always enjoyed offering her counsel to the Blood Elves in the past, and so, a formal meeting with the headmistress of the\u00a0Silvermoon Academy granted her a place among them with a new purpose based solely on nurturing the minds of the students within the challenging curriculums of the Academy's professors. Peace and balance reigned within Adalina once again and remained prevalent for a great deal of time. It was not until the late winter of that year she began to feel another calling. She'd begun making regular trips to Thunder Bluff where she began making friends and forming ties with the honored Earthspear Tribe in the land. The tribe's Elder Seer, Kokochu Winterhoof, and Adalina began to form the strong bonds of friendship. Realizing the two came from brethren tribes that shared the snowy northern Winterspring land and carrying the traditions of their ancestors together, it is that bond which motivated her aid to the Earthspear when Kokochu challenged Huatar Earthspear for the rights of Chieftain over the tribe. Even after victory does Adalina act as an unofficial advisor to the Earthspear, feeling it her honor to offer them what aid she can as a Shu'halo. As she'd begun to wonder what drives her to commune with her new Mulgore friends, it was one day a trip to The Barrens which was the catalyst for it all to begin making sense. It was a shock to her senses to see, mixed beneath the golden longstem grass that had been the life of The Barrens for generations that a carpet of green was growing as far as the eye could see. Concerned and excited, she sought the opinion of other Shu'halo to include Kokochu and most of them hailed the change as a wonderous victory. Adalina was not convinced, however. The speed at which the green grass was growing went against all of her grand knowledge of natures' spirits' ways. Attempt to commune with the land's spirits, also, revealed nothing. The spirits were silent. It was one night speaking with Kokochu in the main hut on Elder Rise that, seemingly randomly, her old friend Elder Wyldhorn arrived. Adalina and Wyldhorn held a brief, warm reunion when Adalina told the Plagueshifter of the changes that she had been witnessing. Wyldhorn, in turn, informed Adalina that the fungal life in Felwood was also randomly beginning to change with no word from the land's spirits. Wyldhorn and Adalina together decided to send a calling to the Shu'halo Druids of Azeroth to reconvene the Druid Council under Elder Wyldhorn's guidance. Adalina then returned to Silvermoon City and her duties to her Sin'dorei friends, though continued to make regular trips to Thunder Bluff to aid and visit with her Earthspear friends as well. It was during one of those visits that Kokochu confessed to Adalina that he was beginning to share her concern regarding the changes of the land. He informed her of quakes that had begun to rock Mulgore and could not get answers from the elements. Adalina began to piece events together, from the seemingly random desire to come to Thunder Bluff where she met her Earthspear friends, then the discovery of the changes, the return of Wyldhorn, and her concern worsened. After returning to Silvermoon, sitting inside the Wayfarer's Rest Tavern, the ground quaked and shook the building. All activity stopped and silence blanketed the room before a second and more powerful quake occurred, toppling elves and tables. Shaken and recovering, all eyes turned on a wordless and shocked Adalina. Her concern, at that moment, turned into fear. It was that which led her, then, to pack her belongings and depart Quel'thalas to pursue this mystery. To Mulgore her travels landed her where, after a great deal of convincing by the new Chieftain of the Earthspear Tribe, Adalina finally joined among them. Tribal life began to reintegrate itself into her as easily as it had left her. The memories of life in the Snowhoof began to resurface and peace began to swell in her veins. Before long it was decided that the Earthspear tribe had adopted its own identity, away from what the Earthspear once was. That was when it was reborn to be known as The Stormtotem Tribe. ((MORE\u00a0UPDATES\u00a0AS\u00a0RP\u00a0PROGRESSES))Lacryma Devanti  Lacryma Devanti has been many things to many different people, but in almost all of her roles she is an inveterate foe of those who would use their affluence to manipulate or harm the downtrodden.Biography Early life  Born in Tirisfal close to a century before the opening of the Dark Portal, Lacryma started her life as a devout follower of the Holy Light. During the Second War, Lacryma's family was slaughtered by the Twilight's Hammer and Black Tooth Grin Clan, which took the Elven Runestone of Caer Darrow on Gul'dan's Orders. It is generally assumed that Lacryma was captured and tortured by the Twilight's Hammer for several years before she finally escaped. What she did in the years between the Second War and the Shattering is anyone's guess, but several reports over the years have place her in Stormwind. She is considered a heretic by the Cathedral of Light, and accused of stealing several forbidden tomes and texts which detailed the teachings of Bishop Natalie Seline. Although in public eye Lacryma is considered a model Priestess and healer who preaches of the Light of the Sun and of the Blood Elves primacy, there are some who quietly mutter of a far darker history. Rumors swirl around her and spin tales that she has a far darker leaning than the priestess and healer that the public knows and remembers as the \"Voice of Solune\". Solune is a personification of the Sunwell and an idealized concept of what a model Sin'dorei ought to represent. The name was chosen to both counter the Night Elves claim of having a God, and their alleged divinity. It's stated goal is to uplift the Sin'dorei people through the tenets of Pride, Power, and Perfection. Yet some claim that Lacryma is not the Sin'dorei that she represents herself to be, and is in reality a servant of the Old God C'thun. This too may be steeped in fact since there is a rather large file on her in the Sun Spire called \"The Lightbreaker Incident\".The Lightbreaker Incident  During the Hour of Twilight when Archbishop Benedictus was discovered to be the Twilight Prophet and killed, more of Lacryma's history was revealed. Besides several correspondences to members of the Twilight Council, a ledger was found on the deceased Priest which was believed to have the names of several members of the Cult on it. According to the documents, Lacryma was a member of the Twilight's Hammer herself, who operated under the moniker \"Lightbreaker\". The document also seemed to indicate that she might of been a slave and not completely in her right mind, as it listed a control word and made mention of an artifact called a \"Scarab\". Lacryma claims that she was a victim and unwilling participant in the goals of the Twilight's Hammer. After the Magistry was unable to conclusively prove her guilt at trial, Silvermoon gave her an opportunity to prove her loyalty in exchange for her assistance in drawing out and destroying the remaining members of the Cult. To that end, Lacryma worked for several years extensively with the Horde and the Thalassian Government in stamping out all known traces of the Twilight's Hammer, operating both as a mole and as an information broker. Due to her ruthless interrogations, Lacryma soon gained the nickname \"The Inquisitor\". Although it was intended to be an insult, Lacryma took it in stride; adopting the name to honor her deceased mentor, Khaelanna D'Khael. As the second Inquisitor, Lacryma then honored her teacher by hunting down and destroying the traitorous Prophet Skarszalis Thrax, and purging Ahn'Qiraj of his influence. Lacryma claims she is motivated by a desire to atone for her past misdeeds, there are some doubt her seeming altruism; and with good cause. Rumors persist that she continues to worship the Old God C'thun in private. Considering her past, and the power of the Old Gods, it is not outside the realm of possibility. After all, she most certainly \"did\" profit from these deaths. Her Cult Scarab (a device used by Apophan to control the Cult) was removed and this in turn freed her from the threat of a sudden and explosively instantaneous death. Moreover with the blame for all of her misdeeds being passed on to Cultists that \"mentally dominated\" her, Lacryma had a perfect chance to eliminate those that were a threat to C'thun's primacy and her own agenda. Lacryma could very well of taken what she was taught by her mentor and engineered the events surrounding Apophus and Skarszalis destruction to grant her both personal and political gain. If that is true, then it would lead one to believe that her rekindled interest in Solune is tied to her service to the Old God of Chaos, C'thun. Devoted Priestess of the Sun, or deranged Cultist?Personality and trait  Lacryma is by nature a cautious and wary person, reluctant to trust people, and even more reluctant to make her thoughts known. The prime reason for this is due to the culture of corruption that often pervades Silvermoon. Having endured countless betrayals, deceptions, and attempts to slander or smear her house, she guards her family's secrets closely and keeps very few true friends. In the end, only you can decide.\u00a0\u00a0Faebelle  http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x405/Faebell/Background.png A Priestess of the light before the events took place which robbed her of her memory, Faebelle is ever searching for the paths she once took. Although the events surrounding her memory lapse remain a mystery to her, Faebelle has fit some of the pieces of her former identity together. She was a dedicated devotee to her worship to the light. A healer of sorts, she seems to always find herself bumping into people who claim she had meant something to them in her previous life. Sometimes, she wonders if it's all a trick or a dream as she can't see how she was ever the person strangers speak of. http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x405/Faebell/Appearance.png An ethereal glow seems to follow this young Priestess. A bit slighter in frame than your usual Sin'dorei, Faebelle Sweetblossom is a remarkable beauty. Long lashes frame her brilliant green eyes that always seem to be dancing about with mischief or pensive dreams. Perfectly combed locks of beige-platinum blonde cascade down over her milky shoulders and slender back. Always neat and manicured, the young Priestess is the very vision of Sin'dorei nobility. Although her dresses vary in style and color, silks and satins, one theme seems to persist in them all: that common denominator being the low and plunging laced necklines that showcase her perfect set of round and supple breasts. The young Sin'dorei never could figure which about her was so captivating to men. Was it her abnormally ample bossom that rose and fell as she breathed, was it her superfluous voice reminiscent of soft velvet crushed just the right way, or was it that mysterious, unknown glow that seemed to attract both humans and animals alike. Whatever it was, this bouncy young girl seemed quiet content in the attentions. Despite the frail appearance of her thin wrist, neck and ankles, her complexion was warm and glowing. Her cheeks were alight in a rosepetal blush similar to the honeysuckle shimmer that painted her lips. Always the proper lady, Faebelle is rarely seen without a trimly tied corset and her signature heady perfume. If one were lucky to catch a glimse of her upper foot occassionally skirting outbeneath the folds of her lavish gowns, one might see a rune of sorts embellished on her skin. Illuminated by the sunlight, the wreathed symbol would shine like sunlight itself before dissapearing into the soft complexion of her skin as her foot retreats beneath her gown. http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x405/Faebell/halo.gif http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x405/Faebell/Quotes2.png Something in your smiles speaks to me, something in your voice sings to me.

Knowing that she loved them, but that they had been stolen from her reach. http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x405/Faebell/Gallery.pngSee also External links The Lionheart Company  The Lionheart Company is a \"family\" of sorts who are the most recognised figures in the Stormwind Economic Market. While they appear as a chain of flourishing shop front owners and tavernkeeps, their real plan is on a much, much larger and more sinister scale. The guild and its members are not evil - they do not want to see Stormwind simply burn to the ground - they are more focused on helping people for the right price. The leader of the Lionhearts is one Jeth Holywrought, who often recruited those that displayed their talents in manipulating the economy of Stormwind, in particular the Black Market. The Lionhearts would often run evenings of entertainment in the Pig and Whistle Tavern in Old Town of Stormwind City, that included magic shows by the fabulous Falrick Holywrought and the serving of drinks and food by Elsiere Cunningham and the Upper Economy branch of the Company.The Parting of Ways  Recently, Jeth Holywrought announced his retirement, much to the surprise of the Company. The future of the Company was considered, however, two of Jeth's Underbosses, \"C\" and Elsiere Cunningham, had a child on the way and were in no fit position to lead to Company, while the third Underboss, Bayhas El'Sabban, had the skills, though not the experience to lead. Due to these facts, it was with a heavy heart that all employees were released from service and the Company disbanded until such a time that one would return to take the lead. Jeth, with the company of his son, Falrick, and Lady Silver, travelled west to the lands of Kalimdor to live his retirement in peace. The remaining members of the Company were left to their own devices; to continue a life of crime and murder, or to start their lives anew, no names remembered, all deeds forgotten.Lilifred Bartleby Bumblehurst  \"Believe me, there is a gnome-shaped hole in all of this and I intend to find it!\"HISTORY  \"If there's one thing I'm good at, it's walking away from bad situations I created\" Lilifred was raised an orphan in Stormwind along with her twin brother, Wolfgang. She made her living doing odd jobs and following business techniques picked up from goblins and dwarves, granting her an uncanny practicality in financial matters rarely observed in gnomes. Her mercenary career was a successful one, earning her fame, fortune and brief notoriety as the leader of the Guild With Name Pending. At the suggestion of Dr. Aestaela Lightspark, Lilifred put her name in for High Tinker, sparking an impromptu round of elections. Though most people considered her candidacy a joke in the beginning (including Lilifred herself), the mercenary leader proved herself to be a surprisingly shrewd and capable politician.When her second-in-command- Vindicator Elexine- disappeared suddenly, Lilifred dropped her former career and sought out an association with the Azerothian branch of the draenic mafia, Kamil te Kar. Using her wit and financial savvy to help the Kamil through a rough spot, Lilifred rose quickly though the ranks and was appointed Capo of Sales, in charge of PR, Black Market Relations and management of the Kamil's steadily growing treasury. She was sent to Shattrath to salvage and organize the old Kamil records as a favour to Yeva. There, she spent several months rifling through the Kamil's dirty secrets, discovering the most harrowing one of all- the truth behind Kamil te Kar's true purpose. When she returned to Azeroth, she fought her colleagues in their attempted coup against the old guard, committing several monstrous acts and losing her eye. In the end, she admitted her error. After the dissolution of the Kamil, Lilifred laid low working as a care-taker at the Stormwind Orphanage. She has recently re-emerged as a fledgling member of the Explorer's League and is currently on assignment in Northrend.APPEARANCE  Lilifred is dark skinned and bright eyed. Her delicate features are offset by thick eyebrows, a hooked nose and the perpetual quirk of her mouth; the sort of expression that says she's used to telling others that they're wrong. She fights with practiced expertise and walks with a confident swagger, however there is an inherent gracelessness to her movements that suggests she has not yet grown into her awkward, gangly limbs. Her nose looks like it's been broken a few times and her left eye has been removed and replaced with a mechanical one. The scent of cigar smoke clings to her perpetually.PERSONALITY  \"Everyone always tells me that I'm full of untapped potential or whatever bullshit.\"  Lilifred is ambitious and well-meaning, if often a little greedy. She's eloquent and glib all at once- talking to her, one gets the feeling Lilifred Bumblehurst is always attempting to find the balance between two important elements of her personality: the thoughtful businesswoman and the rowdy sellsword. She seems to have a lot more fun playing up the latter and often passes herself off as a reckless, mocking, scrappy drunkard. Get to know her a little better, however, and it becomes clear that Lilifred doesn't mean half of what she says and doesn't say half of what she means. Although few gnomes put serious stake or thought into the existence of the Light, Lilifred has a complicated relationship with religion having been raised only a hop, skip and a jump from Stormwind's glorious cathedral. She dismisses her disdain for organized religion as having to do with her scientific zeal; she does not dismiss it convincingly. Lilifred might also be something of an alcoholic. She is rarely seen without a cigar in hand.RELATIONSHIPS  \"Anyone can make a promise about anything and everything in the world, but no one possesses the power to KEEP a promise.\"  Lilifred is still close with her brother despite his... unsavory life choices. Aside from her twin, her closest friend is the former Vindicator, Vindicator Elexine. While the two women behind the Guild With Name Pending are polar opposites in both temperament and personality, their complete loyalty to each other is apparent even at the tavern table. Elexine's steadfast belief in the goodness of people and hope for the future once kept the sometimes morally dodgy Lilifred on the straight and narrow, however their relationship has become unfortunately fraught with complications since Elexine was killed in battle and revived as a Death Knight. Nevertheless, they remain sisters in heart and soul, if not in blood. Although she has lost contact with may of her former guildmates due to unnecessary life choices, Lilifred still has a very fond place in her heart for her former employees in the Guild With Name Pending, especially Xyria Gunsmoke-Gerals who has become a trusted leader in her own right. Lilifred has intentionally kept her distance from the various members of the Kamil in an attempt to hedge her bets, prevent blackmail situations and keep her involvement in the mob \"nothing more than business\". Despite her best efforts, she managed to form close and complicated bonds with many of her co-workers, especially her fellow Capos Miles Campion, Aleyna Greenpath, Auroran Saia and Lazaar. She is currently romantically involved Marton Hamerfall, although the status of their relationship is often questionable thanks to various factors in their lives and respective professions.Human  Humans (collectively referred to as mankind or humanity) are a resilient species native to the world of Azeroth. Recent discoveries have shown that humans are descended from the barbaric vrykul, half-giant warriors who live in Northrend. Early humans were primarily a scattered and tribal people for several millennia, until the rising strength of the troll empire forced their strategic unification. Thus the nation of Arathor was formed, along with its capital, the city-state of Strom.Human History  After centuries of peace, the increasingly independent city-states of Arathor split into kingoms: Gilneas to the west, Alterac, Dalaran, and Lordaeron to the northwest, Kul Tiras to the southwest, and Stormwind to the far south. Strom itself was renamed Stromgarde and remained a powerful kingdom. But disaster struck when the orcish Horde appeared on Azeroth and reduced Stormwind to ruins. The city's survivors, including the young prince, Varian Wrynn, fled to Lordaeron, where the leaders of the seven kingdoms resolved to unify once again in the Alliance of Lordaeron. Together, they succeeded in defeating the Horde. But peace for ther Alliance would only prove to be temporary. As upkeep costs rose, Gilneas and Stromgarde withdrew their kingdoms from the Alliance. Then came a plague that killed thousands of humans and converted them into undead servants of the Lich King. Lordaeron's prince, Arthas Menethil, was manipulated by the Lich King, leading Arthas to kill his own father and journey to Northrend, where he merged with his master and became the next Lich King. For the next five years, Arthas remained in Northrend, plotting and building up his armies. But before Arthas could unleash his gathered power, humans and other races banded together, securing a costly victory. Members of the Horde and the Alliance launched separate campaigns in Northrend, and their efforts resulted in the Lich King's defeat. The kingdom of Stormwind has become the strongest bastion of humanity and the most powerful force in the now multi-racial Alliance. Now, the people of Stormwind hold fast to the principles of honor and justice as they defend their settlements and their allies.Kal Namara  Work in Progress Tumblr: http://warcraftkal.tumblr.com Journal: http://kalooeh.livejournal.com/ Twitter: @KaltomeRecently  Mainly just working at home on engineering stuff and taking care of her kidAppearance  [WIP]Personality  [WIP]Relationships/Characters of Relevance  [WIP]Thoughts and Quotes  [Under Construction] Don't think of it as failure, think of it as an opputunity to learn; It is through our struggles that we grow and become stronger. If you don't like how something is, try to do something about it or stop your damn bitching. Refuse to give in during times of hardship. You can choose to fight and survive, or at least put up a hell of a fight before you get taken out, but it will always be better than being a coward and letting yourself be overtaken because it's just easier. Smile in trouble and gather strength from distress and fear. Courage is resistance to and mastery of fear. It's simply the willingness to be afraid and act anyways. You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. Loneliness doesn't bother me because it adds beauty to life. It puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better. When the pain becomes too much to bare and I consider just giving up, I remember that I've been through worse and survived. I am more afraid of my own heart than anything else. It is one of the few things I havn't been able to face; I don't have the strength yet to be able to face what I've locked inside it, though I try when I isolate myself from other people and the distractions they provide. I think living alone is a great challenge, one that I accepted. It's too easy relying on friends and family and I can live alone, which will develop my inner strength. Love all, trust few Don't try to be better than others, try to be better than yourself. I'm not much of a planner. If I always waited to do everything until I was sure it's right, I'd probably never do much of anything. Commerce with all nations, alliance with none. Gods be thanked for books! They are the voices of the distant and the dead, and make us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages. Anyone who says they have only one life to live must not know how to read a book. Books let us into their souls and lay open to us the secrets of our own. To sit alone in the lamplight with a book spread out before you, and hold intimate converse with men of unseen generations - such is a pleasure beyond compare. For friends I turn to a library: Books are true friends, that will neither flatter nor dissemble. Nobody can be friendless with the companionship of good books.

Raindrops patter onto my window as I gaze out at the decrepit metropolis of Stormwind. 'The city seems to be perpetually dilapidated; smears of mud are plastered across a majority of the buildings, walls are scorched from recent fires, and the feces of paupers are left to rot on the streets. To a tourist this is a cesspool of disease and debauchery. To me this is home. I sit here with a stack of clean parchment and a phoenix quill dipped in violet ink before me. Clustered on my desk is a variety of memorabilia to which I have garnered over my lifespan; they are trinkets and tidbits which remind me of earlier times. With my mind clustered with a myriad of pensive thoughts, I have made my decision: I will begin my autobiography. The scribing of my autobiography has been postponed for a numerous amount of times. \u201cWhy\u201c, you ask? I believed that there was no point to write such a trivial summary of my life which no one will ultimately read anyway. I\u2019m still not entirely sure as to why I feel the urge to jot the depressing spiral of pain and suffering which encapsulate myself. Regardless, if at least one person manages peruse this series of disorganized letters and notes, I will be content. My legacy will interminably live on so long as there is someone there to tell it. So I sit. So I write. So I begin.Childhood  I. Organized Anarchy Psychologists have attempted to prove that a criminal\u2019s background begins with a traumatic experience in his or her life. It has been one of my many goals in life to defame this ridiculous theory, but unfortunately I myself am not living proof of a counterargument. Then again, I am no criminal. The first memory which I can vividly recall was my father\u2019s public execution. Though I was unaware of it then, my father was originally a prestigious diplomat who belonged to the People\u2019s Party of Lordaeron City. This political sect, though granted a minute amount of power, ultimately had socialist ideals regarding public services such as constant sewage management and communal soup kitchens. My father\u2019s political party ascended quite swiftly to the point where Terenas himself acknowledged this vastly flourishing sect. His plans were to finance and promote the People\u2019s Party so long as their ideals did not serve as a conflict to the monarchy itself. Agreeing that his idealism did not involve a coup of any kind nor an anarchy, my father agreed to these terms and was soon funded by the throne. Unfortunately, it had become apparent that others did not agree with this coalition of socialist principles. So much so that a series of notable politicians from the Royal Political Party of Lordaeron had planned a mudslinging campaign of false evidence against my father in an attempt to force him from his soapbox. Only a month after Terenas funded the People\u2019s Party, the city heralds bore with them freshly printed news pamphlets. On the front page? A sketch of a disgusting emanation which slightly resembled a human with several of paragraphs of calligraphic text below. My mother had clipped the editorial for the sake of recollection and I had stumbled upon it every now and then. It took me several years, even up until my late adolescence, to realize that this hideous abomination against art was a preposterous depiction of my father. In bold text, the calligraphy read: Valmodeus Holywrought: Enemy of the People Socialism? Try absolute chaos! As many of the Lordaeron citizens of today know, there\u2019s a fairly new system of politics being introduced to Terenas and they\u2019re here to suck every coin from our coffers only to waste it all on fruitless public welfare programs! Where does our funding go for military progress? To the vagrants of the city! To the killers, thieves, whores, and scumbags! 'Who leads this filthy mob of so-called \u2018fighters for the people? Valmodeus Holywrought (lifelike portrait above) is the ringleader of internal collapse. While most politicians strive to improve their community, it is clear that Holywrought\u2019s sole intention is to eliminate the foundation of our stabilized monarchy which took years to secure.' Worst of all, it has been recorded that Holywrought has been most recently accepting bribes from local mobs in order to turn a blind eye in their direction. Deceit, corruption, and treason - these three properties are a coalition of what comprises a horrifying leader. Valmodeus Holywrought exemplifies this with his treacherous ideals; however, you can end this internal strife by supporting the Royal Political Party today! When I read this in my late childhood I was shocked and appalled at the information which it had proposed. My mother had to extensively convince me for several months before I believed that my father was a good man again. Perhaps what shocks me the most about this incident is how simple it is to convince someone of a blatantly false fact: an editorial scribed in formal font. The tool of organizing fabrication would be utilized by myself in the near future. To this day I find it ironic how those who claim they are fighting for the common welfare will persist to veil their true intentions and thus ignite the flames of an interminable cycle of fascism and totalitarianism: two things which they vowed in the first place to eliminate. Censoring the media, a true mark of totalitarianism, merely led to the ruination of my father\u2019s reputation and ultimately his life was taken from my family as well. All of this was the payment to lie to the public and spout petty midwife gossip in order to \u201cfight for the people\u201d. These false accusations grew out of proportion and soon my father was accused of ridiculously false crimes such as murder and unforgivable treason against the crown. My mother recalled the night my father was taken away: she had said that the guards didn\u2019t even bother to show enough common courtesy to knock. They merely forced our door open and presented my father with a letter de cache. With a solemn expression etched across his countenance, my father showed no aggression as he was forcibly removed from our meager home. Even now it haunts me at how such a pitiable lack of resistance is a prevalent trait in my family. Three days after his conviction, my father was ordered to be hanged at the gallows without the right of habeus corpus. My family was in attendance only to console him and ensure that he would eternally be in our hearts. I remember that my brother and mother were wailing and exclaiming that my father was a good, innocent man. Meanwhile, I hadn\u2019t a clue what was occurring and merely stared at my doomed patriarch. Valmodeus Holywrought stood before a crowd of jeering, aggravated citizens who blasphemed his formerly good name with curses. It took several minutes for the executioner to finally tie the noose correctly and tighten it so that it wrung snugly along my father\u2019s neck. The minutes felt like hours as I merely stared obliquely at the congregation of hate which surrounded Valmodeus. Words like \u201cpig\u201d and \u201cliar\u201d had echoed throughout the execution court, being tossed around freely like mere greetings. It was hard for me to imagine that just months ago, these rioters worshipped my father like a god. Now, they were against him, fearful of the omnipresence of fascism. These were the true people of Azeroth: ignorant scumbags who could be persuaded and intimidated by several eloquent words and who would be doomed to a life of blissful ignorance. The sun\u2019s radiant brilliance had environed Lordaeron City on the day my father was hanged. I couldn\u2019t help but think to myself that the gods had a dementedly sick sense of humor to have bestowed such a beautiful day, yet to have taken away the man who I respected most. It was like the entire universe was laughing at me while I could only sit there and scorn what my predestined fate was. At long last, the time had come: my father\u2019s noose had been completely tied. A sort of suspense overwhelmed the crowd as they merely gazed wide-eyed at Valmodeus. For a man on his way to the afterlife, my father seemed quite tranquil. I\u2019m assuming that this is because my father accepted his innocence and new that ultimately, he would die as a wholesome man. That, or he was too frightened to react to his nearing death. My stomach had lurched when the executioner began to let loose a wicked grin. His eyes wandered toward my direction - perhaps purposely, perhaps by coincidence - and he chuckled with a hint of malice in between his exhalations of air. The bastard was laughing at my misfortunes. In fact, he had enjoyed every Light-damn second of it. Little did the prick know that in ten years he would regret this action dearly. It took one blunt kick to the wooden block under my father\u2019s feet for him to fall off into the spiraling clutches of his demise. A subtle cracking noise resounded throughout the quarter followed by the uproar of cheer. My lessons had begun. II. Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Pyre \"Lack of money is the root of all evil\u201d- George Bernard Shaw My family was by no means a wealthy one. Valmodeus\u2019 pay rate as a politician wasn\u2019t lucrative and he primarily worked for the benefit of the people, an ironic twist against our favor. We had to move out of Lordaeron City because my mother had two children to raise and couldn\u2019t focus on a profession at the same time. Fortunately, I remember us buying a small cottage by the outskirts of Andorhal where we could begin sustenance farming. Living off of carrots and potatoes wasn\u2019t the glamorous life, but my family had never been closer. I suppose now would be an appropriate time to describe both of my remaining family members at the time. My brother, Luthorin, was two years my senior (twelve by the time we had moved out of Lordaeron City). He was always honed more brute strength than I, which led him to instigate many of our physical quarrels. Despite this bickering, Luthorin and I were very close and had a bond of brotherhood which seemed impossible to break. Luthorin enjoyed doing most of the farming and chores around the cottage. He was a born leader and would often send me to town to purchase provisions and sell off the very little extra produce which we earned in the profitable seasons. Though we were mere paupers at the time, my mother still had high hopes of Luthorin joining the Silver Hand. She would always insist that he go to the church of Andorhal every Sunday to learn the Light\u2019s teachings; he would often do so, but not under his own motivation. Mother Holywrought, or Daphne, become a disheveled wreck after my father\u2019s execution. Strands of hair blocked her eyesight, bags under her eyes had become even more prevalent, and crows\u2019 feet were beginning to form along the sides of her countenance. Despite her unsavory appearance, I had always seen my mother as a pristine beauty. She was my treasured jewel who may have gotten tarnished every once in a while, but ultimately always held something magnificent inside. Daphne would do all she could to edify my brother and I. For example, my mother lectured my on the territories of Azeroth and taught me basic reading comprehension and writing. Though her lessons were very rudimentary, they had given me a general understanding of the concept of Common. She was my primary inspiration to break away from the chains of poverty and build myself a flourishing, fruitful future. I remember one particular anecdote when Luthorin was quite ill and as a result, I was sent to Andorhal to buy some medicine. This was the first time in months since I had been away from home and I was quite excited to see what was unraveling in outer society for I had always visualized the possibilities. My mother seemed less enthusiastic about my short journey and I simply didn\u2019t know why. Perhaps it was because her little boy was growing up, or perhaps it was because she knew I\u2019d have to face the treacheries of civilization sooner or later. Andorhal was something for me to marvel at, to say the least. From the people to the buildings, everything was new to me. Being just an infant when living in Lordaeron City, I hadn\u2019t any recollection of urban life, so even simple rural towns had startled me. Beggars were everywhere - that had startled me the most. It had frightened me that even children were entreating for my help. The funny thing was that I felt no pity whatsoever for these fools; rather, I felt a certain sort of hatred toward them. A hatred which would subtly yet surely build up to my middle-ages. One particularly disheveled boy approached me with a tin can and a gloomy mood painted across his visage. Tears welled up in his eyes as he inquired for a mere morsel of bread or perhaps a copper coin. I savored the taste of elitism as I rejected the young pauper\u2019s plea. In fact, I even had the nerve to kneel over, grab a handful of horse feces, and mash it in the boy\u2019s face. He stood there for a good thirty seconds before he had realized the extent of what I had done. A few tears trickled down his dirty cheeks before he wailed for his mother. Tripping along the jutting cobblestones, the boy disappeared behind a clump of wood in shame. I continued my tread to the pharmacist as though nothing of importance had occurred. The pharmacy which I had been given directions to was derelict to say the least. It was apparent that the patio hadn\u2019t been swept for decades and even the support beams out front were beginning to crack and splinter. Above the beams was a second floor, presumably where the landlord slept. Two elongating windows looked over the street as if they were depressed eyes which had to witness the poverty which had consumed Andorhal. No surprise nor shock had enveloped me as I opened the creaking door and peered inside. It was obvious that the pharmacy was in dire need of interior decorating: vials had lain smashed along the musty floorboards, it reeked of cigarette smoke, and perhaps worst of all was the hideous man at the counter. Moles and other facial disfigurations were riddled along this man\u2019s epidermis. The pharmacist had obviously not bathed for months if not years because his smell emanated throughout the disgusting building. As he spotted me, the man waited no further to pronounce himself in a deep, lazy syntax. \u201cOy, you! Yeh li\u2019le bugga\u2019! Come o\u2019er \u2018ere! I \u2018and\u2019t seen a li\u2019l one in clothes such as yerself in weeks now! Wot\u2019 can I do ye\u2019 fer?\u201dI had hesitantly approached the counter and passed the man a neatly folded piece of parchment. He proceeded to take it with his grubby fingers. His eyes trailed from left to right as he perused the document at his leisure. It had taken him a good five minutes to get through the one paragraph which was written upon it. Once finishing the simple request, the pharmacist waved his index finger in the air and declared profoundly, \u201cOh? So tha\u2019s wot\u2019 ye\u2019 want, eh? Well I got wot\u2019 ye\u2019 need, ye\u2019 li\u2019l bugger!\u201d Flickering my seemingly innocent eyes at the pharmacist, I nodded thankfully. I was wholly relieved that I would soon be able to leave the excuse of a building. The pharmacist took five minutes to traverse to the back room and return with a messily-tied package. He slid it across the table and beamed at me. \u201cMe name is Earl, by the way. Earl Greenstone. Mos\u2019 people jest call me Ernie, by tha\u2019 way. Dunno why. An\u2019 what\u2019s yer\u2019 name, li\u2019l bugger?\u201d I replied hesitantly. My primary goal was to leave the pharmacy as soon as possible. With a proud faux smile upon my face, I straightened my back and proudly declared, \u201cJethamus Holywrought!\u201d Ernie scratched his chin and frowned. For the first time since we had begun our conversation, it looked as though he was actually contemplating something. \u201cListen, bub. Jethamus is way too long fer this ragtag town. How \u2018bout Jeth? Sounds less fansy-pansy if yeh ask me!\u201d A moment of perplexed thought enshrouded me before I responded. \u201cJeth? That sounds like a hero\u2018s name. Like one who fights dragons and bandits!\u201d Resounding throughout the pharmacy was a boisterous guffaw which actually made me jump a little before managing to regain my footing. He raised a curious eyebrow at my surprise, then continued in the same tone. \u201cListen, Jeth. I like yeh, yeh\u2019re a funny guy. Are yeh lookin\u2019 for work of some sort? Yeh seem like a smart feller and I wouldn\u2019t mind haven\u2019 yeh around!\u201d I gave Ernie a wholehearted look of complacence and scrutinized the offer carefully. After a moment of consideration, I iterated in a shy tone. \u201cOk. My momma needs the money for our cottage. What do you want me to do, Mr. Ernie?\u201d The pot-bellied buffoon howled humorously yet again. \u201cI swear by tha\u2019 Light, kiddo! Call me Ernie! None of tha\u2019 formal bullshit! Just cus\u2019 I own a storefront doesnae\u2019 mean that\u2019 I\u2019m all professional and such! Anyway, how sneaky are yeh\u2019?\u201d My face became alighted with slight astonishment at the inquiry before I answered dutifully. \u201cUmm. Kinda. Sometimes I go to my neighbor\u2019s farm and take his corn. He only caught me once, I think.\u201d \u201cOnly once yeh\u2019 say? Good, I guess that\u2019ll do. Come back here tomorrow - yeh\u2019ll make a fan-fuckin\u2019-tastic errand boy and pickpocket!\u201d Half of what came out of Ernie\u2019s putrid mouth was estranged from what I was normally accustomed to. Not once in my life had I heard the words, \u201cfucking\u201d, \u201cbullshit\u201d, or even \u201cpickpocket\u201d. I suppose you could even say that I was a bit sheltered in my late childhood to my early adolescence by my mother. Daphne didn\u2019t want me to grow up and kept me as her little boy; however, my preference was to break free from her maternal grasp and mature by myself. Ernie was the key to my new life. He was living proof that I would do anything to be my own man from stealing to pure brutality. After a greasy handshake, I mustered up enough courage to take the package and leave the pharmacy. The door looked as though it would have fell off its hinges if I slammed it, so I was certain to creak it shut as the sun enveloped my youthful body from the outside. Only for a short while could I enjoy the seemingly-perpetual sunlight which graced Andorhal. My pleasure and tranquility was briskly cut off by the thundering clamor of townsfolk. Though a mere echo from where I was standing, I could still hear a muffled chant. Curiosity got the best of me as I wandered toward the source of the yelps of anger. The source of commotion was the town plaza of Andorhal where a group of peasants were crowded around an execution pyre. It was finally clear what they were saying. \u201cShe\u2019s a demon! She\u2019s a demon! She\u2019s a demon!\u201d Tied to this makeshift bundle of wood was a maiden who couldn\u2019t have been older than sixteen. Tears rolled down her eyes as she attempted to loosen the ropes which attached her to the tool of execution. It was an obvious fact that there was no way in Azeroth that this woman was a demon of any sort. Her hair was a fine tint of dirty blond and her eyes had a crystalline tint of blue about them. In an ideal yet clich\u00e9 world, I would have freed the girl and would have been her knight and shining armor. We would have ran off into the sunset and had a happy family. I would have found an honest profession as a baker and she would have cared for our baby boy and girl. Toward the ends of our lives, we would have died in each others arms whispering loving statements. Azeroth is no ideal world. I felt obliged to help the woman, but my body froze up as I could only stare at the event which unraveled before me. A torch seemed to have magically conjured into the crowd\u2019s grasp as they hurled it at the pyre. I\u2019ll never forget how the girl screamed in an incomparable hysteria. The flickering flames inched slowly but steadily to the outer contours of the woman\u2019s body while all she could do was cry for help. Though feeling the urge to turn around and flee before actually being forced to be victim to the murder, I couldn\u2019t help but force my eyes onto the spectacle. I\u2019ll save you the appalling details for your own mental well-being, but be aware that later in my autobiography, I will not grant the same courtesy. There are events contained in this coalescence of parchment and documents which have the possibility to scar your mentality forever. You have been warned. III. Any Business is Good BusinessYoung Adulthood Appearance  The hair of Jeth is a midnight black, obviously dyed. The crow's feet and wrinkles across Jethamus' weathered face proves that the man's true hair color is gray if not white. 74 years have passed since the human's birth, and it definitely shows. One of Jeth's most prized possessions is his tuxedo he wears absolutely everywhere he does business. He constantly boasts that the suit was tailored in the very halls of Silvermoon by the finest of artisans. Some say that Holywrought would slice the throat of any man who would insult this tuxedo. ==Self Defense  Jeth is most definitely not the fighter type. If the man was cornered, he will hold his own, though. Hidden in one of the Lionheart's dress shoes is a small blade, eight inches in all. A small fortune worth of fireworks is securely kept within Jeth's tuxedo as a distraction or blinding technique. Finally, Holywrought's most prized alchemists create invisibility potions: Jeth's favorite method of escape.Quotes  \"Cash is king.\" \"You want to screw with the Lionhearts? You'll get the *&^%in' Lionhearts!\" \"My appreciation to you.\" \"I'd rather you run, given the chance.\" \"Help the Alliance! Support the Lionhearts!Jeth: Not Directly Linked To The Lionheart Family?  A rumor has been spread throughout Stormwind that Jethamus' last name is \"Holywrought\", not \"Lionheart\", meaning that he is not linked with Validus Lionheart, the previous Boss of the family. This is very well a fact. Validus was Jeth's mentor, his protege, the company was Jeth's inheritance.See also  The Lionheart Company Obgrim's Oddities' Reincarnation of the SoulExternal links The Shadowhoof Tribe Introduction  \"Those who forget their ancestors forget themselves.\" - Shadowhoof proverbImportant OOC Notes  The Shadowhoof Tribe is an all-Tauren, heavy-roleplay guild with a tribal atmosphere. While the guild is considered \"neutral\" according to the politics of the game, the nature of our tribe may occasionally lead to in-game conflict roleplay. While it is not our main focus, we do not shy away from conflict roleplay where necessary or logical, because we believe conflict roleplay adds variety, realism, and depth to the larger roleplay environment. Due to the variety of roleplay that will be encountered, we consider ourselves mature roleplayers. Also, the personalities and flaws of our characters do not in any way describe us as players. We're really pretty friendly folks.Recruitment  The Shadowhoof Tribe has once again opened its doors to the community.

The air smelled of sweet oils \u2013 sungrass and lotus \u2013 and carried the hushed murmurings of the other women. There was the midwife Kahnee, of course, kneeled at Halfa\u2019s hooves with the infant in her arms; on one side were three of her herd-sisters, and on the other rested her joyful mother and sister. It was Kahnee who ended the soft chatter by rising slowly and standing erect. Halfa panted into the new silence as her sister dampened a cloth and rubbed her brow clean. Kahnee turned to face the open flap of the tent. \u201cBron, you may come inside.\u201d The male ducked his head as he crept into the tent, clutching a spear in his right fist. Halfa\u2019s herd-sisters dropped their heads in greeting. Halfa\u2019s mother and sister chittered between themselves: it was so obvious Bron was the father, since the infant clearly shared his dark coat. The midwife held the infant out for Bron to inspect, which Bron completed with a grunt of approval. Then, Kahnee nodded towards Bron\u2019s spear. Tossing the spear into the air, the male caught it in mid-fall and pointed the sharpened tip under his child\u2019s chin. The women watched with a nervous gaze, tense but unmoving. The infant opened her dark eyes wide and stared, rather cross-eyed, at the object assaulting her. With a thin bellow of consternation, she grabbed the tip of the spear and, with all her newborn might, tried to tug it away from it\u2019s father. A wild cheer broke the air. Halfa\u2019s sister whispered in her ear, \u201cYour daughter is strong and brave, Halfa. She didn\u2019t shy away or wail. She touched the spear.\u201d >> <> The Shadowhoof is an old tribe, with thousands of years of tradition and ritual that shape their everyday lives. It is a common belief among their people, for instance, that it is lucky if the first thing a baby touches is its father's spear \u2013 should the infant fail to do so, or should the baby show signs of fear, then the baby will probably live a very short life. Indeed, one of the greatest insults you could ever utter to a Shadowhoof would be that traditions are meaningless. The Shadowhoof believe that most Shu\u2019Halo tribes have lost the Old Ways, and that as a result the tribes will (eventually) meet their downfall.A Day in the Life  << The earth began to shake \u2013 small tremors that caused bowls of stew to shudder and ripple, and baskets of laundry to rattle like piles of snakes. \u201cHo-uuup!\u201d The distinctive cry had villagers poking heads out of their tents. A caravan of kodos slowly marched into the center of the village. Each beast was draped with the thick rope net used to secure bundles, and had a Shu\u2019Halo on its back. An excited crowd began to gather, hailing the precession with whoops and cheers and gesturing animatedly towards the goods each animal carried. The visiting Shu\u2019Halo slid off their mounts and, with much affectionate patting, gathered up the reins of their animals in one hand, waiting. Elder Hunter Turok stepped out from the crowd and firmly grasped the arm of Aztok Manywinds, foremost of the riders and leader of the caravan family. The two men broke into identical grins. \u201cWhat have you brought me today, old friend?\u201d asked Turok, making sure to shake the caravaneer\u2019s arm a little as they broke apart. Aztok Manywinds laughed, and gestured to his mate and children, who began rapidly freeing the bundles from the confines of the rope-nets. \u201cLots of mail and goods of the finest quality \u2013 things you backwater folks have never even seen, I\u2019d bet. I\u2019ll be trading for double the normal amount of skins. \u201d He winked rougishly. Turok laughed, and threw an arm around the old bull. \u201cCome on \u2013 water your beasts and rest. Stay a while. Story circle will be starting soon enough\u2026\u201d >> <> The Shadowhoof have a reputation as being a crusty, \u2018backwater\u2019 bunch that is, as a whole, unbearably dour and bristly. This is far from the truth. Just because the Shadowhoof prefer to do things their own way \u2013 such as eschewing goblin mail and hiring caravaneers to fetch mail and goods \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that their tribal life can\u2019t be busy and exciting. The children of the tribe have perhaps the best deal out of all the age groups. Most of their days are spent tumbling and playing from dawn to dusk, only stopping at meal times, or when an adult pulls them aside for a bath and scrubbing. Youngsters are raised communally, and so don\u2019t have the strong connections to \u2018mother' and \u2018father\u2019 that you may see in other societies, such as the orcs. Once the children have seen roughly ten years, they are expected to contribute more to the tribe. They will begin learning the tasks of day to day survival: tasks like washing laundry, collecting plainstrider eggs, or picking herbs. Youth are rarely pushed towards a particular life-path, or \u2018job\u2019. As young tauren age and make bonds with the elders in their tribe, it is expected that the Earthmother will touch each one and gently guide them to their purpose. A young Shaman, for examaple, may find herself inexplicably drawn to the company of the tribe\u2019s shaman elders, and soon afterward may hear the elements\u2019 voices. The only exceptions to this policy are that every tauren must learn the art of battle or defense, and that every tauren is expected to be a capable hunter. The tribe\u2019s environment is perilous, and to be unable to provide for or defend oneself is not an option. Most hunting occurs during the night, when the local wildlife is most active. Many hunters employ cats, for their keen eyesight, but other types of companions are not uncommon. Hunting provides roughly 50% of the tribe\u2019s meat intake, the remaining percent split evenly between trading and domesticated livestock, such as plainstriders.Mating and Family Structure  << Hamal grasped his skin of firewater in one hand, using the other arm to elbow his companion, Dergon, in the ribs. \u201cHow about that one, eh?\u201d He pointed to one of the young females dancing joyfully around the nearby fire. Dergon started, looking up from the scroll he was desperately attempting to read in the failing light. \u201cWhat? Oh \u2013 Serga, you mean?\u201d He shifted from side to side on his mat. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I hear she only likes\u2026 really tall\u2026 males.\u201d Derga himself was a little short \u2013 two heads shorter, in fact, than other males his age. Hamal clapped a hand on Derga\u2019s back, sending the scroll flying. Derga scrambled to pick it up. \u201cNonsense! She\u2019s a sweet girl. How many women do you have in your herd, now?\u201d \u201cStill\u2026 still only the one, Bessyl.\u201d Derga flattened his ears with embaressment. \u201cBut you know, Bessyl and I make a really good pair \u2013 I don\u2019t think I need any more women, really.\u201d Hamal roared with good-natured laughter and gave Derga another heavy pat on the back. \u201cNo, no. That won\u2019t do. Only one woman \u2013 well, that\u2019s just not civilized. You can still keep Bessyl as your favorite, you know.\u201d Hamal stood. \u201cI\u2019ll go speak to her on your behalf.\u201d Derga sighed and covered his face with his palms. >> <> The Shadowhoof, while not monogamists themselves, have heard of the practice\u2019s rising popularity. If you were to ask a Shadowhoof what they thought about it, that Shu\u2019Halo would most likely reply that \u201cMonogamy is all very well, but not very practical,\u201d and then idly blame the Horde and too much contact with the orcs. That is not to say, however, that the Shadowhoof disdain monogamy, or that it never happens \u2013 it is merely an uncommon occurrence. In a land with many dangers, including wild beasts, centaur raids, violent ogres, and increasing Alliance encroachment (just to name a few), it helps to breed widely and often. The Shadowhoof prefer the old tradition where a single bull collects a herd of females. Herd sizes vary widely, and can contain as few as two or can climb up into the double digits in certain rare cases. The Shadowhoof seem to prefer a nice middle ground, with herds containing roughly two or three females to one male. Herds generally share one large tent. As the closest equivalent to a \u201cfamily\u201d, they are the smaller unit that builds up the tribe \u2013 the building block. The young produced from these matings are raised communally. It is not uncommon for the females to form intensely intimate bonds between each other, especially if the bull practices favoritism, or for two males to become especially close. Because of this, allusions to \u201chomosexuality\u201d rarely shock the Shadowhoof. It also worth noting that, despite what many would consider a patriarchal practice, the Shadowhoof is, overall, a matriarchal society. Females rarely ever express feelings of \u201coppression\u201d due to the herd system, for several reasons: a) herds are designed primarily for keeping birth rates high; b) female tribe members receive honors for their achievements, and never according to what bull they mate with; and c) females frequently acquire positions of leadership.Rituals and Events  Rituals and events are one of the biggest components of our guild, and as a result, we can't describe all of them in depth in this section!

She recalled the story of the Great Hunter Ramhorn and his battle with the mighty Kodo Spikehide - how he knew to stay upwind of his prey and the benefits of a good trap. Her spirits soared and she motioned for her little wolf pup, quickly stalking the underbrush. The mighty Kodo was in sight, and the youngster leaped forth with a mighty call as her wolf pup scampered behind with a wailing howl. \u201cOh no! The mighty hunter has caught me!\u201d Lycha Windracer snatched up his little sister and chuckled. \u201cPracticing your hunting skills again I see. What a mighty warrior you will become, but first\u2026 A bath!\u201d \u201cOh noooo\u2026\u201d The youngster squirmed, and sighed, \u201cI bet Great Hunter Ramhorn never had to take a bath\u2026\u201d >> - This section is a condensed version of the lore and stories that each Shadowhoof might hear told and retold to the youngsters and at story circles. Here we have simply named a few great warriors and give a short description of their purpose and Hero status. This mainly provides a bit more flavor to the roleplay and also allows players to allude to and pull anecdotes from individual stories. In order to keep the list short, we've only provided one legend per class. - Great Hunter Ramhorn - Named for his twin horns that curved backwards, this great hunter is revered for his heroic battle with the Demon Kodo Spikehide. Raised by the legion in Desolace, this violent Kodo hammered caravans for years. When the great hunter finally fell the beast, it was said that he communed with the spirit of the angered Kodo and helped it find peace. Kubai the Hot-headed - Kubai was a young druid eager to learn the ways of the Wild Shape, so that she could take on the form of Bear and destroy the tribe's enemies. But though Kubai had great potential, she also posessed a hot temper and plenty of arrogance. One day, an Elder Feralkin took Kubai deep into the jungle of Feralas. He pointed at a bear rooting through a pile of mushrooms. \"Tell me, Kubai, what is the difference between that bear and another?\" Kubai responded, \"Does it matter? All bears are the same.\" The Elder cursed her, saying, \"A feralkin cannot walk the line of Shu'Halo and beast if they do not respect the animal side. You will not return to the tribe until you have learned the nature of every bear in the jungle.\" When Kubai returned years later, her deep wisdom and prowess made her one of the greatest feralhides in tribe memory. Plac Setting-Sun - An old spiritwalker of generations past came to the Shadowhoof with a promise that if they venerate the setting sun they would find allies in the darkness. Through the years many walked the twilight hours in search of these night allies, but many failed to see anything but darkness. Quickly the Shadowhoof forgot their quest and returned to daily life. Many years later, a child of only seven summers wandered into the darkness and was attacked by ogres. If called by Mu'sha herself, or simply by luck, the young child was saved by creatures that radiated the moonlit sky. To this day, Plac Setting-sun still watches the shadows and speaks out to his people to remember the old pact and keep searching into the twilight. \"They are out there.\"History  << Elder Mahaka Shadowhoof looked about the encampment, her half-lidded eyes scanning the fires. The flow of past memories, most of which were not her own, flooded her mind. She saw Father Keen-eye showing his son how to string his bow, and superimposed stood the image of Keen-eye\u2019s great-grandfather smiling over the handy work clearly impressed. The scene to her left played out a pair of young Shu\u2019halo playing tag as they ran around the central bonfire. A mother, brows knitted in distress, looks around desperately for her youngest who, by known account, had died during a raid on the village some thirty years ago. A great figure stood watching over the land, bow tight, as he prepared to let fly his last arrow in defense of his people during the great Centaur raids -- over a thousand years ago. Mahaka knew these spirits well as they played out the scenes of thousands of summers before. The lorekeeper had found the summer tribal lands. She turned to the Matriarch and nodded her approval. This was indeed their home. >> History for the Shadowhoof tribe is intertwined with tradition. The Spiritwalkers, while still a curiosity, hold much more sway with the tribal elders. Their pasts date back over five thousand years of trials and tribulations that still live on in legends and tales of their most respected warriors.Beginnings  The Shadowhoof tribe's oral accounts began sometime near the Grimtotem's rise to power deep in the jungles of Feralas. These two large and imposing tribes were in constant flux over who dominated the lands between Desolace and Thousand Needles. Tribal clashing was common, but never violent as the land could easily support the two tribes and their peoples. Where the Grimtotem often took the lower lands stretching along the eastern lakes and rivers, the Shadowhoof were lithe and often resided in the high peaks and caves. Ritual dueling between chieftains became the method of choice to decide the dominance of a particular area. The fighting between the two tribes never reached violence, as the two groups would on occasion simply agree to occupy the same area peacfully. Here the tribes would mingle and in rare occasions migrate to the opposite tribe to spread the gene pool further. Thus many older family lines hold Grimtotem blood in their veins. A third tribe, the Mistrunner tribe, found homes in the great forests of Feralas. They were a much smaller tribe, but found companionship in the Shadowhoof as they traded goods through their caravans who traveled the further reaches of Kalimdor. The Shadowhoof welcomed the Mistrunners into their homes and beds, through not as commonly as they did the Grimtotem. Taking to the northern lands in the centuries following, the Shadowhoof witnessed the magic of the Dream Portal in Feralas. The elders, deeming it a sacred site and respecting the wishes of the mighty Emerald Flight residing in the area, took to watching over the portal. Believeing it to be the gateway to their ancestors and the spirits of eons past, the Shadowhoof made pilgrimages to the site of the great Dream Bough to request help and guidance. While not the true guardians in any sense of the word, the Shadowhoof did take up the banner to protect the lands around it and protect the Dream Portal in any way they could.The Centaur  The great deserts of Desolace hide the grand city of Maraudon, the centaur\u2019s holy capital city. This location placed the Shadowhoof in direct conflict with the horse-men, as they regularly hit the supply caravans coming through from the southern desolace Shu'halo tribes. This not only strained the Shadowhoof, but also the Grimtotem and the migrating groups of Mistrunners who counted on the supplies from their larger settlements to survive in the slowly diminishing Desolace. Even more concerning was the bold behavior expressed by the Centaur, no longer culled by the Elves as they were before the Sundering. In an act of honor, three chieftains stood as one to defeat the Centaur threat. A Grimtotem, A Mistrunner, and the Shadowhoof Chief Akap Cloudmane met at the great summit to discuss the downfall of the Centaur in Northern Feralas. While each had their own ideals to how they should act, eventually they came to an agreement to divide tactics and hit the centaur on three fronts. Each chieftain called their tribes to action and the wars began in earnest to remove the threat, each giving their special abilities to the effort. The Shadowhoof provided reconnaissance and tactical skirmish points from their plateau retreats and overlooks, the Mistrunners proceeded to bait the Centaur with hit and run tactics, and the Grimtotem hit the confused forces hard with their well trained braves. For a great time the two forces battled for dominion over the land. Many lives were lost in the conflict, and through those times life was harsh and sometimes unforgiving. Many families learned the value of traveling light and oftentimes many bloodlines would come together for support and kinship. The males were often short lived as they would insist on fighting as soon as they came of age, so an integral shift in power soon arose. The Shadowhoof women began leading their people through ritual and hunting trails and soon took up arms as the personal scouts for the traveling family units. This shift later would become a permanent mark of the Shadowhoof as the Matriarch soon became the leading pillar of their people. The break in the centaur attacks, preceding the inclusion of the Feralas nations to the Horde, point to evidence that support the fact that the centaur had been on a two-front war. Eventually, though, the Centaur were driven completely from Feralas and stories of the battles were retold through the generations as great legends.A New Horde  The coming of the Orcs to Kalimdor was for the most part ignored by the Shadowhoof, as their lands in Feralas were several months away. News that did speak of the new groups of trolls and green-skinned brutes were always on the tongues of caravan families and Grimtotem far runners. Coupled with the little knowledge of other tribes in the further reaches of Kalimdor, they had no previous need to investigate the disturbences. It was not until word began to spread of a Shu\u2019halo chieftain who claimed dominion over all the tribes that Shadowhoof heads began to turn. The leader had enlisted the help of outsiders, the alien race of orcs, to remove the centaur threat from their homelands in Mulgore. They were now sending convoys to all the corners of Kalimdor with word that Cairne Bloodhoof was calling all his people home to his capitol of Thunderbluff and the new Shu'halo homelands of Mulgore. The Shadowhoof began getting curious of talk to further expanding their trade among the northern expanses of Kalimdor, however, the elders remained wary. Looking to their sister tribes, the Shadowhoof saw as the Mistrunners quickly taking the banner of the New Horde and readily walking under Bloodhoof rule. Their tribe soon saw wealth of lands they previously had lost access to and a growing of their knowledge to shamanistic nature magics, now called druidism. They also watched as the Grimtotem sent their own convoys to Thunderbluff though for what purpose the Shadowhoof did not know, as the convoys always returned bitter and angry at the response. They soon became enraged and withdrawn as the Bloodhoof slowly grew in power, and often spoke of unknown enemies that drew curiosity from some smaller Shadowhoof camps. The Shadowhoof's world was changing fast, and they would eventually be forced to take action. The great leader Durka Sagehorn, from a neighboring tribe, stepped up to lead a small group of people to Thunderbluff with their allies. There they met with Cairne who welcomed them into the city with open arms. The wary elders remained and watched as diliberations for accomodations and trade were discussed. Several tribe leaders stepped up to aid in the decisions, many of whom the Shadowhoof had never even heard of: the Runetotem, the Stonehoof, the Eagletalon. However, after a long deliberation between the chieftains it was decided that a small group of each tribe would remain under the Shu'halo Horde banner. Satisfied, the Shadowhoof took their leave of the rather open landscape and returned with their allies to the daily life in Feralas. Here life remainded peaceful until the Orc expansion came with a dreadful price.New Conflict  Whisperings of a new enemy began to surface of a pink skinned, short, elf-like creature, who traveled in packs through the supply trails, killing caravans of helpless families. The stories became even more horrific as word got out that these monsters took the horns and hooves of their victims and left the carcasses to rot. Talk of horrific demons and terrible magics that brought down fire and ice were on the tongues of refugee Shadowhoof who escaped from their lands in Desolace. Later reports would come in, as the threat grew to panic stricken heights, that entire villages were being slaughtered for horns and hooves. Women, children, elderly, and infants were slain without mercy all in the name of bloodsport. Messages were sent to the Grimtotem for guidance as their tribes stretched across vast portions of Kalimdor. The responce was less then welcome and the Shadowhoof soon realized their mistake in their Horde alligences. The monsters hunting their people were part the Alliance who existed on the continent over the great sea. It turned out that the Orcs of the Horde, and now all Horde nations, had been in conflict with these vile monsters and had gained the ire of their whole nation. The dealings with the New Horde had placed the Shadowhoof in direct conflict with these beasts and now a Shu\u2019halo pelt, horn, or hoof garnished a nice sack of gold for the hero. The existance of Shu'halo in Feralas, once an elven land, gave marauders the excuse for whole sale genocide on small villages in the north. Turning to their caves and cliff dwellings, the Shadowhoof went into hiding. In the span of twenty years, the Shadowhoof have experienced more death and distruction to their tribe then the centaur wars. The resentment for the war between the Horde and Allaince grew and fostered a new goal and duty for their people. The Shadowhoof now stand as one of the last barriers between their beloved southern Kalimdor and the devestation of industrialized expansion. Even now the Shadowhoof wage a silent war against everyone who would threaten their way of life and their homelands.Before the Shattering - Cairne's Rule  Living in the high stretches of mountain sides and plateaus that line the border of Feralas and Desolace, the Shadowhoof continue to watch over their lands. Protective of their homelands, they are now known to quickly attack anyone seen as a threat to the balance of the jungles. Travelers are often left alone without even the knowledge that they were being observed. However, poachers and hunters are quickly snatched up by rogue Skytalons or attacked by strangely intelligent beasts, which only adds to the mystery surrounding the Shadowhoof homelands. Surprisingly well adapted to life in the high altitudes, the roar of Skytalon prides can now be heard near Shadowhoof settlements. Preferring to stay aloof from their cousins and only returning to the main cities for trade, the Shadowhoof can be a hard tribe to track down. Though, recent activity between Thunderbluff and Thousand Needles has sparked a larger trade effort from the Shadowhoof and they are venturing further and further north from their homes for trade. Their migration paths in Feralas have begun to include the area around the Dream Portal, which the Shadowhoof have taken to monitoring once more. A long forgotten charge of the elders and their families, the Shadowhoof sense stirring and have reawakened their duty to observe the portal. This activity in Feralas has brought the Shadowhoof in close contact with their Night elven counterparts. Increased contact and relations between the two groups has stirred a bit of controversy over who the Shadowhoof really stand behind. More and more the tribe have cut themselves from the main Horde force and retreat back to a more nomadic, nature based lifestyle. The splinter groups of Shadowhoof have begun to regroup and come together to reform the large tribe of long ago. The Shadowhoof have slowly begun to grow in force as they travel the southern Kalimdor continent. Through their travels they have made a few tenuous allies and a few silent enemies.After the Shattering: Baine's Rule  The Shadowhoof have suffered greatly, shrinking from a group of several thousand to several hundred. Many elders, infirm, and children perished, unable to reach safe ground in time. However, the Shadowhoof understand that nothing stays the same forever. Rather then mourn the loss of their old way of life, they have started to adjust to a new lot. Forming bands of roving splinter groups, once again the Shadowhoof work to build their numbers back from the brink. Shrinking back to the Shadows of their former homes of Feralas, Desolace, and the Stonetalon Mountains they will remain and one day return.The Discovery of Pandaria  As the Horde begins to wage war in the mists for the newly discovered lands, the Shadowhoof are still rejoicing the death of the Black Dragon Neltharion. Having lost so many in the Shattering, the tribe's numbers are growing rapidly. The old Matriarch Kurshaw, long thought dead, returned to her people from the depths of the Abyss. However, not long after, word to bring every young bull to the battle to gain victory in Pandaria came to the Shadowhoof. Angered and not ready to part with her tribe a second time, Kurshaw reached out to a sister group called the Windsong Herd. Known supporters of peace between the factions, the Windsong and Shadowhoof worked out a pact. Naming the friendship, the Thundering Herd, they swore to create a place where all Shu'halo could go to remove themselves from the constant bickering and warmongering between the Horde and Alliance. Now protectors of peace, the Shadowhoof will do anything it takes to keep their people from being forced to fight a war that is not theirs.Tribe Leadership Former Leaders:\u00a0 Checotan  Status: Sakem << He stood on the edge of the Colossi, looking out. Feralas stretched beneath him, sprawling and lush, so unlike the forlorn, barren land he had been born in. It was never-ending, that jungle, and unspeakably old. He understood why elves could be found here, as enamoured as their people were with equally ancient things. There was a small circle of elders behind them, laughing and passing around a peace pipe. Checotan heard the hiss of burning leaves just before a heady scent wafted past his nostrils. Once reaching a venerable age, Shadowhoof elders spent much of their time up here, resting until their knowledge was called upon. He wanted that - knowledge. Wisdom. Placing two fingers to his muzzle, Checotan whistled sharply for his mount. The time for his spirit quest had come. >> <> Checotan was the mate of Kurshaw, and was the \"Sakem\" or Patriarch. In contrast to Kurshaw's fiery spirit, Checotan was much more subdued and preferred to take the measure of the world versus proving himself to it. Born and raised in Desolace; he had devotion to the Shadowhoof ways and were only matched by his love of the Chieftess herself. Once a simple hunter, Checotan went on a spiritual journey to reach his full potential and returned for only a short time before going missing.Seraiaga Ebonrage  Status: Crone/Matriarch ((Under construction))Current Leadership:\u00a0 Kurshaw  Current Status: Crone/Matriarch << The female Shu\u2019halo glared at the male who dared to insult her. \u201cI am the Matriarch to the Shadowhoof tribe. You will treat me with respect, for I am equal among you Chieftains.\u201d The male stood and chuckled as he raised a spear to the defiant woman, \u201cGo back to your male. We will speak with him in these matters-\u201d Before any of them could react, Kurshaw had ripped the spear from the grasp of the prideful male and had placed the point under his shocked muzzle. \u201cI will not return to my male and you will speak of these matters to me\u2026 Understood?\u201d >> <> Kurshaw was the former leader of the Shadowhoof tribe. She had a fiery spirit and a short temper when dealing with disrespectful Shu\u2019halo. She worked hard to ensure her tribe gained equal footing among the Shu\u2019halo who follow the way of the New Horde. She refused to back down and give up her tribal lands to the new races inhabiting Kalimdor. While she did not fully endorse the Grimtotem, she did not trust the Bloodhoof in any regards. She saw the downfall of many tribes as they relied on the Bloodhoof to aid them and the arrogant Horde did nothing as they perished. She made sure her tribe was not one of them.Notable Tribe Members  << The young Shaman saw the world unfold before him. Great monsters walked across the land as he cried out in shock. None of them paid him any mind, but that did not stop the poor Shu\u2019halo from fleeing in fear. Turning a corner he witnessed the great battle of Two-stone as waves of centaur ran past him, spearing women and children. His mind whirled and everything went dark. Opening his eyes, the young one meet the faded, milky orbs of the Elder Spiritwalker Mahaka. She smiled down on him as she cradled his head, \u201cWelcome to the past, present, and future young one\u2026\u201d >>Political Alignment  There are many levels to diplomacy, and the Shadowhoof are no strangers to such knowledge. While some factions are given their respects, most of the dealings the Shadowhoof have with others is cursory at best. It takes a lot to gain the trust of the Shadowhoof, as much of their life is in flux. However, for those that do they stand to gain the full assitance of the Shadowhoof whenever it is needed.The Horde  The tenuous alliance with the Horde has surface value at best. Unable to withstand the conflict of alliance raids, centaur overpopulation, and demonic incursion alone the Shadowhoof recognize the value of an ally. However, they also understand that without the Horde many of these problems would not exist in the first place. Most of the regular dealings with the Horde are conducted on a trade level. The caravans travel from Feralas to Thunder Bluff to trade goods and gather supplies to add luxury to their otherwise utilitarian lifestyle. Currently, there is tension as certian factions within the Horde have made it clear they do not like the Shadowhoof tribe's neutrality.Undermine  The goblins and their environmentally unfriendly ways are banned from the Shadowhoof lands. Their constant deforestation and \"dirty\" machines simply to make money cause Shadowhoof elders to cringe. Goblins only find a welcome table at Shadowhoof markets or walking along side their caravans. The tribe only give Goblins enough courtesy to sell at decent prices, one not often returned to them in kind. Only a select few who have worked hard to gain the trust of the tribe are given actual respect, and even so very few goblins have the time to deal with such political nonsense.Alliance Races  The Alliance races, in general, are seen as a threat to the lifestyles of any Horde member. However, showing their neutrality, the Shadowhoof have been alloted a few friendly interactions. For the most part, only the humans who attack the supply caravans are seen as a direct threat to the Shadowhoof. Generally, the Alliance is left alone and watched as it makes its way through Feralas.In-Game Factions  Alliance side: Shadowleaves - These Kaldorei battle the encroching Warsong Orc clan as they move across Ashenvale. The shadowhoof have taken interest in their attemps to protect Kalimdor forests and aid them when it suits the Shu'halo. A friendship lost to time, the shadowleaves have since vanished from the forests of Feralas. Stormkin - These Kaldorei fight for the protection of the Kaldorei homelands. They battle an uphill struggle against the destruction brought about by war between the factions. Considering them a kindred spirit, the Shadowhoof defend the Stormkin as if they were blood. Lost to time, the Stormkin are but a memory to most Shadowhoof after the Shattering. Horde Side: The Windsong Herd - A fellow Shu'halo tribe that the Shadowhoof call friends. A sister tribe to the Shadowhoof, these tauren are looked upon with fondness and are often invited to share in many of the tribes activities. A nomadic tribe, the Windsong often travel through the areas the Shadowhoof protect and so are afforded the\u00a0luxury of a personal escort through the feral lands of western Kalimdor. The Earthspear Tribe - Another Shu'halo tribe the Shadowhoof have dealings with, however the political atmosphere is a little more tense. Unable to fully trust the Horde heavy tribe of Shu'halo, the Shadowhoof see the Earthspear as misguided and often times a bit soft. However, all the same, they will gladly come to aid their allies if they are in need. The Son's of Un'goro - A strictly savage tribe of people who live within the crater of Un'goro. Lead by a Shu'halo pair, the tribe works to keep the corruption of Kalimdor at bay. The Shadowhoof, sharing a common interest, have a deep respect for the tribe as a whole even though many of it's members are not Shu'halo. However, the savage nature of the Un'gorians occationally causes the Shadowhoof to stand at odds with their beliefs, but that does not hinder their will to help if the were in need of it. Note: Allies are made through interaction and not through OOC noteriety. If we have not met you, we likely do not know you. If you do not show Shadowhoof elders and chiefs respect, do not expect Shadowhoof to show any respect to you or yours.Links Contact Us  ((Under contruction))Members  Kurshaw Shadowhoof Seraiaga Ebonrage Malanik Ironhoof Siksika ThunderhornFormer Members  Checotan Duskpelt]] Mahaka Ashmane Metoataske Blackcloud Bahuu Smoothhorn Teigue Dawnstrider Zhultas WolfheartRecommended Addons  The following are addons in use by some members of the Shadowhoof tribe.

Born a standard orc grunt, Bashkuga was in the front lines of the Horde as they went through the Dark Portal to arrive in the world of Azeroth.Biography Early life  Born in a time of war, in a place of war, Bashkuga drank the blood of of Mannoroth the Destructor with his mother's milk. From the day he could hold an axe, he was bred to be a Warrior, a soldier to take the world of man for his people. He had never known the beauty of Draenor before it's corruption by the demons, and before coming to Azeroth, had only seen the greens of the wild from his incredibly rare glimpses of Terrokar. Rock and ash were his trees and grass, battle-crys and the blood rage were his lullaby and dreams. His life was for the war waged on the other side of the great stone pillars, groomed by his commander to take battle as his way of life. His parents were never known to him from the last time he was fed by his mother, and never to be known again. The Horde was his family, each soldier his brother, Blackhand his father and that was all he needed. The day they would step through the portal was the closest thing to a celebration he'd ever known, and when the day came, the excitement nearly overwhelmed him. Greater then any sparring, or brawl he entered in to with his brothers, even more so then the pleasure he received from tracking and killing those that would betray and flee the Horde to worm out an existence in Nagrand. Although he was not greeted with the glorious struggle he so yearned for once he arrived on the other side of the portal, there was plenty to do. Much of which involved tracking and killing, although in a way he was not used to.Arrival on Azeroth  The green plants, and thick water were nothing but a hindrance, and a place for his prey to hide. Great black beasts, with fur and claws, almost like wolves, but with much squatter snouts, and thin, serpent like tails. Massive spiders with coarse, rigid fur all over each of their massive eight legs with dripping fangs of venom. Finally, his favorite, the great stout reptiles with jaws that could snap an Orc's arm in two, with hide thick enough to withstand any arrow that wasn't flung with the proper strength. Clad in natural armor, and born with weapons that could fell an opponent much larger then itself, Bashkuga took the greatest pleasure in challenging these great beasts. Each brought food and bounty to his brothers the likes of which he'd never seen in his life, and had only heard about in years passed from the older warriors. After a few days of trenching out their new found hunting grounds, more and more orcs ever slowly poured out of the great portal into the wet, stinking marsh, and eventually Bashkuga estimated that almost a full quarter of their forces were now knee deep in this new world. They were here far more as a hunting party, and he knew it. They were here for war. It was soon after that the young orc met the enemy for the first time. They were small, about the size of a female orc, pink skinned and often clad themselves in so much armor one could scarcely tell if they were flesh and blood. A few swings of the axe, though, and one knew for certain just how much blood they had. He was somewhat disappointed, as most of the time he had gotten more of a thrill out of killing the great lizards then these women sized enemies.    That was until one late night. A youngling of the pink skins race had somehow managed to wander into their territory. A survivor of one of the attacks on the pink skins caravans? A hunter looking for food in this dense wetland? Maybe a thief thinking that the Orcs were just savages, and trying to make off with some of their goods? He doubted the boy was any of these, as when confronted, he managed to blast one of Bashkuga's comrades with a bolt of power the likes of which he'd only seen come from Warlocks. It was moments after this that a second human, far from being a runt, or a boy, appeared, and with power that made Bashkuga's muscles twitch under every inch of green flesh, made short work of a warlock that moved to confront him. So these humans may well turn out to be a great struggle to defeat after all. Even with his lust for battle, and the blood of Mannoroth in his veins, the young Orc had no desire to come face to face with the tall man whom he had just seen leave with his ward. It was not so much fear that caused his hand to stay an axe, but knowledge of the fact that it would no doubt be meaningless to such a being, and some manner of respect he held for such a great power. Bashkuga was not a brilliant scholar, or a great sage, but he knew raw power when he was near it, and when he was out matched. To die in battle was one of the greatest hopes his kind could have, to end their lives fighting for something, but to be snuffed out in a scuffle with a being that thought of him as no more then a gnat, for no more reason other then his own ego was not something he wished for.The First War  As time went on, the Horde's presence became more well known, and the humans began to respond accordingly. This was what was known as the First War. As the years after the war slowly dragged on, more and more Orcs were forced into labor camps. Camps very often built by those that were meant to be imprisoned in them. At first, many put up resistance, expecting their brothers and sisters to rush in and free them from their human captors, but as time went on and their numbers began to swell, Bashkuga saw the light fade from the eyes of many of his kin. Once proud warriors who lived for freedom, and strength, were now pitiful prisoners, trapped in both body and mid, who were weak, and wallowed in the mud and filth of their self-built prisons. This fate was something that all, almost all, of the orcs fell prey to. Bashkuga would have sooner taken his own life then allow himself such a fate, and attempted to once or twice by trying to force the guards to kill him as he attempted to escape. Instead, all he received were beatings, and imprisonment, locked in a pit for days on end. The humans would rather break his spirit then end his suffering. These were not the proud and honorable pink skins he faced in battle, these were no more then cowards, dishonorable and treacherous.  As the years came and went, Bashkuga's resolve changed. He was not to die in this pit of filth, and he was not to become some mindless live stock to be treated as such. He was a warrior, and would live to one day see beyond these walls, even if that day was only because these walls became so old that they crumbled to dust, he would live to see it. That was the steel of his resolve. There was work to be done, and some days the soldiers felt that the Orcs were meant to pull their own weight, using them to replace their own men, or at times, their own beasts. Stone were broken to make roads to and from the prison camps. Buckets of water and slop hauled to the orcs each day, stagnant water not fit to bathe a toad in, and food that was more bone and hair then anything digestible. Some days soil needed to be reaped, and the guards took great pleasure in locking a harness upon an Orc as if they were a horse to be whipped. Each of these chores meant to be humiliating and degrading Bashkuga took, and from it he received no thanks from the humans, and from some of the more resolved Orcs, looks of disgust and scorn. But there was a method to this work he did. Each day, with each job, he pushed the boundaries of what was expected. Each time he pushed his body to the extremes, to the edge. He would often rip stones out of the ground with his bare hands rather then use a shovel to pry them free, then shatter them into smaller ones. He would carry twice, sometimes thrice, the load of dirty water and slop to his fellow prisoners, burning his back and legs with the weight of the load. He would pull the plow with as much speed and force as he could muster, tearing through the soil faster then even the stoutest of work horses, faster then his guard's whip could reach him. When his antics upset his guards particularly well, and they threw him in the hold, he would grip the bars that worked as the lid of his stony, subterranean cave, and lift himself up, and down, over and over, from when the night's moon raise to when the sun began to finally peak it's white head over the tops of the trees. He would force his body to match his spirit's resolve until his day to see the outside walls came. It kept his body strong, and his mind sharp, whenever he could he studied the guards who would train with each other in use of their small, light swords. When the guards would beat him, or another Orc, for some often fictional transgression, it provided simply another chance to learn their body language and gauge the strength of their strikes and blows. Even though his plans to escape had not presented themselves, it was all an attempt to keep his mind sharp, to not allow himself to dull, to remember what he had been trained for, and what he lived for. War, to fight, and to win. But something happened to change his plans... There had been a female Orc, one who had been captured more recently then the others, and it wasn't until her third month in the camp that it was realized she was with child. Something the guards cared little for, it simply meant another green abomination to watch, and this one an infant of all things. The food and water she consumed was not something to raise an unborn child on, and as the months rolled by, her body withered and her strength left her. Was it not for her powerful will to see her child live, she would have died months before she was prepared to give labor, but she did not, and the child was born. The last of her strength sapped, she died, leaving the child to fend for itself, a small squeal resounding from one of the hollowed out shacks that the Orcs had been locked in. Hours passed before the guards took it upon themselves to find out why the child's mother had not silenced it. Upon finding the deceased mother the guards saw this as an ample opportunity to send a message to the rest of the camp's inmates. Taking the child from the shack, he carried as one would a baby animal, holding it up for all the imprisoned Orcs to see. \"This...thing...is a spawn created by two of your race, and it will not be tolerated any more then you. Let it's fate be an example of what would befall all of your offspring that would fill this camp.\" As he dropped the child to the muddied floor, the guard drew his blade, and lifted it back over his shoulder in preparation to end the child's cries once and for all. At the moment the blade began to fall, a stone the size of a man's skull struck the plated shoulder of the guard, shattering upon impact, such was the force of the throw. Both the plate armor of the shoulder guard, and the man himself, crumpled under the impact. Bashkuga stood mute as the guard screamed for his compatriots to dispatch the infuriated Orc, and in the struggle, he had swept up the child, and scaled the wall near the pile of stones he had been transporting from the quarry site. Vanishing into the woods with his package in tow, the Orc was now not only a fugitive twice over, but made a commitment to a child in what was supposed to be his leap to freedom. It was several days before the Orcish Warrior relaxed enough to cease his meticulous covering of his tracks. Most days after his escape, he would only travel a few miles, as he was slowed by ensuring that he left no foot prints, broken twigs or even bent grass to show which way he had gone. It was agonizingly slow, but with his new baggage in tow, he felt it was the most reasonable way to ensure they both remained undetected. Finally, almost two full weeks later, Bashkuga escaped into the forests of Silverpine, leaving the peaks of Alterac and the rolling lands of Hillsbrad in his dust. Little did he know he'd traded the threat of human capture for something much worse, and far less predictable. Although he'd been raised a Warrior meant to cleave limb from foe, Bashkuga was not inept in the ways of the hunt. He'd enjoyed the bounty of Silverpine, from the meat of the Bear, to the bounty of the large lake that sat nestled in it's center. He'd spent months there, scavenging for shelter from day to day, never staying in one place long enough to think of it as anything more then a camp, ever making his way North, farther and father away from the territories of the human encampments. The Orc had never come across anything much more threatening then a larger then average bear in those woods, save for a close encounter with a particularly nasty Murloc. The vile thing had decided that it was curious enough about the bundle that the Orc had left on shore to make a mad dash for it, probably thinking it was food or some particularly shiny trinket. Bashkuga was only a yard or two away, but he was knee deep in water with a crude fishing spear in his hands. He knew the water would slow him down enough for the Fish-man to make it's way to the infant long before he had even reached the shore. In that instant, the warrior in him took over and he flung the spear, which had already impaled one fish that day, which caught the Murloc dead in the throat. There was twitching and spurting of blood, but that night, Bashkuga had his first taste of Murloc Meat. The infant had a new harness made from Murloc leather, which he was always in whenever Bashkuga was spear fishing and was strapped securely to the Warrior's chest each time. For a long while, life was good. The Orc hunted, he lived and he was free. It was as close as he'd ever felt to the old ways, as the more senior warriors had spoken of them. Even so, he knew he was not exactly like his ancestors. Every night, when all he could feel was the surging of his blood like the march of an army and the pounding of his heart like a great war drum, he knew that he thirsted for battle. Not with beast, but with a warrior. One clad in armor, that fought on more then just instinct and the need to survive. One that would test his wits as well as his strength. As far as he had come, he knew he had never fully escaped what he was built to be. Soon the Orc would realize, there were others to fight beyond man and beast. There was a terrible union. As he and his charge traveled farther and farther north, game became more scarce and even the Murlocs whose settlements dotted the lakeside like kelp washed on the shore began to lessen. The only thing that increased was the number of markings on the trees, as if made by a great bear to warn others of where they tread. But they were not wide enough to be made by a bear. As the Orc placed his hand upon one of the wounded trees, he couldn't help but think that the claws were just the right size to have been made be a five fingered hand.Physical appearance  Built like a tall and powerful Orc warrior should be, he has a deep green flesh tone, and red eyes. His tusks are short and sharp. Just below his tusks sprout a pair of 'saw blade' styled beard strands which matches the same style and color of hair atop his head. Aside from numerous scars along his arms, neck and torso that he wears as badges of honor, the Orc has a crude black tattoo burned into the flesh of his right shoulder, like a brand. One particularly deep scar runs across the front of his neck in a single, clean cut.Combat Information Fighting style(s)  Bone Crusher - Originally Bashkuga's only know style of combat was that of the Bone Crusher. This style of combat focuses on raw power and unstoppable momentum, becoming a juggernaut through nothing but sheer force of will and muscle. Most often this style involves the use of crushing or cleaving weapons, or short of that, hand to hand combat. The use of armor in this combat style is often minimal, but when it is used, it augments his already natural flesh armor to near supernatural levels of endurance. This style most often uses two weapons if any.Physical attacks and techniques  The Double Deuce - Swinging both fists down upon his opponent, Bashkuga can disarm them by wrenching their shoulders, or at times, even dislocating them. This move can be augmented with a pair of axes, which can make the move much more effective...and messy.Equipment Personality and traits  Bashkuga holds great respect for those that show great physical strength and prowess, but tends to look down upon Rogues, thinking of them as sneaky backstabbers, who shy away from a real fight and care only for themselves. He also has a strong dislike for Warlocks, due to how much they corrupted his people, and Mages, feeling they are not much better then Warlocks. Cowards that hide behind the true Warriors, and throw spells from a safe distance. He has respect for those that work as healers, and the most respect for those that would wade into the midst of battle and fight side by side those they choose to heal, such as Druids and Shaman. His opinion of Paladin tends to be on a case by case basis, finding that most Alliance Paladin are strong, and worthy of respect, but that Sin'dorei Paladin are whiny, self absorbed and over dramatic. Although he appreciates fine weaponry, he rarely strays from the use of axes, or fists, in fights. At times he will grudgingly accept the use of armor, but when he does, he still refuses to cover his upper armors or chest, feeling that it restricts his movements, as well as dishonors the spirits that watch over him. His hide has become thick enough to act as a natural armor, and his faith in the spirits protection augments even that.Strengths  Endurance. The life of a Bone Crusher is an intense one. His existence is purely to master the physical, to become a living weapon and to become unstoppable. A Bone Crusher can run at full speed through a platoon of armored opponents, crushing them under toe or throwing them into the air. They have the stamina to charge for hours without needing to stop or slow. Their hides can deflect attacks that would pierce the flesh of most mortals.Weaknesses  Temper. Bashkuga's temper can overwhelm his better nature and more intelligent persona, even moreso then that of other Orcs. When the Blood Fury rises up within Bashkuga, his mind falls back to a less intelligent and more beastial state, even his speech and mannerisms becoming far simpler. Such a state does not reverse itself as soon as the source of the fury is over, but takes a great deal of concentration most often achieved through meditation, or a loss of conciousness (either from force or from sleep). He has limited to no understanding of the use of fel or divine magics. His lack of armor leaves him vulnerable to poisons and extreme changes in temperatures. His skill with ranged weaponry is modest at best, and while he does possess some Shamanstic abilities, they require more concentration to use then most.Klaus  Alurklaus Dai'luan Highthorne (known simply as Klaus) is a shadow priest of the sin'dorei. He is well-known by his comrades for attacking his enemies with haunting visions, yet compassionate personality.History  Although much of his history has faded within his memory, recent mind manipulations have revealed that Klaus was part of a ruthless attack on a village, murdering women and children, and torturing their defense for his own pleasure. Leading this attack was Klaus' older brother, Rhovin Highthorne, a skillful yet unstable marksman and tracker. This attack has been said to happen more than six years ago, as Klaus suffered through memory loss after his father attempted to murder him. Rhovin saved Klaus by convincing his father to let him be the one to end him. Rhovin faked his brother's death and left his unconscious body in the Ghostlands. Klaus would awaken to find no recollection of who he was or how he came to be. The reasons for his father's betrayal is unknown.Traits & Personality  Although usually mistaken for being shy and quiet, Klaus displays a level of confidence that has him introduce himself to even the most random person. His somewhat childlike demeanor can get him in trouble at times, as he fails to realize when he insults a person through his blunt disposition. He quickly apologizes to those who admit his unintentional disrespect. He also takes a liking to goblins, although some find it odd as he has admitted to wanting one as a pet and usually treats them as such by attempting to scratch their ears or simply petting them.Powers & Abilities  Klaus is seen as a very powerful shadow lord within his peers, and could be considered a High Priest if his people allow him this title. He manipulates the Light to offer painful damage to his enemies. Because of this, he gained other abilities shadow priests are known for, such as shadowform, dispersion, and mind sear. He is keen at sending false images in a person's mind to bring out their worst fear and force them on their knees to the brink of terror before killing them.Relationships  Rhovin Highthorne - twin brother of Klaus, yet polar opposite in spirit. Both brothers hold great hostility towards each other as Rhovin refuses to believe his brother will not accept what he once was, where as Klaus assures that part of him is dead, and he will kill in cold blood no more. Rhovin has been on a long quest to make his brother's life miserable.Trivia External links Character Age Chart  See WoWPediaPixiz Midlik  Pixiz \"Pixy\" Midlik (born April 13th, Year 8 ADP) is a goblin of the Bilgewater Cartel. She is also a warlock with the guild Destiny Reforged, and the resident Horde DJ of the popular Club Trix nightclub in Gadgetzan.Biography  Pixiz Midlik was born on Kezan during the time of the Second War, when the empire of cartels that ran goblin society had just started to gain their power with their new partnership with the Horde. As a teenager, Pixiz started her work in the fel arts with the hopes of gaining enough power to move up the ranks of society to get a cushy job with the Kajaro Trading Co. and live rich and comfortable for life. She sought out the best trainers her limited funds at the time could buy, and remained under their tutelage until she turned 20. At age 20, her world was turned upside down as Deathwing's appearance, and subsequent triggering of Mount Kajaro, drove her and the rest of the Bilgewater Cartel from Kezan. Since the First Bank of Kezan froze all assets, she was ruined, and was shafted onto the slave ship heading away from the city. After a small pit stop at the Lost Isles, and the Bilgewater Cartel's later induction into the Horde, Pixiz settled with the rest of the cartel in Azshara, moving into her current home in Bilgewater Harbor. Since then, she has continued her warlock training, started an enterprise selling herbs and metal bars at attractive prices, and obtained her position at Club Trix in December of Year 29 ADP.\u00a0 This residency lasted until late 31 ADP. In early 31 ADP, Pixiz' arrogance got the better of her, as she was jailed by a Kor'kron detail for speaking out against Garrosh Hellscream.\u00a0 She spent 2 months in a prison camp at Warsong Hold before being sprung by a combined effort of friends in both the Horde and Alliance, with the cooperation of the Taunka, the Forsaken, and the Steamwheedles.\u00a0She was considered a fugitive from the Kor'kron, and contributed to the efforts of Vol'jin in the Rebellion. In mid 32 ADP, she founded a new nightclub event with Amylin Stormpike called Club BOOM!Physical appearance  Pixiz is about average height and weight for her race. her hair may look ginger at first glance, but a close eye may notice the beginnings of green roots. It's best advised not to ask her about it. Her eyes are usally hidden by goggles she wears simply as a fashion statement. When casual, she's fond of Sage's clothing for what she describes as an \"upbeat\" feel.Personality and traits  Pixiz is quite vain. She has been known to keep her goggles on while geared simply because she thinks they look better, regardless of what abilities a proper helmet could give her. She is also on the greedy side as well, taking up Herbalism and Mining simply for the gold it nets her from sales of herbs and smelted bars. Her biggest love, however, is attention through power and fame. To these ends, she has honed her skills in the fel arts, and is trying to get into the \"in crowd\" in several areas, going so far as getting DJ training for Club Trix. Anyone who makes friends with her should continue to keep their eyes on her, though the ones most loyal to her tend to get their loyalty paid back to them, sometimes in gold. She also has a bit of a reputation as a practical joker, though if you end up on the receiving end of one of her jokes, then it means you're on her good side.Draenei  Long before the fallen titan Sargeras unleashed the Legion on Azeroth, he conquered the world of Argus and its inhabitants, the eredar. Believing that this gifted race would be crucial in his quest to undo all of creation, Sargeras contacted the eredar\u2019s leaders \u2013 Kil\u2019jaeden, Archimonde, and Velen, offering them knowledge and power in exchange for their loyalty.Draenei History  Only Velen abstained, for he had seen a vision. In it, his people were transformed into demons; members of Sargeras\u2019 Burning Legion, a growing army of unspeakable evil. With the aid of the benevolent naaru, Velen gathered like-minded eredar and escaped Argus. These renegades would call themselves the draenei, or \u201cexiled ones.\u201d Kil\u2019jaeden, infuriated by the draenei\u2019s flight from Argus and their refusal of Sargeras\u2019 offer, led the Legion\u2019s armies in pursuit of his former people throughout the cosmos. But the draenei eluded their hunters, discovering sanctuary on a remote world that they would name Draenor. There, the draenei developed an extraordinary society and coexisted peacefully with the shamanistic orcs native to the planet Draenor. Kil\u2019jaeden eventually found Draenor and corrupted the noble orcs into a single, bloodthirsty force: the Horde. Blinded by rage, the Horde slaughtered most of the draenei race and forced any survivors into hiding. After being exposed to fel energies wielded by orc warlocks, many draenei were mutated into physically deteriorated forms known as the Krokul, or \u201cBroken,\u201d. Years later, the shaman Ner\u2019zhul opened magical portals throughout Draenor, and the resulting energies shattered the dying world. What remained of Draenor\u2014henceforth known as Outland\u2014devolved into a battleground among the Burning Legion and other factions vying for control of the ruined landscape. To escape the chaos, Velen and a number of his followers commandeered a dimensional fortressnamed the Exodar. In search of new allies, the draenei left Outland. However, the blood elves had sabotaged the Exodar\u2019s engines, and the draenei ultimately crash-landed on the world of Azeroth, where they pledged their loyalty to the Alliance. Together with their new allies, Velen and his refugees returned to Outland and defeated their demonic rivals. But Velen had another vision: a coming war between the forces of light and darkness. The draenei now prepare to defend their new home, Azeroth, against a shadow they believe is fast approaching.Brightmoon Faire  There is a ragged paper tacked on a post near some bedraggled looking tents. Welcome to the Brighmoon Faire Grounds. We are happy you have come to enjoy the biggest little show on the face of Azeroth (better than Darkmoons anyway.) We have performers! We have vendors! We have fortune tellers! ... pay no mind to the shady fellow by the tree, he is not looking at your coin purse at all ---- Come have an ale!History  Founded by Owakeri Brightmoon, the faire lived on through the hard work of his daughter Lindiwe and her husband Astenya Brightmoon. During the Cataclysm, much of the Faire was destroyed while enroute to a show in the Barrens. After the dust had settled, some members of the faire lived one performing small shows and busking in even smaller towns. Keyandros Highdawn got a hold of the rights to the Faires name in the year 623 and for a time, revived the Faire to its glory days. Even throwing a couple of seasonal bashes. However he was forced to give up on the fair due to lack of experienced performers.Out of Character  Founded on January 20th 2009, Brightmoon Faire was one of the oldest roleplay guilds on the Wyrmrest Accord server. The Brighmoon Faire officially went on hiatus in May of 2015. The primary focus was to promote public RP through planned events and through support of various community events. We were firm believers on the golden rule: RP is where you make it, and encourage all of our members to RP whenever and wherever they want.Community Involvement  Besides performing regularly at various venues once a month, the Brightmoon Faire was found hosting or participating in numerous events, such as the Brightmoon FAIR Market (one of the first player run markets on the server), The Noble Bachelor (a yearly date auction), and the Brightmoon Faire Seasonal Bash (a quarterly party). Owakeri and Lindiwe also headed up the first Gathering of Druids events on the server, which is still being run by Lindiwe to this day.See also External links Lindiwe Brightmoon  Lindiwe Brightmoon is a Tauren druid that specialises in plaguewalking and healing. She coordinates seasonal rituals for members of the druid community and those outside the community who are interested. The following information is all the information found in her file with the Cenarion Circle. The following information is considered public information and is written as in-character. Any information on this page can be used in RP interactions.Appearance  Anaketa, aka Lindiwe as she prefers, is a short, thick, Tauren. She has white and orange mottled fur, brown shoulder length hair and cropped bangs that tend to hide most of her eyes, though they are green and tend to express exactly what she is thinking. Lindiwe favors casual clothing as opposed to ceremonial gear or leathers, though during ritual or formal occasion she will wear more formal attire. She decorates her hair and robes with many charms and beading that most druids prefer, but two things stand out: a necklace with an orb pendant, and a single ring with a bright red stone... both of elvish make.Personality  Lindiwe presents herself as a friendly and easygoing individual. She is can be passionate and it shows the most when she throws herself at subjects that she is interested in. As with people who are as passionate as she, her emotions can sometimes become out of her control... becoming unreasonably angry or spiraling into depression. However, she has a good head for leadership and takes to it naturally. Her voice is confident, loud-ish, clear and rings across a room commanding attention. She is the perfect candidate for public speaking, and is likely practiced from her time with her father's faire. She does not shy away from crowds, and her presence naturally draws people.Relations  Owakeri - biological father (whereabouts unknown - see file on Brightmoon, Owakeri) Onawataya - biological mother (deceased) Uzyell - adoptive mother (deceased) Astenya - husband (nee Deus, presumed deceased) Lilyana - adoptive daughter (whereabouts unknown) Selia - adoptive daughter (whereabouts unknown, presumed deceased) Notes: The Brightmoon family tree is extensive, boasting over 9 children fathered by Owakeri, Lindiwe being one of the younger. There are many branches of extended family from both the Brightmoon and Deus lines, see appendix A for complete list with statues. Many of Lindiwe's relations seem to be deceased or missing since the Cataclysm.Cenarion Circle Status: Active  Rank: Shan'do Focus: Plagueshifting, dreamwalking and healing arts Shan'do: Mulgris Deepriver (deceased) Current Thero'shan: None Past Thero'shans: Tatharon Crowfeathers Notes: Because of her history with public speaking and her experience with many races, Lindiwe was approached to lead information sessions and public rituals that would be used as teaching tools. She does the rituals during holidays and hosts information sessions that focus on the history of druidism and topics that hold the interests of druids. In the past Lindiwe has been hesitant to take on A Thero'shan, preferring to hold classes rather than mentor privately. She had taken on Tatharon with much uncertainty, but he flourished under her tutelage and has become a fully train druid within the Circle. She still has not chosen another student, but we would like to see her take on another.Druidic Talents Totems  The following is a report of the various forms that Lindiwe applies to her druidic work, and her proficiency with them. Cat: unable to connect with the guardian spirit for a number of years, since before the Cataclysm. There may be corruption involved. Bear: basic application of the totem. Stag: advanced application of the form: able to talk and carry loads. Bird: advanced application of the form: able to talk, cast minor spells, can hold the form for a long period of time. Whale: basic application of the form. Moonkin: rejected by guardian spirit. Treant: advanced application of the form: can talk in form, cast advanced spells, hold form for an extraordinary period of time (indefinitely as far as we know).Healing  Lindiwe has extraordinary healing abilities, especially when it comes to healing things tainted by disease. She has demonstrated that she is an expert in mending of bone and tissue, even in the most serious cases in the field. She can heal with the aid of magic as well as in the more traditional ways with salves and potions. She often will supplement her magical heals with herbal tinctures as she believes it (with the aid of time) creates a stronger bond of tissue.Plagueshifting  The advanced healing of disease comes with the territory of her chosen focus, plagueshifting. She has put herself at risk from poisons and disease to heal the lands, and helped with some of the cleanup on the Plagueland in recent years. Though this focus is rare among druids, she has a natural affinity for it and has mastered the art of accelerated growth of plants and curing of poisons and afflictions among other things.Dreamwalking  Lindiwe had been groomed as a Grove Walker when she first took on the druid arts, and can tend to The Dream in a Dreamform and well as her physical form. However, after the Cataclysm she has not kept up with her training down this path, instead focusing on plagueshifting. It is unknown where her talents lie currently in relation to dreamwalking.Notable Service History  The following is notable service history (year of the Kings Calendar). Year 602 - Recommended for service - natural affinity for plants and traditional healing. Year 607 - Assigned to Mulgris Deepriver as a Thero'shan, starts advanced training. Year 614 - Lindiwe's Shan'do dies, after review Lindiwe is advanced in rank to full druid. Year 616 - Personal leave. Year 620 - Lindiwe returns to Cenarion Circle, is reinstated as full member. Year 623 - Assigned a Thero'shan, starts work with The Forward Line and public information sessions. Year 625 - While on assignment with the Forward Line to bring down a commander of the Legion, Lindiwe was corrupted by the Emerald Nightmare. Under the power of the Nightmare and the artifact that the Legion gained, Lindiwe's powers were amplified and she wreaked havoc on her former friends. The members of the the Forward Line had reached their limit when for a moment the power of the Nightmare was suppressed, allowing Lindiwe the clarity of mind to seal her powers and save her friends. Sealing her powers sapped the last of her strength, and she collapsed - becoming one with the earth. A tree in Duskwood marks her last stand. No body was recovered, and she is presumed dead. Notes: Lindiwe's leave was spurred on by the death of her Shan'do as well as meeting her biological father, former druid Owakeri, who convinced her to be in his on-going business venture - The Brightmoon Faire. In her time working with the faire, she also met her husband and adopted two children. It is known that she and her husband took over the faire after the disappearance of Owakeri and ran it for a time. The Faire was destroyed in the Barrens en-route to the next show by Deathwing. Lindiwe's husband and daughters have been missing since, and are presumed dead. She came back to Moonglade looking for seclusion and peace, losing herself in her work. It was by the advice of some of the Elders that Lindiwe be encouraged to take on a role outside of Moonglade before she really did become lost, and therefore was assigned to keep watch over a Horde Troop that requested a field healer, The Forward Line, from which she informs the Circle of ongoing Horde activities. As part of further outreach Lindiwe runs information session for the public, and seasonal rituals, when time allows. Lindiwe's Thero'shan has recently been advanced to a full druid in wake of the need of skilled druids in Val'sharah. Though she has not shown interest in taking on another, we would like to see one assigned once things calm down.See also  Brightmoon Faire - A record of the faire Guild that Lindiwe was the head of.

She is the daughter of Akio Furukawa and Sanae Furukawa. Nagisa appears as both the female lead, and later on, the wife of the protagonist, Tomoya Okazaki throughout the Clannad manga and anime. Nagisa becomes an even greater force in the anime in the ~After Story~ arc, culminating in her marriage to Tomoya and the birth of their only daughter, Ushio Okazaki. Nagisa's signature theme is a song named Nagisa, after her, from which various songs such as Dango Daikazoku, Small Palms, and Nagisa: Parting at the Foot of the Hill are derived.Appearance  Nagisa Furukawa is a beautiful young girl with short, wavy auburn hair that reaches a little below her shoulders. She has a frail physique, as noted by Tomoya, therefore she is petite compared to her peers, due to her poor health and weak immune system. She also has two prominent ahoge sticking out on top of her head. The two ahoges resemble the letter 'M', and she inherited that physical trait from both of her parents (Akio and Sanae). Nagisa has olive skin and big, downward-slanting, amber eyes. She usually wears the Hikarizaka Private High School uniform, but her casual attire is light and girly. She wears 2 red clips at both sides of her head. Nagisa usually leaves her hair down, but she ties it more frequently into a ponytail or a bun during the After Story arc. She blushes a lot and is noted to be very cute even though she denies it wholeheartedly.Personality  Nagisa Furukawa is a shy girl who is always kind and sweet towards others, even going out of her way to assist a stranger. She is selfless and self-depreciating as she thinks lowly of herself and values other people\u2019s happiness more than her own. Nagisa is naive and optimistic, as she always sees the good in everyone. In After Story, she is noted to be smart and diligent by the manager of the restaurant she is working in. Like her mother, she is very sensitive and feels insulted easily. Nagisa usually lets her emotions out and has a holding them in. At times, she accidentally is too honest and blabbers out the truth. She can, at times, be confident though, like her determination in starting the drama club. Especially after meeting Tomoya and other friends, she grows more stronger, even to the point of somewhat bossing Tomoya around. Nagisa is seen as a strange girl, having a habit of motivating herself by muttering the names of food that she plans to eat. Her favorite foods are anpan, a type of sweet bean bread, and pork cutlet (which is Kyou Fujibayashi's best course). Despite her introverted personality, she is social and talkative so she isn't a quiet person. Nagisa is bubbly and cheerful, especially since she is very fond and passionate of the Great Dango Family. Nagisa is sometimes quite enthusiastic and easily excitable when comfortable. She also loudly sings the theme song all the time, providing some comic relief. But she is also embarrassed a lot so she tends to talk to a lot to fill in conversations, however, usually with meaningless chatter that makes no sense. Nagisa always speaks politely, as she always ends her sentences with \"desu\", which can be considered as her verbal tic. She is also very girly and speaks in a high and soft voice, the highest of all characters, and calls people by honorifics. She may be airheaded or a klutz but she is perceptive of other people's thoughts and feelings. Nagisa is thoughtful and catches on to how people feel and the situation that causes them to be the way they are. Because of her cute and childish demeanor, she has an easily noticeable presence, attracting the attention of strangers, including several male customers. Of the girls except Kyou and Fuko, Nagisa is one of the most talkative and draws all the attention to herself.Quotes  \"Um, I think someone better for you will show up.\" - Nagisa to YouheiBiography  Nagisa is in her third year throughout the time she is depicted attending the Hikarizaka Private High School. Due to an illness which lasted nine months, she was forced to repeat her final year of high school; as such, she is a year older than her classmates, including Tomoya. Her poor health continues to serve as a major plot catalyst throughout Clannad, and it is revealed that she has periodically suffered long bouts of illness since the age of five. Although she has no memory of the incidents, Nagisa nearly died as a child due to her parents' unintended negligence; their preoccupation with their careers prevented Akio and Sanae from caring for her properly during her illness. Nagisa's life was spared, however, after Akio begged for her to become healthy again.Clannad  Nagisa is the central heroine of Clannad. She is introduced at the beginning of the first episode of the Clannad anime, On the Hillside Path Where the Cherry Blossoms Flutter, wherein she meets Tomoya on a long hill path in front of the school, and she is also the first character to speak in the anime. In the visual novel, Tomoya quietly voices his thoughts out before he meets her, when we are introduced to her strange habit of motivating herself by muttering the names of food that she plans to eat. In the anime, her introductory monologue begins with the name of her favorite food, anpan, while in the VN she starts asking herself whether she likes this school and whether she'll be able to like it if all funny and happy things are gone. She also displays a great liking for the Great Dango Family, a commercial, cultural mascot and fad. Nagisa lives with her close-knit family in the residential quarters of Furukawa Bread, her parents' business. Throughout the first storyline of Clannad, we are slowly introduced to new aspects of Nagisa's character; she does not have much self-confidence, and her insecurity requires her to seek help in order to motivate herself through the day. Nagisa desires to join the Drama Club; however, the Club was disbanded the previous year when all the members graduated, and no new students showed interest. Having discovered this, she and Tomoya work to reestablish the Club. In The First Step, Nagisa and Tomoya discover that they cannot advertise to recruit new members, having missed the deadline to do so. In order to establish an officially-recognized club, they find they need at least three members, as well as a teacher to act as club advisor. The only available teacher is Koumura, who asks them to discuss their plans with the Choir Club, to whom he has already pledged his support as advisor. The members of the Choir Club tell Nagisa about Rie, a member of the Choir Club who used to be a very good violin player, but is now unable to play due to an accident. After listening to Rie's story, Nagisa abandons her dreams of reestablishing the Drama Club, believing the Choir Club to be in greater need of Koumura as an advisor.  Youhei Sunohara, a friend of Tomoya's, is furious about the story, and decides challenge the Basketball Team to a 3-on-3 match to show the Choir Club members that it is wrong of them to hide behind their handicap. His plan is a success, and the Choir Club agrees to share Koumura with the reestablished Drama Club. After Tomoya has a falling out with his father, Nagisa suggests Tomoya move into her house until things settle down, and Tomoya agrees. Curious about a play Nagisa is working on, which bears a striking resemblance to the Illusionary World he has dreamt of, Tomoya seeks information about its story, leading him to learn the secrets behind Nagisa's illness. Nagisa, accidentally learning of her past, feels guilty about her role in forcing her parents to give up their dreams. During her performance in Two Shadows, Nagisa begins crying, forgetting to recite her lines. However, her father calls out to Nagisa through the hall, assuring her that she is not at fault and encouraging her to continue to follow her own dreams. Sanae and Tomoya join in Akio's encouragement, and Nagisa successfully performs the play. The following day, Tomoya confesses his love to Nagisa. She accepts his love and the two begin their relationship as a couple.~After Story~  After enjoying some time with her friends and living a normal high school life, Nagisa succumbs to her sickness again in the ~After Story~ arc, and is forced to repeat her final school year for a third time. She tries to reestablish the Drama Club once again, but does not succeed, lacking the great encouragement she received from Tomoya while he was still a student. However, she manages to continue attending school every day, and dons a brave smile throughout the year. When Tomoya leaves the bakery to move into his own apartment, Nagisa visits him almost every day and cooks meals for him, keeping him company. She is always seen encouraging him to do his work even if it means that she is left on her own, such as when she waits for him at the Founder's Festival for over an hour. When winter comes, Nagisa becomes ill once again, though not enough as to make her repeat her third year yet again. When her illness forces her absence at the graduation ceremony, Tomoya organizes a mock ceremony for her in Graduation. Soon after, she and Tomoya marry. Along with Rie, Nagisa begins waitressing at a family restaurant. Nagisa becomes pregnant in A New Family, and she and Tomoya decide to name their child Ushio, borrowing the root of Nagisa's name. In White Darkness, Nagisa enters her final months of pregnancy, and the strain on her body causes her to fall ill once more. Nevertheless, she perseveres, and successfully gives birth to her daughter, Ushio; however, she dies shortly after childbirth. Ushio would suffer her fate, and die of the same mysterious illness several years later. Both Nagisa and Ushio are eventually resurrected, when Tomoya wishes for a miracle to turn back time. Despite deciding to avoid his first meeting with Nagisa, in order to change their fate, he finds he cannot let Nagisa go, but by calling out to her again, he proves he doesn't regret meeting her, and the delivery goes well, allowing both Nagisa and Ushio to survive.Trivia References Tomoya Okazaki  Tomoya Okazaki (\u5ca1\u5d0e\u670b\u4e5f, Okazaki Tomoya?) is the main protagonist of the Clannad visual novel and anime series.Character Outline  At the beginning of the series, Tomoya is a 17-year-old third-year student of Hikarizaka High. He deeply resents his town Hikarizaka because of all the bad memories he experienced while living in it. Ever since his mother, Atsuko, died in a car accident when he was young, Tomoya Okazaki has been living with his alcoholic father, Naoyuki Okazaki, with whom he argues with constantly. He resembles his father, having tan skin, spiky blue hair and deep blue eyes. Tomoya used to be a basketball player in middle school, but he received a permanent injury during a fight with his father, in which he got brutally slammed into a wall and the impact dislocated his right shoulder. Since then, he could no longer lift his right arm higher than his shoulder and he quit basketball afterwards. After that incident, Tomoya's relationship with his father has been very distant. Tomoya began to view life cynically as a delinquent, holding a grudge against his father. He is best friends with Youhei Sunohara and is a childhood friend of Kotomi Ichinose. As he progresses through high school, he meets many new friends, such as Kyou, Ryou, Tomoyo, Fuko, and of course,\u00a0Nagisa. He is a cynical and sarcastic delinquent who has a tendency of always arriving late to school and skips classes during the day and staying out all night, hanging with Sunohara in his room. Tomoya enjoys having company, playing lighthearted pranks on people, especially Sunohara or Fuko. Occasionally, he teases Nagisa or the Fujibayashi twins. Despite Tomoya's seemingly antisocial ways, he is a sociable and protective friend who cares deeply for all of his friends, especially Nagisa, and loves solving their problems. Though he is also unaware that some of the girls at school show interest in him or, most likely, pretends not to know. Tomoya is the type of person who thinks deep thoughts about his life but usually does not voice them out. Though Tomoya is a delinquent, he does not go around looking for fights. He is usually somewhat quiet and silent, being more approachable than a stereotypical delinquent. However, when he does get into a brawl he is shown as a very tough fighter.Clannad  The major story in Clannad is about Tomoya learning about family and friends that will slowly change his cynical and negative outlook on life. In the episode On the Hillside Path Where the Cherry Blossoms Flutter, Tomoya as a third-year student meets a girl named Nagisa Furukawa while walking uphill towards school and befriends her, thus setting off the main story. Tomoya begins interacting with her along with Kyou, Ryou, Tomoyo, Fuko, and Sunohara; discovering their history and his own forgotten memories in the process. He also meets Nagisa's parents: Akio Furukawa and Sanae Furukawa in the process. He began to harbor feelings for Nagisa towards the end of the first season of the Clannad anime. Tomoya canonically ends up with Nagisa in the Clannad visual novel and its ~After Story~ arc, as well as the anime. He also has alternate timeline counterparts that end up with Tomoyo and Kyou respectively in the both the visual novel and anime. Tomoya also has the option of ending up with Fuko, Kotomi, or Yukine in the VN.~After Story~  In the ~After story~ saga, Tomoya has helped a lot of people like Sunohara, Misae and Yukine settle their problems and is about to graduate high school. His love for Nagisa grows stronger until he eventually marries her after both of them graduate and he gets a job as an electrician, thanks to Yusuke. Afterwards Nagisa becomes pregnant with Ushio. During those months, Tomoya takes care of Nagisa as she grows ill, and once Ushio is born, Nagisa passes away. Afterwards, Tomoya goes into a five-year depression, and barely interacts with his daughter, who is left in the care of Akio and Sanae. Later he takes her on a trip, where they meet Tomoya's grandmother, who tells Tomoya about his father's struggles after his wife died. Tomoya realizes that he's putting Ushio through the same kind of relationship he and his father had and soon becomes a better father. The two of them return to Hikarizaka and he apologizes to his father, as well as introduces Ushio to him. His father accepts and claims that his role as a father is over. Afterwards, Tomoya's dad moves back with his own mother, and Tomoya receives an orb of light, only noticed by Ushio. Later on, however, after Tomoya becomes the true father of his intent and making happy memories with Ushio, Ushio returns to school and brings together his old friend, Kyou, whose dream was to become a kindergarten teacher during their high school years. Kyou explains that a sports event is approaching. Tomoya and Akio ready themselves for the event with post haste, however, Ushio is struck with the same devastating sickness that took the life of her mother, Nagisa, and Tomoya takes it upon himself to remain with her until the sickness subsides. The sickness does not pass, and Tomoya begins to lose hope. Months later, winter approaches and Tomoya is still looking after the sick Ushio, who requests to take a trip to the field of flowers that they'd once entered before. Tomoya, unable to bear disregarding his only daughter's wishes in return for her health, agrees eventually and begins the trip with her. It begins to snow, and halfway on the walk up to the northern field, Ushio collapses, and Tomoya catches her. As he holds Ushio, her last breath being, \"Daddy. I love you\", Tomoya's daughter dies in his arms, and as he succumbs to the pain and grief of losing both Nagisa and Ushio, he falls into the snow. It is theorized that he dies when he collapses as he stops moving and crying, seemingly, breathing after he collapses. After the event that Ushio is revealed to be the girl in the other world, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Ushio are able to be sent back in time, and the robot assisting the girl in the other world turns out to be another form of Tomoya, in the world that ended. Tomoya, in possession of enough light orbs to turn back the hands of time, is taken back to when he first met Nagisa and reluctantly doesn't speak to her at first out of the belief that it was his doing that she and Ushio died. (Although without him, Ushio would essentially have never existed.) However, in the knowledge that he can change things, and that Nagisa is all he ever wanted, Tomoya doesn't let Nagisa turn away and walk past him the day they met, and embraces her, discovering that she remembered everything he had. Nagisa tells Tomoya to never regret the time they spent together, and how happy they were. Tomoya returns to the day that Nagisa is in labor, but this time Nagisa survives, as does Ushio, who never suffers the sickness her mother had. This is because the wish Tomoya made also cured her of her disease. Tomoya lives his happily ever after with his daughter and wife. In Episode 23, it seemingly takes place in their Junior Year. Tomoya hadn't met Nagisa yet, and everything is in the same timeline. In Episode 24, Tomoya tells Ushio and Fuko a story about before Ushio was born and recaps the entire series basically. When Ushio and Fuko fall asleep, he states that he has a vague memory of Nagisa and Ushio dying, while not stating that he may have died. Afterward, Nagisa calls for them to go home and Ushio and Fuko wake up and leave with Tomoya. In the final episode of the ~After Story~ arc, this takes place in an alternate timeline. Similarly to the final episode of the previous season, Tomoya never met Nagisa, but instead of loving Tomoyo, he is supposed to love Ryou, as per Kyou's desire to help Ryou, but ends up with Kyou.Characters of Clannad  This is a list of characters which appear throughout the Clannad series, including the visual novel, anime, Clannad ~After Story~ and other related productions.

Ushio's hair is mostly left untied, with the exception of a small section of hair at the back of her head which is tied using a large, white bow/ribbon.Personality  Ushio is more similar to her father, Tomoya, except that she isn't antisocial and is a positive person to be around.Clannad ~After Story~  She only appears in the After Story arc of the anime, the beginning of the Clannad opening, and in the movie. After giving birth to her, Nagisa dies. This deeply depressed Tomoya, and he gave up raising Ushio soon after and left her to the care of Akio and Sanae. Tomoya resorts to alcohol and cigarettes to ease his depression. Five years later, Sanae arranges Tomoya and Ushio for a trip in hope for them to be together again. During this trip, Tomoya meets his grandmother, Shino, and learns about his father's past and the sacrifices he made for Tomoya, which leads him to regret his actions, and he decides to raise Ushio and acknowledge Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya sets things right, Ushio is struck with the same disease as Nagisa and despite the efforts and sacrifices that Tomoya, Akio and Sanae made, Ushio's fever never subsides but actually worsens. In the coming winter, being filled with the desperation of wanting to do anything for Ushio, Tomoya brings her for a trip, but she falls unconscious and dies shortly after along with her father who succumbed to his grief. Ushio is then revealed to be the Girl in the Illusionary World. Not wanting her family to suffer from such a cruel fate, she created the Illusionary World in order to meet Tomoya again and collect enough light orbs to make a miracle possible and save their lives. In the anime, after the truth is revealed, having collected enough orbs, Tomoya manages to turn back time and call out to Nagisa. Ushio's birth then happens again, but this time, Nagisa doesn't die, and she, Tomoya and Ushio live happily together as a family, freed from their tragic fates. This will also happen in the visual novel if you've collected all the necessary light orbs. Asides from Tomoya, who vaguely recalls these memories, no one else seems to remember anything. In the epilogue, Ushio is shown sleeping under the same tree where Akio begged for Nagisa's life to be saved.Tomoyo Sakagami  Tomoyo Sakagami (\u5742\u4e0a\u667a\u4ee3, Sakagami Tomoyo?) is one of the major heroines of Clannad and the title character of its sequel visual novel, Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~. She transfers to Hikarizaka Private High School as a second-year student during the spring and has a reputation as a tough girl who beats up troublesome delinquents. Kanako calls her the strongest in a brawl during Tomoyo After. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student. She has a younger brother named Takafumi and is revealed in Tomoyo After to have a half-sister, Tomo. Tomoyo's theme is Her Determination.Appearance  Tomoyo Sakagami is a beautiful young girl. She has long, straight, silver hair that reaches her upper thighs. She wears a black headband, and she has messy bangs and locks of hair framing her face. Tomoyo has navy blue eyes and a stoic expression.Clannad  Tomoyo is first shown to be a tomboy who is rumored to be violent and possesses a misconduct record for fighting. These rumors are later confirmed, when she beats up several delinquents from her previous school during school hours. Youhei challenges Tomoyo, unable to believe what he saw. She easily defeats him, and it becomes a frequent gag in the series for Sunohara to challenge Tomoyo for stupid reasons, which always ends in his defeat. Tomoyo usually uses chain combos with her high-speed kicks, even combining with Tomoya once. Sunohara's face is usually hidden after the beating, implying it to be too damaged to show on screen. After several meetings with Tomoyo, Tomoya learns from her that she wants to become the president of the student council. Later, it is revealed that her goal is spurred by her desire to preserve the school's cherry blossom trees, as they are considered significant by several residents of their city, including the Sakagami family. Having involved herself in a fight, Tomoya assumes responsibility in order to save Tomoyo's reputation. Nevertheless, rumors spread that Tomoyo is the leader of a gang of delinquents. In order to boost her popularity to become the student council president, Tomoya convinces Tomoyo to challenge all the school's athletic clubs to a match. With some minor help from Tomoya and Sunohara, her great strength prevails and she eventually manages to win all the challenges. Ultimately, she becomes the student council president.~After Story~  In ~After Story~, Tomoyo makes brief appearances from time to time, such as when she is asked by Sunohara to pose as his girlfriend, when she asks Misae for advice on her school political career, or when she patrols the area for delinquents. However, she is not the focus of any major plot points. She is briefly mentioned during Yukine's arc; Yukine's brother, Kazuto Miyazawa, is said to have been the only person who could have faced Tomoyo and stood a chance of beating her during her delinquent days. After Nagisa is forced to repeat a year, she ends up being in the same grade as Tomoyo, although the latter can't spend much time with her due to her duties as student council president. However, she attends Nagisa's solo graduation ceremony. She was mentioned during the New Years Party. Although, she does not attend the party herself. In the last episode, she is seen looking at the sunset at the beach on her own. It has been hinted in bonus material that she attended university and did many great things.Another World: Tomoyo Chapter  Another World: Tomoyo Chapter is the first of two original video animations included with Clannad and its sequel. In an alternate timeline, Tomoyo and Tomoya are secretly dating. Rumors of Tomoyo's relationship with Tomoya spread quickly through the school, and the school's administration attempts to separate them, in the hopes Tomoyo will concentrate more on her position as student council president. Tomoya, worrying his delinquent status will hold Tomoyo back, reluctantly breaks their relationship off. After eight months, the two meet again, and Tomoyo informs Tomoya of her success in saving the cherry blossom trees. However, she expresses sorrow at having lost something in return: her time with Tomoya. She then confesses to Tomoya that she wants only him, and will follow him to the ends of the earth. Tomoya is touched by her words, and the two decide to resume being lovers. In the Visual Novel, after Tomoya graduates in the spring, he sees both Takafumi and Tomoyo off to school, with both of them admiring the beauty of the cherry blossoms.Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~  Due to the popularity of her character, a year after releasing the Clannad visual novel, a spin-off titled Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ was released. It focused on the continuation of Tomoyo's route in Clannad, chronologically taking place sometime after the events of her (Tomoyo) route in said visual novel (Clannad), meaning several weeks have passed after Tomoya graduated from high school in the spring and Tomoyo herself becoming student council president and saving the cherry blossom trees (this is the ending to Tomoyo's route in Clannad, and Tomoyo After (being the spin-off sequel to Tomoyo's route in Clannad) continues where it (Tomoyo's route in Clannad) ended/left off, which is depicted above, starting several weeks later after the ending to her route in Clannad, with she and Tomoya reconciling and deciding to resume being lovers). Tomoyo and Tomoya are in a romantic relationship, several weeks after he graduated from high school and she became student council president, and he is living in his own apartment while working in a recycle shop. While Tomoyo is still a high school student in her third year, she occasionally stops by Tomoya's house to cook his dinner, having a running gag of their intimate moments being occasionally interrupted by Takafumi's arrival. One day, it is discovered that Tomoyo has an illegitimate younger half-sister named Tomo, with whom she shares her father. Due to her mother's psychological problems, Tomo ends up living with Tomoya along with Kanako, Takafumi's ex-girlfriend, who hates the thought of her mother remarrying and freeloads at Tomoya's apartment. Tomoyo loves Tomo a lot and spends a lot of time with her. The visual novel focuses on the struggles of the different characters while keeping the focus on the importance of family, just like the main story of Clannad. When they decided to bring Tomoyo back to her mother at a remote village, Tomoya came up with the idea to build a school, which eventually passed on to the villagers. Despite being the one who suggested said idea, an accident leads to a massive head injury which rendered him comatose. Tomoyo and Kanako assist the villagers in building a school while at the same time wearing a bear costume. Due to Tomoya's head injury, he suffers from amnesia which caused him to remember until his years in middle school. To make things worse, Tomoya's memories were reset each week and the source was stated to be a brain tumor. Fearing the operation may cost his life, Tomoyo agreed with Naoyuki to abandon it and instead taking care of his health under the pretense that his original memories would return naturally. She obtained help from the school to permit Tomoya's visit in hopes for his memory's recovery but to no avail. This process continued for three years, to the point where she maintains her school uniform. When Tomoya voiced his love for her (in his entire reboot, Tomoya only express his thanks), Tomoyo quickly breaks down and reveal the true secret to him. Before Tomoya succumbs into another memory loss, he proposes his marriage to Tomoyo. In the next awakening, Tomoyo only revealed her engagement and he remembered his love for her. After paying their visit to Naoyuki, Tomoya accepted to have the brain operation at the hospital in the next day, where he was greeted by Tomo, who wished him good luck. Tomoyo was with Tomoya to accompany him for the operation, so she also met Tomo at the hospital. Although the operation failed in terms of sustaining his life, Tomoya was able to regain his lost memories (of Tomoyo and his whole life) before eventually dying (from the complications of the operation) by Tomoyo's side (he died right beside her in a wheelchair, she didn't die obviously) several days later when the two watched the sunset on a cliff (an ending which is acknowledged and confirmed by the manga adaptation, where we are shown his (Tomoya) marked gravestone in the expanded epilogue (said epilogue gives us a more conclusive closure to the story compared to the VN's ending, which ends right after Tomoyo finished sharing her story to the internet, which she did sometime after Tomoya's death. However, we aren't shown explicitly on how Tomoyo, Takafumi, Kanako, and Tomo are doing sometime after Tomoya's death in the VN's ending, making said ending quite vague unlike the manga adaptation where the expanded epilogue made for said adaptation expands on the ending of the VN, giving us a one-year timeskip (several months after Tomoya shared her story online to help people through grief, so the timeskip is one year after Tomoya's death) where we are shown Tomoyo, Tomo, Takafumi, and Kanako visiting Tomoya's grave and how the four are doing presently a year after Tomoya's death) given in the manga adaptation, signifying his death). Sometime later after Tomoya's death, Tomoyo shared this story to the internet under an anonymous account in hopes of helping people through their grief online, just like how he helped others. Note: the above is for the original, first release of Tomoyo After, released in 2005 as an 18+ adult PC version. This version confirms (or makes it quite obvious) that Tomoya dies, which the manga adaptation acknowledges and confirms as well, considering that it's based on this version (the first, original release in 2005, the adult one with sex scenes). In the Memorial Edition of the visual novel, the final scene added is Tomoyo finally reuniting with Tomoya, although the interpretation of the situation is differed from certain people, either: Which of these interpretations are true is up to everyone, they decide what they want to believe is true. It's speculation at best. Of course, this made whether Tomoya dies or not very vague here, so it is based on our speculation. It's what we want to believe is true, there's no clear answer to it.Quotes  \"From what I've heard, you're habitually late. As your friend, I can't let that be.\" - Tomoyo SakagamiReferences Kyou Fujibayashi  Kyou Fujibayashi (\u85e4\u6797\u674f, Fujibayashi Ky\u014d?) is a close friend of Tomoya Okazaki in the same year. Kyou is the older and more well-known one of the Fujibayashi twins. She was Tomoya's class representative in their second year, and has maintained a steady friendship with Tomoya even though they are put in different classes on their third year, remaining one of the few female students who don't mind talking to him. Her theme is That's Like the Wind.Personality  Kyou is a loud and aggressive girl who is bad mouthed and never afraid to speak her mind. She is decisive and reliable, which makes her seem like an older sister to everyone. She is an average girl who is extroverted, outgoing, bold, communicative, and sociable. Kyou is the kind of person to never get bored with, as she always has something to talk about. Despite her usual expressiveness, she is too shy to make a move on Tomoya. Her Tsundere personality makes her more popular with girls than with guys, which she is upset about. The girls in school call her \"Kyou-sama\" (which translates to \"Miss Kyou\" or \"Lady Kyou\" in English), make banners about her, and follow her around at times. She also likes joking, sometimes kind of indecently. She is the older one among the Fujibayashi twins, her younger sister is Ryou, her love for whom (as a sister) breaks the limits of one's imagination (and it's not only Ryou who she loves that much, which is implied in Kyou's route in the VN), from which comes her protectiveness of Ryou. She is intimidating and athletic, with a tendency to throw various books towards anyone she gets furious with, especially Tomoya or Sunohara. When it comes to romance, Kyou is easily jealous or envious, especially around Tomoya, though towards Tomoyo moreso than Nagisa. They have somewhat of a tension and rivalry in strength. Like her sister, Ryou, Kyou is a class representative and a third year in the Hikarizaka Private High School. She is the class representative of class 3-E in Clannad, though she doesn't take this responsibility too seriously, and often violates the school rules. Unlike Ryou, Kyou is an excellent cook, with her best course being pork cutlet.Appearance  Kyou Fujibayashi is a beautiful young woman with long, straight, violet hair that reaches her waist, and striking purple eyes. Two parts of her hair arch up, forming cat-shaped \"hair arcs\" that resemble the letter M, just like her twin sister Ryou. She has two locks of hair framing her face, and average-sized breasts. Like her sister Ryou, Kyou wears a ribbon-like hairpiece, but hers is on the left lock of hair, while Ryou wears it to the right. She and her sister can be distinguished by their eye color, as Kyou's eyes are purple, while her sisters are blue. In her route, she cuts her hair to make Ryou feel better.Clannad (visual novel) Kyou's story  Twins' story begins with Tomoya gradually growing closer to each of them. During that he learns about the particular qualities of Ryou's fortunes (to be exact, their results are always the opposite to what is going to happen) and the fact that Kyou is a heavy sleeper, gets hit by Kyou's bike multiple times, gets to know that Kyou is very popular among underclassman girls and soon enough comes to understand the reason of that: Kyou's confidence and protectiveness sets up an image of her as that of an older sister to everyone. During all this time Kyou was thinking on how to pair Ryou up with Tomoya. It's unknown when exactly did Ryou fall in love with Tomoya; it's implied that Kyou and Ryou fell for him at the same time which leads to the conclusion that, most likely, it happened at the first year. They both knew about each other's feelings for Tomoya, but Kyou decided to sacrifice her feelings for Ryou's sake as soon as she asked for her help. So she comes up to Tomoya and uses his sense of pride to lure him into going to the courtyard to have lunch with Ryou, then to go home with her and, finally, to go to the courtyard and \"return her feelings\". The plan she developed is so perfect (at least, in Kyou's opinion) that she doesn't even bother hiding it from Tomoya. All this time Ryou is convinced that Tomoya shows her attention of his own volition. Yet when Tomoya agrees to start dating Ryou, he does so after rethinking it for himself and actually considering it worth trying. Then comes the time when Kyou totally devotes herself to making both Ryou and Tomoya happy together. Knowing Tomoya and his tastes, Kyou tries to make Ryou bolder and more confident while teaching Tomoya how to be a good boyfriend. Being a heavy sleeper, she goes to the trouble of waking up at 5 o'clock in the morning to make lunches for them all. She even guides them on their first date, during which Tomoya notices that he just wouldn't know what to do if Kyou wasn't there. Kyou sets up a situation where Ryou would express her tastes about gemstones, but gets into her own trap as well and names her favourite gemstone simultaneously with Ryou. Then she makes sure Tomoya remembered what exactly does Ryou like. Later on she ran to buy a deck of tarot cards as Tomoya's gift for Ryou for their next date. Two days later Tomoya tries to taste Ryou's cooking for the first time and finds out that when she said she's a terrible cook, she meant it. Before the long three-day holiday Tomoya and Ryou make an agreement about a date on the third day since Ryou has to go on a profession-related trip to another town. Tomoya comes to understand how happy can he be by just knowing someone needs him just because it's him. During the holiday Tomoya and Kyou go to the forest to walk Botan. There, Kyou tells Tomoya her story about how she found the baby boar trembling under the cold rain and felt too sorry for it to leave it there. Tomoya seems to be moved by that story and have finally found out how kind Kyou actually is. So he even agrees to Kyou's idea of a kiss practice (Kyou said it was just so Tomoya won't fail when doing so for real with Ryou). Having already started harboring feelings for Kyou, he awaits the actual kiss, but Kyou stops his face a millimeter away from hers (she has a sister she has to pair up with this guy, so she can't take him for herself). Tomoya decides to buy Ryou a gift himself and goes for the gemstone she wanted. But due to having already fallen for Kyou (yet not realizing it at the moment) he can't correctly remember what did Ryou want exactly and buys a pendant with Kyou's favourite gem instead. At the day of the date with Ryou Tomoya is lucky enough to accidentally leave the pendant at home. After receiving the results of the fortune from a machine, Tomoya and Ryou kiss for the first time. Someone saw Tomoya and Kyou almost kissing in the forest, due to which corresponding rumors started to spread through the school. Kyou decided to avoid Tomoya and reject everything about them dating so the rumors would eventually die down and won't disturb Ryou; Kyou, on the other hand, would be able to always stay close to Tomoya, even if as a friend, again. Just to kill those rumors, Kyou even goes so far as to start dating Sunohara, which is seen by Tomoya. He was about to shout for her to stop, but Youhei successfully drove out of the situation himself by pointing out that Kyou isn't that confident in her feelings and actually loves Tomoya. The next day Kyou tells Tomoya that she doesn't see him in any special light and decided not to date Sunohara because it would be mean to him since Kyou has no feelings for him, which, as obvious, is only part true. Kyou gradually returns to her regular self (at least, she seems so) while Ryou becomes bolder, practices cooking and so on; in other words, she tries to become as much like Kyou as possible for Tomoya. This leads the guy to self-hatred since his inertness to his feelings led him to a terrible situation: he knows how much Kyou is hurt seeing him with Ryou, but he doesn't want to hurt Ryou by breaking up with her since it's obvious how much Ryou loves him; Kyou will get mad at him as well. At this point, he still hopes that doing nothing will somehow lead him out of this. On a next date with Ryou, he jokingly offers her to go \"where no one will see them\" and do corresponding things. Despite Ryou was taken by total surprise, she accepts Tomoya's offer before he tells her he's serious about her and means her no harm, so he doesn't want to hurry the events up. Tomoya notices he cannot clearly tell Ryou that he loves her. Later Tomoya finds out that Kyou went from school early. He sees Botan through the window and deduces that Kyou is still somewhere on the school ground. Tomoya ignores the fact that lesson is still on and goes to find Kyou. She tries to escape but ends up in his embrace. Kyou tells Tomoya about that both she and Ryou loved him, but Kyou was afraid to be rejected or to hurt Ryou's feelings if she was accepted, that's why she concealed her own for that long. She told that she secretly wished Ryou failure with Tomoya, but actually did everything so Ryou would succeed. Tomoya tries to tell Kyou about his feelings for her that he came to realize over the time, but Kyou cuts him off before he could and says that he has to care for Ryou only. Ryou reads Tomoya's fortune with tarot cards and it turns out to be deadly accurate: Ryou was like she was actually reading her beloved's past, present and future, his thoughts and feelings. She already knew who did Tomoya love in fact (that's the exact reason she started to behave like Kyou of her own volition), so she covered those grim results up with a happy smile and a phrase \"Everything will be OK for us\". Next day, Sunohara clearly states to Tomoya that he won't be able to get out of his situation clean-handed: he will have to hurt someone by clearly deciding who does he love. The only choice given to Tomoya is who will he hurt. Tomoya privately asks Kyou about what will she do if he breaks up with Ryou. Kyou says she doesn't want Tomoya for herself if it needs someone else to cry. It takes Tomoya a day to make up the resolve to voice out his decision. First, he tries to tell Ryou they're breaking up, but fails; all he could do was reject her kiss; that was enough to make Ryou run away in tears. Later on, a rugby club member comes to Sunohara's room and tells Tomoya that one of the twins was looking for him and that it seems she was the younger one. Tomoya runs around the school to find her, but only succeeds in the evening. He tells everything about his feelings to a short-haired girl with indefinite due to the sunset's tint eye color. The girl surprises Tomoya by turning out to be Kyou. She tells him that it's Ryou who told her not to give up and fight for her happiness until the very end. Tomoya finally gives Kyou the pendant he thought he bought for Ryou. Then Kyou and Tomoya kiss again. After some time, Tomoya also meets Ryou in order to say sorry for everything he blamed himself for. Ryou asks him not to apologize because in that case, she would forgive him and that'll make her believe that all the happy memories they made are but a lie. Tomoya comes to understand that despite everything, it was time when they were happy, so there is a reason to be friends again. Later, in the fall, Kyou tells Tomoya that she only cut her hair so she could hear for herself what he was going to say to Ryou. She also tells that Ryou has found a boyfriend (presumably Kappei). Kyou remembers what Tomoya said a few months before about his favorite hair length and promises him to grow her hair out again so he'd love her even more.Clannad (anime adaptation)  Kyou is overprotective of her younger sister, Ryou, throughout the entire series, and we first see her when she shoots a book at Tomoya thinking that he was bullying Ryou. She knows of her little sister's crush on Tomoya since junior year, so she tries her best to get them together and separate Tomoya from any sort of romantic interest (like Kotomi and Nagisa), even though she is their friend and means them no harm. She helps Kotomi during her arc and supports her and Nagisa. However, while working so that Ryou and Tomoya become a couple, Kyou falls in love with Tomoya. This is proven in season one when Kyou sees Tomoya and Nagisa together. After Nagisa had been hit by a foul tennis ball, Tomoya helped her to the nurse's office. She looked at Ryou and tried to tell her that she was sorry and that she couldn't get Tomoya to fall in love with her, but Ryou stopped her and said, \"Onee-chan...I'm so sorry...\" Kyou then looked at her in shock and said, \"Wh-What are you t-ta--\" Kyou then stopped as she noticed tears welling up in her eyes. She tried to hold back the tears but she just started sobbing. The two sisters hugged and cried as they finally came to their senses that Tomoya is already in love with Nagisa. Kyou becomes a member of the Drama Club, although she only signs up so the minimum number of members will be reached.~After Story~  Kyou appears as a secondary character during most of Clannad ~After Story~. She plays in the baseball match at the beginning of the season and attends Nagisa's mock graduation ceremony later on. She is also seen visiting Nagisa during her pregnancy. Later in ~After Story~, Kyou works as a kindergarten teacher, and coincidentally is also Ushio's teacher. According to Tomoya, her personality is still the same, even after the reunion, but Ushio says that Kyou is a good teacher. She misses Nagisa and is often reminded of her each time she sees Ushio.Quotes Trivia References Characters  A list of characters pertaining to the Clannad series.Fuko Ibuki  Fuko Ibuki (\u4f0a\u5439\u98a8\u5b50, Ibuki F\u016bko?) is a first year student at the Hikarizaka Private High School. Fuko's theme song is Hurry, Starfish.Appearance  Fuko Ibuki is a very short girl, and she has a rather child-like stature, as she is one of the shortest characters in Clannad. She usually wears her Hikarizaka Private High School uniform. She has dark, greenish, gray-brown hair, and large, innocent, and droopy golden-yellow eyes. Fuko's hair is tied into a very low ponytail, using a large periwinkle ribbon.Personality  Fuko Ibuki is a very eccentric and childish girl. She is totally obsessed with starfish, and she is usually alone, making small wooden carvings of starfish with a carving knife, to give to her others as presents. That hobby completely drains her concentration and awareness of the people around her. Fuko loves starfish so much that she daydreams about starfish at any time of the day, though nobody bothers to wake her up. Fuko always refers to herself in the third person when talking to people. She is very fond of Ushio. She is rude towards Tomoya and Youhei, but deep down, values her friendship with Tomoya. Whenever people insult starfish, Fuko tells them that they are very rude. According to Fuko's older sister, Kouko, who stated that when Fuko grew up, she still thought that she is a freshman, and maintained the exact same personality that she had when she was a teenager, due to her sleeping (being in a coma) for years.Clannad  Tomoya meets Fuko in an empty classroom, carving a block of wood with a knife. Tomoya confiscates the knife after noticing that Fuko is hurting herself, but he eventually returns the knife the next day. Some days later, Tomoya learns from Fuko that she is carving wooden starfish, whom everyone mistakes as being common stars, to be distributed to all the students in the school, wanting them to attend her sister Kouko's wedding. The main problem is that no one in the school knows about Kouko, who had retired from teaching art three years ago. She likes starfish so much that she will often go into a starfish daydream at any time during the day, which no one manages to wake her up from. Tomoya uses this time to play pranks on her. After learning about Fuko's accident and her unknown existence as an ikiry\u014d, both Nagisa and Tomoya decide to assist Fuko to accomplish her dreams. Just when they thought everything was going well, Fuko starts to disappear from everyone's heart, due to her waning spiritual powers, as the real Fuko had stopped breathing in the hospital. Wanting Kouko's wedding to happen, Tomoya asks Koumura to organize the wedding ceremony on 18 May. Through many struggles and hardships, Kouko's wedding turns into a success and everyone that was given a starfish carving came to the wedding. After the wedding, Fuko thanks Tomoya for everything he did, and congratulates her sister before disappearing. After the wedding, Kouko and Yusuke decide to thank Fuko in her hospital room. After Until the End of the Dream, Fuko randomly appears during tense situations and tries to help, but doesn't really do anything that helps solve the problem.~After Story~  Through a miracle, Fuko recovers from her coma in the After Story arc. Because she had spent seven years sleeping, her personality is the same as it was when she was fifteen years old. She is extremely fond of Ushio Okazaki, intending to take her away from Tomoya. She often visits Ushio and plays with her. Fuko first appears in The Road Home with Koko, she immediately takes a liking to Ushio but her inappropriate behaviour towards Ushio annoys Tomoya and Koko but Ushio accepts her as a friend, calling her \"the weird girl\". In The Tidal Breeze's Mischief, Fuko comes to the Okazakis' apartment to play with Ushio. She has lunch with the Okazakis and they play cards together even though she and Tomoya continue to annoy each other and she tries to run off with Ushio. Later in the episode, Fuko finds Ushio standing outside Hikarizaka General Hospital one evening. She warns Ushio of the dangers of going out for walks alone at night and escorts her home. Fuko still wakes up and meets Ushio sleeping under the same tree where Nagisa's father begged for her life to be saved. She still befriends Ushio and can be seen with Ushio and Tomoya in Under the Green Tree.Trivia References Kotomi Ichinose  Kotomi Ichinose (\u4e00\u30ce\u702c\u3053\u3068\u307f, Ichinose Kotomi) is a childhood friend of Tomoya Okazaki, but, like Kyou Fujibayashi, she is in the same year and in a separate class from Tomoya. Kotomi is a genius girl who is almost always seen in the library reading books, or cutting up pages of printed media. Kotomi's theme is \u00c9tude Pour les Petites Supercordes.Appearance  Kotomi may just be of average height, but she has a large bust size, which is why Kyou Fujibayashi enjoys teasing her, hugging and groping her and complimenting her build. She is considered a beautiful young girl. She also has straight indigo hair that has an odd length of short and long, with strands of hair that completely cover her ears, and bangs parted in the middle. The short part of Kotomi's hair framing is divided into two sections and tied into two small horsetails with two large pink beads. Kotomi is flat-chested in the visual novel, with her huge breasts (and the largest bust size out of the female cast) being an aspect of hers in the anime.Personality  Kotomi Ichinose is a silent girl who has trouble speaking with others. She relies on Tomoya to help her with her social skills. She knows how to play the violin, but she usually ends up sounding horrible. This is a gag used for comedic relief. Kotomi prefers to be called \"Kotomi-chan\". Despite her strange antics, Kotomi is always one of the top ten people in all of the subjects at school. She is very intelligent, and she likes to read books, even books in foreign languages. Kotomi is somewhat mature and quite a polite girl.Clannad  Tomoya meets her but does not remember that they were once good friends when he enters the library and finds Kotomi sitting on the floor barefoot, reading books with scissors in her hand, and acts oddly with Tomoya. After several meetings with Kotomi, Tomoya starts skipping the fourth period to spend time with Kotomi in the library. Kotomi soon decides to join the drama club. Just when Kotomi starts to open up to everyone, a bus accident causes her to breakdown in front of everyone and returns home. Tomoya visits her in her house and learns that he and Kotomi were childhood friends, but lost contact with each other after Kotomi's parents died in a plane crash. Not wanting to feel the pain of losing someone important anymore, she asks Tomoya to leave her alone. Wanting to bring Kotomi away from her past, Tomoya decides to renovate her garden, while the drama club members decide to gift her a violin, but was unfortunately destroyed. After renovating Kotomi's garden, Kotomi appears to Tomoya, and after some poignant conversation, Tomoya brings Kotomi out of her house. The next day, her guardian presents Kotomi her parents' briefcase that has traveled all the way to Japan, and inside is a teddy bear and a testimony, asking Kotomi to live the way she wants and grow up to be an adult. Kotomi realizes she is still being loved by her parents even after their death and cries. After this, Kotomi becomes more mature, and the Drama Club members finally give Kotomi a violin.~After Story~  In the anime adaptation of Clannad ~After Story~, Kotomi moves to America to further her studies. She, however, occasionally visits Tomoya and the others. She attended the reunion party with Tomoya and the other girls. She is very interested in what her parents were studying before they died, which is the theory of parallel worlds. She tells Tomoya, Nagisa, Ryou, Kyou and Youhei about this theory while they visit a pregnant Nagisa. This theory may explain the existence of the Illusionary World. She is last seen driving around in her car, presumably in the USA, judging by the side of the road she was driving on.Quotes  \"Day before yesterday I saw a rabbit, and yesterday a deer, and today, you.\" - Kotomi to Tomoya \u201cI must study lots of things or I won\u2019t become a great person.\u201d \"Those who seek out the truth must not be arrogant. You must not laugh at miracles just because they cannot be explained scientifically. You must not turn away from the beauty of this world.\" - Kotomi Ichinose (according to her father) \u201cI was a crybaby from the start, but it was my first time crying like that. I cried and cried until I got tired of crying and slept; When I woke up, I cried again.\u201d - Kotomi Ichinose (according to Clannad Visual Novel) \"I've been alone for as long as I could remember. But just when I thought I had nothing else in the world. When I thought that all I could do was cry. Tomoya came to rescue me. So, you don't have to worry about me anymore. I'm finally happy now. Very, very, very happy.\" - Kotomi Ichinose to her parentsTrivia References Youhei Sunohara  Youhei Sunohara (\u6625\u539f\u967d\u5e73, Sunohara Y\u014dhei?) is Tomoya Okazaki's best friend who is also a delinquent. He entered the Hikarizaka Private High School on an athletic recommendation in soccer, but was kicked out of the Soccer Club after being involved in a fight. After this incident, he became very careless, becoming the only student with a higher absence rate than Tomoya. He is left-handed when it comes to sports and fighting (this is only mentioned in the anime), but he writes with his right hand, hinting that he is ambidextrous. He and Tomoya are known as the \"Dirty Pair\" in school. His hair is naturally black but he bleached it blond. Later in Clannad ~After Story~, he no longer has bleached hair. This was so he doesn't lose his job. He has a younger sister named Mei Sunohara.Clannad  Youhei is mostly a comic relief character. Tomoya spends a lot of time with him in his room. Unlike Tomoya, he is extroverted and dimwitted. However, Youhei plays minor roles in some of the character arcs, such as Fuko's, when he helps her when everyone is starting to forget about her. Youhei is generally cocky, rude, and obnoxious, but he is caring towards his loved ones deep down. He is the one who comes up with the idea of challenging the basketball club to a match in order to get the Choir club members to realise their determination after Yukine reads his fortune, and Tomoya and Kyou team up with him during the three-on-three match. As noticed by Tomoya, because of what happened to him in the past when he was kicked out of the Soccer Club, he hates people who use handicaps as excuses to get it their own way. His relationship with his younger sister Mei is a bit distant, but if she is bullied by other people, Youhei becomes defensive of her and his personality changes from light-hearted to serious.~After Story~  During the first episodes Clannad ~After Story~, which are focused on the Sunohara siblings, Mei is worried about her brother. Thinking that he must find something to pretend he is happy with his life in order for Mei not to worry anymore, Youhei attempts to get a fake girlfriend, who finally turns out to be Sanae, who dresses up as a high school student. However, this turns out to be inefficient, and Mei starts thinking that he is not as dependable and strong as he used to be. Hoping that he will go back to being a good brother, she tries to pretend that she likes Tomoya, trying to get some response. However, Youhei makes no comments, but is obviously furious. Youhei doesn't go to school for a while, and Nagisa, Tomoya and Mei go to the Soccer Club to beg to the members so they let Youhei rejoin, wanting him to have a goal in life. Even after being forced to do tedious tasks, they refuse to let Youhei come back and start bullying Mei. Youhei then storms in and, together with Tomoya, beats up the whole team for bullying Mei. He then fights against Tomoya, revealing that he was worried about Mei all along. Nagisa and Mei intervene, and everything is solved. The next day, after seeing each other's swollen faces, they laugh and become good friends again. Later in ~After Story~, he graduates along with Tomoya, and attends Nagisa's own graduating ceremony in Graduation after being begged by Tomoya, and visits Nagisa when she is sick and pregnant. He is replaced by Akio Furukawa in his role as a comic relief character. Youhei starts working at a company as soon as he leaves high school. As seen in the episode Small Palms, it seems to be some kind of driving company.References List of Clannad ~After Story~ episodes  This article contains a list of Clannad ~After Story~ episodes. A continuation of the first anime series, entitled \"Clannad ~After Story~\" was produced by the same staff as with the first series, and contained the same cast of main voice actors. The second season aired in Japan between 3 October 2008 and 26 March 2009 with twenty-four episodes. Of the twenty-four episodes, twenty-two are regular episodes, the twenty-third is an extra episode, and the last episode is a summary episode showcasing highlights from the series. An original video animation (OVA) was later released on the DVD.See also Ryou Fujibayashi  Ryou Fujibayashi (\u85e4\u6797\u690b, Fujibayashi Ry\u014d?) is a secondary main character, Tomoya's classmate and his class representative. She is the younger and less known one of the Fujibayashi twins.Appearance  Ryou looks very similar to her sister, Kyou, but with a few differences. Unlike Kyou, who has hip-length hair, and sharp, purple eyes, Ryou has short-cropped hair and droopy, blue eyes. She wears her hairpiece to the right. Like Kotomi, her breasts are sometimes emphasized in scenes from the anime, although she is flat-chested in the visual novel.Personality  Unlike Kyou, she is timid and doesn\u2019t cook well (but is otherwise good at chores). She gets flustered easily and blushes a lot. Ryou doesn't talk very much and tends to fade into the background. Even Nagisa is less hesitant towards other people and slightly contributes more to conversations. Though of course, being an average student, Ryou is fairly social and has her own friends outside of her sister and the Drama Club, but still is invisible nonetheless. She is very keen about fortune telling, but her predictions, while incredibly specific, usually manage to be either somewhat skewed or extremely wrong. Only once, in Kyou's route, her fortune turned out right.Anime  The Fujibayashi twins are average students in Hikarizaka Private High School. They both liked Tomoya since junior year. However, since Ryou is too shy to talk to him, she could never bring herself to ask him out so Kyou took it on as her mission to get Tomoya to see Ryou, even if it meant separating him from any romantic interests (such as Kotomi and Nagisa). However, over this time, Kyou fell in love with Tomoya, but kept her feelings quiet for fear of hurting Ryou. Near the end of season one, Kyou witnessed Tomoya helping Nagisa to the nurse's office, and she suddenly realized that he was in love with Nagisa, not her. Kyou turned to Ryou and tried to apologize for not being able to get Tomoya to like her, but Ryou stopped her and said, \"Onee-chan...I'm so sorry...\" Kyou then looked at her, shocked, and said, \"Wh-What are you ta--\" Kyou then stopped when she felt tears well up in her eyes. She tried to hold back the tears but couldn't and started sobbing in front of everyone. The two sisters hugged and sobbed as they realized that Tomoya would never like them. In Another World: Kyou Chapter, it is set in senior year and Ryou finally worked up the nerve to ask out Tomoya. He says he hasn't known her long, but he agrees to go out with her. They start going out on dates, but they don't show any affection. As this is happening, Kyou tries to forget about her feelings for Tomoya by kissing Sunohara, but he saw through it and asked if she really loved Tomoya. Tomoya overhears this, but Kyou quickly makes up an excuse and leaves. Later, Kyou finally admits that she's in love with Tomoya. This leads Tomoya to break up with Ryou because he realized that he was really in love with Kyou. Kyou then cut her hair in sacrifice to hurting her sister, but Ryou assured her that it was okay, and that she couldn't help who she fell in love with. In Clannad ~After Story~, Ryou attends a nursing school. Her job as a nurse is proven when she is seen working as a nurse.Visual novel  However, her \"true\" story in the Clannad visual novel is very different. If you decide to avoid Kyou's scooter on the right side, you will eventually encounter Kappei Hiiragi. Off-screen, he was hit by Kyou's scooter and Ryou helped him recover before quickly leaving. She unknowingly left her handkerchief behind and he tried searching for her. Making the appropriate choices, he will eventually find her and become Ryou's boyfriend. However, it is later revealed that he suffers from osteosarcoma, a type of cancer, but refuses to get cured. His reason for not accepting the treatment is that it would mean amputating his leg, which he has a deep attachment to since he used to be an athlete. After talking with Yusuke Yoshino, an upset Ryou manages to convince him (one of the methods she uses is threatening him with getting pregnant with his baby while he sleeps, which proves just how deeply she cares for Kappei) to get cured. In the end, they manage to get him cured without amputating his leg (through the use of a new treatment, a rapid freezing technique that utilizes liquid nitrogen), and he and Ryou are shown five years later (Ryou is working as a nurse, just as in the anime's After Story), happily married (as of three years previous) and without a trace of the illness, though Kappei will still need more time to fully recover from therapy.Notes Akio Furukawa  Akio Furukawa (\u53e4\u6cb3\u79cb\u751f, Furukawa Akio?) is a recurring protagonist. He is the husband of Sanae Furukawa (who runs a bakery named Furukawa Bread with) & the father of Nagisa Furukawa. Although he often talks and plays rough, he is kind and sympathetic. His childish side makes it easy for people to befriend him. In his spare time, Akio plays baseball with children in the small park next to the bakery, and indulges in the Gundam fandom. He is often the victim of Sanae's bread, having to eat her bread in front of her while claiming that he loves it. He can be looked at as a father figure to Tomoya in substitute of Naoyuki. He can be very loving even though he hates to be called father by Tomoya and prefers Ushio to call him \"Akki\". In his route in the visual novel, he goes to Kyushuu to supervise the creation of a threatical company by an old friend of his. He is then involved in a bus hijack. Akio eventually befriends the hijacker, even after he is wounded, managing to get everyone off the bus safely, including the driver, and staying alone with the hijacker on the bus. As requested by the other man, he drives the bus in order to find the hijacker's grandmother. However, just as he is about to lose consciousness, the hijacker pulls the breaks and tells him that it's okay. The grandmother is later revealed to be dead, and in his epilogue, after running away from his hospital room, Akio promises Sanae to always be by her side. Having decided to create a bakery with Sanae in order to spend more time with Nagisa because his wife claimed she could bake bread, he ended up being the one who did most of the baking since Sanae's bread was inedible most of the time. It is briefly suggested in the Visual Novel that Akio may secretly hold a second career as a hitman. One possible variation of the Yukine's gym storage room spell causes Tomoya to become locked in the Storage Room with Akio, who follows him in with a gun, mistaking Tomoya for his target. Once they are locked in, Akio uses gunpowder to blow the lock on the door and escape. The possibility of this second career is never mentioned in the anime, though it does provide another explanation for his regular absence from the bakery.Clannad  Akio first meets Tomoya when he visits the Furukawa Bakery, having been invited by Nagisa. After Tomoya criticizes Sanae's bread, Akio tells him about the unspoken rules of the bakery and threatens him. Only after realizing he is Nagisa's friend does he stop, but continues giving him weird nicknames and being suspicious of his intentions. This continues for most of the first season. Akio is revealed to have been an actor in a theatrical company but had to quit his job due to Nagisa's health. He tells the story about how Nagisa almost died due to his and Sanae's unintended negligence, because they were both busy with their respective careers, and how her life is connected to the city after getting saved from her fever. However, he says that he doesn't regret giving up his job since ever since Nagisa was born, her dreams became his, and that he'll be happy as long as she is happy. He is the one who ultimately encourages Nagisa to act during the Founder's Festival after she lost all of her willpower by screaming through the auditorium and telling her that she mustn't regret anything that happened in the past because what he cares for the most is her well-being. The play turns out to be successful, and Akio praises Nagisa.~After Story~  Akio replaces Y\u014dhei's role as comic relief during the After Story arc, however, he can be serious when needed, as he often gives advice to Tomoya on what is like to become a man. He employs Tomoya for a short period of time after graduation. When Nagisa starts working at a family restaurant, he dresses up as a rapper in order to take pictures of her without raising suspicion. After hearing about Nagisa's pregnancy, Akio tells the whole story about what happened when Nagisa was a child and she was about to die to Tomoya, who believes the city saved her and now that the trees are being cut to build a new hospital, Nagisa's health will wither as a result of her connection. He is present when Nagisa gives birth. Akio is the one, alongside Sanae, who cares for Ushio for five years. Even after she returns with Tomoya, he still visits her frequently.References List of Clannad episodes  This article contains a list of \"Clannad\" episodes. Twenty-four episodes were produced for the \"Clannad\" anime series, twenty-three of which were originally broadcast between October 2007 and March 2008. The last episode was released as an original video animation (OVA) on the eighth DVD in July 2008. The episodes were produced by Kyoto Animation.See also Sanae Furukawa  Sanae Furukawa (\u53e4\u6cb3\u65e9\u82d7, Furukawa Sanae?) is the wife of Akio Furukawa (who runs a bakery named Furukawa Bread with) & the mother of Nagisa Furukawa.Appearance  Sanae Furukawa is a beautiful woman with long, wavy, light brown hair that reaches her hips and amber eyes. Like Akio and Nagisa, Sanae has 3 \"hair antennas\" protruding from the top of her head. Sanae's hair is usually tied into a low ponytail using a periwinkle bow that slightly resembles a butterfly. When Sanae was a middle school teacher, she had back-length hair, and she still had her bow. Instead of a low ponytail, a small section of hair at the back of her head was tied. Like all the Clannad characters, Sanae has bangs and hair covering her ears.Personality and Description  Normally, she's very childish and a cry-baby, especially when someone insults her bread, but, when needed, she can be very strong-willed and dependable. She often conceives of strange concepts to make bread, which when attempted prove inedible and are never sold. One of the series' frequent gags consists of Akio making a negative comment on Sanae's bread while unaware of her presence, causing her to run off with tears in her eyes, and Akio stuffing his mouth with her bread and saying he loves it, as he chases behind her. She also tutors children in the Furukawa Cram School and she's quite proud of the way people often mistake her for Nagisa's older sister because of her youthful appearance. This can be seen in the Sunohara siblings arc, where she poses as Youhei Sunohara's girlfriend and no one suspects that she is actually an adult.~After Story~  Sanae plays a larger role in the After Story arc, often coming to Tomoya's aid when Nagisa is ill and needs to be accompanied, especially during Nagisa's pregnancy. Before being a baker at the Furukawa Bakery, she was a junior-high teacher but had to quit her job due to Nagisa's health. After claiming she could bake, they decided to open a bakery, but in the end, Akio is the person who does most of the baking. She is the one, together with Akio, who cares for Ushio during the five years after Nagisa's death. She seems to be quite strict with her, but this is just to show her that there is nothing better than being with her father. Sanae is the mastermind behind Tomoya and Ushio's trip to the flower cape, in hope for them to reconcile. She knows Shino, Tomoya's paternal grandmother; however, it is never revealed how they met. In her arc in the visual novel, her cram school was about to be closed down because of the opening of a new one nearby, but in the end, the children decided that they still wanted Sanae to tutor them and they manage to avoid the closing down of the Furukawa Cram School.Trivia References Girl in the Illusionary World  The Girl in the Illusionary World (\u5e7b\u60f3\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u5973\u306e\u5b50, Gens\u014d no sekai no on'nanoko?, \"Mysterious Girl\") is the only human living in the Illusionary World, a world Tomoya dreams of. She creates a body out of garbage for an unnamed entity only referred to as \"Me,\" so that she will not be alone in her world. The Girl is actually Ushio, who had lost her memories; as such, though never stated, it can be assumed she is aware of her true identity the whole time. She created the Illusionary World in order to collect enough lights to make a miracle possible and save her family from their tragic fate, although she holds no recollection of this. Being the only human in the Illusionary world, she can create things out of garbage, such as toys to play with, but cannot infuse life into them, unless they themselves, like Tomoya, the garbage doll's real identity, choose to come to such a place. The garbage doll eventually convinces her to leave the Illusionary World, and they start building a flying machine. However, winter comes before they can complete it, and the girl is unable to move. However, she and the robot start walking together until she collapses, unable to continue. In her edge of death after failing to get away from the world, she regains her memories and calls the garbage doll \"Papa\", realizing he was indeed Tomoya, and told it a bit about their linked past. She 'dies' while humming the Great Dango Family song. In Clannad's epilogue, a vision of her is shown sleeping under a tree where Akio begged for Nagisa's life, although, in reality, it turns out to be a five-year-old Ushio, who awaits Fuko to awaken her.Yukine Miyazawa  Yukine Miyazawa (\u5bae\u6ca2\u6709\u7d00\u5be7, Miyazawa Yukine?) is a second-year student who hangs around in the library's reference room during lunchtime. She is a quiet girl who helps others find books. Yukine's theme song is Tea Party in the Reference Room. In the visual novel, her arc simply explains her everyday life with Sunohara and Tomoya, until the moment where a year has passed since her brother died. She then visits the grave with Tomoya and her brother's gang and, after giving a very emotional speech, she is kissed by Tomoya.Appearance  Yukine is a beautiful young girl with waist-length, straight light brown hair with a prominent ahoge. She has fair skin and sleepy blue eyes. Her bangs cover her forehead, and locks of hair also cover her ears.Personality  Yukine is a polite and helpful girl who often serves tea to others. She is motherly and has an interest in magic spells. She is noted to be an excellent cook, even though she prepares ready-made food most of the time, and has a small gas stove in the reference room in order to prepare meals for her guests.Clannad  Tomoya first met her in the library's reference room while trying to find a \"how to\" book about speeches for Nagisa. He is immediately greeted by her hospitality and returns the next day with Youhei Sunohara due to Youhei's insistence. Ever since, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Youhei start to enter the library reference room routinely. She later avails Tomoya and Youhei an instruction book for magical spells for them to try. Most of them are in the favor of Tomoya, involving the girls they met. The most well-known spell is the one where he accidentally found himself locked inside the gym storage room with Kyou.~After Story~  In After Story, is it revealed that Yukine has friends outside of her school, who turn out to be delinquents from other schools. She made friends with the delinquents through her brother, Kazuto, who was also a delinquent, after his death trying to save a friend from an accident. The delinquents respect her and think of her as being their older caring sister. Some of them even go to the reference room when she is there to eat and get their wounds treated. However, aside from the members of his gang, no one else knows that Kazuto died. They decided to keep this a secret because of their rivalry with another gang, who would charge at them if they knew that their leader died. In her arc during the anime, after a series of violent fights between the members of the rival gangs which threaten to end with the police intervening. After a fight between Tomoya (all the other members of her gang and Sunohara had been unable to fight after eating Sanae's special rainbow bread combined with what is implied to be Akiko's infamous jam) and Sasaki, a member of the opposite gang, she manages to make the two sides reconcile after being hit by Sasaki. He accidentally hit her since she had dressed up as Kazuto to try and stop the fighting. After revealing the truth about her brother's death, she visits Kazuto's tomb with everyone and the two sides promise to be on friendly terms for her sake. After the visit, she tells Tomoya, Nagisa and Youhei about the existence of light orbs, revealing their origin. She, along with many others, attended Nagisa's solo graduation ceremony. She is later seen in a photo during the New Years Party which showed her with the two gangs that have peacefully settled together. Years after graduating, she is shown still caring for the members of her brother's gang.Trivia References Great Dango Family  Great Dango Family (\u3060\u3093\u3054\u5927\u5bb6\u65cf, Dango Daikazoku?) is the ending theme song of Clannad, and was used from On the Hillside Path Where the Cherry Blossoms Flutter to Another World: Tomoyo Chapter. It was released in the album Mag Mell / Dango Daikazoku on 26 October 2007. It was performed by Chata, written and composed by Jun Maeda, and arranged by Takumaru. It uses the melody from Nagisa's theme song. Great Dango Family is often sung by Nagisa Furukawa. She sang it to show Fuko how wonderful the Dango Family is, and Fuko immediately plagiarized it to create a starfish song. In the episode A Hidden Past, finding an old Dango trinket in her shed prompted her to sing happily, which earned her a label of embarrassment from her father. She also decided to sing it at the end of her stage performance in the episode Two Shadows, without concern for the anticlimax that it caused.Remixes  2018. \"Dango Daikazoku saikaL re-edit\" / an electronica version. Great Dango Family has come to be one of the most popular songs from the Clannad series. As a testament to this, a plethora of remixes of the song, both official and fan-made, have been released since the melody of the song made its debut in the Clannad visual novel song Nagisa. Small Palms was among those other versions of it released as part of the franchise. The song has also been very popular on YouTube. YouTube user rythemdestiny released the full version of the song 2 November 2007, and since then it has recieved nearly 2,300,000 views. Also 14 September 2006, YouTube user \"noritomi\" released a cover of Nagisa, the theme song of heroine Nagisa Furukawa. In the five years since it was posted, the remix has received nearly 255,000 views. One of the more popular rock versions of the song was an off-vocal version released by \"andryou\" in April 2008 as Dango Daikazoku / Chiisana Te No Hira Rock Version. \"TGX-Sirisobhakya\" released an orchestral arrangement of Great Dango Family in November 2008, and made the music score available two years later.References Mei Sunohara  Mei Sunohara (\u6625\u539f\u82bd\u8863, Sunohara Mei?) is the younger sister of Youhei Sunohara who loves him as a brother and lives in the countryside. She is a fan of Y\u016bsuke Yoshino, an older male graduate from Tomoya Okazaki\u2019s school, who was a member of a band.Appearance  Mei is a short girl, though she is taller than the very small Fuko. She has black hair that is tied into pigtails with thin, yellow ribbons, and has amber eyes. Mei has bangs and hair covering her ears.Personality  After hearing for the first time about her, Tomoya pictures her as a female Youhei. However, Mei's personality is a direct opposite of that of her brother. She can be very nosy about things, like trying to further Tomoya's relationship with Nagisa by becoming their cupid angel or learning about Youhei's current situation. Despite her claims, she loves her brother a lot. Although Youhei tries to avoid Mei, he still cares for her, as seen when he stands up for her when she gets bullied by the Soccer Club in With the Same Smile as That Day. Mei is a smart girl who likes learning new things, and she deeply cares for her brother and often worries about him.Trivia References Naoyuki Okazaki  Naoyuki Okazaki (\u5ca1\u5d0e\u76f4\u5e78, Okazaki Naoyuki?) is Tomoya's father. Tomoya's mother, Atsuko Okazaki, died when Tomoya was young, thus leaving only Naoyuki to raise Tomoya. After the accident, Naoyuki stopped working and turned to alcohol and smoking, and held frequent fights with his son. One day while arguing with his son on trivial things, he slammed Tomoya against the wall, dislocating Tomoya's right shoulder. Immediately after that, Tomoya refused to come out of his room, and by the time he finally went to the hospital, it was declared to be untreatable. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya more kindly, but like a stranger rather than family. This only hurt Tomoya even more, so he becomes a delinquent, as he is unable to participate in basketball activities any longer, and he avoided returning to his home early enough to be confronted with his father.Clannad  Tomoya is shown to be on very bad terms with his father, who treats him like a stranger. He goes home late, only to find his father passed out and drunk. Tomoya doesn't like Naoyuki watching or touching him, resorting to violent or aggressive behaviors if he feels that his father is too close to him. After his homeroom teacher comes to consult his father about his future, being unable to cope with the situation any longer, he decides to move out of his house and starts living with Nagisa. Naoyuki never goes to search for him.~After Story~  In the After Story, Naoyuki is put in prison due to some problems with his work. This prevents Tomoya from ascending in his job, and he visits his father in prison, taking his anger out on him. He visits him again later to tell him that he is going to marry Nagisa, to which his father consents. Naoyuki isn't seen until five years later. When Tomoya meets Shino Okazaki, she tells him about all the sacrifices Naoyuki had to make in order to raise him. After Atsuko's death, he promised to try his best for his son, spending all his money on toys and things that would please him. However, due to the long hours he worked and the accumulation of problems he fell into a depression. It was after this that he started having problems with Tomoya. However, after hearing this, Tomoya remembers that Naoyuki was indeed a good parent, being in his same situation now, as he is behaving badly with Ushio. Tomoya feels like he can finally understand what his father was going through and decides to forgive him, admitting that he indeed was a good parent. After Tomoya comes to terms with his father, Naoyuki decides to return to his hometown to stay with his mother, claiming his role as a father has finally come to an end. Even after Tomoya uses the light orbs to save Nagisa and Ushio, Naoyuki is never seen, but Tomoya tells that he went back to his hometown. Also, it can obviously be assumed that Tomoya would still reconcile with father and introduce him to his family.Movie  In the movie, Naoyuki plays a vital role. Realizing how depressed his son is after Nagisa's death, he visits the Furukawas and begs for them to help his son.References Katsuki Shima  Katsuki Shima (\u5fd7\u9ebb\u8cc0\u6d25\u7d00, Shima Katsuki?) is a minor character of the Clannad anime and visual novel. He only appears during Misae's arc, which explains the events which happened to her some years prior to the beginning of the Clannad storyline. He was Misae's boyfriend for a while. He is described as being a bish\u014dnen, a fact which Saki and Yuki make use of to dress him up as a girl.Clannad  During the main Clannad series, we can see a cat often accompanying Misae. He often stays with Tomoya whenever he visits Sunohara in his room.~After Story~  It is revealed that Katsuki is a boy who Misae met in the past while he was in a wheelchair in the hospital. Her kind words encouraged him to recover. Years later, he searches for her with the hopes of paying her back. He holds a charm which contains a light that can grant a single wish. Misae considers him annoying since he is constantly following her around. She doesn't want him to feel indebted to her and tells him she doesn't want anything. However, she gradually comes to care for him. After a misunderstanding during which she realizes that her crush, Igarashi, doesn't like her back, she starts liking Katsuki after being comforted by him. Yuki and Saki later ask if they can hang out with Katsuki at his house, since Misae is busy as the newly elected council president, but as they are walking, he realizes he can't remember where his house is. They eventually find the Shima household, where Katsuki's mother greets them asking if they want to light some incense in his memory. Katsuki then remembers the truth and runs off. We discover that he is not the real Katsuki Shima, because the real Katsuki died, but not having been able to thank Misae and grant her wish, he entrusted this mission to his cat, who took a human form. After enjoying some time with Misae at the Fall Festival, he brings up the issue of the charm and opens it, revealing it to be empty. Misae says it doesn't matter and that what's important is that they are together. She then wishes for Shima to always love her, and then kisses him. He tells her he also loves her and thanks her for all the happy memories she gave him while sobbing. Embarrassed, she goes to buy some drinks, but when she comes back, he has disappeared. She searches for him only to see a flash of him in the crowd whispering her goodbye. Sometime later, a cat started following Misae and she took him in. This cat is revealed to be the very same cat that Katsuki entrusted, who has remained by her side in fulfillment of her wish. Misae only discovers this later in After Story, when she is told by Tomoya after the cat showed him the story in a dream. Misae says she can't have a date with a cat, but scoops him into her arms and walks away with him. This releases her light orb, and we can see the cat addressing his master, the real Katsuki, and wondering if he properly fulfilled his job, wanting to stay this way forever.Kappei Hiiragi  Kappei Hiiragi (\u67ca\u52dd\u5e73, Hiiragi Kappei?) is a mysterious nineteen-year-old young man who is travelling around. His goal in life is \"to live like a man\". Tomoya will meet Kappei if he chooses to avoid Kyou's scooter on the right side. Kyou intends to hit Tomoya as a revenge for Botan running back home wet, but hits Kappei instead. After being stunned from the crash, a kind girl helped him recover but left quickly. Unbeknownst to her, she left her handkerchief behind. Kappei's goal is to find a job, although he has already applied for a lot of them and none accepted him, and to find the kind person who he met after the crash. The kind person turns out to be Ryou, and through her, he finds a job at the hospital. Both of them start to become intimate ever since, with Ryou eventually accepting to be his girlfriend, but due to a misunderstanding regarding his feminine appearance, Sunohara (who helped him find housing alongside Tomoya) thinks that he is a woman and falls in love with him. This is used as a gag during his arc. After finding out that he is, in fact, a man, Sunohara is devastated but decides to move on remembering Kappei as if he were a girl. After Tomoya sees an article in a sports magazine, he discovers that Kappei had once been a prodigious runner for his school, but he was diagnosed from suffering osteosarcoma, a cancer which he carried since he was young, causing him to be hospitalized. Due to this, he had to give up on running. Kappei refuses to have his legs amputated even though it would cause him to die because he could not bear not being able to run. To relieve the pain, he secretly took an opiate painkiller called codeine to avoid worrying his friends. After his cancer is revealed to them, he argues that his legs were important to him because they helped him fulfill his dreams and he states that he will not have it cut even if it means he will die. Ryou was upset over his refusal and sought comfort from Tomoya and Yusuke, who encouraged her to confess her feelings and urge him to get surgery. With Tomoya's support, Ryou used all of her courage (along with a threat to have his baby in his sleep if he refused to get surgery) to make him realize how she deeply she cared for him even if he can't walk anymore. Later, Ryou also finds a new technique of treatment using liquid nitrogen would not require an amputation and informs him. This encourages him and he finally decides to take the operation. Five years later, Tomoya visits the hospital again where Kappei's undergoing therapy to visit Kappei and Ryou, who is working as a nurse in the hospital and married Kappei three years before, guides him to Kappei's room where he greets him with a nostalgic line. Kappei is the only character in the visual novel who does not appear in the animated versions of Clannad.Clannad  Clannad (\u30af\u30e9\u30ca\u30c9, Kuranado?, \"CLANNAD\") is a Japanese visual novel created by the software company Key. Key released a limited version for the PC on 28 April 2004, and the regular version less than four months later on 8 August 2004. The visual novel was later ported to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Xbox 360. The game was translated into English by Sekai Project, who released it through Steam on 23 November 2015. The gameplay in Clannad follows a linear plot line, which offers predetermined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters. Clannad has made several transitions to other media. There have been four manga series: the first serialized in the Japanese magazine Comic Rush, the second serialized in Comi Digi +, the third serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine and Dengeki G's Festival! Comic, and the fourth in Dragon Age Pure. An animated film by Toei Animation was released on 15 September 2007, followed by two anime series including two original video animation (OVA) episodes by Kyoto Animation. Lastly, there are two sets of drama CDs, totaling nine in all. Both anime series and their accompanying OVAs are localized and distributed in English by Section23 Films. The first Clannad anime series was released in North America in two half-series box sets in March and May 2009. The Clannad ~After Story~ anime series was released in North America in two half-series box sets in October and December 2009. On 25 November 2005, Key released an adult spin-off entitled Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ which expands the scenario of Tomoyo Sakagami, one of the five heroines from Clannad. The visual novel and the animated adaptations including the two TV series and film have received high sales figures in Japan. Across the national ranking of bish\u014djo games in amount sold in Japan, the Clannad limited edition PC release premiered at number one twice since its release, and the third ranking brought the PC release down to forty-six out of fifty. Out of eight DVDs released for the first Clannad anime TV series, six were ranked first during their first week of sales for anime DVDs in Japan. Out of eight DVDs released for Clannad ~After Story~, seven were ranked first during their first week of sales. The special edition film DVD first ranked at number three during its first week of sales. Clannad is primarily set in a high school located in a small Japanese city. Clannad follows the life of Tomoya Okazaki, a third-year student who does not take his studies seriously. He hates his city and his everyday routine, while waiting for something that would bring color into his dull life. Always late for class, he is seen as a delinquent by the rest of his classmates who are busy preparing for their college entrance examinations. Needless to say, he does not have too many close friends either. One day, while walking to school, Tomoya passes by a frail girl\u00a0muttering quietly to herself. Suddenly she exclaims \"anpan\" and catches his attention. A brief conversation follows and then both resume their walk towards the school.See also External links Yusuke Yoshino  Yusuke Yoshino (\u82b3\u91ce\u7950\u4ecb, Yoshino Y\u016bsuke?) is an electrician who once lived as a rock musician. He is admired by Mei for his infrequent rock play. Tomoya first met Yusuke during a street light accident involving a person's car, and assists Yusuke in his work. Yusuke seems to like speeches, and is always talking about youth and the gifts he can give to young people. However, only Youhei and Mei seem to appreciate his speeches, which the rest of the cast are totally indifferent to. Through Yusuke, Tomoya realizes the pain of working in society. Yusuke is engaged to Kouko Ibuki, and is also one of the reasons why Fuko Ibuki still exists as an ikiry\u014d in Tomoya's school. After marrying Kouko, they go to the hospital to thank Fuko for making the celebration be successful. He gives Tomoya a job as an assistant electrician in his company, the Hikarizaka Electric Company, and sometimes gives him advice. Due to Tomoya's interest in him, Yusuke tells him of his past - how he became a rock musician, rose in fame, and how his career ended due to his loss of his original motivation. He sang for his own sake, trying to empty himself of all his feelings. However, he slowly realized that his music wasn't his own anymore, as it belonged to everyone who listened to it and relied on his songs to live on and give them hope. Not being able to bear this, he fell into misery, falling a victim of stress and drugs and losing 40% of his fortune on the way. After being rehabilitated, no one wanted him anymore, except for Kouko, who had encouraged him to become a rock musician during his high school days. Throwing away his past, he now works as an electrician. Realizing that there are people who still love his music through Tomoya. Yusuke decides to create another music CD that sings his love for the city.Trivia References ", "Mysticons Wiki": "Mysticons Wiki ", "Viva Pi\u00f1ata Wiki": "Viva Pi\u00f1ata Wiki Dragonache  The Dragonache is a dragon pi\u00f1ata. It is one of the special elusive pi\u00f1ata species in the series, the other being the Choclodocus. It can be one of four colors, gold, brown, blue, or green, and it depends on which surface it is on when the egg was hatched. Also, each Dragonache's appearance is different, with difference designs for teeth, mane, wings, and tail. It cannot be found in the wild. The egg for the Dragonache can only be found in the Mine and cannot be found anywhere else.Requirements  Finding a Dragonache (pronounced drae'gahn ahsh; rhymes with panache) egg is a matter of luck and patience!Species Variants  The Dragonache variants are uniquely obtained. Each has its own color, style of teeth, mane, ridges, wings, and tail. The terrain where you hatch its egg will affect the color of the Dragonache. The other features are completely random. It is estimated that there are over 20,000 Dragonache variants. In the original Viva Pi\u00f1ata, if all Dry Soil has been removed with the shovel in the garden, there's no way to get a patch of it back to get the gold Dragonache. Plan in advance to leave some in a garden, if a gold Dragonache is wanted there. In Viva Pi\u00f1ata: Trouble in Paradise, there is no hard soil to unearth, so the gold Dragonache is instead earned by hatching the egg on Golden Paving, which can be purchased from Costolot's Store.Other Information  Each garden may have its own Dragonache, however, you will have to build a Mine and hire Diggerlings to unearth that garden's egg. There is only one Dragonache egg per garden, and the egg cannot be broken, or crated. The Dragonache is a very special pi\u00f1ata, and the focal point of the story in the first game. Its presence in your garden prevents any Sour from appearing regardless of the Tower of Sour, and it causes the screen to shake with each step. It can be sent away at will by hovering the cursor over it and selecting the special \"Dismiss\" command. You\u2019ll want to do this if you wish to attract Sours back, perhaps to convert them to regular pi\u00f1atas. Another good reason is if the Dragonache take up too much space and is a nuisance (especially when trying to get what it needs to mature, the hardest part of which is the Dragumfly.) Once dismissed, you can recall the Dragonache for free through Gretchen Fetchem\u2019s. The Dragonache is completely invincible. That means no sickness, nothing can eat it, and you can\u2019t beat the bejeezus out of it with your shovel and break it no matter what the shovel is made of (although it\u2019s fun to try). The only award a Dragonache can give a player is the Resident award. An in-game rumor from Leafos claims that becoming a Master Romancer for the Dragumfly will make a Dragonache appear in your garden. (False) If you decide that your Dragonache is getting in the way, you can dismiss it by selecting it, bringing up the menu, and selecting dismiss. When you want it back, Gretchen Fetchum is happy to fetch it for you, free of charge! Gretchen will only fetch a dismissed Dragonache back into the same garden that it was dismissed from. Also, she cannot be hired to hunt for additional Dragonaches in the wild. Sometimes a Dragonache can lose fights despite being very strong. If it loses, it will cough up a joy sweet. The Dragonache does add value to the garden. Before it cocoons, its value is 8250. but as an adult it's 11,000 (as much as a Captain's Cutlass, but sadly, you can't sell it.)Uses Species Conflicts In the TV Series Cliff Dragonache  Cliff Dragonache is a character born in the episode Bringing Up Cluckle. He hatched from a giant egg and his mother is Carol Cluckles. He is an orange Dragonache who was subject to verbal annoyance after his brothers found out he was not actually a Cluckles, but a Dragonache.Commonly Asked Questions Can I have a Dragonache in each of my gardens?  Yes. Each garden can have its own Dragonache, but you'll need to find and hatch an egg in each garden. View\u00a0threadHow do I make my Dragonache happy?  You can feed it Happy candy or Joy candy. If they are too sad to eat the Joy candy, feed them a piece of Happy candy first. A Dragonache's happiness is important, as a sad Dragonache will start fights with other pinatas!Is there any point in keeping the Mine and Diggerling(s) once you have your Dragonache?  Diggerlings can also dig up gems, chocolate coins, dirt piles, emeralds, giant seeds, gold flakes, gold nuggets, and sapphires from the Mine. Otherwise, they serve no purpose.Are the prizes earned from the Mine valuable?  Yes. Other players tend to buy gems and gold for a fairly good price. You can search the Trade over Xbox Live forum for Gems threads, if you have some gems or gold to sell.My diggerlings haven't found a Dragonache egg yet. Any tips?  I'd say wait a little while longer and it should come, and if it doesn't then try firing them and hiring new ones. Don't worry, you'll get it eventually.My Cluckles won't hatch an egg.

Kinda creepy, but very valuable; you won\u2019t see one until you\u2019ve had the garden a long while. It also has lots of boogers. An in-game rumor claims that Galagoogoos like sunglasses and may allow them to be awake in the daytime. Shoes may help the Galagoogoo thrive in daylight. Galagoogoos can climb trees. To get them down, tap the tree. Galagoogoos sleep with one eye open when at full candiosity. Hint: The Galagoogoo won't reside until you have a helper, and they won't even visit until you have a moon-on-a-stick. So get a helper, prepare your Mothdrops and Tulips, and THEN put a moon-on-a-stick in the garden. They are easily obtainable in TIP just for fun mode. Once you plant a tulip, it should appear. Galagoogoos like tulip flowerheads and orchids, but any other flowerhead will lower their candiosity. You must not feed them milk, honey, or any other Cost-o-lot foods. Such as bread. Unless you wish to unlock the purple variant.Galagoogoo Uses  It can be used to fulfill the Roario romance requirement \"has eaten a pinata worth 4500 coins.\" Eat it?In the TV Series Les Galagoogoo  Les Galagoogoo is one of the main characters of the Viva Pi\u00f1ata TV series. He is the smartest pi\u00f1ata, but never utters a word. He only talks in strange hoots and sighs so no one ever understands him, but they somehow figure it out by themselves directly after he says it, and then claim that they found it which he dislikes.Commonly Asked Questions When I went to sell my Galagoogoo, it's only worth 100 coins. Anyone got any ideas why?  Some variants (Galagoogoos included) are worth less than their non-variant versions.I've been trying to get a Galagoogoo to become a resident, but it won't stick around.  Because it's a high-level pi\u00f1ata, it might take an extra visit or two to get one to have eaten everything it needs, to reside. Also, it's important to keep in mind that you won't necessarily get exactly the same Galagoogoo visiting, the next time one shows up. First, make sure you have far more than 16 Tulips or 8 Mothdrops in your garden, so it doesn't leave early, after eating one or two. Next, there's one thing you can do to help it along. Once it starts eating something, you can knock off some tulip flowerheads, or break open a Mothdrop, and leave the flowerheads/Life Candy near where it's eating. This will help save time, as the Galagoogoo only lingers until dusk. If you do it quickly enough, the Galagoogoo will gobble up what you're leaving for it, instead of wandering around. Make sure to keep the Watchling away from the Galagoogoo or it will be scared away.Pigxie  The Pigxie is a purple deformed pig Pi\u00f1ata with wings. It is the evolved form of the Rashberry.

A Mine is also very valuable and gives you lots of money (hopefully). Also, when trying to get one, it helps to whack one of the Doenuts or Zumbugs, take its life candy, and try to get the Roario to eat it. It helps to place it near the candy of a pinata the Roario kills itself.In the TV Series King Roario  King Roario is one of the main characters of the Viva Pi\u00f1ata TV series.

Since you're not guaranteed to get the same visitor next time, getting a wild Roario to eat enough Doenuts and Zumbugs may take a bit of time.

If a tinker fails then you lose the original item and you get absolutely nothing.Zumbug  The Zumbug is a purple zebra pi\u00f1ata. Most of its body is covered in dark purple stripes covering a light purple body. Proving that hunches can pay off, the Zumbug is born from that extra bit of black and white in a Horstachio's diet.

Like the Elephanilla (see answer), this is another pinata that takes time to reside. As with any pinata that needs multiple visits, it's important to keep in mind that you probably won't get exactly the same Chippopotamus, the next time a wild one visits your garden. Always make sure to maintain well more than 14 watercress or 14 Water Lillies or 14 Bullrush in the garden, and replant the ones it eats. If its Visit requirements are no longer met, it will leave the garden early, drawing out the number of visits needed. If you've got a visitor that only needs to meet one or two more requirements, try not to distract it with other items that it no longer is required to eat. One tip is to whack the plants that a particular visitor needs to eat, and move the flower heads near where he visits/eats, to help speed things along. This way, it will hopefully eat more of what it needs to eat, instead of randomly devouring whatever it's fond of. Ultimately, patience is the key, while you pay attention to its needs, and keep your garden well-planted. (Either that, or you could pay someone off to ship you one.)Doenut  The Doenut is a colorful deer pi\u00f1ata. It has a yellow muzzle, a blue quadrangle marking around its eyes, and black irises.

The sheer scale of the Elephanilla makes it very impressive, but at the same time it's probably this plodding pi\u00f1ata's biggest drawback. When an Elephanilla is clumsy the cost of a 'little accident' can be suitably enormous.

Larger even than the Dragonache, Elephanillas tower over absolutely everything. They\u2019re awfully peaceful creatures, but you\u2019ll need to devote an incredible amount of real estate for them and their home. You may want to even create a separate garden just for the sake of attracting them. The easiest and most cost-efficient way to attract an Elephanilla into the garden is by growing 16 corn seeds, as opposed to trying to get 16 monkeynuts, blackberries, or gooseberries. Corn seeds are cheaper then gooseberry, blackberry, or monkeynut seeds, are much faster to grow, and the ears of corn will last much longer before becoming rotten. If an Elephanilla steps on another pinata, it will squish them, and make them unhappy. Keep a good supply of joy candy to keep your smaller pinatas happy.Elephanilla Uses Species Conflicts  None.Frequently Asked Questions Any tips for meeting Elephanilla resident requirements?  The higher-level pinatas are a bit challenging to attract, because it does take several visits, and you won't necessarily get the same one visiting, next visit. One option is to start a new garden, designed to attract only that species. This should help the Elephanilla to show up every day, instead of competing with many other wilds who are also attracted to the garden. Make sure to always maintain  than 16 blackberries, ears of corn, gooseberries or monkeynuts in the garden, as it eats what's attracting it, so the Visit requirements are  met, or the Elephanilla will leave your garden early, drawing out the number of visits needed. A good way to do this is to plant 16 corn (or buy 16 blackberries) and put them in a fenced area so the Elephanilla can't reach them. This way there will always be enough food for it to stay. Remember you will probably need  wooden picket fence to keep it away (possibly even more). If you've got a visitor that only needs to meet one or two more requirements, try not to distract it with other items that it no longer is required to eat. Try to focus on keeping lots of what it needs on hand, near the corner it shows up on and move the other items away from where it enters. This way, it will hopefully eat only what it needs, instead of wasting the day devouring other things. With a bit of patience, and attention to what it needs, you should eventually get one of these plodding pinatas to move in. (If all else fails, you could just get a friend to ship you one.) View\u00a0thread", "BIOMUTANT Wiki": "BIOMUTANT Wiki ", "Psychonauts Wiki": "Psychonauts Wiki Main Page Razputin Aquato  Razputin \"Raz\" Aquato is the main protagonist of the Psychonauts series. He is voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz.Background  Razputin was born and raised in the Aquato family circus, the middle child of five. He showed signs of psychic powers at his young age, but his father insisted that he practice difficult acrobatics constantly in an attempt to distract him from those powers. The acrobatic training was so grueling, Raz became convinced that his father hates psychics and therefore him for having psychic abilities, even though Raz suspects his father is a psychic as well. He believes this hatred stems from a curse. As it turns out Raz's father truly loved his son and did not hate his powers, but this was unknown to Razputin at first. For reasons unknown, a family of psychics from a rival circus cursed Razputin's family to always die in water. Consequently, whenever Raz enters water deeper than a few inches, a supernatural liquid hand attempts to grab him and pull him beneath the surface. The Psychonauts manual refers to this eerie hand as the Hand of Galochio, which is named after the family that imposed the curse. After a show, an audience member handed him a pamphlet about Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, a secret government camp designed to train psychic children into becoming agents known as Psychonauts. His disapproving father tore up the pamphlet, but it was too late. Raz was completely captivated by the idea of mastering his powers and becoming a Psychonaut, so he stealthily ran away from the circus on the World's Smallest Pony, eventually meeting a friendly lumberjack willing to take him to the camp gates.Psychonauts  At the beginning of the game, Razputin unintentionally interrupts Coach Oleander's speech to the new campers at Whispering Rock Summer Camp. The Counselors want him removed from the premises at once, but Raz recites the pamphlet Coach Oleander wrote about being a Psychonaut which persuades him to let Raz stay. Eventually after clearing Oleander's basic braining course, Raz gets invinted into Sasha's Brain Tumbler, where he sees a vision of a strange Dentist trying to steal Dogen's brain, but he needs the Levitation badge before he can continue further. Going to the docks, Raz talks to Lili and they realize they both had the same dream with the dentist and promise to meet again at nighttime. Raz manages to get his Levitation badge and witnesses Dogen having his brain stolen and put into a Brain Tank blueprint. After fighting the Brain Tank blueprint, Raz notices that the plan to take over the world is in Coach Oleander's mind, but Sasha leaves before he can tell him the important information. Raz then meets Lili at the docks and they deduce that Coach Oleander is planning to steal the brains of all the campers and use them to pilot Brain Tanks to take over the world. Lili feels a rush of affection and wants Raz to kiss her which confuses him. Lili is then abducted by the Lungfish and takes her across the lake. Raz manages to get underwater and fights the Lungfish. After beating the Lungfish, Raz goes inside its mind and destroys the mental implant controlling it and making it kidnap the campers. Grateful for being free again, the Lungfish takes Raz to where it brought Lili which is the abandoned Thorney Towers Insane Asylum. After gaining access to the Asylum through Boyd the Guard, Raz has to enter the minds of the last remaining residents of the Asylum so that he can get the necessary components to disguise himself as Dr. Loboto so Crispin the orderly will let him into the upper floors. Raz gets to the top floor of the Asylum where he finds Lili, Sasha, and Milla with the later two having been debrained. Raz gets help from Loboto's disgruntled assistant Sheegor after he gets her turtle back and the turtle makes a plan that sends Loboto flying away. After rebraining Sasha and Milla and freeing Lili, Coach Oleander appears. Raz and Lili are levitated down by Sasha and Milla for safety and Raz gets his first kiss from Lili. Ford appears and makes Oleander sneeze out his brain, but Oleander gets his brain put into a brain tank for him to use. He attacks Raz and separates him from the rest of the group. Raz wins the fight, but he's bombarded with sneezing powder when he tries to remove Oleander's brain and sneezes it out. Stuck in his brain, Raz is forced to levitate into Oleander's brain tank and their brains merge their minds into one dreamscape called the Meat Circus. In the Meat Circus, Raz meets the Coach as a kid who's known as Lil Olly. Olly tries to protect his bunnies and Raz is forced to help him. At the end of the circus, Raz is forced to fight Olly's greatest mental demon which is his Father the Butcher. After beating the Butcher, Raz meets a Nightmare version of his Dad who hates Psychics and challenges Raz to prove his Acrobatic skills and then helps the Butcher in a rematch. After the rematch, Raz's real Father comes in and reassures Raz that he doesn't hate him because he's psychic and gives Raz enough Mental energy to defeat the Two-Headed Dad Monster. Raz and Oleander's minds are separated and Oleander is reformed after having his mental demons purged. Raz is made an official Psychonaut for his work. Raz and Lili are about to say goodbye due to living to far apart when Sasha and Milla tell them that the Grand Head of the Psychonauts Truman Zanotto was kidnapped. They all get into the jet and fly off.Psychonauts 2  Razputin will appear in Psychonauts 2Behind the Scenes  According to an interview with creator Tim Schafer [1], \"Raz\" was the nickname of one of the game's animators, Razmig Mavlian. Schafer \"stole\" the name, and expanded it to \"Rasputin\", which was later changed to \"Razputin\" so that it could be trademarked. The name Dart (short for D'artagan) was also considered, however the original Dart's character design was very different from Raz's, with an outfit including a long stocking cap and a thick winter jacket. This design was carried out until the character was computer animated, when the animators abandoned the image because they felt that the long hat would end up looking like a ponytail, and would cause gamers to think Raz was a girl. The cap was also very hard to animate.Psychic powers  Raz starts the game with the ability to strike nearby objects with a large psychic hand and to perform a double jump using a bubble of mental energy. While it is not a playable power, Raz also has some degree of telepathic ability which he demonstrates by reading Lili's mind during a cutscene. He also has considerable psychic defenses that not even the professional Psychonauts can penetrate, despite his young age and lack of formal training. During his stay at Whispering Rock, Raz also learns the following psychic abilities:Trivia Characters  Characters in the Psychonauts series.Milla Vodello  Camilla \"Milla\" Vodello is a famous Brazilian Psychonaut agent, who is partnered with Sasha Nein. She is also part of the staff at Whispering Rock. She is known as the Mental Minx, and is known for her Levitation prowess and psychedelic 1960's mod style and fashion sense. She is very laid-back and enjoys partying and dancing. Being that she is the only female staff member at Whispering Rock, she is the most motherly, very big on rules and keeping her kids safe at all costs.Background  Before becoming a Psychonaut, Milla took care of children at an orphanage. One night after she got back from grocery shopping, the orphanage was on fire (the cause of which remains unexplained) and all the children perished in the flames. Due to her psychic powers, Milla heard them screaming to her for help as they burned to death, scarring her deeply. Milla was deeply traumatized and blamed herself for the deaths, but she tries her best to not let the incident take over her mind and remain a positive person.Psychonauts Milla's Mind  Main Article:\u00a0Milla's Dance Party Milla's mind is a lively party. Students at Whispering Rock refine their Levitation skills in her brain. Raz completes the race and earns his Merit Badge of Levitation.Kidnapped  After Raz finishes Sasha's Shooting Gallery, Sasha and Milla will disappear on \"Official psychonauts business\". If Raz visits Milla's Mind at this point, he will ask her: \"Agent Vodello? Where are you?\" To which Milla will reply, that she was sitting at the docks when suddenly everything went black. She also asks Raz to give her body a shake when he finds her. The player is allowed to go through the level normally, collecting any Figments, Vaults and Mental cobwebs left. Later in the game, Raz will discover Milla, Sasha and Lili locked at the top of Thorney Tower. Sasha and Milla's brains have been stolen by Dr. Loboto and Raz needs to get them back and progress with the story.Psychonauts: In the Rhombus of Ruin  see: The Rhombus of RuinPsychonauts 2  Milla will appear in Psychonauts 2.Psychic Abilities Trivia Sasha Nein  Sasha Nein is a famous Psychonaut agent. He works with fellow Psychonaut\u00a0Milla Vodello on many missions. In Psychonauts, he helps at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, running underground tests of questionable moral status, brought up due to the campers having such negative (and in a few cases, traumatic) opinions on the idea.Background  Sasha came from an undisclosed location either in Austria or Germany (Although not confirmed, he has a fairly strong German accent, and he is referred to as \"that German fellow\" by Ranger Cruller while looking for his underground chamber), working as a shoemaker with his father. Sasha never knew his mother due to her death from an unexplained illness when Sasha was a baby. When Sasha asked his father about his mother, he wouldn't tell Sasha. So when Sasha's powers manifested, he used his telepathy to see his mother's face from his father's memories. This turned out to be a big mistake, as he discovered a naughty memory of his wife, Sasha's mom. Seeing as he was at a young age, this event presumably disturbed Sasha enough to run away from his home. Events after this are unknown, such as how he became a Psychonaut, how he became partnered with Agent Milla Vodello, etc.Psychonauts Sasha's Mind  Sasha's mind is a large white cube drawing inspiration from the sharp, monochrome 1960s brutalism/minimalism aesthetic popular in mid-century German gothic design (as opposed to Milla's 1960's British psychedelic mod leanings). Sasha says that he can manage to keep his mind under control. Hidden inside the cube are various parts of Sasha's mind, each section hinting about his life (like the large bed and crib about his mother and the shoeboxes and tape-measurer about his father), shown when Raz sets the dial that releases the Censors to the highest setting. After fighting the Mega Censor, Sasha gives Raz his Marksmanship badge, telling him that they will never speak of what happened in his mind again. The music in his Shooting Gallery is a remix of Mozart's \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\", which is an indication that he comes from Austria if not Germany. Upon re-entering the mind, it is revealed that the censor leak was a set-up to make Raz a marksman.Psychonauts 2  Sasha will appear in Psychonauts 2.Psychic Abilities Trivia Boyd Cooper  Boyd Cooper is a clinically insane resident of the Asylum in Psychonauts.Background  Boyd was once a security guard at a department store called \"Hernando's\". One day, he was fired. Boyd had already been fired from a string of jobs and couldn't bear the thought of being fired from yet another one, so, using Molotov cocktails fashioned from empty milk bottles, he burned the department store down in a fit of rage. He was arrested, found insane, and sent to Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed. At some point, he was hypnotized by Coach Oleander, who implanted subconscious orders into Boyd's mind to guard the Asylum from prying eyes and if necessary, burn the place down to hide any evidence of Oleander's plans.Psychonauts  Raz first ecounters Boyd guarding the Asylum Gates, where he finds him continuously mumbling to himself about several conspiracies and writing on the walls. Boyd asks him who he works for, as a confused Raz states himself to be working with the Psychonauts. Boyd states this \"Doesn't fit in at all\", and proceeds to talk to himself. Raz then asks who Boyd works for, he dodges the question by simply stating he is the guard of the Asylum and that he's been \"fully trained.\" In a hurry, Raz pleads for Boyd to open the Gates, but he claims that the \"Milkman has the key\". Desperate for information, Raz is curious of the Milkman's location, but Boyd theorizes that he is sleeping on the job. Unable to obtain any straight answers from the paranoid guard, Raz pulls out his Psycho-Portal, and descends into the mind of Boyd Cooper.The Milkman  The Milkman is Boyd's alter-ego. In Boyd's mind (Milkman Conspiracy), the Milkman is apparently dead, although Boyd and the G-Men do not believe it. When Raz eventually finds the body of the Milkman, he is forced to battle the Den Mother, who has apparently been guarding it. When she is defeated, the Milkman awakes, taking control of Boyd in the real world. Dressed similarly to Boyd in real life, although in white, the Milkman will not rest until he completes his final delivery. The Milkman is actually a personality implanted by Oleander to destroy the insane asylum, erasing any evidence of what went on there. He accomplishes this using a Molotov cocktail made from a milk bottle. After burning the Establishment (read: Asylum), Boyd returns to his previous demeanor. The figments and subconscious orders Coach Oleander planted in Boyd's mind (including the G-Men, the Rainbow Squirts, and the Milkman) leave after he has completed his task, whereupon Boyd says \"The Milkman has completed his route\", much to the confusion of Fred, Gloria, and Edgar. After that, he casually turns to the three and asks if they want to split for a cab.Boyd's Mind  Main Article: Milkman ConspiracyQuotes Outside the Aslyum Gates Inside Boyd's Mind Trivia Coach Oleander  Coach Morceau \"Morry\" Oleander is a Psychonaut and the head coach at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. He believes that the mind is a muscle, meant to be exercised and toughened. His mind, the mental world he callsBasic Braining, is fully explored during his class early in Psychonauts. He is one of that game's three main antagonists, the other two being the mental version of his father and his right-hand Dr. Caligosto Loboto.Story  Coach Oleander is first seen in the intro cinematic, delivering his open monologue to the campers around a fire. He is responsible for writing the pamphlet that inspired Razputin to run away from the circus for Whispering Rock. He is asleep for a large portion of the game, and can be heard grumbling in his sleep from the intercoms around the camp. It is revealed that Oleander has a plot to take over the world with tanks controlled by the brains of psychics. Oleander worked with Loboto to capture the children of the camp and extract their brains. Oleander also had Loboto put an implant into Linda, who mutated and became the Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata, and the Lungfish's mind to turn into the technicolor metropolis known as Lungfishopolis wherein a projection of Oleander into Linda's mind has apparently taken over all of Lungfishopolis via a radio tower (which could be a representation of the implant) and must be defeated. The projection is known as \"Kochamara\", a superhero to the Lungfish, dressed head-to-toe in a blue and orange suit. Kochamara's body and voice are similar enough to the Coach, and after beating him, he claims he \"no longer needs this freaky toad\" and that he has \"the brain of a little girl\" in his lab strong enough to power an army of Psychoblaster Death Tanks. Nearing the end of the game, Ford Cruller\u00a0(outfitted with some Psitanium to keep his mind in check) blows a handful of the sneezing power into the Coach's face, leading to his brain being removed. Said brain makes its way into a Psychoblaster Death Tank, and blasts Raz's party unconscious, leaving only Raz to fight. After the tank is destroyed, Raz also sneezes his brain out. His brain uses Telekinesis to throw itself into the tank with the Coach's brain, leading to the final level of Psychonauts, the\u00a0Meat Circus.Background  As a child, Morceau loved rabbits, and had a field full of rabbit hutches. He took a particular shine to a small rabbit in one of his hutches, and brought it out to play with it. However, he was the son of a butcher, who apparently disapproved of his son's preferences. Morceau's father told him animals were good for nothing but food, and emphasized this by taking the rabbit Morceau was playing with, and killing it right in front of him. This experience proved to be incredibly traumatic for Morceau, and has haunted him for years. When he was rejected from the military due to not being tall enough, Morceau's already scarred mental state was damaged further, driving him to devise a plan for global domination. He claims he is a former soldier, but was in reality never allowed into the Army, Navy, or Air Force because of his height. To reinforce this falsehood, he puts a fabricated Memory Vault titled \"Oleander's Pride\" in his mind where children can easily reach it.Oleander's Mind  Main Article: Coach Oleander's Basic Braining Oleander's mind is a battlefield, where he trains the campers. His warzone of a mind is full of bombs, land mines, and cannons. When Razputin's and Morceau's minds are mixed together, Razputin's childhood memories of the circus where he grew up mixed with Morceau's memories of his father's butcher shop, creating the Meat Circus. Oleander reverts to his childhood state, thus creating a giant version of his father.Psychic Abilities Trivia Ford Cruller  Ford Cruller is a Psychonaut agent, one of the best the agency ever had. He is part (actually multiple parts, via his alter egos) of the staff at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. Around camp, no one but Sasha Nein and Milla Vodello know he is a Psychonaut, including himself when he is not around Psitanium to keep his mind in check.Background  Several years ago before the events of Psychonauts, Ford was locked in mental battle with a very powerful psychic. He managed to defeat his opponent, but the ordeal left his psyche heavily fractured. Literally fractured. Unless Ford stayed near the Psitanium mother lode deposit (the power of which pulls his mind together), his mind would split off into a number of other identities, leaving him with no memory of who he truly is. Although Ford tried to remain underground in his sanctuary as much as possible to continue scouting for Psychonaut business, the operational branch of the Psychonauts largely wrote him off as a mentally-damaged has-been. This forced him to secretly give the assignments he came up with to Sasha Nein and Milla Vodello, the only agents who still respected him as a competent psychomaster. Ford had a large network set up in his sanctuary where he was able to see where psychic trouble is occurring around the world. He then relayed the information to Sasha and Milla, who carried out the missions. They kept the fact that their missions came from Ford a secret, knowing that if the Psychonauts found out that Ford gave them all their assignments, they would stop approving them.Psychonauts  Around camp, Ford's alter egos can be seen, each one different depending on the area of Whispering Rock. He runs the Camp Store, cooking burgers (which are not available, due to the charcoals being on \"back order\"). He sells many useful Psychonaut items, such as a Cobweb Duster (necessary to traverse the later levels) and PSI Cores (which are used to make PSI Challenge Markers). He will also talk on the intercom, advertising for the store. Ford also acts as a janitor, a park ranger, and he also runs the boathouse. Ford doesn't seem to notice anything about Psychonaut business here. Ford loves bacon, and Razputin uses this to aid him. Ford gives Raz a strip of bacon, which he can use anywhere in the field to contact Ford, who will pop his head out of Raz's right ear. He can teleport Raz to his sanctuary (and back to the area he was in), tell him about enemies, and remind him of what he needs to be doing. Furthermore, if Raz has bought the PSI Energy Colorizer from the Camp Store, he can ask Ford to change his thought bubble's color for him.Trivia Quotes Clairvoyance  Clairvoyance is a psychic ability learned by Razputin in Psychonauts. The psychic merit badge was obtained at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. It is also used in Psychonauts: In the Rhombus of Ruin.Description  Razputin learns this skill in the Milkman Conspiracy in Psychonauts, where the badge is found in Boyd's refrigerator. Raz uses this to see through the eyes of another person or object. He first uses this to see through Boyd's eyes. When using this power, Raz can still move freely, however the person will look towards Razputin. When Raz uses Clairvoyance on other people and creatures who are looking at him, his own appearance will vary based on the target's perceptions of him. He usually appears as a two dimensional image of what the target perceives him as. For instance, if it is used on Boyd, Raz will appear to be a milk bottle with his head at the top. However, some characters see him as his normal 3D model, such as the Den Mother. Raz uses this power in conjunction with Lili's Bracelet, allowing him to see her capture at the hands of Dr. Loboto. He can also use a Crow Feather to see from the point of view of nearby crows. Clairvoyance plays a major role in the Den Mother battle.Visions  Whenever Raz uses Clairvoyance on another character, the camera shows the world from their point of view, but focused on looking at Raz. Raz himself appears as a mental image that individual subconsciously perceives him as.Strategies Psychonauts: In the Rhombus of Ruin  This is a key power Raz uses while on a rescue mission to save Truman Zanotto, Grand Head of the Psychonauts.Trivia Lili Zanotto  Lili Zanotto is a veteran camper at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. She is voiced by Nicki Rapp.Background  As the daughter of the Grand head of the Psychonauts, Truman Zanotto, Lili is a gifted psychic and has passed every test and earned every merit badge at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp by the time Razputin arrives. She is fond of plants and specializes in herbaphony, preferring to talk to them rather than most of her fellow campers, whom she views as loud and obnoxious. Even so, she may have dated or at least hung out with Melvin \"Chops\" Sweetwind and Quentin Hedgemouse and she develops romantic feelings for Raz, eventually to the point where she starts calling him her boyfriend.Story Psychonauts  When Razputin literally drops in on the Coach's speech at the start of summer camp, Lili is the only one of the campers who appears to be the most genuinely interested. However, she is subsequently very abrasive towards him and appears unimpressed by anything and everything he does. In Basic Braining, she rescues him from falling hard on the ground, but only to protect the odd meat plant he would have fallen on, mentioning that she's seen similar meat plants in a nightmare of hers. After Raz has an odd nightmare-like experience during the Brain Tumbler Experiment, Raz tells Lili that Dogen's brain has been stolen by an insane dentist. She reveals that she has had similar dreams and agrees to meet him by Lake Oblongata at nightfall to figure out what is happening. In the meantime, Lili climbs to the top of a tower at the Kids' Cabins to investigate the sleeping Coach Oleander's mumblings, noting that his mumbles sound like various things she heard during her nightmare. She later meets Raz by the lake and they agree that Coach Oleander seems to have a plot to take over the world. Lili is thrilled that something interesting is finally happening at camp and impulsively wants Raz to kiss her, but almost immediately she is kidnapped by the Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata and taken to Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed. Dr. Loboto tries to use a special sneezing powder intended to force her to sneeze out her brain, but she has a cold, making the powder useless. Nevertheless, he keeps her hostage at the top of the asylum until he figures out another way to steal her brain. Eventually, Raz comes to save her and with the rebrained Sasha and Milla's help, they psi-blast her out of her restraints. Unfortunately, Coach Oleander soon turns up. As Sasha, Milla, and Ford prepare to battle him, they ignore Raz and Lili's protests and levitate them to the bottom of the tower to keep them safe. With nothing much else to do, they discuss their relationship and share their first kiss just as Thorny Towers explodes. Coach Oleander cuts Lili and the Psychonauts off from Raz as he prepares to do battle. Once the dust settles, Raz is promoted to full-fledged Psychonaut to Lili's shocked delight. Unfortunately, it seems she and Raz will go their separate ways since she lives on the east coast and Raz moves around often. Lili attempts to leave to avoid the pain of goodbyes, but Raz pulls her back into one last kiss. Almost immediately Milla and Sasha inform them that Truman Zanotto has been kidnapped. The team immediately takes the jet and sets off towards their next assignment.Psychonauts: In the Rhombus of Ruin  Lili is part of the rescue team, eventually tracing her father to the Rhombus of Ruin with the help of her family's Music Box as a Clairvoyance link, before being caught. She is brainwashed and taken to a room where she builds bombs, believing they're a garden of beautiful flowers. Raz finds Lili in the room, softly reciting poetry to one of the bombs she calls \"Francis\" and being unresponsive to Raz's requests. Raz notices the broken music box lying on the shelf and uses his powers to repair it, with the help of a rat Lili found and named \"Harold.\" When the music beings to play, Lili wakes up from her trance and is shocked to find the flowers she was tending to were really bombs, scolding \"Francis\" in particular, who was her favorite. Afterwards, Lili (with Raz guiding her) escapes through the hallway, threatening to burn the fish people around her if they attempt to stop her. She uses Francis to blow up the door, telling the bomb she \"accepts him for who he is\" and creating a massive hole from which she escapes. She is briefly chased through a cluttered hallway by a fish monster, but Raz helps her keep it at bay. Lili begrudingly donates some of her psychic power to Raz afterwards, reasoning that he can do more to help from his position than she can. Lili reunites with the other agents as the secret base is destroyed, heading into the jet with Raz and Truman's unconscious bodies. Lili stands next to her father as he and Raz both come to consciousness. Lili, delighted to see her father is okay, excitedly tells him she can't wait to explain. As she whispers in his ear, Truman juts up from his seat and shouts \"you're -- BOYFRIEND?!\" and the game ends.Psychonauts 2  Lili Zanotto will appear in the upcoming Psychonauts 2.Psychic Abilities Trivia G-Men  The G-Men are characters in the Milkman Conspiracy. Although they are technically not enemies, they act as the main obstacles of the world. They are identical, trenchcoat-wearing humanoids who monitor the neighborhood, searching for the Milkman. They \"disguise\" themselves by holding different objects and stating what they are supposed to be disguised as. Humorously, they often use these objects in ways that show they clearly have no idea how they're supposed to be used, such as swinging a bouquet of flowers like a golf club or trying to play a plunger as though it is a trumpet. If Razputin Aquato walks into the zones they are standing in (marked by dotted yellow lines) while not wearing the correct disguise then Razputin will be apprehended and interrogated by the G-Men. He will only have a few seconds to escape (unless, disguised or not, he attacks them, or he tries to enter the area the G-Men is guarding) should he step into these areas. If Raz uses Clairvoyance on them, he appears as a black figure covered in question marks. By holding the various disguises, Raz transforms into whatever the G-Men are pretending to be and you can see how they see themselves this way.Disguises  The G-Men have a variety of disguises (which are only objects that they hold). Raz can hold these objects to sneak through the zones that the G-Men block.Trivia Quotes Confusion quotes  If Razputin hits one of the G-men with confusion, their heads hover above their bodies and they say a line based on what item they hold and then the line they all use when the confusion wears off. This cannot be discovered except by cheating because all the G-men are dead by the time Razputin obtains the confusion merit badge.Linda  The Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata, also known as Linda, is a heavily mutated lungfish that is rumored to kidnap children in Psychonauts.Background  Linda was initially a regular lungfish living underneath a dry lake bed before being taken and altered by Dr. Loboto and Coach Oleander. After hideously mutating her and putting a mind-control implant in her brain, Oleander used her to kidnap the children from the camp, bringing them to Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed across the lake. She is first mentioned in the opening cinematic by Bobby Zilch, who had been spreading the rumor that there was a monster in Lake Oblongata. Mikhail is the second to mention her, mistaking her for a \"giant hairless bear\" that he expresses interest in wrestling. She makes her first appearance during the \"Lili Kidnapped!\" cutscene, where she attempts to lure Lili and Raz with random objects while they converse. The last object she throws out is a flower with a happy face, which Lili picks up without thinking, giving Linda the chance to reel her in and kidnap her. After destroying the mind-control implant in her brain, Linda is very grateful to Razputin, offering him a way to the Asylum across the lake where Lili and the other children's brains are being held.Linda's Mind  Main article: Lungfishopolis Linda's mind is a sprawling metropolis reminiscent of Tokyo, inhabited by Lungfish people living out a human-like existence. When Raz enters her mind, he is gigantic and feared by the citizens as \"Goggalor\". However, the Lungfish citizens within the resistance movement against Kochamara aid Raz in taking down the radio tower (mind-control implant). The entire scenario parodies the Godzilla franchise and the Kaiju film genre in general, casting Razputin as the monster as Lungfish are more commonly preyed upon by humans.Strategy  The first battle with Linda takes place in an air pocket under Lake Oblongata. The best way to beat this part is smashing open the boxes of nails lying around as she sucks them in. Repeating this will move the battle to phase two, where Raz has to be steered through the lake bottom while Linda pushes the air pocket around. Keeping ahead and not getting too close to the edge of the bubble are key, as Raz will be grabbed out of the bubble by the Hand of Galochio if he touches the edge. After surviving the obstacle course the final part of the battle will ensue, in which Linda will come out and fight you herself. She attacks with her \"fishing rod\" appendage at close range, and needs to be led to one of the many clam shells while doing this attack. Her fishing rod will get stuck in a clam if it done correctly, leaving her open to attack. After the battle, the player will be able to use the Psycho-Portal on her, and continue to Lungfishopolis.Trivia Milkman Conspiracy  The Milkman Conspiracy is a mental world set in paranoid security guard Boyd Cooper's mind in Psychonauts. It is a twisted version of a normal suburban neighborhood, with mysterious faceless government agents called G-Men around every corner, constant whispering and eyes or cameras just about everywhere. There are also the\u00a0Rainbow Squirts, suspicious girls that resemble Girl Scouts.\u00a0Points of Interest NPCs Gameplay  In the later part of the game, Razputin reaches Thorney Towers,\u00a0but Boyd, who was still trying to uncover the conspiracy, would not let him in, saying only the Milkman had the key. Inside his mind, Raz has to disguise himself and get past the G-men, who are rather conspicuously trying to look for the Milkman, while the Rainbow Squirts are hiding his location from them. The Squirts are led by the Den Mother, who is the chief in hiding the Milkman from the outside world. After defeating her, Raz wakes the Milkman, and is ejected from Boyd's mind. Boyd then switches his persona to that of the Milkman, and unlocks the gates. After this he is seen holding a Molotov cocktail, restraining himself from throwing it and burning down Thorney Towers. Clairvoyance, the ability to see through the eyes of other living things, is an essential ability to have in The Milkman Conspiracy.Trivia Fred Bonaparte  Fred Bonaparte is a direct descendant of French general Napoleon Bonaparte, and a resident at Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed in Psychonauts. In his mind, he is locked in a battle over control of his body with Napoleon. Having lost so many times, he had given up all hope of ever recovering his sanity when Razputin came to give him a hand. Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo voices him.Background  Fred was once chief orderly at the Asylum. He took an interest in the withdrawn inmate Crispin Whytehead, making it his mission to get Crispin to communicate with other people. He decided to use play therapy to do so, using a board game known as Waterloo-O. The therapy seemed to work all too well, however; while it did allow Crispin to come out of his shell, he proved to be devastatingly good at the game. Fred lost a humiliating 27 times in a row, causing the genetic memory of his ancestor Napoleon Bonaparte (who was sick of seeing his descendant lose to a \"feeble-minded invalid\") to awaken inside him and take control. From then on, Fred was forced to play the same board game again and again until he could win against Napoleon and prove himself at least a bit worthy of the family name after all.Appearance  Fred is a rather tall, lanky person at first glance. He\u2019s trapped in a brown and white straight jacket that keeps both arms at his side. He has a single cup mounted on each shoulder, (Left is a blue mug, right is a pink teacup) both made to mimic shoulder pads. Along with the cups is a big pine green hat atop his head with a yellowish trim around the edges, made to look like Napoleon\u2019s famous hat. A single flower pot is embedded into the top-right of the hat with a single, bright red rose growing out, mimicking a feather. Fred also sports two towels on his back. (Left orange, right pink.) Both put together to look like a cape. And to top it off, he wears long, pale green pants decorated with lines of dirt starting from the bottom, heading upwards and ending halfway. He also wears two mismatched flipflops with white socks, left red, right green.Psychonauts  When Razputin enters the Asylum's lower floors, he immediately hears Fred shouting about losing his battle, and Crispin telling him to be quiet. He quickly learns Fred believes himself to be Napoleon, and decides to help him out of his delusions. With Razputin's help, Napoleon is defeated, leaving Fred sane once more. Razputin helps him out of the straitjacket that bound his arms for so long, and he vows to go and strangle Crispin for what he put him through. But not before taking a refreshing nap, without ancestors to bother him. Later on, when Raz uses the elevator to get up to the upper floors of the Asylum, Fred confronts Crispin and chases him out of the room (it is unknown if any strangling or violence actually took place). Fred regains his position as Chief Orderly after the absence of Whytehead. If Razputin later returns to the Lower Floors, Fred will be back where he was before, playing his makeshift board game, but this time because he finds it fun and wants to \"run a few new strategies through his head.\" He also seems to have permanently inherited Napoleon's proud, upright way of walking. Right before the destruction of the Asylum, Fred jumps out of a window to his freedom, and meets up with the other inmates who cease their escape when being spotted by Fred who is orderly once again. He tells everyone that the asylum is closed and that they can go home. His comment to Boyd triggers a reaction, making him throw his Molotov milk bottle into the courtyard and wrecking Thorney Towers in a fiery explosion.Fred's Mind  Main Article: Waterloo WorldQuotes Trivia Edgar Teglee  Edgar Teglee is an artist and resident of the Asylum. He suffers from random bursts of rage and is obsessed with bull fights. He is voiced by Jerry De Capua.Background  At first, Edgar tells Raz that he was once a famous painter and husband to the beautiful Lampita Pasionado. One day, Edgar was approached by the famous bullfighter, Dingo Inflagrante, who commissioned Edgar to paint a portrait of him. As time went on, however, Lampita ended up getting seduced by Dingo and ultimately left Edgar to be with him. Edgar was devastated by this and was driven mad with heartbreak, painting nothing but bullfights to symbolize his anguish. A sad tale indeed, but a romanticized version of what really happened in the real world. The true story is that Edgar was the captain of his high school wrestling team. He and his teammates all based their costumes on different animals, with Edgar's being \"The Bull\". Edgar's talents as a wrestler were able to get his team a chance at the state semi-finals, but it was then that his cheerleader girlfriend, Lana Panzoni, left him for a male cheerleader, Dean LaGrante. The devastation Edgar felt broke his fighting spirit. He lost his next wrestling match, costing his team a chance at the championship. His teammates all turned their backs on him for it, further compounding his sadness. Edgar spent much of his time painting in the art teacher's room to hide away from his former teammates. He was eventually sent to the Asylum, when his obsession with bullfights led him into fits of rage.Psychonauts  Raz finds Edgar inside a room full of painting equipment, chained to the ground by his leg. He paints velvet paintings and attempts to paint Dr. Loboto's face, which is required for him to be set free, but every time he tries to finish a painting, he ends up painting a bullfight over it. Raz helps him by entering his mind. Here, in the mental world of Black Velvetopia, he finds Edgar attempting to build a house of cards to reach the sun. In the sun is a woman crying rose petal tears. Edgar explains that he is trying to build the house of cards to reach her, but two things have gotten in the way of that. First, Edgar doesn't seem to have a full deck, meaning that he doesn't have enough cards to reach the woman. Second, Edgar reveals that his tower keeps getting knocked down by a large pink charging bull known as El Odio. Raz points out that Edgar is missing his Queens, and offers to go find them. Raz is then swept into the streets of Edgar's mind by El Odio. After finding the cards, Raz gives them to Edgar, who uses them to finish the house of cards and reach the sun. Raz follows Edgar up the house of cards, and then finds himself in a bullfighting ring with El Odio, who is revealed to be Edgar himself. Raz fights against Edgar and defeats him, whereupon Dingo shows up to finish Edgar off. Raz tries to reveal that everything in Edgar's mind wasn't real, that Edgar made up El Odio, Dingo, and Lampita, the last two being romanticized versions of Dean and Lana. However, Edgar is too angry to listen, and turns back into El Odio, charging at Dean/Dingo, who simply parries him. Raz takes Dean/Dingo on himself, and defeats him, causing Lana/Lampita to run to Dean/Dingo crying. Seeing this, Raz's sorrow turns to disgust as he instantly says they are pathetic. Finally Edgar is able to see Dingo and Lampita for who they really are, and decides not to obsess over what Dean and Lana did to him any longer, removing the thing that caused him to go insane: the trauma stemming from his high school memories. After that, he gives Raz the painting of Dr. Loboto and begins painting a new one. After the player removes Loboto, Edgar decides to leave and frees himself. When he breaks off the chain, connected to the floor, he accidentally breaks a gas pipe. At first he's worried, but after sniffing the air, realizes that there is no gas. After spilling all his turpentine and acetone on the ground he leaves his room, Gloria turns on the gas and Fred opens a window leading into the area that has the elevator and Edgar's room. Boyd tosses his lit bottle into the area and the gas ignites, blowing up the Asylum. Like the other asylum inmates, he leaves Thorney Towers and never returns.Edgar's Mind  Main Article: Black VelvetopiaTrivia Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp  Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp is a remote government training facility where paranormally gifted children are trained to become Psychonauts. The camp sits on the shores of Lake Oblongata, opposite the Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed. It is the main setting of Psychonauts.About Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp  Whispering Rock has had quite a history that can be traced all the way back to 500 years ago, when a huge Psitanium asteroid plummeted down on this simple life-giving soil that is now known as a humble camp ground. That very day, this place was marked by the Lord to be something different, unique and amazing, for the very ground itself is paranormal and full with power. In the past, old Natives made the Psitanium material into arrowheads and scattered them throughout the land. They called it Whispering Rock, and since then the name has stuck. Now these arrowheads also serve the camp as a type of currency and is extremely valuable. But with great power comes great responsibility. The Psitanium power is not suitable for the average human, as seen by the past settlement of Shaky Claim. Due to the power found in the soil itself, the old town went into ruin. Its residents became mentally unstable and in Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed. This problem was resolved by flooding the old town, creating Lake Oblongata. Psitanium is one of the reasons this campground is only for Psychics. They are the rare few of the population that can handle such power, and use it for good. The Psitanium soil is the foundation on which this camp was built. It's not just a good place for obstacle courses and some cabins (it's that too), but it is a wonderful foundation for the young psychic minds. The Psitanium helps make a psychic more psychic. Which in turn has caused this very place to be perfect for helping Psi Cadets hone their craft, as well as unlock many new skills they didn't even know they could do. Some of the main things that Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp provides is a place to train, have adventure, explore new worlds, and use and unlock the psychic true potential. Also there is quite a heavy social burden that comes hand in hand with psychic abilities. People of all kinds just don't understand these abilities. Their communities, strangers, friends and even their own families at times are scared and reject them. Deeming them crazy, weird and dangerous. Making this group, a crew psychic of misfits. Yet here at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp the misfit finally fits in and is accepted with open arms.This camp was made with a wonderful goal in mind. That each young psychic could finally have a place to call home away from home.Camp Residents Camp Staff  The camp is run by of a group of super international secret agents. In other words, Psychonauts. They are here to guide these young minds to Psychic successes. Their goal is to help the young campers to unlock, understand, explore and advance their psychic powers, as well as provide a safe haven away from the ridicule and suffering that often comes along with these remarkable abilities. This environment is where these little Psi cadets can be free to be themselves and grow.Campers  Campers come from all over the world to Whispering Rock. From the USA, Russia, and even outer space! With a hope to hone their Psychic powers. There are quite a number of unique kids in this bunch. Each from different backgrounds and status. All this the same psychic potential. Some are new this year and just now uncovering their powers with tender brains. Others have been coming here for years and are Psychic Scouts and Warriors. All are remarkable Psi Cadets.Locations Dr. Caligosto Loboto  Dr. Caligosto Loboto, D.D.S. is an insane dentist and one of the antagonists of Psychonauts\u00a0and the main antagonst in\u00a0Psychonauts: In the Rhombus of Ruin. \u00a0He wears a shower cap, has a prosthetic claw for a right arm, and regards brains as like bad teeth - in need of removal. He is also the designer of the Brain Tanks.Appearance  Dr. Loboto wears a strange item of clothing that's an amalgamation of lab coat and a straight jacket. His head is covered by a large flowered shower cap and his eyes have been replaced by two mechanical contraptions. He wears a long rubber glove on is left arm, but his right arm has been replaced with a clawed, pepper grinder-like prosthetic that is capable of spraying Super Sneezing Powder, which causes his \"patients\" to sneeze out their brains.Personality  Dr. Loboto is a sadistic, deranged man who doesn't mind inflicting physical and emotional trauma on others if it is required by his experiments or rewarded by a paycheck. He also tends to be forgetful, as he forgot to remove Dogen's brain during the procedure. His personality before his lobotomy isn't well known, but he may have shown a small glimpse after Raz healed the rift in his mind. He apparently felt remorse for all the unethical experiments he's performed and expressed a desire to atone for his mistakes. However, as this included activating the self-destruct system of the underwater base he was working in and escaped before he made sure anyone else did, it's unclear how \"cured\" he actually is.Backstory  Loboto was born to a doctor and his wife who loved him very much, hoping for a successful life for their baby. At a young age, he showed signs of psychic abilities, such as bending spoons with his mind. His parents didn't understand their son's gift and grew fearful of him, afraid he was turning into a monster. Loboto would hide in various locations and overhear his parents conversations, including one where his mother declares that she just wants her son to go away so she can forget the whole ordeal. His father had acquaintances in the medical field that he thought might help young Caligosto, and soon sent the boy to the Thorney Towers to be lobotomized in the hopes of curing his strange abilities. This did presumably \"cure\" him of his psychic powers, but it also caused him to lose his mind and the massive Psitanium deposit nearby didn't do him any favors. When the asylum was abandoned, Loboto remained behind with a few other inmates, taking over the facility to conduct mad experiments. \ufeff Later on, he replaced his regular eyes for the two mechanical contractions, put a green glove on his left arm, and replaced his right arm with Super Sneezing Powder device. Finally he put a shower cap on his head and an amalgamation of a strait jacket with lab overalls. \ufeffPsychonauts  \ufeffLoboto soon came to be in cahoots with Coach Oleander to steal the campers' brains. He accomplishes this with powder from his prosthetic arm, making the victim sneeze their brain out. He is first seen removing Dogen's brain before dumping it into a \"trash chute\" in Raz' Brain Tumbler experience. Later, he tries to remove Lili's brain but fails as she has a cold. When the player reaches his lab, he is working on an experiment with Sasha and Milla's brains. He torments his assistant, Sheegor, by threatening to cook her turtle, Mr. Pokeylope, and blames her for bringing him nice brains that won't fight. He is later PSI Blasted out of his lab by his own brain tank when Razputin puts the turtle's brain in the tank.The Rhombus of Ruin  \ufeffHe ran into Raz again in the Rhombus of Ruin where he was conducting experiments on Truman Zanotto and other people, especially Raz for an unknown client. When his back was turned, Raz threw a Psycho-Portal given by Oleander onto Loboto's head. Raz traveled into his mind and, temporarily, cured his insanity. Seemingly sane and remorseful, he ordered his minions to bring the captives to his location and flee the base, after which he activated the self-destruct sequence of the Rhombus and fled.His Mind  In his mind is a sail boat that's missing its compass on a vast ocean with one crew member, representing the last shred of sanity left in his mind, and a giant cuckoo clock built into it. Every now and then, a giant version of him leaps out of the water trying to drag the boat under the water, representing his insanity trying to consume him completely, and the crew member has to stop time with the cuckoo clock in order for someone to attack the giant beast. The ocean is actually a giant bath tub surrounded by a shower curtain and the boat is actually a toy, representing the fact that the only time he was at peace was playing with his toys in the bath.Trivia Gallery  \ufeffDogen Boole  Dogen Boole is a camper at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. He is nine years old and specializes in Blastokinesis. Dogen is voiced by Nika Futterman.Biography  Dogen is a calm and friendly boy and a bit air-headed at times. His outfit consists of red footie pajamas with a yellow Whispering Rock handkerchief around his neck, as well as a specialized tinfoil hat his parents make him wear so he doesn't accidentally blow up any heads with his immense psychic power\u2014power Dogen has been taught to fear. Dogen is one of several children present at Coach Oleander's camp meeting, which is interrupted by Razputin. He is shown to be easily frightened when he mistakes Raz for the Lake Monster, and when he has difficulty making it through the minefield in Basic Braining; if Raz helps Dogen through without letting him explode, he gives Raz some arrowheads even before it is explained what they are as a thanks. When Razputin first talks to Dogen in person, the little boy is having an argument with some squirrels, claiming they are lying and telling him he will kill everyone. He threatens them, and as Razputin heads to class, Dogen feigns innocence before squirrel parts rain down around him. After returning his brain, Dogen will remark that he had better apologize to the squirrels for not believing them, as they had been telling him that \"A little man would kill everyone,\" which he had taken to mean himself. He can later be found at the Kids' Cabins, apologizing to the squirrels.Psychic Abilities Trivia Quotes Psychonauts  Psychonauts is a 2005 3-D platforming video game developed by Tim Schafer and Double Fine Productions and was first published by Majesco Entertainment, then later by Double Fine Productions after they acquired the Psychonauts license from them. There are two sequels released in the series, Psychonauts: In the Rhombus of Ruin, and Psychonauts 2, an upcoming game.History  The game was originally released on April 19, 2005 for the Xbox, April 26 for Microsoft Windows, and the following June for PlayStation 2. The game has subsequently been ported to additional platforms: While it initially suffered from poor sales, Psychonauts received strong critical praise and is considered one of the best platformers of the sixth console generation.Plot  Warning: Massive spoilers for Psychonauts ahead! Read at your own risk; you have been warned. Psychonauts is based on the adventures of Razputin (\"Raz\" for short), a 10-year old who is gifted with psychic abilities. Raz runs away from his family's circus because his father does not appreciate his psychic gift, making him practice acrobatics day after day, and sneaks into a summer camp for those with similar powers, so he can train to become a Psychonaut and show his worth. Soon, however, he finds that there is a sinister plot unfolding at the camp, which only he can stop. When Raz first gets into the camp, Psychonaut Milla Vodello calls his father, leaving Raz with little time to master his psychic powers. While being allowed to stay at camp, Raz befriends Dogen Boole, a boy with incredible but uncontrolled psychic power, and Lili Zanotto, 10-year-old daughter of the grand head of the Psychonauts, who instantly falls in love with Raz, but her natural reluctance prevents her from throwing herself at him. After doing incredibly well in Coach Oleander's Basic Braining, Agent Sasha Nein notices Raz's talents at his young age and asks him to come to his secret lab for advanced training. The advanced training mentioned by Agent Nein involves using a device known as a Brain Tumbler to project Raz into his own mindscape and unlock his true potential. In doing so, he comes across a vision of a large thorny tower where an evil dentist in a shower cap is threatening Dogen with the removal of his brain. Back in reality, Raz discovers that the vision in his mind about Dogen has come true, and he is indeed completely brainless. By gaining new powers from former Psychonaut Ford Cruller, and learning Marksmanship and Levitation from Sasha and Milla respectively, Raz makes it to the top of the tower and sees the madman dentist force Dogen to sneeze his brain out via a super-charged sneezing powder. Raz goes after it down a garbage chute and ends up in a battle with the blueprints of a tank powered by Dogen's psychic power, and upon its defeat, finds himself in the white corridor he saw before in Oleander's mind. Suddenly Sasha turns off the Brain Tumbler, forced to leave on official Psychonauts business and Raz finds that Milla is missing as well. When he goes to meet Lili by the docks, they discuss their findings and come to the conclusion that the good Coach is plotting to take over the world by stealing the campers' brains, and power tanks with them, tapping into their unused psychic potential. Sadly, before they can do something about it, Lili is kidnapped by the Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata, a monster rumored to live in the lake, and Ford Cruller, the only other person left at camp, reveals he cannot leave his sanctuary without lapsing into one of his split personalities, as the Psitanium reserve there focuses his mind, which was broken after an enormous psychic duel. Raz is thus forced to set things right by himself, and uses a bathysphere to follow the monster, being deathly afraid of large bodies of water due to a curse on his entire family that will cause them all to drown in deep water. After engaging the Lungfish in battle, Raz finds that Lili is not with it, but Ford Cruller tells him the monster was once an ordinary lungfish, mutated and brainwashed by Oleander and Loboto. Using the Psycho-Portal from Sasha's lab, Raz journeys deep into the lungfish's mind and frees it from Oleander's control. Grateful, the lungfish takes him to Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed, the abandoned insane asylum across the lake where Loboto resides, and gives him a pipe to summon her should Raz want to cross the lake again. Before leaving, the lungfish reveals her name to be Linda. Making his way up to the gates of the asylum, Raz meets Boyd Cooper, the appointed guard, who refuses to open the gates, rambling about a conspiracy and \"the milkman\" holding the key. Again visiting Boyd's mind, Raz discovers that the milkman is Boyd's pyromaniac alternate persona. Oleander had hypnotized Boyd to burn down the asylum to destroy any evidence of what went on there, and Raz accidentally triggered this mechanism, leaving Boyd frozen in front of the Asylum's main door with a molotov cocktail. Moving on, Raz comes across fallen actress Gloria Von Gouton, Napoleon's loser descendant Fred Bonaparte, and wrestling black velvet painter Edgar Teglee, all mental patients, helps them overcome their mental issues by sorting out their mindscapes, and puts together a costume of Dr. Loboto out of some of their possessions. Using this disguise, he is able to fool the extremely nearsighted Crispin Whytehead, who was guarding the elevator, into letting him through to the upper floors. As Raz reaches the top of the tower he discovers Dr. Loboto experimenting with brains, and notices the brains of Sasha and Milla in jars on a table. He finds their bodies and Lili, who was saved from losing her brain due to a nasty cold keeping her from smelling the super sneezing powder, by which means the brains are removed. He also meets Dr. Loboto's assistant, Sheegor, who only works for Loboto because he holds her precious pet turtle Mr. Pokeylope hostage. Raz helps rescue Pokeylope, who turns out to be entirely sentient and even highly intelligent, and he and Sheegor use his (Pokeylope's) brain to get rid of Loboto (knocking him off the side of the tower) and then rebrain Sasha and Milla. After freeing Lili, Oleander appears and Sasha and Milla send Raz and Lili back down to the asylum courtyard so they don't get hurt in the battle. Ford bursts in with a piece of Psitanium strapped to his back and sprays Oleander with super sneezing powder. Meanwhile, the inmates of the Asylum decide to leave, their issues finally sorted out, and Boyd finishes his objective, throwing one last Molotov through one of the Asylum's windows. Because Edgar left flammable paint thinners laying around and Gloria turned on the gas earlier on, the entire building blows up just as Lili and Razputin have their first kiss, confirming their relationship. After the explosion, the Psychonauts emerge unscathed, and Oleander has lost his brain. However, as the adults laugh over the brainless Oleander, Raz ponders on where his brain is, until suddenly a brain tank emerges with Oleander's brain inside. He knocks out Lili, Ford, Sasha and Milla leaving Raz to face Oleander alone. He defeats the tank but is sprayed by the sneezing powder, leaving him, too, brainless. Using Telekinesis, Razputin tosses his own brain into the brain tank's container, thereby combining his own psyche with Oleander's, mixing Raz's childhood memories of the circus with Oleander's childhood memories of his cruel father's butcher shop. Raz protects 'Little Oly' through the 'Meat Circus' and battles with Oly's gigantic father. Raz eventually meets his mind's representation of his own father, an unpleasable psychopath hell-bent on his son's demise via ridiculously difficult acrobatics. After Raz manages to complete his mental father's challenge, his real father penetrates his mind to reveal that he, too, is psychic, and only forced Raz to practice so much to teach him discipline because their family has many enemies. The two evil dads are defeated, and knocked into a meat grinder, but emerge as a grotesque combination of both. Raz's father gives him a special power that allows to him to defeat the two headed dad monster. Raz and Oleander's psyches are separated with Oleander's inner demons finally taken care of. Back at camp, all the students are recranialized and Oleander apologizes for stealing their brains and trying to take over the world. Ford promptly promotes Raz to a true Psychonaut, seeing as it is obvious that he is not average. Raz and Lili come to terms on their relationship but Lili runs off due to the fact that Raz's family moves around so much that they will barely get to see each other. Just then, Sasha and Milla come in saying that Truman Zanotto, Lili's father and head of the Psychonauts, has been kidnapped. Sasha invites Raz to come along on the mission, who asks his dad for permission, but he simply says he's taught his son everything he knows. Oleander, Sasha, Milla, Lili and Raz then head into the jet and fly off towards new adventures. At PSI Cadet Rank 100, an extra cutscene is unlocked, in which Linda arrives at the burning asylum and meets Sheegor and Pokeylope on the shore after the residents have left, feeling much better after Raz helped them with their mental issues. Linda recognizes Pokeylope, calling him Sam, implying that they must have had some form of history together.Gameplay  Psychonauts combines traditional console platformer elements with the kind of strong storytelling, humor and dialogue found in adventure games. The camp itself is fully explorable by the player to find hidden arrowheads that can be used to purchase items at the camp store and PSI cards that help to improve Raz's PSI Cadet Rank, to talk to other campers and camp advisers, and to make way to the various \"levels\" within the game. There are also areas in the \"real world\" of the camp, including a nearby insane asylum, that the player will explore during the course of the game. Throughout these areas are characters whose minds Raz can enter, either through their own actions, or by use of a small door that Raz uses on the character's forehead. Each of these character levels has its own unique visual design and set of challenges, related to the demons, nightmares and secret memories of the mind that Raz is exploring; for example, within the mind of the lungfish that terrorizes the camp lake, Raz is seen as a giant monster attacking a city filled with lungfish beings (in a level designed to parody most elements of the kaij\u016b genre), while within the mind of Boyd Cooper, the insane security guard at the asylum, Raz finds a mind twisted and askew, with cameras and eyes hidden everywhere, which tune in with Boyd's paranoia. Within the mind levels, the player can collect various \"figments of imagination\" which can also lead to increasing Raz's Psi Ranking, locate tags to match with various \"Emotional Baggage\" within the level to advance ranks and unlock concept art and destroy \"mental vaults\" to unlock a slideshow that helps to explain the background of that character and his or her mental problem. The player must also avoid taking damage from censors that attempt to remove Raz from the character's mind. Each mind level typically ends with a boss fight that represents the main cause of the character's mental problems. Raz gains new psychic powers through the game through either instruction by the camp counselors, or by increasing his PSI Cadet Rank. These powers include telekinesis, levitation, invisibility, pyrokinesis, clairvoyance, PSI Shield, PSI Blast, and confusion. Additional Rankings increase the range, duration or potency of these abilities. These powers are directly involved in the puzzle-solving aspects of the game as well as to defeat foes within the game, and allow the player to tailor the solutions to his or her own playing strengths. The player also gains items that can be used either for solving puzzles, to escape from a mind level if they become stuck, or to get advice for solving some of the puzzles.Appearances in other games  The sequel to Psychonauts would take about 3.3 Million dollars to produce, according to Tim Schafer.Mikhail Bulgakov  Mikhail Bulgakov is a camper at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. He is fixated on wrestling bears. Specifically a \"large hairless bear\" he has seen around camp. He is Maloof's bodyguard and has been known to tell campers exactly how he could beat them in a fight. He calls his Telekinesis move the \"Telekiliminator\". Mark Ivanir voices him.Story  Before embarking into Basic Braining, Mikhail can be seen standing near the path to the Main Campgrounds. He mentions looking for a \"giant hairless bear\" that he thinks lurks in the forest and spends his time searching for the elusive creature for a while. If Razputin goes to the parking lot after completing Milla's Dance Party, he'll find Maloof with a pair of underpants containing a fish pulled over his head. He is waiting for his father to come pick him up, sick of being constantly bullied by Bobby Zilch. Mikhail joins them, thinking the fish is a strategy to attract the bear for wrestling, and tells Raz he'll stay with Maloof so he can wrestle the bear himself afterwards. Maloof tells Mikhail he can have his turn, as he is completely uninterested in wrestling. Mikhail is so thankful for this that when Bobby appears to cause more havoc, he uses Telekinesis to hold the bully into the air, stating \"Bullying now forbidden\" and threatening to use a fighting technique called the \"Deadly Nelson\", which, according to him, would cause the eyeballs to pop out of the victim's head. This scares Bobby away from bullying Maloof, at least for the remainder of the game. From that point on, Mikhail acts as Maloof's bodyguard, being seen warding off any threats to his 'little boss' (including Raz). Mikhail doesn't have a reason why he started working for Maloof, nor does he know that Maloof has nothing to give in return except bullies to beat up. Mikhail doesn't charge Maloof for his services because he thinks his \"boss\" should be charging him. They are also later seen holding Benny over the creek near the GPC, trying to decide Benny's punishment and whether or not to kill him with the Deadly Nelson. After recovering both Mikhail and Maloof's brains, both can be seen wiring something to Coach Oleander's jeep in the parking lot.Psychic Abilities Trivia Crispin Whytehead  Crispin Whytehead is the current orderly at the Asylum. He is seen outside looking over Fred Bonaparte in Psychonauts, the former orderly, while guarding the elevator for the tower. He is also nearsighted enough to be able to mistake Razputin for Doctor Loboto. Dwight Schultz voices him.Background  Crispin was once an inmate himself. He was unresponsively stuck in a padded cell for a long time, until orderly Fred Bonaparte took pity on him and tried to get him to communicate by playing a board game called \"Waterloo-O\" with him. Crispin proved to be brilliant at the game, and then beat Fred 27 times in a row. This helped Crispin out of his original catatonic state, but plunged Fred into a massive inferiority complex, leading to his mind being taken over by a genetic memory of his ancestor Napoleon Bonaparte. After the arrival of Coach Oleander, he was appointed Chief Orderly and Elevator operator for Dr. Loboto.Psychonauts  Razputin was on his mission to save Lili Zanotto from Dr. Loboto, and the only way he could reach her was to ride the elevator. Unfortunately, Whytehead would not let anyone on the elevator except for his boss, Dr. Loboto. Whytehead was immune to Razputin's psychic powers and psycho-portal, but had poor vision. Luckily, Razputin befriended the other asylum inmates and obtained items from them each to make a disguise as Dr. Loboto. Thinking he sees Dr. Loboto, Whytehead kindly lets Razputin ride the elevator to continue his mission. Afterwards, Fred confronts him due to the freedom from his mental past and straitjacket. Frightened that his former Chief Orderly is no longer an inmate and is finally able to get his revenge, he runs off as Fred chases after him.Personality  Despite being an inmate once, Crispin speaks in a quiet and mannerly tone after becoming the Chief Orderly. Crispin is a bitter and sadistic person. Although it is not known why he was sent to the Asylum, or why he was catatonic, he is shown to be quite disturbed. He has the most wild laugh out of all the characters when tickled with the Crow Feather.Appearance  Crispin is a short man with bluish green hair, an enormous forehead and a protruding brow. His big lips show one tooth sticking out. He wears an Orderly's coat over his straitjacket with orange and purple patches sewn on the elbows, and green and black striped pants. He has vague blue pupils, to indicate he is going blind or possibly has cataract.Trivia D'artagan  D'artagan, or Dart for short, was the original protagonist concept planned for Psychonauts. The main character was changed during development to Razputin, due to difficulties with animating Dart's hat. They also feared that the sway of the hat would be confused with a ponytail and people would think Dart was female. He makes an appearance for a split second during the final cinematic, peeking out from inside an outhouse in the background.Trivia Kochamara  Kochamara is a boss who appears in Lungfishopolis in Psychonauts.Background  Kochamara is the product of a mental implant that was placed in the mind of the Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata. Ever since Coach Oleander placed the implant in the Lungfish, Kochamara has been reigning over the people of the mental city of Lungfishopolis. His tower, which brainwashes the Lungfish and the citizens of Lungfishopolis, resides on Kochamara Island. Kochamara appears to be an astral projection of Coach Oleander with an added disguise, as he talks to Razputin Aquato prior, during and after the boss fight about things only the Coach would or should know of. This theory is strengthened by Kochamara's \"fading\" animation during the cutscene following the ending of the boss fight itself.General Strategy  Kochamara begins the battle flying. He will only perform two attacks right now: Mighty Ram (where he charges into Raz) or Deadly Triangle Beam (where he fires an energy beam at Raz). When he use Deadly Triangle Beam, use Shield to deflect the beam back at him. After about three hits, he will sap all your Aggression Ammo, and land on the ground. Now, he has three additional attacks: Mighty Ram Ground Version (he charges at you), Overly Intricate Combination Attack (he does a combination of kicks and punches), and Hard-to-Avoid Area Attack (he charges up and blasts the entire area). When he uses Hard-to-Avoid Area Attack, use Shield to defend and then run up and hit him. Eventually, he'll start flying again. Repeat the flying phase until he is hit once, then the ground phase until he is hit twice, and then you'll win.Trivia Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed  Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed is an abandoned insane asylum on an island in Lake Oblongata off the shores of Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. It is the second main setting of Psychonauts.Background  The asylum was founded years ago by Houston Thorney, to house the demented people of Shaky Claim, the town currently at the bottom of Lake Oblongata, who were driven mad by the Psitanium under the ground. Within fifteen years' time, however, Thorney Towers was more populated than the town itself. Houston, either driven insane by the Psitanium or by the huge responsibility over the many patients, committed suicide by jumping off of the highest tower. The asylum seems to have been built on a high point above the town, because when the government flooded the town to prevent further settlement, creating Lake Oblongata, the asylum remained standing. It has been abandoned for years, yet some of the residents still remain (even after being paid by the federal government to leave).Story  Coach Oleander uses Thorney Towers as his base of operations for his plot to take over the world. Dr. Loboto's lab resides in the highest point of the Asylum. The Asylum has fallen into obvious disrepair and is hardly safe to inhabit; filled with rats and crumbling stairways long exposed to the elements. Milla Vodello blocked off the route to the asylum to make sure the kids don't go to such an unsafe place. Even though this asylum is abandoned, it still has inmates and is run by Dr. Loboto. The inmates were unaware that the asylum was closed because they had their own mental problems to deal with. After climbing to the top of the tower and defeating Dr. Loboto, Thorney Towers was destroyed by Boyd Cooper\u00a0with\u00a0Molotov milk bottles, the flames of which reached Edgar Teglee's room, which was fill with leaking gas and flammable paint thinners, thus immolating the tower. It is unknown how the inmates fled the asylum, but it is certain that they managed to get out of there before the destruction.Current Residents Trivia Milla's Dance Party  Milla's Dance Party is a mental world in Psychonauts which takes place inside the mind of Milla Vodello, the mental minx. As its name might suggest, this world is basically one enormous party from start to finish. Equipped with all the necessary obstacles to train campers in Levitation, in a playful manner. Numerous Party Dancers are seen throughout the level, dancing to their hearts' content. Basically it is like being in a groovy lava lamp.Points of Interest Description  The level is modeled with a 1970s disco feel and gives off a very upbeat vibe. The Levitation Merit Badge is earned here, and so the world introduces the different aspects of levitation. The mental minx Milla Vodello is with the Campers, the whole time guiding them through various obstacles; in her sweet patent voice, via some vary large screens from the other side of the party. The main goal in this level is to find her on that other side of the party and get to dance with her face to face. The Mindscape starts with rolling around on the Levitation ball on different dance floors so that they will light up. Also there is quite a lot of bouncing from one bright and psychedelic platform to the next. As well as lots of mini dance parties with your fellow Psi Cadets, as one makes their way up the level. Milla isn't as carefree as she might seem. Hidden within her playfulness is a deep feeling of loss. Milla Vodello apparently used to work in an orphanage, but all of her children died in a fire and she couldn't help them. This is represented by a hidden room, that looks like a children's playroom, which contains a large toy chest. Inside of this toy chest is a room lined with bars, behind which is a horrible, burning landscape populated by the Nightmares of Milla's children, who whisper about how much the fire hurts, and ask why Milla didn't save them. The meaning of this room is explained by a Memory Vault, found in the area containing the chest. The next part of the mindscape resembles being inside a giant lava lamp. This is where we find Milla's other vault filled with all of her adventures with the Psychonauts. There is also an obstacle that shows the mechanic that Levitation\u00a0allows Raz to pass over dangerous surfaces. The exception being deep water which is strange according Milla and causes her to show concern for Razputin. There are lot of fans, and bubbles throughout the mental world which Milla Vodello uses to teach Campers how to float up or down with the Levitation ball. Near the end is a long track used for a levitation race against Bobby Zilch, Clem Foote and Crystal Flowers Snagrash.Enemies Collectibles Vaults Trivia ", "\u041f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0442\u044b - \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "\u041f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0442\u044b - \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "Cars Video Game Modding Wiki": "Cars Video Game Modding Wiki ", "Taxi Simulator: Brick Cars Edition Wikia": "Taxi Simulator: Brick Cars Edition Wikia ", "Crash of Cars Wiki": "Crash of Cars Wiki ", "Cars: Mater-National: Superdrive Wiki": "Cars: Mater-National: Superdrive Wiki ", "Scars of Lugacir Wiki": "Scars of Lugacir Wiki ", "Project Cars IndyCar Series Wiki": "Project Cars IndyCar Series Wiki ", "Crashsh of cars Wiki": "Crashsh of cars Wiki ", "Carstwo Strigiego!

Radio.Thrillville (video game)  Thrillville is a theme park simulation game developed by Frontier Developments and published by LucasArts and Atari.Gameplay  In Thrillville, your uncle Mortimer, who owns and operates a chain of theme parks known as Thrillville, asks you to be his park manager. Thrillville is a group of five separate parks, each with three themed areas. You start off in the first park, and by building rides and improving the park, you unlock the next park, until you have all five unlocked. But the foundation of the game lies in the missions. In order to unlock the next park, you must complete a set amount of missions (tasks that Mortimer gives you) in order to improve each park. Completing these missions will not only unlock parks, but can reward you with money to build more attractions, or by unlock new rides and games. As park manager, you can build rides, games, food and drink shops, restrooms, souvenir stalls, race tracks, and other attractions.There are also two coaster stations in each themed area of each park.

Elements shared include similar simulation/strategy gameplay, and a cameo from Lily of Himegari. Product HomepageRoutes  The game features 3 routes, one for each main heroine (Yuela, Serawi, and Emilita). The route you take changes which of the three you romance, as well as unlocking specific quests.Changes from Princess Hunting Dungeon Meister  The game spans beyond one dungeon with outdoor battles and at least one city to spend time in between battles. Has an overworld map and you can see where the game takes place geographically compared to other Eushully games. There are now unique recruitable monster girls and other characters with more events for them, rather than having an army of generic monsters (which makes this a RPG and not a warfare-oriented SLG like Himegari Dungeon Meister). A character reaching 0 HP is only knocked out of the field for the current play of a map, they're not killed for good and can be present the next time you explore a location. You have a workshop and item creation that is far more extensive than Dungeon Meister's. You can assign units to be shopkeepers and upgrade the shop to make it more effective. Items can be synthesised and used to give your characters new abilities and skills, or be sold at your shop. Units can equip three different items at once - a weapon and 2 accessories. Major characters can change into outfits with different elemental properties - however, this limits them to 1 accessory. Adjacent allies can perform support, attack, or defense actions. Specific units can perform an \u00a0union attack together, provided that the skill is equipped. Monsters have a base level in each map but will scale to the average level of your party if it exceeds that minimum level, up to a cap. It is possible to remove the cap for second, third, etc playthroughs. The current fully upgraded state of the game is 2.0, with three append disc extras (Special Alchemy, Hannah's Pilgrimage, and the v2.00 expansion).English Translation Project  This game has been translated into english by Tenka Seiha. You can download the patch from their official site: http://tenka.seiha.org/2012/02/atelier-wil-and-his-pretty-princess-dressup-adventures/ The patches have been removed. Note that the patch requires all append discs of the game installed in order of their times of release (as mentioned in the above section), or else the translation patch may malfunction.Note to Editors  Please note at this time we are starting to translate (using the above patch) and are continuing to add information to the wiki. Feel free to leave or add the Japanese names of items, enemies, and skills. However, to save space, most (if not all) of the other information should be in English. In other words: We cannot be sure of everyone's update or translation state, so if possible, leave the Japanese for items IN THE SECTION MEANT FOR THEM. For example, append the EN name to the JP name of monsters in the Monsters section, but wherever else they appear (in Items and Stages), ONLY KEEP THE ENGLISH. This is to allow us to present the information necessary to those who must use the vanilla version, unpatched version, or otherwise.Gallery Others  The full version of this game EUDV-012 was released on April 22, 2011, along with a preorder bonus disc (\u7279\u6b8a\u932c\u91d1\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af) containing an Append feature as well as concept art and wallpapers.

He wanted to apply for membership at alchemy guild a year ago, but failed because of the accident where his parents lost their life. Now, a year later, he plans to pass the entrance exams again. Largely, his combat purpose is to be a physical tank, able to shield frail units (like Serawi) from direct harm with skills such as Cover, as well as take considerable damage himself with his relatively high HP. This only increases once he gets his second outfit, which bears resistance against the main four elemental types and Physical. Being the actual alchemist, he also is very versatile in movement, being able to obtain all four elemental walking skills as well as Double Action. He is also capable of buffing his teammates with runes. Before reaching S and M weapon mastery levels, he has access only to Physical, Earth, Wind, Dark and Omni weapons, which limits his offensive capabilities somewhat. Despite his few combat skills, his high natural stats growth and access to better weapons late in the game make Wil ultimately one of the best offensive as well as defensive characters. Also, if you can procure his artifact, he will be able to fly and teleport along with his own ethereal skill. This turns him into the best explorer/collector in the game as he can go any type of terrain and obstacle. Weapons: Hammers Type: Human Classes:Yuela / \u30e6\u30a8\u30e9\uff08\u6708\u721b\uff09  Swordswoman from Disnafrody, she seeks to restore her sword's original strength in Yuidora. She accepts Wil's offer to work as his bodyguard in exchange for him finding a way to restore her sword's magical powers. Her combat role is the physical sweeper - able to move in, land high-damage, high-accuracy strikes with Sword Dances, and prevent the enemy's attacks with high evasion rate and skills like Sword Flash and Intimidate. She has high speed, which usually grants her an additional attack (or at least prevents the opponent from gaining one). Her Sword Dances cover all elemental types (including Omni) other than Ice and Wind, so in most cases she can use whatever weapon grants the largest stat bonus and still have the \"right\" elemental attack. Yuela's main weakness are the severe caps on her Res and Luk stats (and to a lesser extent Con as well). As a result, she is quite weak against any magic attacks and must rely on Evade to survive. In NG+ games, Godslayer Armor (especially with 1-2 Chronos gems) significantly reduces these weaknesses. Overall, she is a strong fighter and is a solid choice for almost any dungeon. Weapons: Swords Type: Human Classes:Emelita / \u30a8\u30df\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf  Emelita is good-natured, enthusiastic and cares about others. From the start, she takes an interest in Wil and knows quite a bit about him before they formally meet. Emelita's combat role is that of the ranged nuke - she has powerful magic, but is slow to get to the party and intially quite frail. However, once she obtains a diversified list of spells and reaches level 40+, she becomes a powerful offensive force. She is the only character until late in the game to bear an AoE attack capable of striking five squares away (Io Rune), but her movement range is only 3 squares until she reaches level 50. Her lack of mobility is partially offset later when she gains spells with range of up to 5. Even at low levels, her magic attacks allow her to defeat foes that would normally be difficult to overcome due to high melee defense and/or physical resistances. She is one of the best shop managers, and given her low movement and initial weak combat abilities, is often better suited for that role rather than dungeon exploration until reaching higher levels and obtaining NG+ clothing. At higher levels (50+), with Double Action, excellent omni-elemental Sonic Scream spell obtained from Gothic Rocker Robe along with top level spells for Ice, Earth, Wind and decent Holy attack, Emelita becomes a very solid range attacker. Weapons: Staves Type: Human Classes:Servalwi Endoss (Serawi) / \u30bb\u30e9\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30a6\u30a3\u3000\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u30b9\u3000\uff08\u30bb\u30e9\u30a6\u30a3\uff09  An elf sent from the nearby but little known elven village of Reyshiamael, she serves as the link by which the reclusive elves of Reyshiamael interact with the humans of Yuidora. Her dream is of future where humans and elves can build a cooperative future together. Being an elf, she has a much longer lifespan than humans, and will probably live much longer than Wil, a fact that the player is often reminded of throughout her route. She likes taking the role of elder sister, and is almost like a motherly figure to Emelita. Her combat role is largely multirole - she is the only ranged healer until NG+, and good with the bow as well as offensive magic. She starts with only Wind magic (and fairly weak at that), but once she learns clothing skills of other elements or merely equips the right elemental bow, fear her. Like Emelita, she's slow to move, so she may lag behind while the melee fighters move through the map. She tends to be overshadowed by Crayl and Crayanne due to this until she obtains high level archery skills such as Carpet Bombing and Enhanced Barrage together with upper level elemental spell skills. At levels above 50, with her stats un-capped, she ultimately becomes one of the best all-purpose range fighters. As a healer/mage, NG+ Hannah outclasses her due to range 9 healing as well as the benefits of having uncapped stats from level 1. Weapons: Bows Type: Demihuman Classes:Secondary characters (non-customizable) Aht / \u571f\u7cbe\u30a2\u30c8  An earth spirit summoned by Wil and Serawi. Aht was initially little more than gooey brown slime little stronger than the average monster. However, Wil subsequently rectified the problems that she had and her true form was revealed to be a girl. Similarly to Wil, Aht's combat role is largely that of physical tank, with decent Con, rank A Physical resistance, and skills such as Iron Wall and Cover to protect her and her allies. Unlike Wil, at low levels she can hold her own against enemies fairly easily - as long as she is not attacked with magic. Until you get a Pure Anklet (and get her humanoid), she's the slowest party member (with only 2 Mov), which not only makes using her in most dungeons troublesome, but even training quite tiring. Her ability to use gloves as well as claws allows access to all elements by late game. More importantly, by that time she will have completed her \"training\" (ch 7 event), making her a much more useful party member. However, even with the much needed improvement in Mov and large bonuses to Speed and Luck, Aht is simply too handicapped by her stat caps to be anything other than a secondary, situational party member. In NG+ ver 2.0 games, Stone Golem makes this even more apparent. Weapons: Claws, Gloves Type: Mana Join condition: Quest 023 (chapter 1+) Classes: Resistances:Suina / \u6c34\u7cbe\u6c34\u90a3  Suina is an undine dwelling in Lake Shisetika nearby Yuidora. She joins Wil after he rescues her from monsters fighting over the lake. She is kind, if timid, and very affectionate towards Wil. Suina's combat role is a caster, primarily Ice-element, but her magic crystals provide her with some spells of other elements. She is quite capable in early game, being one of the first characters to gain a range 3 attack (Water Volley), but is really hindered later by her low stat caps. Although her stats growth still leaves much to be desired then, she gets better once she completes her quest line and obtains Ice Shield skill and Frozen Blade spell (an Omni-elemental melee spell), and certain weapons from 2.0 dungeons provide her with high-power, high-range spells as well. Weapons: Crystals Type: Mana Join condition: Quests 027 & 028 (chapter 1+) Classes: Resistances:Crayl / \u6728\u7cbe\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb  Crayl and his sister Crayanne first meet Wil in Yuidora forest, where they try to play pranks on him. After observing Wil though, Crayl finds him interesting and subsequently joins him so that he may become strong to protect his sister. Unlike his sister, Crayl is considered Wind element, thus his elemental weakness is Fire. He is exclusively an archer, with strong weapon-based Wind attacks as special abilities. His role partially overlaps with Serawi, who possess Wind magic, thus he is not very useful if you invested heavily in making Serawi strong. Because of his Wind-based attacks, Crayl is very useful against constructs and Earth-element creatures such as lower-mid level dragons. At higher levels, Crayl struggles a bit due to stat caps and limited skills; his Wind attacks are still useful, but in many situations there are better choices to bring to the dungeon. Weapons: Bows Type: Mana Join condition: Quest 038 (chapter 2+) Classes: Resistances:Sharty / \u7761\u9b54\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3  Sharty is a succubus who was menacing the housewives of Yuidora (by seducing their husbands). She is subsequently captured by Wil and joins him as the better alternative to being turned over and executed by Yuidora authorities. On the battlefield, Sharty can serve as a secondary explorer, being one of the few characters who naturally has Thief, and later Adventurer. On the attack, she can use both magic and physical attacks equally, and can readily heal any damage that gets through with Bloodsuck. Her survivability when outnumbered is quite good thanks to Bloodsuck skills again. She also possesses the Flighty Guardian skill, which will always block one hit for any adjacent allies, making her a useful support for frailer characters, or when fighting against bosses and other strong enemies. Still, due to fairly low stat caps, Sharty frequently struggles against powerful foes. She doesn't have sufficient HP and Con/Res to survive repeated high damage attacks while her Evasion is too low to avoid a sufficient percentage of attacks. Even with Bloodsuck, she may not deal enough damage to regain sufficient HP. Against fellow demons or Holy-element attacks, she may have trouble without the right equipment (i.e. Special Gloves/Santified Necklace). Lack of Wind or Ice elemental attacks may be a factor in whether she is deployed. Generally, Lily is a better option in NG+. Weapons: Gloves Type: Demon Join condition: Quest 046 (chapter 2+) Classes: Resistances:Uya / \u72d0\u708e\u7363\u30b5\u30a8\u30e9\u30d6  Uya is a flame fox and a servant of Kohakuren, who sends him to monitor Wil so that Wil does not forget or escape fulfilling her requests. Proud and somewhat stubborn, he seeks to become stronger and more self-reliant. As a flame fox, his elemental weakness is Ice. He is one of a few characters able to find hidden rooms, unlock doors, and excavate, all in 1 skill. He also has high movement range, allowing him to cover distances quickly, and at high levels, has double move. While that makes him a potentially very useful ally, his actual combat abilities are fairly limited, although his high Evasion allows him to often avoid retaliation. Assuming normal stat growth, he is most useful as a utility unit used to find hidden rooms and excavate materials when Wil is not around, fight low- to mid-level foes, or those using Fire attacks. Weapons: Claws, Fangs Type: Mystic Join condition: Quest 054 (chapter 2, accompany), chapter 3 (join) Classes: Resistances:Melodiana / \u7b2c\u516b\u4f4d\u5929\u4f7f\u30e1\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u30ca  Melodiana is an angel Wil meets after making an offering at the Cliffside Church. She subsequently joins Wil under the premise of monitoring him. Melodiana tells Wil that she is an archangel, which despite the grand sounding name, is the second lowest among the 9 ranks of angels. Offensively, she suffers from low stat caps, particularly Speed, and as a result, rarely gets an additional attack and often grants one to the enemies. Her Holy attacks are useful in the right situation, especially early game before other characters join or obtain such attacks. She serves decently on both physical and magical fronts, though she prefers the physical. Angel-related skills (such as Angel's Guardian and Angelic Command) lets her work well with fellow angels (e.g. Elizasleyn). While her skills are limited to Holy attacks, her weapon class (spears) ultimately covers all elements (including omni) with all but Wind available as normal (non S or M) level weapons. Still, overall, even with sizable stat bonuses from S & M level weapons, her stat caps and limited skill set relegate her to a secondary/situational support role. Weapons: Spears Type: Angel Join condition: Quest 051 (accompany), chapter 3-4 (join) Classes: Resistances:Crayanne / \u6728\u7cbe\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30f3\u30cc  A tree spirit protecting the elven forest with her brother Crayl, Crayanne joins Wil and company after being rescued from a profiteering human merchant who captured her with the hope of havesting her honey. Because male and female tree spirits have contradictory natures, Crayanne is considered an Earth element character, unlike her brother Crayl, thus her elemental weakness is Wind. Offensively, Crayanne is primarily an Earth-based magic user, using Fissure and later Aftershock, though she also can use her bow acceptably. High Resistance and Speed works in her favor against spiritual foes, and decent Strength is nice against physical foes too. After her training event, she can also work as a battlefield healer, though not quite as versatile as Serawi. If you can get her Time Bracelet, she handily becomes a powerhouse with Double Move, and gets even better if you can use Supplements on her. Even with Double Move, there are situations where Crayanne may struggle or possibly not used at all. She is extremely vulnerable to Wind attacks (F- resistance) and should not be used against strong foes attacking with that element. Against foes highly resistant or immune to Earth attacks, her effectiveness is limited. Overall, with Double Move and relatively benign stat caps, shes a solid NPC - more so than her brother. Weapons: Bows Type: Mana Join condition: Quest 042 (chapter 6+) Classes: Resistances:Paraskevas / \u5e7b\u7363\u30d1\u30e9\u30b9\u30b1\u30f4\u30a1\u30b9  Paraskevas is an unique sea creature Wil meets while investigating a disturbance at Yuma Lake. After finishing a series of quests, he offers to help Wil and join the party. Despite not speaking a formal language, Servalwi can communicate with him to some extent, and Emelita becomes quite fond of him despite his monsterous size and appearance. Like Suina, Paraskevas is at home in water/ice environments. Give him a Mifu Hammer and he will clean up water type foes easily. Unlike Suina, he doesn't suffer from harsh ability stat caps, apart from abysmal luck. He has good HP and Str along with fairly good Con and Res, although his Spd is a bit low and his movement is only 3 until reaching level 55. The skills are fairly good: Supersonic is a nice Str-based attack skill with a range of 5, Water Breath is a decent AOE attack, and he starts with Intimidate as well. Paraskevas is situational party member best used in water/ice environments (replacing Suina if you used her in that role) or as a \"light\" tank against low to mid level opponents. Weapons: Hammers, Claws Type: Mystic Join condition: Quest 070 (chapter 7+) Classes: Resistances:Kohakuren / \u5996\u72d0\u30b3\u30cf\u30af\u30ec\u30f3  Kohakuren is a nine tailed demon fox, one whose territory Wil tresspasses on while on an expedition in the Rosean Mountains. As an expression of apology, Wil offers his services to her. She joins Wil and company after Wil manages to completely satisfy her requests. Kohakuren's a Fire creature, and her elemental weakness is Ice. Fire magic is her domain, with very high Intelligence and strong Resistance, she is a potent offensive force against all but those highly resistant to fire attacks. Against foes weak to fire attacks she is uterly devastating using Nine Tail Flame. She is also a competent melee fighter if necessary due to fairly high Strength and decent Constitution. In addition to her offensive abilities, the Displace skill can send allies to any player-controlled sector, so she can stay back at the home base and send allies to the front lines to no risk and much faster than they would if they had to hoof it from the nearest controlled deployment point. Displace is also a very useful skill in gathering materials from already cleared maps - allowing collection of materials without having to re-fight battles. Weapons: Pipes Type: Mystic Join condition: Quest 060 (accompany), quest 062 started (join) Classes: Resistances:Elizasleyn / \u7b2c\u4e94\u4f4d\u5929\u4f7f\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3  Having Melodiana as a companion gave Wil a positive impression of angels, so when the legend of an angel with a singing voice reached his ear, he decides to pay the said angel a visit. However, when he finally does meet Elizasleyn, he learns of her hostile intent towards Yuidora, which she believes will eventually bring about ruin due to it's development. After a brief war, Wil defeats Elizasleyn in battle and makes a contract with her, whereby she promises to kill him if he does not meet her expectations. Unlike Melodiana's strict but gentle personality, Elizasleyn can almost be said to be cruel. Elizasleyn is a 5th ranked angel (Virtue), and as an angel, she is weak to Darkness element. Much faster on foot than most other casters, Elizasleyn can move quickly through a battlefield to aid others with Angelic Command and various Holy-based skills. She also has a curious AOE ability (Light Veil and later Atonement) which, while not unique in terms of range, does not attack allies like most other spells. She also is one of only a couple of characters who can learn the Seal skill, which limits enemy attacks to their primary weapon. With good resistances (other than Dark which is a manageable E), stats and a solid Omni attack from the start in Angelic Hymn, Elizasleyn is a good all-around range fighter. Weapons: Staves Type: Angel Join condition: Quest 077 (chapter 7+) Classes: Resistances:Gaptahl / \u96f7\u7adc\u30ac\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u30eb  Gaptahl joins the party after Wil returns the dragon egg stolen by Gantz. His demeanor is \"noble\", almost to the point of being arrogant, but he develops respect for Wil as the game progresses - ultimately leading to him joining the party. When first joining the party, Gaptahl is a bit of a paper dragon - he's not nearly as powerful as when you initially confront him. His resistances are surprisingly average for a dragon, with \"B\" resistance to everything but Wind (X = immune as a storm dragon) and Fire (E). Starting stats are decent overall, but low Res combined with his average elemental resistances requires careful deployment against magic-using foes. Skills are fairly good: he starts with Thunder Breath AOE Wind attack, and easily gains the top tier Wind spell Thunder Carnage, although the effectiveness of the latter is limited by his mediocre Int. Dragon Assault is a powerful melee attack offering a good Str bonus and SP drain. He also gains Prevail I from his personal accessory. He is best suited as a situational unit against foes weak to Wind attacks, using his Flight skill and high movement to reach/search distant areas, or fight low to mid level foes until his stats improve sufficiently to take on strong opponents. Weapons: Fangs Type: Mystic Join condition:Quest 71, 72 and 73, Chapter 8, Wil Level 37+, Missable if didn't Join at chapter 8 Classes: Resistances:Ragsmuena / \u6b7b\u795e\u30e9\u30b0\u30b9\u30e0\u30a8\u30ca  A reaper who was fused with the spirit of Yuela's dead sister, Ragsmuena terrorized the mines and forest of Yuidora, until she was defeated by Wil and subsequently forcibly seperated from the said sister's spirit, and began to wander dungeons aimlessly slaying monsters for their life force. She is later captured by Wil, who out of his desire of peaceful coexistance with various races did not slay her. She joins several events after. As a reaper, Ragsmuena's elemental weakeness is Light. As a spirit, Ragsmuena has high Constitution and Strength. Many of her weapons and skills have Death effect, capable of instantly killing the enemy. On top of high Con, she has S+ resistance to Physical attacks, making her the ultimate tank against physical melee attacks. Even against elemental melee attacks, her high Con reduces damage taken considerably. However, she has low starting HP, average (B) resistance to Earth, Ice, Wind and Fire, E resistance to Holy attacks, and a low Res stat, rendering her very susceptible to non-Dark magic attacks. She's effective against melee attacking foes, Holy-based foes (if equipped with Sanctified Necklace), and once she gets a Holy attack weapon such as the Guilty Scythe (Gauntlet prize), demonic and other Dark foes.

In an EX-event, Wil picks up a magical black pearl (\u6f06\u9ed2\u306e\u9b54\u73e0) belonging to Mylen in \u4fee\u7f85\u306e\u6df7\u6c8c\u907a\u8de1 (Wartorn Ruins). Upon his return to his workshop, Wil is confronted by Mylen, demanding its return. After learning that she intends to use the power of the black pearl for evil, Wil refuses to return it, and as a result had to confront and defeat Mylen in battle in the Gushimera Temple. Upon defeating her, Wil decides to teach her to understand humans and why it is wrong to kill. Mylen is one of the best side characters you can recruit, having Double Action from the start, no elemental weaknesses, and excellent initial stats (especially Str, Spd, and Evd). These along with Prevail skills more than offset any weaknesses from average Con and Res and relatively low HP for a melee fighter. Although she is best suited towards melee combat, Hellfire Cage (and its upgrades) along with the ability to use orbs give her solid range attack abilities. Explosive Assault is utterly devastating to opponents weak to fire, and Ferocity adds to her already potent offensive power. Equiped with a Naqua Ninja Blade, she can be a quick explorer of hidden rooms in addition to having a chance of inflicting Death. Compared to Yuela, Mylen has better overall stats and higher Evd, but lacks Yuela's massive skill set (including flexibility from the varied sword dances and an AoE attack). Mylen has one of the highest command costs in the game, but is well worth it. Weapons: Swords, Crystals, Claws Type: Demon Join condition: NG+, quest 083 (requires picking up Ebony Pearl in Chaotic Warground - Wartorn Ruins) Classes: \u6b6a\u9b54 literally means \"warped devil\", KanJi reads \"Waima\" Due to a mistake in translation, second English title is same as first one. In fact, her second title could be translated as \"Space compressing warped devil princess\". Resistances:Phinilly / \u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30ea\u30a3  Joins in second and later playthroughs if you turn EX-events On when starting a new game. Upon discovering the spirit's candlestick (\u7cbe\u970a\u306e\u71ed\u53f0) in Ancient Ruins (\u53e4\u306e\u9b3c\u65cf\u907a\u8de1), Wil is given the opportunity to go on an expedition to the Mercy Light Valley (\u5149\u6190\u306e\u8c37). Upon arrival, he discovers that the place is protected by powerful magic that denies outsiders entry. When Wil finally enters the valley, he finds Phinilly hostile to him for tresspassing into her territory. After her defeat, she joins Wil and company hoping to learn more about humans and what makes them strong. As a fairy, Phinilly has no elemental weakness, but is strong to physical, light and dark, just like the Eushully maid angels. Phinilly is one of the more useful companions even if the Eushully maid angels are recruited. Her stats are good overall (Int very good), HP is fairly high, and she has no elemental weaknesses while being resistant to physical damage. Her skills are good if not outstanding as well. She has top-notch Wind attacks which are effective even to those without weakness to wind due to her high Int. Accelerated Thrust is a good backup melee attack while Reflect can be devastating in some cases. She also gets Double Action, although not until level 99. In short, she is a very good melee fighter with excellent mobility and some magic/range offensive capabilities as well. Weapons: Spears Type: Mana Join condition: NG+, quest 082 (requires finding Fairy Candlestick in Runic Forest Ruins - Ancient Ruins) Classes\u00a0: Resistances:Asmodeus / \u30a2\u30b9\u30e2\u30c7\u30a6\u30b9  Joins in second and later playthroughs if you turn EX-events On when starting a new game. While exporing the deep recesses of Yuidora Mine (\u30e6\u30a4\u30c9\u30e9\u9271\u8108), Wll encounters a powerful and evil entity, whose interest he piques after a battle. Asmodeus offers Wil knowledge, which he readily accepts in the form of lectures through her avatar summoned by special bracelet. Unbeknownst to Wil, Asmodeus was slowly corrupting him with lust. Fortunately, Melodiana and Elizasleyn were well aware of her plans and upon informing Wil, Wil and company set off to defeat Asmodeus. She becomes a companion shortly after. According to Asmodeus, she is a fallen seraphim, the highest rank of angel. Starting at level 80, Asmodeus is one of the most powerful companions you can get. She has no elemental weaknesses. While her stats are rather unremarkable for a level 80 and weapon skill is only \"A\", her skill set is one of the best in the game. Double Action is available upon joining the party, and her attack skills are not only powerful, but long-ranged as well (5 spaces). With massive HP, she can also tank if needed despite mediocre Con and Res. However, she has the worst Luck growth in the game. Like Mylen, her command cost is high, but worth the cost, although by the time you get her, you are probably powerful enough not to need her. Weapons: Hammers, Claws Type: Demon Join condition: NG+, quest 087 (guest), quest 090 (join) Classes\u00a0: Resistances:Eushully / \u30a8\u30a6\u30b7\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\uff08\u767d\u30a8\u30a6\u5a18\uff09  Joins in second and later playthroughs if you turn Eushully events On when starting a new game. Eushully is probably the best Eushully Angel overall. With good initial stats (even without the excellent Eushully Tiara) and decent movement, she is both a good melee and ranged fighter. She also has a short range magic omni attack as well. As with the other 3 Eushully characters, she wields a personalized weapon offering generous stat bonuses with the top tier weapon offering some off the highest bonuses in the game. Finally, Eushully-chan is an excellent store clerk. Her biggest drawback is her relatively high command cost. Weapons: Vacuums Type: Angel Join condition: Quest 093 Classes: Resistances:Black Eushully / \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30a8\u30a6\u30b7\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\uff08\u9ed2\u30a8\u30a6\u5a18\uff09  Joins in second and later playthroughs if you turn Eushully events On when starting a new game. Black Eushully is strictly a range fighter primarily using Omni-element attacks. Her initial stats are average apart from fairly high Int. Given her fairly low Con & HP, and no melee attack, her usefulness is limited due to the fact that other than the excellent Biaduece AOE, her other attacks only have a range of 2 until she reaches level 64. Like the other Eushully characters, she is equipped with the powerful Eushully Tiara and her weapons offer huge stat bonuses when fully leveled. Initially, she is best suited for situations where enemies are highly resistant to physical attacks, but susceptible to magic attacks. Once her level rises and she gains additional skills, she becomes a much better all around ranged fighter. Weapons: Kettles Type: Angel Join condition: Quest 094 Classes: Resistances:Anastasia / \u30a2\u30ca\u30b9\u30bf\u30b7\u30a2  Joins in second and later playthroughs if you turn Eushully events On when starting a new game. Anastasia is the weakest of the Eushully characters - both in terms of starting stats and skills. She also has the lowest service score as well. While she does have a ranged attack (default), it only has a range of 2 spaces. Windup Punch offers a low cost (and low stat boost) melee attack. She does have high Evade, but that isn't enough to offset low HP and Con against strong or multiple foes. Similar in character to Sharty and Lily, she lacks the Bloodsuck skills they both have. Other than Double Action (obtained at level 99) her skills are average at best. Cross-Counter is especially disappointing as it imposes a high Con penalty on a character that already is weak in that area - essentially rendering the skill useless against stronger foes. Anastasia does have high movement and relatively low command costs, but generally is best suited as a shop clerk or as as clean up fighter against weaker foes until her Con and HP level up enough for her to survive powerful attacks. It's worth noting that Anastasia is classified as Mana rather than Angel, so Angel's Guardian will not work for her. With Append 2.0, a max-stat Anastasia with Infini Bucket becomes one of the strongest and most versatile characters. Offensively, she hits 165 in both Str and Int, has 6-range Omni magic along with ranged and melee attacks, and sports a high crit chance to boot. Her 7 Mov is among the best, allowing her to clear a room full of enemies ahead of everyone else. Practically, however, Anastasia needs her artifact, at least one transmigration, and weapon grinding both to synthesize and to equip the Infini Bucket. Leguna (and Lily with a Railgun weapon) can fulfill a similar niche with much less grinding required. Weapons: Buckets Type: Mana Join condition: Quest 095 Classes: Resistances:Ms. Eukleia / \u30a8\u30a6\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u3093  Joins in second and later playthroughs if you turn Eushully events On when starting a new game. Shy and silent (she literally doesn't speak), she is the leader of the Eushully characters. Eukleia is the the best melee fighter of the Eushully group. Her stats are mostly average, but she has a high Str score. With the Eshully Tiara and massive Str boost from a fully leveled Eushully or Rail fan, even her normal attacks become quite powerful. Skills are decent, with Flower Bloom (and upgrades) being Death attacks. Flurry and Preemptive are also useful, if a bit mundane. She does have a decent ranged attack (Whirlwind Slash) as well, which retains the element of her weapon. While starting HP is decent, her Con & Res are relatively low. Together with average elemental (Earth, Ice, Fire & Wind) she can struggles a bit against elemental/magic range attacks. Also, she has the highest command costs of the four Eushully characters - one of the highest in the game and as high as Mylen Ploa. With that taken into consideration, she is simply not worth the expense compared to other characters in most cases unless Wil is at Meister or Magnus level. Weapons: Fans Type: Angel Join condition: Quest 096 Classes: Resistances:Roka Luscort / \u30ed\u30ab\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c8  Joins in third and later playthroughs after completing the events at Shipwreck Beach, only available in NG+ with the Party Members bonus on. She will always remain a Clone Unit and have no personal events. With average stats, average movement, unremarkable skills and pretty lousy resistances for a 3rd game character (lowest possible F- vs Dark while somehow Elizasleyn and Melodiana have an E resistance), she's outclassed by a number of other characters in the game. Her only redeeming point is that only she can equip the most powerful spear at 57 Str. With improved stats upon leveling up, she's a servicable fighter, but not much more than that... Weapons: Spears Type: Human Join condition: NG++, quest 109 completed in NG+, Clone Units active Classes: Resistances:Lyphia / \u30ea\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2  Character from \"Battle Goddess\" series, playable in Battle Goddess VERITA (\u6226\u5973\u795eVERITA). Full name: Imperial Princess Lyphia Irina Sylphya Marshrun of Mesofiru (\u30ea\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30a4\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca\u30fb\u30b7\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u30b7\u30eb\u30f3\u5e1d\u56fd\u306e\u7687\u5973\u306e\u30e1\u30bd\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb). Grandchild of Louie, Sylphya and K\u0101rian, and she's currently on mission to save her grandfather's deceased wife's soul. In Kamidori, she briefly joins in NG+, and after completing all her events in your NG+, she'll become usable in third and later playthroughs . You will hear rumors at the bar, regarding demonfolk, eventually leading up to the Ominous Portals dungeon. Completing that and all her followup events (hotsprings required) will let Lyphia and Evelyn join upon starting a new game. She will always remain a Clone Unit and will have no personal events. Despite being a \"demonfolk,\" Lyphia has some of the best if not the best Holy attacks in the game - Cross Ciel and Sacred Column. Together with no penalty against Dark attacks and high Int, she is easily one of the best choices against demon/Dark foes and does quite well even foes without strong magic resistance. Meteor Storm AOE is one of the better ranged AOE magic attacks. Lyphia has starting resistance to all but Holy and Dark attacks and a decent starting Res (MDef) stat as well. Her weakness is low starting HP combined with low Con (PDef) and little to no evade. Lyphia simply can not stand melee combat, and can be \"one-shoted\" until reaching higher levels if up against a strong foe despite good (and later very good) physical resistance. Like Evelyn, her resistance for all types other than Holy and Dark improve to S level upon reaching level 70. Relatively low Str means that while she does have a melee attack, it's negligable in effect. She is strictly a range fighter, and quite competent in that role against all but those highly resistant to Holy attacks. Weapons: Staves Type: Demonfolk Join condition: NG++, quest 108 completed in NG+, Clone Units active Classes: Resistances:Evelyn / \u30a8\u30f4\u30ea\u30fc\u30cc  As well as Lyphia, she's a character from \"Battle Goddess\" series, playable in Battle Goddess VERITA (\u6226\u5973\u795eVERITA). Originally she was one of ten \"Shinryou no Setsuma\" - Demon Gods (\u9b54\u795e), which were summoned by mage Buleard in order to defeat goddess Femirins and steal her powers. Her rank among summoned Demon Gods was fifth. Later, due to certain circumstances, she joined Mesofiru Empire, and now she's traveling with Lyphia. In Kamidori, she briefly joins in NG+, and after completing all her events in your NG+, she'll become usable in third (NG++) and later playthroughs. You will hear rumors at the bar regarding demonfolk, eventually leading up to the Ominous Portals dungeon. Completing that and all the followup events will let Evelyn and Lyphia join upon starting a new game. She will always remain a Clone Unit and will have no personal events. Her role is that of an \"older sister\" to Lyphia. With solid starting stats and good resistances which improve upon reaching level 70 to S for all types other than Holy and Dark, Evelyn is an efficient, if not spectacular, archer. The Swift skill is a plus, as is the Flurry while Riu Nehl is a fairly good long range (4 space) dark attack, and Cero Anfini provides a powerful, short range (2 spaces) omni attack. Still, she has relatively few skills even upon reaching high levels. Her main advantage over Crayl/Crayanne is her higher stats and resistances. With the right bow, Evelyn is a solid, if not spectacular, range fighter. Weapons: Bows Type: Devil Join condition: NG++, quest 108 completed in NG+, Clone Units active Classes: Resistances:Hannah - \u30cf\u30f3\u30ca  Joins in the Append Disk \u30cf\u30f3\u30ca\u3055\u3093\u306e\u5de1\u793c\u65c5\u884c\u8a18 (Hannah's Pilgrimage). Hanna is the priestess who runs the local church in Yuidora. She is very devout, pensive, and fairly quiet - though on occasion she will converse at length with Wil. As the story develops, her respect, along with a hidden, lustful affection despite her appearance (NG+), for Wil grows. In NG+ games, after spending a sufficient amount of money, Hanna will make a series of requests for Wil to complete. Once completed, Hannah joins the party. Hanna is a holy mage with both Holy based magic attack skills and some healing skills as well. She starts at level 1 with good stats (very good Int) apart from low Spd. Apart from a weak F against Dark attacks, her resistances are superior overall (B Phys, A+ for Earth/Ice/Fire/Wind, S+ for Holy) despite being human. Two things make Hannah a very good party member. First, as with Lilly she starts at level 1 with NO stat caps. Second, she has a very good personal staff for each element. The Mana staffs (Earth, Ice, Wind & Fire) magic attacks are excellent - all top (gold) level, long range attacks (5 spaces for Earth/Ice/Fire and 3 for Wind). While Holy and Dark staff attacks are lower level (Sunlight Burst and Hellfire Cage), they grant sizable Int bonuses, especially for non S or M level weapons (+18 and +22 respectively). Thus, even though her skills are limited to Holy attacks, Hannah can fight effectively against almost any foe. Hannah does have a few negative aspects. Her melee combat ability is very limited, and until she reaches high higher levels with access to Magic Resistance and Reflect (along with a high Res stat), she may have trouble against foes with ranged Dark Attacks. She also lacks an omni/null attack (at least initially). Weapons: Staves Type: Human Join condition: NG+, quest 113 Classes: Due to a mistake in translation, second English title is same as first one. Resistances:Lily / \u30ea\u30ea\u30a3  After completing the Extra Stories quest \"An Angel's Melancholy\" you will have the option to have Lily join your party upon starting a new game. Lily will always remain a \"Clone Unit\" and will have no events in the story. You will also be able to choose between her Girl, Teenager and Adult form which will change her appearance and sprite, but not stats. Lily is very similar to Sharty, but ultimately a much better character. Because she starts at level 1 with low stats, it takes quite a bit of careful leveling up before she is able to contribute meaningfully in combat. However, because she has no stat caps from the start, once her ability stats rise (especially if Marwen's Ring & Necklace are used), she becomes a very good support character, and a strong fighter at higher levels (lvl 50+). Her ability to use almost any weapon is very useful and allows her not only to have the best elemental weapon against a particular foe, but also to switch from melee to range fighter (bow or magic attack) with ease. Like Sharty, she does not have a lot of HP and thus relies, albeit to a lesser extent, upon Bloodsucking skills along with Evasion to withstand high damage or multiple attacks. Compared to Sharty, Lily has similar skills along with some other very useful skills such as Flurry, Hades Blast and Teleport. Another benefit is that she has one of the lowest command costs in the game. Overall, Lily is an excellent party member.

In addition, he has a fairly high base stat growth (aside from HP) without stat growth boost items, and as he starts at level 1 uncapped, he can become a strong offensive mage. Low health at higher levels makes him riskier than other mage choices if surrounded. If supported, however, Leguna can be an excellent mage, especially once he gets the powerful 9-range Judgment Lance at level 70. Also very notable is that his artifact can be obtained early and easily; it morphs from the Red Mantle and doesn't require any particularly rare materials, and once synthesized, turns him into a powerhouse, with several significant stat boosts and abilities (including Double Action).

It has excellent resistances to almost every element (immune to Ice & Earth, S+ to Fire, S for both Holy & Dark, A to Physical). Its only weakness is against Wind (E) which can be offset easily if needed with a Typhoon Necklace. On top of strong resistances, Stone Golem has massive HP, receiving +2-4 HP per level (+3-4 with Marwen's Ring or Necklace). Because there are no stat level caps from the start, it does not suffer from stat limitations like Aht (particularly resistance and luck). Stone Golem is also a good fighter as well due to its high strength. Skills are similar to Aht's, but Tremor replaces Rock Throw, and Iron Punch and a few other skills are replaced with with Intimidate skills.

A party of adventurers led by a Hero made their way to the Maou and challenged him directly. As they defeated the Maou, the Maou cursed that he would one day return and seek vengeance upon those who defied him, as he could never be fully destroyed. The Maou's last words clouded the hearts of the adventurers. They decided that rather than defeating the Maou and have everyone live in fear of his return someday, they would seal the Maou and have the sealed Maou be under constant watch. And thus, peace was restored to the land. However, the Maou's soul was able to escape at the very last moment, before the body was sealed up. The Maou had one Servant Demon left, one so young and weak she was completely useless in battle, and thus had been spared the fate of the rest of the Maou's army. The Maou will need all the help he can conjure up to help him regain his former body and glory. In the meantime, he's stuck with a temporary body weaker than an average human!Gameplay Overview  A trial version of the game is available. See Download page As the Maou, the player commands the Servant Demon Lily to explore a large dungeon. The dungeon is divided into stages, each of which spans a few dozen floors. As the game progresses, more units becomes available to the player. Certain captured enemy units may be bound into your service, while all may be sacrificed for mana. The flow of the game is typical of an SRPG, where the player and the AI take turns ordering their respective units around on the map. Either side may place certain map squares under their control, giving their side certain advantages. Depending on the player's actions in the game, Lily's alignment can change towards \"Law\" or \"Chaos\". The two meters can affect the ending of the game, and may or may not affect how certain characters react to the player. Lilly can also go through class changes: from a child-like body to a adolescent body to a mature body.Other Information Princess Capture Dungeon Meister Append Data Foreign Guide Sites Ordering  The following online stores ship this game overseas: A downloadable edition can be bought from DLSite Japan.Error Fix  Link: MEGA A patch that solves the \"Data is broken, please reinstall...\" error window which shows up about every 5 minutes after starting the game.

Exam has three parts: 1) close all chests except two that are located at the place where arena and bar are (northwest corner chest, south central chest), 2) kill the guy with the natural skill (gained through class changes or available from beginning, skills gained from clothes or weapons won't work) of the person you love most (person, whose H-scene you have seen already in this playthrough), 3) kill all slimes in a single turn (use Emelita's area spell)Q. How to pass Melodiana's test with chests?  A. You need to open two chests that are located at the same place as \u970a\u6094\u306e\u68ee and \u30e6\u30de\u6e56, and close two chests that are located at the same place as \u7d76\u58c1\u306e\u6559\u4f1a\u8de1 and \u8a00\u970a\u306e\u6a39\u8de1. (Close the two bottom chests and open the two top chests.)Q. Why do I get only HP/SP/FS on level ups?  A. When you level up, the game selects (via Random Number Generator and an invisible growth rate) which stats get increased. Growth rates vary depending on the character - for example, casters like Emiritta or Eliza tend to have high Magic growth and poor Physical growth, while pure physical characters, like Yuera, have high Physical, but low Magic growth. It's entirely possible for the generator to roll badly, giving you one stat increase (or on rare ocassion, no increases). In addition, characters have maximum values for their stats, which on the stats screen, are depicted by a grey bar. The character's natural growth via level-up (expressed as light blue bars) cannot exceed these values, though equipment (expressed as dark blue bars) may exceed these values. The maximum values increase as the character reaches new tiers, with the greatest increases around level 50. The maximum values for HP/SP/FS take quite a bit longer to reach then those for other stats, which is why they are the only thing that appear to increase. The exact value at which each stat maxes out differs for various charactersQ. Why event sign on \u89aa\u5b50\u9b54\u7363\u306e\u5de3 (LV22 free map in \u30c7\u30a3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30fc\u30eb\u4e18\u9675\u5730) does not activate when I step on it with my characters?  A. To activate this event, you need to allow \u30b0\u30fc\u30c6\u30cf\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9 (yellow dog monster) to come there. Just kill giants that block the passage and free the way for it.Q. In Chapter 5, a man is asking for 10,000 S. What I meant is, should I buy it and how is it required for the quest.  A. The payment is to get the man to search for possible things related to the shell you took from \u30e6\u30de\u6e56. This will be required to progress in the Parasukevasu quest line, and will get you a document from the northern lands containing a few recipes in the next chapter.Q. Quest N.73 in search for Gantz, the 30,000S Rich Merchant or the 5,000S Cute Merchant?  A. In Rogue's Den Stage to capture Gantz in the near future, choosing the 30,000S rich merchant will give the follow-up quest a level 30 requirement for Wil, as well as making the battle harder (8 rally flags instead of 5), but will also unlock 3 hidden items for Stage Missions clearance requirements (refer Stage>Limestone Caverns>Rogue's Den for info), including treasure items worth 60,000 total and a Ful's Mill. Choosing 5,000S Cute Merchant will not unlock the 3 hidden items, but nevertheless will be able to save S during that moment incase of urgency, and will also bring about an easier finish of the quest and no level requirements.Q.How do I finish Chapter 6?

A. Will must reach the enemy base to clear the objective. In addition, Will must not die.Q. What is the fourth objective in \u5922\u5e7b\u306e\u65ad\u5d16 in \u30df\u30b5\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb?  A. The objective is to secure exactly 60% of the map at the end of the battle. Due to the layout of the enemies, you'll have to let them take some of the territory and then have your troops move out to reach exactly 60%.  Updated now, you need hit 60% when you move out only. No need to escape as soon as you do.Q.How to complete the quest N.86?  I think Will need to be lvl 60 or more and this unlock a new dungeon. (Only in second playthrough) You need to also have recruited every character you can have in the first playthrough so you also need to be at chapter 8.Q.How to remove cursed weapons?  Simply go to the Church in Yuidora, select the uncurse tab and select the character you want to unequip the cursed item. Alternatively, the Church also sell a consumable item that can uncurse (forgot the name)Level-up and farming  During a level-up, a roll is made for each stat to see if it gets an increase; the chance for a stat increase depends on the stat and the character in question - for example, Yuela has higher chance for Strength and lower chance for Intelligence, while Emelita has it the other way around. It is possible to get many stat bonuses in a single level-up; it is possible to get none. Unlike Himegari, Kamidori has an anti-save-scumming mechanism to prevent cheating on level-up rolls; however, it is easily bypassed. Level-up bonuses are dependent on random seed that is re-generated in the beginning of every turn. In other words, if you save and get a level-up in the same turn, the results will be the same if you load and try again. Enemy turn is considered part of the player's turn before it - if a character levels up after defending from an attack, it will have the same effect as a level-up during that turn. As such, a general save-scumming scenario would be like this: Item drops from monsters and items harvested after leaving location are determined in the same way, so the farming scenario works for them as well.Script for Automated Levelling Up God Catching Alchemy Meister:Autolevel Script  Note: The preface to the autolevel script below was written by the author of the script and contains an error about the save scumming mechanism. See level-up & save scumming section of this page. If you played Himegari, you may remember save scumming for better stats at every level up. Here in Kamidori, the mechanics are different to keep you from doing that (quite aside from the stat caps)- the simple load/attack repetition will always yield the same stat increases. I have found that if you save on the main map with a character ready to level, you can still save scum for stats- it just takes more clicks. This makes the process even more suitable for scripting; the process being longer, running through it manually each time is even more of a pain in the ass. I submit the following autolevel script for your amusement and benefit.Before using this script  First things first, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. When making this script, I realized that deleting all your save games would take a script about five seconds and you wouldn't be able to stop it (unless it contained a hotkey to stop- and what malicious programmer would include one of those?). This realization scared me, so I'm issuing this warning. BACK UP YOUR SAVES. Do it before using any new version of a script.Preparation for running  This script uses AutoIt3, much like Andy Scull's Himegari Autolevel Script. So, go ahead and install AutoIt3 (http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/). Next you'll need my script, link below. Then there's using it. Run the script (you'll know it's running by the AutoIt icon in the system tray) and select the Kamidori window. Oh, yes. Before actually running it, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. What it needs to work is a save in any slot of the active save page. This save should be at the Yuidora city map (For faster initialization, start the script from this location). The character you want to level needs to be close to level-up- specifically, she should level up the next time you attack a bat from the first map of the game.Directing the script  The script has four control buttons: F6 through F9. F6 pulls up a window with the settings. F7 will pause and unpause the script (only useful when the script is running, really). F8 will start the script- it will level your character over and over, saving the best level up in the selected slot. The best level up is the one with the highest score; the score is the increase in each stat multiplied by the associated Scoring Value, all added up. Press F8 again to stop the script and load your best save. F9 will exit the script. I made a major assumption in writing this script: I assume that the first map of the game (\u5de5\u5320\u4f1a\u8a66\u9a13\u5730\u533a) is always THE FIRST NON-FREE map in the mine. If this assumption is not true at any point in the game, then this script will not work at those points. Also, my script uses a lot of pixel color tests. Andy Scull points out below that some colors need to be tuned to the system the script runs on. This is not available right now.Output  The script will keep running until you stop it with F8. After every levelup, a tray tip will pop up with the lastest info. It shows the high score and high stats, and the last score and last stats. You'll probably be most interested in the stats. Those stat numbers are the increases in each stat, in order: HP, MP, FS - Physical attack and defense - Magic attack and defense - Agility and Luck. The script will save the best run in the set save slot of the active save page. When you stop the script (F8), copy that save game someplace safe. If you start the script again, it will overwrite it.The Script  One last time before I give this to you: BACK UP YOUR SAVES. http://bayfiles.com/file/3NB1/H41ekA/kamidori_v1.0.au3Another Autolevel Script  I consider my script to be a little more usable... It can - As with any autoit script, you may need to tune some colors to your systems. For example, color for levelup marks (glowing blue) could be 0xC1EBEE on one computer and 0xC1EBED on another. So, some programming (or common) sense is required to use it. Link on my userpage - http://eushully.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Andy_ScullQ. Where to easily level up from 40 - 75?  A. Deadbeat Dungeon (Deadbeat God) first equip your lowest possible equipment for your characters and be sure to have range attack which are either phisical water, wind or fire... Then just keep hitting The puttetto King even with just 1 damage you get 40 XP till you get to level 74. Equiping Training Bracelet along with Marwen's Necklace is a good way to maximize xp gained this way. If possible, attack with range 3 or longer abilities. If you do it correctly, you can train multiple characters at once (range 5, 4 abilities). For characters that require range 2, make sure to equip a Sanctified Necklace if they have low resistance to holy attacks. Remember not to kill it untill all your desired characters reach level 75 before you end its life. Up to level 80, attacks still give you 30 XP. As this is more XP than you get normally from killing most monsters, you can consider leaving the Puttetto King alive until level 80. After level 80, attacks give you 20 XP (~1 normal enemy)Q. How can I complete excessively grindy quests such as \"Mass Produce Medicine\" before they expire?  A. Do not start the quest, if you have started it already, reload a save from just before accepting/starting the quest. The quest timer starts the moment you accept it, as long as you are aware of this you can grind up all the materials needed to finish the quest before accepting it, only then should you begin and immediately complete said quests.God Catching Alchemy Meister:Stages Full Stages Stages basics  Each location on global map can contain several stages, that are unlocked as you gather/complete quests or progress further into the story. Some maps are restricted to specific story lines, while others are Free Maps, which do not have any bearing on the story. The character and map type is noted under Type. You can replay most maps as many times as you want to gather items/resources. Maps that are not replayable are those with no global location and those with no home base available. Each stage has several spots where you can get resources. Gathering spots are shown when they are in a zone of moving of any character, mining spots only shown if they are in a zone of moving of characters that have Mining skill. The levels of enemies in stages are the average level of your 5 highest level characters that are not at working at your shop. Enemies have a minimum level of the stage level and a maximum level of the stage level +10, there are some exceptions. The enemy level cap can be removed on a second and subsequent playthroughs. Experience rewarded for fighting is determined by the level difference of the combatants and the base level and exp rewarded of the enemy. The base stats of enemies can be viewed in the monster information tab in the information screen. Most stages have whirlpools that spawn monsters after a specified amount of time. In tables this is shown as Q1+Loc1(T1)+Loc2(xT2). Q1 - starting amount of monsters when you enter the map. If several types of monsters spawn from the same portal, then this value can be different each time when you start battle. This is shown in the table as 0.5 for monsters sharing single portal, 0.25 for monsters sharing 2 portals, 0125 for 3 portal. Loc1, Loc2 - describe location of portals, for easier identifying (w - west, s - south, c - central, ne - north east). T1 - amount of time before monster spawns from the portal (only once for battle, notice that there is no \"x\" before T1). xT2 - amount of time, before monster spawns from this portal. You get new monster each T2 turn (exception is turn 1 that is treated as turn 0). Examples: 1. Scorching Caves (Rosean Mountains): Hellhound: 3.25+ne(x4)+s(x3) Labrador: 0.25+ne(x4)+s(x3) Means: when you start battle you can see 3 \"Hellhound\" and there will be 2 \"Hellhound\" or \"Labrador\" standing on two whirlpools located in the ne and s parts of the map. At turns 3, 6, 9, ... south whirlpool and at turns 4, 8, 12, 16, ... northeast whirlpool will spawn any of those two monsters 2. Training Ground (Yuidora Mine) Rocktoise: nw(15) Means: when you start battle nw whirlpool will be empty, but in 15 turns it will spawn \"Rocktoise\", but won't spawn it again at turn 30. 3. Troll's Lair (Dijenel Borderland) Troll: 4.125+w(x2)+e(x2)+c(x2) Cave Troll: 0.25+w(x2)+e(x2) Glou Troll: 0.5+c(x2) Means: .125 means that this monsters shares three whirlpools with other monsters. So the result is - when we start battle we see 4 \"Troll\" and have 3 whirlpools with any of those three giants on top of them. At turns 2, 4, 6, 8, ... new giants will spawn - \"Troll\" or \"Cave Troll\" on west and east whirlpools and \"Troll\" or \"Glou Troll\" on central whirlpoolYuidora Mine - EX Map (\u30e6\u30a4\u30c9\u30e9\u9271\u8108-EX) (1 day)  Note: * Ogre only appears the first time this map is explored.Runic Forest Ruins (\u8a00\u970a\u306e\u6a39\u8de1) (2 days)  Note: * You can get Fairy Candlestick only on second playthrough if you turned Ex-events on (it leads a way to Phinilly's place)Yuma Lake (\u30e6\u30de\u6e56) (3 days)  Note: * Treasure Putetto is not always present on the map.

It appears if and only if all other portals on the map are sealed by the end of turn 19.Chaotic Warground (\u7a2e\u306e\u6b7b\u95d8\u5730) (5 days)  Note: *4.0625 - this weird number means that when you start a battle there are 4 \"Kankuri\" monsters in the middle of the room, and there are 0-4 of them on whirlpools around north (nww and nwe) and east (sen and ses) walls. The rest of whirlpools are taken by one of the other 4 monsters (Sand Kankuri, Frozen Kankuri, Flame Kankuri, Static Kankuri). Note: ** Ebony Pearl can be found only at second and later playthroughs if you turned Ex-events on when starting a game. Note: *** Treasure Putetto escapes after 1 round.Garden Ruins (\u78a7\u738b\u306e\u5ead\u5712\u907a\u8de1\u7fa4) (4 days)  Note: *The Stynia chest only appears on a subsequent visit.Additional maps  You can visit them only once during a playthrough, so all items you leave there are missed until you start from the beginning again.Princess Hunting Dungeon Meister:Characters  For detailed info on unit stats and recruitment, see Princess Hunting Dungeon Meister:Units.Main Characters Euclid Kingdom Dungeon Dwellers Others Princess Hunting Dungeon Meister:Growth and Personality  When you are in the H menu (\u80b2\u6210) there will be three rows. The top row's requirements are generally just having more growth. The second row requires growth in addition to having high law. The third row requires high chaos in addition to growth. There are some exceptions, but is a pretty good rule of thumb. This is in addition to any items that are required. At least one of the items needs to be created, so don't neglect your crafting skill too much. Notes:Growth Girl (Shojo)  Training options (H Magic with Lily) become available when Lily reaches level 3. Options listed in vertical order, from left to right.Tsundere Adolescent Lily (\u30c4\u30f3\u30c7\u30ec\u601d\u6625\u671f\u308a\u308a\uff72\uff09 Requirement Changes from Girl Lily Training Menu  \u2666Only at second and third time.Adult Requirement Changes from Tsundere Adolescent Lily Training Menu  \u2666Only from second time.Personality  H actions and generally being nice would increase Lily's \"Law\" score (positive personality), whereas sacrificing enemies or being mean would increase \"Chaos\" (negative personality).Maintaining LAW Points Princess Hunting Dungeon Meister:Units Unique Characters Overview The Gals  in general order of appearance This is for unit information. For route info, see Princess Hunting Dungeon Meister:RoutesMaid Angels  There are 4 Maid Angels and they would appear randomly in Card encounters. You can ask them to join the battle (\u5171\u306b\u6226\u3048). Initially they will only join for that particular stage. However, after finishing the game once and starting a new game, asking each angel to fight with you a total of three times will result in them joining you permanently the next time (the \"total of three times\" is per angel, and carries over from the first playthrough). Even after they have joined your army, they will still have a chance to appear during Random Card encounters. When each Maid Angel join you permanently, they will bring along their items: In the third playthrough, you may ask them just one time, then they give you the items and its character. (2 times less compared to the second playthrough)All Units Summary Detailed initial stats God Catching Alchemy Meister:Workshop Full Workshop Overview  There are four basic areas in your Home, and each one has stats which can be modified by placing furniture in them. Some furniture can go in any non-Yard area and can trigger various character events.Store  To assign your characters as shop keepers, go to your home and enter the Party Menu. Select the character and click the \"Manage Shop\" button below the character select portion. The character will no longer be allowed to enter a dungeon so long as they are managing the shop. A character's ability to sell items in the shop is dependent on the \"Serv\" stat. Yuela has the lowest with a value of 4; however, equiping her with her strongest weapon (Kitchen Knife) and strongest Character specific accessory (Eastern Pin) gives her +30 to Service. If you don't put anyone in, the default shop keeper will act as your salesperson.God Catching Alchemy Meister:Gameplay Battle phase  During any one character's turn, (enemy or yours) all the hit chances, crit chances, skill proc chances are all fixed on that turn. You can check by re-loading a save and fighting the same enemy with the same a character repeatedly. Results will not differ. - It is indeed differ if you load, fight another battle and then redo the battle that you messed up.Leadership  Before starting a battle you can select a number of characters for immediate deployment (depending on the size of the area - maximum 9 at once) and can deploy further characters from the Base Camp and any Rally Points you control while on the map. However, with the exception of Will himself, each unit costs a certain amount of Command Points to maintain - if this number is exceeded at any point, all units will expend three times the FS per square until the number falls below the cap, which will drain each character very easily. This cap is dependent on Will's level within the Alchemy Guild, so if you find you cannot reasonably field everyone you want, you can end the current chapter to raise your Leadership cap. Your allies each have their own amount of Leadership required to deploy, dependent on their class. This number can be viewed on his or her Status screen, under Command. Example of required CP (for default classes of characters)\u00a0:Area skills  Some characters (starting with Emelita) and enemies have area-of-effect skills which, while able to affect several enemies at once, give reduced experience gain. These are denoted by the letter M in the skill name and \"\u7bc4\u56f2\" characters on the skill icon in Japanese, and a symbol depending on area of effect (circle, triangle, line, or \u51f8 symbol) in the skill name and \"Area\" on the icon in English - for example, Emelita's \"\u30a4\u30aa\uff1d\u30eb\u30fc\u30f3\uff2d\"\u00a0/ \"\u25ef Io Rune\" and Suina's\u00a0\u5927\u6d77\u562fM\u00a0/ \"\u51f8 Huge Tsunami\". You can see the area of effect in the Information Menu, under Skill List. To use them, select the character, click on him or her, and a menu will appear showing what area skills they have available. Once selected, you need to choose where to aim the skill. A targeting indicator will help you decide where to place the skill, showing the area of effect where the skill will land. Be warned, however, most such skills attack both allies and enemies, so aim carefully! Finally, every area skill has a cooldown period (3 to 5 turns), during which the character cannot use any area skills.Gathering, mining, search, unlock  All units can see and claim Harvest points, but only units that have the skill Mine (\u767a\u6398) can see and claim Mining points. At first only Wilfred has this skill, but other characters who join later also have the ability or can learn it from clothing. The accessory Mining Bracelet (\u767a\u6398\u306e\u8155\u8f2a) also grants this skill. To detect hidden rooms, the Search skill (\u63a2\u7d22) is necessary. As before, Wil is the only one of the four leads who has it initially, but other characters can learn or have it from the beginning. The accessory Hermit's Monocle (\u91ce\u4f0f\u306e\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd) can grant this ability to its holder. A few hidden rooms are not available in this manner - generally, they may be sealed for a certain number of turns or require an event to take place during the battle. To unlock chests and doors, the Lockpick skill (\u958b\u9320) is necessary. Later on, you will discover doors that are locked with bronze, silver or gold keys. Recipes for those keys will be available later in the game. After you craft them, you will be able to unlock those doors with characters that have these skills. The accessory Master Key (\u76d7\u8cca\u306e\u5408\u9375) grants this skill, and the consumable item Door Stone (\u958b\u9320\u306e\u5275\u77f3) will serve in a pinch. Wilfred comes with a special skill (Adventurer) that gives him all 3 of the above skills at the same time while taking only one skill slot. There also is the Thief skill, which grants Search and Lockpick.Location stars  Each battle location can have from 1 to 4 extra tasks which are rewarded additionally. First task is\u00a0always to conquer 100% of the territory (rewarded with money), second is to clear the stage (not available on Free maps, and rewarded with Evaluation), and third and fourth are different on every map and may involve, for example, killing all enemies, sealing all whirlpools, capturing all deployment gates, or encountering and killing a rare enemy, and give you items completing them. All those tasks are hidden\u00a0at first, but you can unlock them if you finish first one (conquer 100% of the territory). One of 2.0 NG+ options reveals all extra conditions.Weapon skill  When fighting, characters gain experience in weapon handling. Minimal mastery level is F, and initial characters start with that, while those who join later may start with higher mastery. Current value can be seen in the status screen available through Party menu. S or M mastery is required to equip some higher level weapons; other than that, it has no effect on gameplay. In every combat encounter the character gains \"weapon experience\" equal to their current level (1-99). Experience gained is independent from enemy's level or number of attacks, or whether the \u00a0enemy was defeated or not. Both basic attacks, special attacks, magic, and AoE skills all grant weapon experience (although AoE only gives as much as a single encounter, regardless of number of enemies it hits); experience is not gained if the character is defending or has no weapon equipped, or if the enemy has Perfect Focus. Required experience between levels is as follows:\n E \u2192 D: 3000\n D \u2192 C: 6000\n C \u2192 B: 10000\n B \u2192 A: 15000\n A \u2192 S: 21000\n S \u2192 M: 30000Terrain types  There are several types of terrain, which have different FS cost and elemental affinity, and sometimes require certain skill to move through. Here is the complete list:Monster level  Levels of the enemies you encounter on location maps are the average level of your 5 highest level characters that are not at work at your shop. Enemies have a minimum level of the stage level and a maximum level of the stage level+10; also, it cannot be lower than the monster's base level. Upper cap can be removed on a second and subsequent playthroughs with corresponding option on game start.Engagements  To engage an enemy you need a ranged attack that can reach them (a diagonal square counts as 2 range) or to be able to walk unto their square (which requires sufficient move and that each square between you and the enemy is controlled by your side, denoted by being blue for Wil, colorless for monsters, and other colors for other factions). When an engagement occurs both combatants take turns hitting each other (see below). However, a ranged attack can only be retaliated to with a ranged attack, and a melee attack can only be retaliated to with a melee attack. A melee attacker can avoid retaliation by attacking someone who has only ranged attacks. A ranged attacker can avoid retaliation by attacking from superior range, or attacking an enemy which only has a melee attack. If a combatant does not have enough SP for performing an attack (ranged or melee) then they cannot retaliate. You may optionally choose to defend, which forgoes retaliation in order to reduce the damage you take.Number of attacks  The number of attacks each combatant performs during an engagement depends on the difference in speed between attacker and defender. General pattern is the following:\n 1) Attacker\n 2) Defender\n 3) Unit with higher speed (attacker if equal)\n 4) Unit with lower speed (defender if equal)\n 5) Unit with higher speed (if there is at least 3 Speed difference) Certain skills may change this layout if they trigger: Preemptive switches attacker and defender around, Intimidate denies all opponent's attacks, and Flurry, Counterattack and Vorpal Counter add extra attacks. As you can see, if you engage an enemy with higher speed, it gets two counterattacks after your first attack, so be careful if you fight faster enemies. Many weapons and some skills sacrifice speed for more damage, which is useful when speed difference is high enough (since the attack rate remains unaffected); however, sometimes delivering an extra attack (or denying the enemy's extra attack) is worth sacrificing some damage.Elements  Any attack has one of eight elements: Physical,\u00a0Earth,\u00a0Wind,\u00a0Fire, Ice, Holy, Dark, and Omni. Generally, Fire > Wind > Earth > Ice > Fire, while Holy > Dark > Holy. Some enemies are resistant to Physical attacks (ghost types and a few Earth-based creatures), but no enemies are weak to it. Omni deals 100% damage to everything, meaning that there are no penalties but no bonuses either; as such, it does not appear in a unit's resistance list.Hits & Damage  Every attack, be it a spell or a weapon, has a Hit value. Every creature has an Evd (evasion) value. The chance to hit with an attack equals (Attacker's Hit - Defender's Evade). If an attack is evaded, it deals no damage. The chance to hit cannot go above 100% or below 0%. Focus, Evasive and Undress skills can modify this value; they are applied after the cap, so if you have Evasive II (+15 to Evade), you chance to be hit will never go above 85% unless the enemy has Focus. Guardian and Cover skills can trigger a guaranteed miss when they activate. Every attack is either a weapon attack or a magic attack. Weapon attacks use Strength for damage and Constitution for defense; Magic attacks use Intelligence and Resistance respectively. The stats are further modified by items and skills (which can give both flat and percentage bonuses and penalties); defender's resistance to the\u00a0attack\u00a0element also matters. Damage from a successful attack is calculated as (Dmg * elemental multiplier - Def). Minimum damage per attack is 1 HP, unless the defender absorbs the attack element\u00a0(see below). It is important to check the target's status before attacking: if it is resistant to your attack element, or has high defense from your attack type (weapon or magic), attacking it may be a waste of time. Sometimes even vulnerability to the element may be outweighed by sheer Con/Res, making the attack ineffective.Resistance  Most characters or monsters have a set of weaknesses or strengths. Those act as a multiplier to your attack score in battle. If you use a weapon that exploits enemy weakness, attack on the screen before battle will be displayed in blue. If you use a weapon with an element that enemy is resistant to, attack is displayed in red. If enemy absorb (it heals them) this element's attacks damage is displayed in green and if enemy does not have any weakness or strength to this element, damage will be white. Damage is further decreased by enemy's defense stat. Because defense is applied after resistance, it becomes possible to kill monsters that have defense higher than character's attack by equipping right weapon to exploit enemy element weakness. Clothes or enemies can have Physical, Earth, Water, Fire, Lightning, Holy, Dark resistances/weakness. Resistance value can vary from -5 (very weak) to 6 (absorb). Some weapons have no element affinity (Physical is also an element) so they always have 100% attack against any type of armor. Resistances can be increased by inserting some jewels into clothes of 4 main characters (each jewel increases resistance value by 1), unlocking resistance slots on some clothes (each resistance slot unlocked increases value by 1) or wearing resistance amulets. There are two types of resistance amulets - common (like \u571f\u7cbe\u306e\u9996\u98fe\u308a - Gnome Necklace, increases value of earth resistance by 2), that you can craft after getting a recipe for them, and mutated (like \u77f3\u59eb\u306e\u9996\u98fe\u308a - \"Stone queen necklace\", increases value of earth resistance by 3), that you can get if you try to make common one, but mutation triggers.Critical hits  Critical hit doubles the damage after defense calculations have been applied. The chance to do critical hit mostly depends on the difference in attacker's and defender's luck. Basic chance to do critical hit is the difference of those two parameters, but when the result is negative, it becomes equal to 0 instead. After basic chance is calculated bonuses from weapons or used magic skills/killing blows are added at the same moment. So if basic chance was 0, bonus from weapon was -2 and used killing blow had a bonus of +5, resulting chance will be +3. It can be seen, that even character or monster with low luck can do critical hits, if he uses a good weapon, or skill.Combo attacks  Through certain story events, some (rather far!) enhancement slots on clothes, or just by (relative) default, characters can learn special Unison Attacks (in story events, these are paired; various solo ones exist on the enhancement grid). To use one, equip the ability on the character initiating the attack. Then, set up the second character so that they are standing within one space of where the attack will be executed (e.g. right next to each other for ranged attacks, next to the monster for melee). Then they can be used just like any other skill! Unison Attacks are generally far more powerful than the one attacker and leaves the second free for additional damage (or even another Unison with the same character); however, Unison Attacks drain the SP of both characters in the unison, so mind both totals before setting up for an attack.XP gain  Experience is gained from both killing and just attacking enemies - obviously, the former grants more XP than the latter. Exact amount of experience from an encounter depends on the following factors: the character's current level, the monster's base level (as noted in its dictionary entry), and the monster's base Experience (as noted in the same entry). AoE attacks give half the XP they normally would. Clothing enchanted by Demeter's Gem increases XP gain by a percentage.Workshop Stars  Your party members and guests can be seen in the appropriate rooms in your workshop. If they have a red star star above their head then it means you can trigger an event (dialog, quest, etc) by clicking on them.Shop  Workshop is your most valuable source of income and equipment. Before leaving on adventure it is usefull to make some items and put them on sale. To make items you need to enter the Workshop/Alchemy and choose which and how many items you need. Items that have blue sign near their name have not been produced yet. When you make first prototype, you gain 10 reputation points, each next item will give you only 1 point. To sell items you need to enter Workshop\\Sales and choose which items you want to sell. Remember that you can select only as many items in one stack as your workshop capacity allows (parameter Stock in Store section of workshop). It can be increased with additional furniture. The price to sell items will be raised if you have parameter Prices in Store section of workshop more than 100%. But even if you put a lot of items on sale it does not mean that they all will be sold when you come back. To get customers and to make them buy your items you need to put some of your character to sell those items (the NPC clerk will work fine, but she isn't as efficent as most characters). His or her Service rating largely influences the selling rate. To put a character into a shop you need to enter the Party menu, select the character you wish to leave in a shop (s/he won't be able to participate in battles) and press Manage Shop under characters list. The Room's Clerk rating is the cap of how many can be clerks at one time. The chance of a clerk successfully selling an item to any given customer is found by the following formula: sale rate = (Service + Sales(c) / 20) * Sales(w) Sales(c) refer to the statistic Sales of the clerk, Sales(w) is the parameter Sales in Store section of workshop. Note that the \"Sales(c) / 20\" is rounded down to the nearest whole number and the final multiplication by Sales(w) is rounded down to the nearest percent. The maximum sale rate is 100% (There is no more effect if the sale rate exceeds 100%). It bears notice that while the items for sale do not affect the sale rate, customers prefer some items over others. The number of customers that come to your shop when you leave your workshop is equal to: (Attract * Nclerks * Ndays) rounded down (minimum 1 if Ndays>0) Nclerks is the number of clerks assigned to the shop, Ndays is the number of days since \"Last Settlement\". Each customer will randomly choose one clerk to serve him.Upkeep  Going to a battle always cost some time - the further you need to go, the more time will be spent away from workshop. Going to any map in Mines cost 1 day, in Forest or Lake - 2 days. It will cost you 2 days to go to forest, even if you just left it and decided to enter it again. Each day you need to pay for your rank in artisan guild (5 gold for each guild rank), upkeep for your workshop (summary for all four workshop parts) and living expences (4 gold for each character). You can gain money by selling things you produced in your workshop, completing first star task on different maps (only one time reward), finishing quests (also only one time reward), winning arena battles or selling things in temple (they are sold much cheaper than in your workshop, but if you have a lot of extra reagents, that can't be sold in a shop and need urgent money, this also can be used. There are also a number of items that are meant only for selling through this method, such as bags of gold coin). You pay all fees and gain rewards for completed quests when you come back to workshop. After gathering 30 or more days away from workshop you are automatically returned to town and can't leave it until you pay your fees. Should you be unable to pay your fees, you are given a one-time funding from the Guild of 10000 Santoeril. If you are unable to pay your fees afterwards, you get an automatic Game Over. Ideally, one should keep a buffer of funds just in case things don't sell and you can't sell anything decent to Hannah.Clothes  It is possible to upgrade clothes that main characters (Wilfred, Yuera, Emiritta, Seravaruwi) wear. Both enhancement and changing of clothes can only be done in the atelier. To do this you need to enter Workshop/Enhance. Each armor have a unique grid where you can buy squares to unlock additional properties to it. Skills are unlocked automatically when the square next to it is purchased. The price to unlock squares increases with the number of squares already unlocked, as well as how far it is to the next upgrade, so it is beneficial to unlock side paths whenever you can and travel the entire distance before moving on through the main line. To unlock additional clothes for your characters you need to complete certain requirements. For example, second set of clothes for your female characters can be unlocked by making friends with different elemental spirits (earth spirit Aht - get her into party, level her, watch event; water spirit Suina - get her into party, level her, watch event in workshop; wood spirit Crayl - get him into party). Most of other clothes for female characters are unlocked by completing quests for additional characters. Append outfits (like Yuela's Gothic Doll) may be available immediately, but require items which may take a long while to obtain. After unlocking any square on character's clothing you gain only one of two or three parameters that are assisted by this square. If you don't like the one, you can change it by clicking on a square, deactivating parameter you don't like and activating another one. This way it is possible to fine tune you armor exchanging defense for attack or evasion for accuracy. Some squares unlock ability to add jewel orbs to armor. Completing the game and running a Clear Data does a few things to clothing. Any unlocked Orb square opens up two slots instead of one, and a second parameter is available to use. Completing the game a second time will open up all three parameters.Upgrading workshop  Each of the four areas of your atelier can be upgraded, increasing their parameters. For the workshop and shop, upgrading them are requirements to rank up as an Alchemist. Pressing Remodel in the upper right of the atelier screen will switch to an upgrade area. Highlighting the area's name will show you how much Santoeril and material you need to upgrade the area to its next level, while clicking on the blue squares scattered around each area allows you to place furniture related to the area (for example, stock shelves in the shop and a hot spring in the yard).Princess Hunting Dungeon Meister:Routes  There are a total of 15 different endings.

You can browse through pages of save slots through the left and right arrows on the screen or your keyboard, or jump to any specific page via the shortcuts on the bottom of the screen (next to 195 is the \"auto\" page).

Enhancing costs money - the more upgrades you've bought, the more expensive next one will be. Another factor that increases price if how far the chosen upgrade slot is from last bought one (which is marked by the character's icon). Skill slots (marked by stars) don't cost anything - they are unlocked when you buy any of the upgrades next to it. When a skill is unlocked, it goes to the character's Skills tab, and can be activated from there. Unequipping the armor does not remove the skill. Some enhancements require items as well as money: Magic Stone and Rainbow Thread for Divine Gem slots, Brown/Blue/Red/Green/White/Black String for extra elemental resistances, and Fabric Treatments for HP bonuses. Here, Fabric Treatments will be referred to as \"Fabric Treatment Lv. #\" instead of their item names to simplify things. Most upgrade slots give you a choice between two (sometimes three) stats to increase. On first playthrough, you are limited to one option. On second playthrough, you can choose 2 of the options. On third and later playthroughs, you can choose 3 (i.e. all) of the options.Armor H-scenes  Additional H-scenes can be acquired by upgrading the heroines' armors.

Native skills come from achieving new ranks, and enhancing clothes. Non-native ones come from equipments. There's no benefit from overlapping of non-native with native, eg when Wil know Burrow and cost 3 CP to equip it, wearing an accessory with Burrow skill doesn't help in defray the cost, or anything else.Artifact Specials  Incorrectly listed as Wind Blessing in the skill description.\n Not present in the skill description.\n Incorrectly listed as Wind Blessing in the skill description.\n Incorrectly listed as Hyper Regeneration in the skill description.\n Incorrectly listed as Search in the skill description.Special Attacks  Ultra Cat Punch: Bonus chosen randomly from +3 Str, +20 Str, or -99 Str.\n Omega Cat Punch: Bonus chosen randomly from +5 Str, +30 Str, or -99 Str.God Catching Alchemy Meister:Enemies (Full) Monsters  This page is for monster info in a game with all the expansions (appends 1 & 2 and v2 patch).

If you need to find which monster drops specified item, use CTRL+F and search for item name. Only global location names are displayed, not stages. To find name of the stage, look for monster name in a game after choosing global location, if there are none, search for\u00a0??? marks in a list. If monster is not found in the list and there are no more\u00a0???, it can mean that there will be new stages in that location or monster is special (you can see him only once or twice according to events). Notice, how The Reaper is displayed in several lines (168, 169, 170), yet it does not appear in \"Stage monsters\" list in the game. Experience you get when killing monsters depends on base monster level (LV) and base exp (XP) for that monster. For details on XP gain, refer to Gameplay#XP gain. Drop items enclosed in asterisks (*Drop name*) denote rare drops (when you get one, it is displayed in gold popup window).\nNOTE: Weapons can't be dropped until you got someone being able to use it (ex:Bagre Eyeball). Character accessories (e.g. Revival Bracelet) can't be dropped until you get the corresponding character.

Try out tons of jobs, and switch back and forth at the drop of a hat! By completing quests, jumping into combat or playing fun mini-games, you will level up your job. As you gain levels, you will begin to unlock exciting new abilities, quests, weapons and even cooler job outfits.The maximum of a job's level is 20 (level 4 if you are not a member for most jobs).List of Jobs  Jobs generally fall under three classifications. Freestyle jobs are, for the most part, quest driven jobs. Experience is gained by completing quests, playing mini-games, or exploring. Crafting jobs allow you to create items using ingredients bought from vendors or harvested in the world. Experience is gained by completing job specific quests and playing Mini-Games . Combat jobs will allow you to battle with some of the less friendly inhabitants of the world. Experience is gained by completing job specific quests and by battling in combat instances in the wilds and in dungeons. Combat jobs also spend Stars to improve their abilities.Combat Crafting Freestyle Unlocking Jobs  To gain access to a profession, you must first unlock the job. Most jobs unlock by simply talking to a basic trainer for that profession. Most jobs have multiple basic trainers in locations all over the world. Some jobs, such as Postman, have an introduction quest that is given to you by interacting with an object (ie. postboxes), which will then lead you to the trainer. Most jobs cannot be unlocked until meeting a requirement (experiencing another job type first or having a membership after level 4). Since the Sunstone Valley expansion was released, the Blacksmith, Brawler, and Miner job levels have been increased to 20. A few objects (mostly Mini-Games ) within the world will activate a quest if you have not already unlocked the job associated with it. The quest will direct you to the nearest trainer that unlocks that job.Job Statistics  Job Statistics effect how a character performs in some of the job related mini-games. Stats can be increased as a job's level increases or through related clothing, weapons, tools, accessories, and shards that have stat bonuses. Any job related items that have a bonus will be shown at the bottom of the item's tool tip. Job Statistics can be found in the \"About Me\" section of the Job window.Combat Stats  Health: Increases the maximum amount health points\n Energy: Increases the maximum amount of energy available for abilities\n Attack: Increases the amount of damage inflicted when attacking\n Defense: Decreases the amount of damage received when attackedMatching (Harvesting) Stats  Matcher's Timing: Slows game timer during \"match 3\" mini-games\n Matcher's Skill: Increases chances of matching tiles spawning alongside each other during \"match 3\" mini-games\n Matcher's Advantage: Increases chances of special tiles will spawning during \"match 3\" mini-gamesMaking (Crafting) Stats  Maker's Reach: Increases smashing radius during cooking mini-game\n Maker's Speed: Increases chopping speed during cooking mini-game\n Maker's Sense: Decreases the speed of moving meat during cooking mini-gameSee Also References Brawler  Brawler is a combat job, specializing in close combat utilizing blunt weapons like hammers.

Each main category is then divided into several subcategories. An alternate means of categorizing locations is to divide them according to size or significance. This approach was taken with the Off the Atlas division of Locales and Places of Interest.Adventurer  Adventurer is the default job the player starts out with.

} .WikiaBarWrapper .wikia-bar { background-image: none; }Collections  Collections are items that are found around the lands of Sacred Grove. They are usually discovered by clicking on sparkling locations \u00a0such as leaves and junkpiles. Some collections do not require you to gather physical items, but simply discover a specific set of locations. If you find a new item, you will be rewarded with Adventurer experience. Some are easier to find then others. Some require you to thoroughly check out towns and cities while some just want you to collect items in assorted areas. Some collectibles are member-only. If you complete a collection, you may earn a reward.Collection Types  ===Exploration Collections===Exploration collections require you to simply discover a specific set of locations. Approaching any location in the list will activate the corresponding collection. Approaching subsequent locations will add them to your collection until complete.Rare Exploration Collections  Rare Exploration collections are more difficult to find locations that can be spotted by turning, sparkling \"coins\" which must be clicked to collect. Coins associated with the realm they are found in, (The Sanctuary, Seaside, Shrouded Glade, Merry Vale, Wugachug, Blackspore Swamp, Briarwood, Snowhill and Sunstone Valley) \u00a0Collection names give hints as to where the coins are, but to see any of the names you must find at least one coin in the collection. Even though there are only nine places there are twenty-two coin collections, there is an Elite collection and a Rare collection for every realm and the Northeast, Northwest, SouthEast and SouthWest rare collection which can be found in their titles of The Sanctuary.Explorer Collections  Explorer collections are collections of the Exploration and Rare Exploration collections. Completing an Exploration or Rare Exploration collection will activate the corresponding collection.Item Collections  Item collections pieces can be found in sparkling \"spawn\" objects that appear almost anywhere in the world. Each spawn will yield one item \u00a0which can be a piece from any number of different collections depending on the area or the type of spawn. Types of spawns are also differing depending on the area. Items may give either Adventurer\u00a0experience or randomly award experience\u00a0to other jobs. Items also come in two qualities. Common collection items appear the most frequently. Rare collection items appear less frequently and the spawn object will have the words <Rare Collection> under the object name. The appearance of a rare spawn will differ slightly from a common one, and the sparkling effect will appear more like fireworks.Meta Collections  Meta collections are Item collections that can only be started and finished by completing other Item collections.Job Collections  Job collections are collections of items that tie into a particular job. Pieces can be found in sparkling \"spawn\" objects similar to Item collection spawns. However, these spawns will appear only in areas that correspond with a particular job, and only if you have switched to that job. (ie. \"Ninja Materials\" will only appear in combat areas if dressed as a ninja) Completion of the full collection will award some job experience as well as a job related item.Cascading Collections  Cascading collections are collections where the reward from completing one Item collection contributes an item for another collection. Completing these collections can often result in a final reward of a highly valued and rare item.Types of Collections Ghostly Latern\u00a0  \"Obtain a haunted light, eerie flame or even a lantern with a wraithlike glow, all lit by the supernatural powers of the unknown.\"Fireflies  Never has a bug collection been so rewarding. You'll find lots of different bugs along your journey. These firefly sparks are just a glimpse of the excitement ahead.Fancy Keys Collect enough keys and unlock a grand treasure trove.

To add articles/categories, place \"[[Category:Free Realms Wiki]]\" somewhere in the article in questionBlackspore Swamp  Blackspore Swamp is a town located\u00a0in the southeast corner of Sacred Grove. It is a dark and gloomy swamp where there is little difference between night and day. Amid the bogs are rotting remains of what existed before the Unbinding including archaeological sites, the Ancient's Wall, and myriad fossils to be collected. Blackspore is roughly rectangular in shape with the long dimension running north and south. The western side is swampy terrain and the eastern side is submerged under a dark lake. The main outpost, Mire's Edge, is clumped into a loose knot along the shore. Just north of Mire's Edge is Mucklewhump's Ferry. The presence of old man Mucklewhump gives the impression he once gave boat rides to the Isle of Tears out on the lake. South of Mire's Edge is the Ancient's Wall, and south of the wall is the Sinking Graveyard, Shadowtalon Dojo and the Quagmire Quarry. There's a lot of mystery surrounding the quarry and the unexplained deaths of some of the miners. Blackspore is separated from the rest of Sacred Grove by a mountain range that rings the town. There are two tunnels under the mountains that lead to town and there is also a warpstone in Blackspore near Mire's Edge. During the annual \u00a0Spooktacular Blackspore is home to the Vampires vs. Werewolves Dance-off, which takes place just outside the gates of the Bone Bog Cemetery. The Dance-off is hosted by the Pumpkin Prince, whose tomb is in a corner of the cemetery. Many of the Super Spooktacular quests involve searching around Blackspore and crossing swords with the many haunts found here.History  Long before the Unbinding, the area now known as Blackspore Swamp was a beautiful rolling landscape, full of lush forests, fertile fields, and sparkling springs. Now Blackspore is a vast, seething swamp that seems to be sinking further and further into the mire. Despite -- or perhaps because of -- this decline, Blackspore is a refuge for thieves and other shady characters who take shelter in its shadows.Travel  Blackspore is located east of\u00a0Crossroads and southeast of\u00a0Stillwater Crossing. The only way into or out of Blackspore, other than by\u00a0Warpstones, is to pass through the tunnels near\u00a0Crossroads\u00a0or\u00a0Stillwater Crossing.Quests Blackspore Swamp series Pet Trainer  Pet Trainer is a trainer job, specializing in teaching tricks to pets.

Joe faction. For the man who founded the group, see G.I. Joe (Colton).G.I. Joe  G.I. Joe is the official code name for Special Counter-Terrorist Unit Delta, devoted to protecting the world from Cobra and other violent terrorist organizations. They are highly skilled, and have access to cutting-edge military technology. Led by General Hawk and Flint, G.I. Joe are true American heroes! Based in their hidden base in an undisclosed location somewhere in Utah, G.I. Joe is the world's best defense against the assaults of Cobra, and assist against the ravages of the Decepticons as well.History MUX History  In 2004, Soon after a decisive defeat of the Autobots by the Decepticons, The President of the United States gave over control of the US to the Decepticons. Soon after, around the country the Decepticons began rounding up humans to serve as labor in their energon production facilities. In March of 2005, after months of occupation, the Decepticons were finally driven out of North America by a combined force of Autobots, Cobra, and G.I. Joe.Uniform  The Pentagon tightly controls information about GI Joe and refuses to comment publicly on the highly secretive unit and its activities. Delta operators are granted an enormous amount of flexibility and autonomy. To conceal their identities, they rarely wear a uniform and usually wear civilian clothing both on and off duty. When military uniforms are worn, they lack markings, surnames, or branch names. Civilian hair styles and facial hair are allowed to enable the members to blend in and avoid recognition as military personnel.Reports 2011 Aug 04 - Medical Report  This Medical Report is on the following personnel: Scarlett and Coldshot Scarlett: She has suffered multiple gunshot wounds, multiple contusions and multiple knife/machete wounds. Prognosis: At least a week in medical recovering. Coldshot: She has suffered massive internal injuries. Crush wounds from an unknown source. She is currently Comatose. Prognosis: Undetermined time in Medical, at least a month, more likely 2, recovering. After that, likely will need another month to regain strength.2013 Jun 18 - Tax Dollars at Work...  A large amount of GI Joe vehicles in the PIT have had magnetic signs applied to their sides, changing GI JOE to GI JOESE, REAL MEXICAN HERO. Someone has too much time and is in too high a pay grade.G.I. Joe World  After the conclusion of the Second World War, General Robert Savage speaks to the newly formed United Nations, and stresses the importance of not only a world diplomatic force, but a policing force. The General is placed in command of the UN's security forces, which are named G.I. Joes by the people. Joe takeover was gradual, with them slowly gathering up power. Temporary emergency powers somehow become permanent, and keep growing. Under the Joes, peace is maintained and strengthened, and even though there are still seeds of discontent, the Joes faithfully and honorably defend the principles of peace and justice. Of course, there are those who see things otherwise, and feel the Joes are an excessive jingoistic overreaching arm of the United States, enforcing its foreign policy at the expense of the rest of the world. To them, Cobra are heroic freedom fighters, battling against the odds in the name of true freedom from the Joes' worldwide police state.Shattered Glass  In the Shattered Glass universe, G.I. Joe is an assassination squad serving the personal interested of President Colton. Any one stirring up too much trouble, or suspected of 'terrorist' or 'un-American' leanings, is rounded up and \"detained,\" usually never seen again -- \"rendered\" to another country for torture, or just buried in the desert with a bullet in their head. General Courage runs the day-to-day operations of G.I. Joe, with the assistance of G.I. Joe Command. In recent years G.I. Joe has gotten bolder, taking out dissidents and 'troublemakers' at home and abroad with ruthless precision. Their primary target, Cobra, has been forced to ground, and are slowly being hunted, one by one.References Transformers Universe MUX Wiki C130-3.jpg Mikaela Banes  MIKAELA Banes is an attractive woman with a juvenile history of auto theft. Her father was lifelong a car thief, and started bringing young Mikaela on jobs from when she was a young girl, showing her the ropes and teaching her everything he knew about stealing, repairing, and modifying cars. When he was finally arrested, Mikaela refused to cooperate with the police and wound up with a record of her own. After years in foster care at one new school after another, Mikaela is attempting to put her criminal past behind her, but still finds herself attracted to bad influences and retains her ability to hot-wire and drive just about anything on four wheels.History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  Mikaela Banes was born May 16, 1990 in Rockwood, Tennessee.MUX History:  Mikaela is currently working as a mechanic when not going on adventures with Katie Sorenson.OOC Notes  Since the 2007 movie isn't canon, Mikaela is just a student with an interest in unusual cars. She has yet to have any run-ins with the Autobots or the Witwicky family, although she has met Katie and certain members of Cobra.Logs Players  Mikaela is currently temped by Bzero, but is available for application.References G.I.

Joe command structure few are treated with anything less than respect for their contributions and skill.KIA G.I. Joe Casualties in Benzheen G.I. Joe Casualties in Trucial Abysmia References See Also Sam Witwicky  Samuel James \"Sam\" Witwicky is the cousin of Buster and Spike Witwicky. He's an energetic and somewhat hyper young man, excited at the prospects of his first job. When Sparkplug and Spike joined the Autobots, Sam's parents Ron and Judy Witwicky took on the responsibility of looking after Buster. While Buster was off at college and Spike off with the Autobots for most of Sam's life, he does feel some affection for his cousins, and getting to meet Bumblebee as a kid was the highlight of his young life. At this point, however, Sam wants to live his own life, free of the Witwicky family fame and its association with the Autobots.Background MUX Pre-History  Sam Witwicky was born September 13, 1991. While Buster was off at college and Spike off with the Autobots for most of Sam's life, he does feel some affection for his cousins, and getting to meet Bumblebee was the highlight of his young life.MUX History  In 10th grade, Sam tried out for the football team. He failed. Bullies took notice of this and taunted him about this sometimes, but Sam would claim that he was researching a book he was writing. In 2009, Sam Witwicky graduated high school and entered college at the University of Oregon. However, with Seattle threatened in the Great Flood of 2011, Sam was temporarily relocated to the Ark. In 2013, Sam returned to class and school, although he continued to receive care packages from his parents. Seeking to get the hell out of Oregon and to get a more prestigious degree, Sam applied for scholarships to Princeton and Yale to complete his studies. However, even though he was accepted to Yale, he never transferred to the school, and instead dropped out of college entirely, claiming he needed to take some time to \"find himself.\" After a series of failed interviews, Sam arrived at a telecommunication company named Accuretta Systems, where his apparently failing attempt to win over Bruce Brazos succeeded, and he was given a position as a mail carrier. However, in October of 2016 Sam was laid off, and is now back to living in his parents' basement, playing console games while pretending to look for a new job. That year, Sam went to spent Christmas at Autobot City with his uncle and cousins, and wound up staying through to the new year. In 2017, Sam moved back in with his parents. Fired from his last professional job at a business establishment after not being able to cut it in the mailroom, his time was freed up for his passion project - an art house film where a camera focuses on him for 12 hours as he watches an entire season of the '80s sitcom Gimmie A Break.Involvement  Sam primarily serves as a background character for the MUX, fleshing out the Witwicky family.Players  Sam was first played by Spikewitwicky, appropriately enough. In 2016 he was taken over by Bzero.Quotes Trivia  Sam Witwicky is a character from the otherwise non-canonical live-action movies. Unlike the live-action movies, however, this Sam has had little contact with the Autobots since he moved out on his own for college, aside from his time on the Ark during the Flood TP.See also External links Baroness  BARONESS was the spoiled offspring of European aristocrats who made sure that both her and her brother, Eugen, had the best of everything in life. During the time of the Vietnam War, Eugen had abandoned his aristocratic lifestyle. Using his power and influence, he delivered medical supplies and other needed items into the war-torn region. On one tragic occasion, Eugen's sister, the woman who one day would become The Baroness, accompanied him on what would result in a deal gone bad. Eugen was fatally wounded just as another soldier later known as Snake-Eyes burst in and killed Eugen's murderers. His sister, who had been in another room, believed that the soldier had destroyed both her brother and his supposedly peaceful contacts. This set her on a course of revenge that would lead her into a life of international terrorism. She joined the ranks of COBRA, rising to become its top intelligence agent. The Baroness is a highly intelligent and ambitious individual, and a world-class expert in cryptography, psychological warfare, and bio-chemical skin-irritants. She is full of contradictions: cynical yet romantic, calculating but naive, blunt and prone to beating around the bush. She is qualified in most small arms, including the M-16, AK-47, RPG 7, and the Uzi. She is also an experienced H.I.S.S. tank operator, and her military specialties include helicopter and fixed wing pilot. Her principle weakness is in the division of her loyalty between Cobra Commander and Destro. Her chief strength would seem to lie in her incredible skill at disguise and impersonation, as well as her ability to work everyone around her against each other, to her advantage. Her powers of manipulation and seduction are simply breathtaking.History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  Anastasia Cisarovna DeCobray was born somewhere in Europe in 1953 to wealthy aristocrats who spoiled her. Her brother, Eugen, had been part of a humanitarian effort to bring medical supplies to the natives of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The supplies were to be distributed to the people regardless of their political affiliation. During the Tet offensive, Eugen had been in Saigon and Anastasia, only 15 years old, came along since she was on Christmas break from her boarding school. When they arrived, a warehouse which was supposed to be filled with the supplies was empty. He discovered that his contacts were selling the supplies to buy weapons. When DeCobray found out, the two men shot him dead. At that moment, a young soldier -- Snake-Eyes -- arrived and killed the two men. Anastasia rushed into the room and saw Snake-Eyes there, believing he killed all three men. Taken away before Snake-Eyes was cleared, Anastasia became angry, bitter and disillusioned. She soon became a radical student activist, dabbled in extremist fringe groups, and eventually graduated to an international terrorism. The particulars of the early years of her career are unknown, but She is believed to have been trained as a spy and saboteur at an exclusive facility run by a former Warsaw Pact intelligence agency. By 1982 the Baroness had became an infamous figure and joined the organization known as Cobra Command. Early in her career with Cobra, she led the team that kidnapped American scientist Dr. Adele Burkhart. The Baroness first dealt with the G.I. Joe team during their rescue of Burkhart. For the next few years, Baroness became an integral part of Cobra and a trusted lieutenant of Cobra Commander. When Cobra Commander brought Destro into the organization, he was surprised to find out the Baroness had already met Destro. It was obvious they had had a past relationship, but the exact circumstances remain unknown. Cobra Commander soon became suspicious of Destro's growing power in the organization and hired the mercenary Major Bludd to kill him. During a battle in Washington, D.C. with the Joes, Bludd took the opportunity to shoot Destro while driving a HISS tank. The Baroness realized what was about to happen and swerved her tank to stop Bludd. Her tank exploded, nearly killing her. Bludd decided to save the Baroness, but they were both captured by the Joe team. Bludd managed to escape the Joes headquarters -- the Pit -- and took a comatose Baroness to the Bern Institute of Reconstructive Surgery in Switzerland where she was healed by Dr. Hundtkinder. When Joes had tracked them to Switzerland, Bludd sent a message to Cobra Commander to ransom the Baroness back to Cobra. Once he showed up, Bludd and the Baroness escaped and left the commander to be captured by the Joes. Bludd and the Baroness returned to Cobra headquarters and began plotting with Destro to take control of Cobra. They wanted to eliminate Cobra Commander, knowing that his bodyguard, Storm Shadow, would rescue him. They sent the mercenary Firefly and the Cobra pilot, Wild Weasel, to find the commander. However, Storm Shadow was captured, allowing Cobra Commander to escape and return to Cobra headquarters. Firefly and Wild Weasel were captured by Zartan. The Baroness and Major Bludd continued their plan to take over Cobra. Baroness offered freedom to a imprisoned Bludd to help her. Bludd located the young boy Billy, part of the Cobra underground in Springfield, the Cobra-controlled town somewhere in America. They trained him to assassinate Cobra Commander, but when the attempt was made, Destro somehow recognized that Billy was Cobra Commander's son and stopped the boy. When Billy's trial was held, he refused to turn in his accomplices. Bludd and the Baroness were delighted and soon afterward, Storm Shadow rescued Billy and left Cobra. Baroness continued her prominence in Cobra. She and Destro tested the inventions of Dr. Mindbender against G.I. Joe trainees and were defeated, but Mindbender joined Cobra. When Storm Shadow tried to escape Cobra Island, the Baroness shot him, tired of being betrayed by the ninja. Destro and the Baroness helped Mindbender scour the world for the remains of long-dead historical leaders. The scientist used these remains to create Serpentor, the ultimate Cobra warrior. Storm Shadow's body was used as well and he was somehow revived. When Serpentor arrived on Cobra Island, he began to usurp control from Cobra Commander, gaining the support of the Baroness and Dr. Mindbender. Soon afterward, Cobra Commander and Destro attacked G.I. Joe's headquarters, the Pit. The Pit was destroyed, and the commander and Destro were presumed killed in the explosion. The two men had survived, but went into hiding for a short time, away from Cobra. Cobra Commander was shot by the Crimson Guardsman Fred VII, who thought the commander had died. He arrived on Cobra Island claiming to be the original Cobra Commander. Serpentor had the Baroness decide if it was truly Cobra Commander, since she knew what he really looked like. When Fred VII revealed his identity, the Baroness did not turn him in, but instead decided to become his \"partner,\" using him to have more control over the organization. The power struggle between Serpentor and the false commander culminated in the Cobra Island Civil War, which split Cobra into two factions, loyal to Serpentor or the commander. The war, in which the Joe team entered on Serpentor's side, ended with the death of Serpentor and the arrival of Destro. Destro's personal army nearly took over the island when Destro claimed the Baroness as his prize, and left the island, taking her with him. The Baroness then joined Destro's organization, which soon merged with Cobra. She was teamed up with Zarana to oversee Cobra's Broca Beach operation. The two women constantly fought and the Baroness tried to kill Zarana. The Baroness soon got a call from Dr. Hundtkinder who faxed her a picture of another patient at the Bern Institute. She recognized the man as her brother's murderer, and learned it was Snake-Eyes. She attacked the Bern Institute, shooting Scarlett and capturing Snake-Eyes. She brought him back to the Cobra Consulate building in New York, but Snake-Eyes escaped, causing the collapse of the building. Baroness nearly fell to her death but was caught by Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow as they hung from the crumbling building. She was about to shoot Snake-Eyes when Destro arrived and told her that he had been in Saigon as a teenager when her brother was killed. His father had discovered that Snake-Eyes had not killed Eugene. Unwilling to accept this, she let go of Snake-Eyes and fell again. She was saved by Storm Shadow who returned her to Destro to live with what she had done. Destro gave up his weapons business to live with the Baroness in his castle in Scotland. When the real Cobra Commander returned to power, he attempted to kill Destro. He brainwashed the Baroness to kill Destro, but she broke free of the conditioning and defended Destro's castle in Trans-Carpathia from Cobra with the help of the G.I. Joe team. When Dr. Mindbender revealed to Cobra Commander that he had placed mind-controlling implants into Destro and Zartan years earlier, the commander returned to Destro's castle in Trans-Carpathia and activated the implants. He soon used the Brain-Wave scanner to control the Baroness, Billy and Storm Shadow as well. With the high command of Cobra back in power, the commander began his plan to take control of the countries surrounding Trans-Carpathia. A short time later, the G.I. Joe team was team was disbanded by the U.S. military. Soon afterward, Cobra forces fell to a unified attack by regular military forces. Most of Cobra's \"high command\" disappeared in the wake of the conflict, including the Baroness.MUX History:  The Baroness was given control of Cobra by Destro as an engagement gift, while Cobra Commander was missing. She participated in the Rescue of Cobra Commander, along with Artemis. When Cobra Commander returned, he placed her in charge of the day to day operations of Cobra, while he remains hidden in the shadows, plotting who knows what. She has temporarily turned over the Intelligence duties to Tomax and Xamot, but she does not keep her hands out of the pot. Most of her contacts still report to her, and she only passes along what information she deems the Twins able to handle. She and Major Bludd took an unscheduled vacation, which lead to much consternation amongst Cobra, before they returned. She again disappeared, this time to spend a few months in direction communications with Cobra Commander in an unknown location, only to return as the situation with Destro becomes very dire, and a possible Assault on Cobra Island looms. The Destro situation seems to have been cleared up, and as such, she led a clandestine mission into the Cobra Consulate to see if the American Government had grabbed any Intelligence from the servers left behind. Major Bludd, Interrogator, and herself snuck in, but had to fight off a Joe team. They were wounded, and before they could fully recover and check the servers, another Joe team, led by Scarlett and Lowdown forced them to flee. Baroness and Interrogator were severly wounded in the fight, and the team was forced to flee via the Cobra Consulate Building roof, and Night Raven Drones to return to Cobra Island. Next on the agenda was dealing with Over Kill. She authorized the funding for one final Over Kill unit, this to be the last Cobra funds, she than ordered that the Unit be given a comprehensive set of tests to check for loyalty and combat effectiveness. She than hatched her next plan, the take over of a small Middle Eastern country, that is rich in Oil Reserves. All-Alawi. Cobra invaded, and Baroness left the planning of the invasion to Major Bludd, and sat back, waiting for good things to happen. When things in Al-Alawi progressed far enough, she went there to oversee the final stages of the Invasion, including the Peace Treaty that turns the country over to Cobra. She personally was involved in the combat, when G.I. Joe tried to kick Cobra out of the country. In 2014, she masterminded the opening phases of Operation Popsicle. She turned the operation over to others in Cobra High Command, however, before the final stages were implemented. In 2015, the Baroness was captured by anti-Cobra forces in Borovia, and imprisoned for several months. She was rescued at last by Destro, who took her to the Silent Castle to recover. While there, Destro reconnected with the Baroness, and discussed her idea for teaming up and possibly infiltrating G.I. Joe. However, in 2016 the Baroness hosted a party for Destro in the Silent Castle, and after she retired for the night Destro was killed by Satan and Artemis. She went on the run, but was soon captured by Cobra Commander's operatives, and brought in to face him. While she convinced Cobra Commander not to kill her, her closeness with Destro robs her of much of the Commander's trust. Baroness has complete freedom to travel the world in her guise as head of Cobra Intelligence, but is currently spending most of her time at the Silent Castle, in the company of the recently-resurrected Destro. Cobra Commander's trust in her has waned, and he wonders at her true loyalty. In the meantime Cobra Commander may be grooming a replacement for her in Cobra Command.OOC Notes  With Cobra Commander often in hiding, and Destro busy running MARS, the Baroness is the de facto day-to-day head of Cobra, and acts as Cobra Commander's spokeswoman and Executive Officer.Logs/Posts 1848  \"Once Upon a Joe in the West\" - An explosion in Cape Canaveral sends Cobra and G.I. Joe into the past - Parts 1.5, 2, and 32002 2007 2008 2009 Sep 21: IC Message to all Cobra Troops  This is the Baroness. I am sending this to all LOYAL Cobra Troops, Destro is attempting to take over Cobra, and meld it into something the Commander does not want. We can not allow this. If you support Cobra Commander's true Vision of Cobra, contact me now. If you prefer, go to Broca Beach... I will be there awaiting the TRULY loyal troops. Baroness ClearNov 23: IC Orders  On the screen, comes the image of Anastasia DeCobray, better known as The Baroness. She smiles at the camera, and starts out, softly, her Eastern European accent causing her words, while understandable, to have an even greater menacing quality. Cobra, let me begin by saying that our efforts to discredit the G.I. Joe Team have started to payoff, even if the American Media. It should continue. I want the Naval Forces of Cobra to Launch attacks on the Port Cities of New York, Boston, New Orleans, Houston, San Diego, and Seattle. Nothing too severe, but random Missile Launches as Cargo Storage Facilities, Cargo Ships, and the Like. Limit the loss of life, for the time being. Cobra Air Forces, strike further into the Country. Special Targets would be Napalm raids on Farms, Ranches, and Water Treatment Facilities. Strike fear for the food and water supply of the American civilian. Always, of course, leaving a Calling Card... Cobra Dry Rations, and Water Bottles with the Cobra Symbol, in crates, would show that Cobra, while interested in discrediting G.I. Joe, and waging war on the American Government, does not wish to harm the Civilians. We must turn the Civilians of America against the Government, and especially against G.I. Joe. Cobra Infantry Forces, I want you to be on watch for targets of opportunity. Anything that will continue to do the work started by the Naval and Air Forces is what I want to see. I have a special mission for those of you that are more Sneaky, especially the Range-Vipers, Ninja-Vipers, and Night Creepers. I *want* Cobra Commander found. While I am holding his place, I do think we need our Commander back. FIND HIM! I will be addressing the American Media in a few days, after our attacks begin, and I want successes to show what we can do. Do not fail yourselves, Cobra, or ME! Failure will be met with SEVERE penalty. With a last, almost sweet smile, Baroness' face fades out slowly, to be replaced with the Cobra Symbol, blood Red, against a black background, before that as well, fades.Nov 23: IC Orders  Baroness appears on screen again The following agents are tasked as follows. Firefly: Your standard fee has been deposited in your account. I want you to locate high value MILITARY targets in the United States, or their Bases off American Soil. Report them to me. Over Kill: You will stand by for any targets designated by Firefly, for your B.A.T. and Vector troops to attack. Also, if you find, during the course of your wandering, any Member of G.I. Joe, I want you to attack them. If you can, capture them, if not, kill or injure them. Zartan: You and your Family should infiltrate the Americans, use your disguises to locate the Commander, and inform myself immediately. Artemis: You will take Zartan's information, and you and a squad of Range-Vipers I am sending to you, will check each bit of information. You WILL find Cobra Commander Major Bludd: You will oversee any and all Infantry and B.A.T. raid on the Americans. Copperhead: Take charge of Naval Forces, and lead them into their Attacks. Wild Weasel: The Air Force Raids are your area. Also, Military Targets will be acceptable. Dr. Mindbender & Typhoid: I want more weapons that the Infantry can use to incapacitate the Americans. However, I want Lethal and Non-Lethal weapons. Civilians should NOT be targeted with Lethal Weapons, unless it is unavoidable. OOC: If I forgot you, specifically, let me know, and I will give you some Orders Baroness.2010 January Jan 06 - IC Orders  TO: Cobra Command, Cobra Tele-Vipers, Cobra Island Personnel\nFROM: Baroness\nRE: Cobra Island Communications Effective Immediately, Tele-Viper 742 has been Promoted to Wiretap, and made Commander of the Tele-Vipers on Cobra Island, and placed in Charge of the Communications Section of the Command Center on Cobra Island.Jan 08 - IC Orders  TO: Brainstorm, Artemis, Cobra Intelligence\nCC: Cobra Command Personal (OOC Note: Rank 5 or Higher)\nFROM: Baroness\nRE: Operation Commander Recovery Artemis, you and your Search Squad will be seconded to Brainstorm's more aggressive search for the Commander. Brainstorm is in command of this mission, and your squad will support him in any way necessary. All Reports originally routed to Artemis, will go to both Artemis, and Brainstorm. However, if you, Artemis, find any leads that are not based on Brainstorm's approach, you are to inform him, and myself of it, and I will decide if the information is reliable enough to act on. Baroness OOC NOTE: Artemis is assigned to Brainstorm, so that the Range Viper that Baroness has placed there, can continue to hinder any search for the Commander. During the course of the search, Range Viper 1928 can, and will hinder any real chance of success, but, in the end, will be found out, and likely killed. No link to the Baroness will be shown by anything the Range Viper in question does or says, as the Range Viper is working under false pretenses that Destro ordered him to hinder the investigationJan 08 - IC Orders  TO: All Cobra Personnel\nFROM: Baroness\nRE: Attacks on American Mainland From now on, without direct orders from me, all attacks on the American 'Lower 48' will stop. Such attacks should be moved off the Mainland United States, to such places like Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, or any U.S. Military bases on 'Foreign Soil'. Our attacks have done the work they were designed to do, but the time to attack the United States Mainland is over. It is time to ensure that American Civilians understand we do not wish them hurt, that we only wish to free them from the Government that enslaves them. The only exception to this will be attacks on U.S. Military Installations in the United States, or at such targets that Brainstorm's new Campaign will do, for which only he may decide if you need to know about. I want to see a world wide raid on U.S. Military targets, beginning as soon as possible. I want Strikes on Naval Vessels, including those Civilian Vessels that may be hauling Oil, which first must be taken over, and the crew removed. Also, strikes on U.S. Military Bases in the European and Middle Eastern Theaters should commence tomorrow.\n\n BaronessJan 19 - IC Orders  TO: Cobra Command, Major Bludd\nFROM: Baroness\nRE: Haiti Major, while you are there, I want you to work on getting the Haitian Government to accept a full time Peace-Keeping role from Cobra Troops.

I want all forces to prepare for resumed actions on the United States, but all forces are to await my orders before striking. We will begin with a series of strikes, with no warning, that leave no witnesses, to soften up certain targets. I want there to be no connection to Cobra, at first. The first Target, will be Guantonamo Bay Naval Base, on Cuba. However, to soften the target, I want assaults on Naval and Air Force Facilities in Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas. Air Strikes by Night Ravens and Any Stealth Equipped Aircraft. Sea Based Strikes will also be launched, but from maximum range, to ensure the Naval Forces can not be tracked. Major Bludd, I want you to plan a Naval and Air Based Assault on Guantanamo Bay. Infantry Forces can be Airlifted in via Helicopter, Airborne Assault via Airplane, or Naval Based Landing Craft can be used as well. Whatever you deem most effective. Our objective, other than the destruction of American property, and loss of American Naval and Marine Life, is the freeing of the terrorists the Americans have there. Use whatever units you deem needed. All Cobra Forces are at your Control. If there is any talk of this strike on ANY Radio, Cellular, Land-line, Television, or Internet Communication, I will have the offender killed.

We have not allowed G.I. Joe or the American Government to kick us off our Island, and we will not allow Destro to do it. All vehicles that can not be made worthy of Winter Combat Operations should be moved to Underground Storage, or to one of our other bases. All forces are to be placed on High Alert, and all leave is canceled. Any agent currently on leave, or not on a mission of utmost importance, is to be contacted, and ordered to return to the Island. The defense of Cobra Island will be our top priority. Techno-Vipers, find out what is wrong with Over Kill, and get him fixed... We may need him. If we decide to, later, shut him down, make sure we can do so easily, and without the Vectors threatening to, again, mutiny. If this can not be done, dismantle them all. If Destro insists on attacking the Island, for something we did not do, I want all of our foreign bases to be prepared to invade Trans-Carpathia, and to take control of the country.

We will also need the same kind of recon run done at the South Pole, to see if the Decepticons are pulling the same kind of operation there, as they are under the north pole ice cap. If they are, we will need to strike both, to hopefully return the ice caps to normal. Commander, I request permission to, if the South Pole is experiencing the same kind of Heating as the North Pole, to approach G.I. Joe and share this intelligence. Their S.H.A.R.C.'s could potentially assist us in restoring the Earth to normal, and a temporary truce, only for the duration, and only against the Decepticons, might be in order.

Africa: South East Asia: Central America and will control Operations in the Mid-Western United States: The Officer listed first is in command of the area assigned, and can call upon any operative ranked below their level for support with their operations. All assignments are known to the Commanding Agents. -BaronessFeb 13 - United States  TO: Cobra High Command\nFROM: Baroness\nRE: Mid-Western United States It is still my desire to send supplies of food, water, fuel, and most importantly, new seed material to the farms or the Mid-western farmland states of the United States. Despite the refusal of the United States Government to allow us to do so openly, we can send Night Ravens in stealthily, and have them air drop, or use the drones to land and off load supplies to the farms that are in desperate need of such supplies. If we can win at least a small population of middle American support, we will have a foot in the door for future operations. We have plenty of Siegie penetration in the Midwest, that we can have them, as Insurance Representatives, go to the area, meet the drones, and offload the supplies, or, they can ignore the supplies, and meet covertly with the militia groups in the area, and perhaps gain their support, as the U.S. Government will not be getting around to that area for some time, as they work on the more coastal regions. I intend for Tomax and Xamot to coordinate these efforts, while they work in Central America, as they will be the closest operatives, or we can send in Zartan, Zarana, and Zandar. -BaronessAugust August 8 August 14 - Promotion  TO: All Cobra Operatives\n FROM: The Baroness\n RE: Promotions List The following Agents have been Promoted from Viper to Code Name Status: Tele-Viper 911 New Code Name: Cypher The Following Vipers have been promoted within their ranks: Viper 8473 has been promoted to The Crimson Guard Viper 8125 has been promoted to Techno-Viper Status Effective Immediately, Cypher has been designated the Cobra Communications Executive Officer All promotions have been reviewed, and approved by Cobra High Command, and Cobra CommanderSep 06 - Intelligence Reports  TO: Cobra Command (Rank 6 or Higher)\n FROM: Baroness\n RE: Intelligence on Kurdish Raids The recent attacks by the Kurdish Insurgents appear to have tapered off. No attack has taken place in 72 hours, leading me to believe that the Kurds have either run out of weapons, or are currently training for a major assault. I want all High Value targets to step down from high alert, and get back to doing the jobs they have been assigned, however, the Terrordrome personnel need to step up their alert status, and increase their ground patrols. We have still lost too many helicopters on low level recon, so from now on, Helicopter patrol will be carried out at the Flight Level (4 Aircraft) rather than at a single, or two, aircraft level.2013 May May 07 - IC Report  TO: Cobra Command (Rank 7+) \n FROM: Baroness\n RE: My absence Since late September of 2012, I have been tracking down an Infiltrator into Cobra Unity. I noticed someone familiar in the Crown City Bazzar, and I followed them. After months of recon, and a lot of money, I discovered the location of this infiltrator. It was Scarllet. Yes, the Joe. I lead a small team of Vipers into her hideout, and it would appear that she was massing Intelligence Information on our actions. We attacked her, and I alnoe, of my ten man group, came out. Scarlett escaped, with the help of some locals, or perhaps Iraqies, but I captured her stash of Intelligence and I have had it brought back to the Palace, so I can sift through it, and see if there are any weaknesses in our defenses that the Joes might be able to exploit. BaronessDecember Dec 07 - IC Message  TO: Cobra Command (Level 6+) \n FROM: Baroness\n RE: My Return I have returned from the DeCobray barony.

I want her to show him how to be an effective Combat Sniper in all situations, and if possible, I would like him to learn to lead Range Vipers and Alley Vipers in the same manner as she does. He will shadow her for the current missions in Frusenland. At the end of his training period with her, it is expected that he will be ready to be promoted to level 4 status. Artemis, if he does not pass your training, I expect to know immediately, and this includes a loyalty test.

Deputy Prime Minister August Volff\n Interior Minister Johan Thorin\n Foreign Minister Inger Alvsdatter These officials oppose Cobra, and a possible addition might be Defense Minister Franz Ackenheil, if Destro is unable to convince him to invite Cobra in. Eliminations should be done by the end of the weekend. Baroness2014 April Apr 02 - IC orders  TO: All Cobra Personnel\n FROM: Baroness\n RE: Operation Popsicle - Final Phase Operative Artemis has prepared Frusenland for our forces. The Government is in shambles. I want all Ice Vipers, along with their Wolves, all Arctic HISS and their assigned HISS Drivers, along with all assigned Snow Serpents, and support crews, including the MAMBA and Rattler air assets, to assemble in Crown City, by no later than Monday. We will be launching a full invasion, if Destro is unable to secure our invitation. The time frame for the invasion has not yet been set, however, it will be less than two weeks. Before that time, Artemis will assassinate Defense Minister Akenheil. That should leave the last roadblock to our victory by the wayside. BaronessApr 11 - IC Orders: Operation Popsicle  TO: All Cobra Personnel\n FROM Baroness\n RE: Operation Popsicle, Phase Five With the initial phases over, and our invitation into Frusenland as Peacekeepers secured, and the initial force of Ice-Vipers (And W.O.L.F.'s) and Track-Vipers (And Arctic H.I.S.S.'s), with MAMBA and Rattler air Cover, along with Snow Serpent and Range-Viper ground support teams moving in to take over the capital, along with the major population centers, the next phase of the operation is to move forward. Artemis, Angel, Agent Bristow, and the Night Stalkers are to move to secure the Coast Line areas that our Geo-Sats have indicated are the resource rich areas. Interrogator, I want you to take Command of all forces in Frusenland, until such a time that one of the High Command comes in Country. Be prepared to quell riots, or fight the Frusenland Security forces that might attack you, to try and get us out of the country. Do not let a Civil War break out. If that means you must arrest every member of the Frusenland Security Forces, do so. Tomax and Xamot, you shall send in Crimson Guard to begin to change the public opinion about Cobra, so that when we introduce Political Prospects for the Major positions open in the Government, the Frusenlanders will vote for them during the Special Elections that we will be holding as soon as Public Support for these canidates is high enough to ensure their victories. Use Wiretap, or Cypher, along with Interrogator to feed them subliminal messages through their local radio frequencies, if necessary, as it worked very well in Northern Africa, after the World Flooding. Major Bludd, I imagine the G.I. Joe Team, or perhaps more likely, the Oktober Guard, will not be happy about our being called in as Peace Keepers, and will be sending in at least a small team to keep an eye on us, form a rapid response team, to respond to any sighting of either group, and discourage them from remaining in the country. You need not lead it yourself, just pick a team. More orders will follow, as needed. Baroness2016 Apr 22 - Notice sent to Command  To: Cobra Command \n FROM: Baroness\n RE: Assassination of Destro I demand an explanation on why Cobra has targeted Destro for assassination. I further demand to know the reason I was not rescued by Cobra from the Borovian Prison I was in, and had to wait for Destro to rescue me. Had I not been a loyal subject of the Commander's? If the answers are less than satisfactory, I will contemplate my association with Cobra, and all the Intelligence I could provide the enemies of Cobra!

She began her training at age 9 and was awarded her first black belt at age 15. Scarlett is confident and resilient; it's remarkable to some that a person so deadly can still retain a sense of humor. She's graduated from Advanced Infantry Training and Ranger School, and has special Education at Covert Operations School, Marine Sniper School, Special Air Service School, and the Marine Tae Kwan Do Symposium. She's a Qualified Expert in the M-14, M-16, M-1911A1, M-79, M-3A1, M-700 (Remington Sniper Rifle), Mac-10, XK-1 Power Crossbow, Throwing Stars, Garotte, and Ka-Bar fighting knife. \"With any mission, you always have to be ready to take advantage of changing circumstances. And you need to make peace with the fact that this may be your last mission.\"Blog  IC JOURNAL - HANDWRITTENHistory Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  On Augut 10, 1952, Shana Mae O'Hara was born in Atlanta, Georgia where her father and three older brothers were martial arts instructors. Scarlett got along well with her father and brothers, beginning her training at nine years of age. They discovered that Scarlett had a natural affinity for the ancient fighting arts and was only fifteen when she was awarded a black belt. Scarlett and her sister Siobhan never got along well, and they drifted apart as they got older. After joining the Army, Scarlett received a varied education, attending Covert Ops School, Marine Sniper School, Special Air Service School and the Marine Tae Kwon Do symposium. Scarlett has participated in many martial arts tournaments and is also qualified as an Army hand-to-hand combat trainer. She is proficient in various weaponry, including the XK-1 power crossbow and many martial arts weapons such as throwing stars, garrote and ka-bar. Scarlett's first assignment on the G.I. Joe team was to train the new team in hand-to-hand combat. During the exercises, she met Snake-Eyes for the first time. While she bested most of the team's members, she recognized that Snake-Eyes was a superior fighter despite the fact that he had allowed her to beat him, wanting her to keep her dignity and respect with the other Joes. Scarlett was intrigued by his actions, and as a result, they became very close. On a mission in the Middle East, Snake-Eyes, Scarlett, Rock 'n Roll, and Grunt were sent to save George Strawhacker from Cobra. On the way, the helicopter in which they were traveling began to malfunction, forcing Rock 'n' Roll and Grunt to bail out before it crashed. Scarlett remained stuck in the burning helicopter, however, and Snake-Eyes stayed behind to save his lover. He rescued her, but a window exploded right in his face, scarring him and damaging his vocal cords. Despite his injuries, Snake-Eyes convinced Hawk to let him continue with the mission. Scarlett recovered from her injuries but Snake-Eyes harbored no ill will and the two became even closer. The two were later tasked with infiltrating Cobra's island hideout to rescue Dr. Adele Burkhart. They managed to infiltrate the base deep enough to actually confront Cobra Commander holding the scientist at gunpoint. Burkhart refused to let the Commander get away with his plan to kill the Joes and was shot. Scarlett took a risk and injured the Commander's hand with a shuriken. Burkhart, though wounded, was saved, but the Commander managed to escape. Some time later, Scarlett participated in a mission in the Middle East to keep Colonel Sharif's men from getting an object the Joes dubbed \"Hot Potato.\" She took a leave of absence during that time to participate in a martial arts tournament. It was broken off, though, as she was called on another mission to investigate an incident in the Arctic. There, she met the mercenary Kwinn whom even she couldn't best in a fight. The Eskimo knew how to use his size to good effect. As the Joes are ferocious fighters, he came to respect them. After a raid on a Cobra stronghold, the Joes retrieved a Cobra battle robot. The next day, Scarlett and Hawk had to make a showing for a social tea held at the motor pool above the Pit. Despite the commotions that went on with the activated battle robot below, they had to maintain the cover that the motor pool was nothing more but just that. A robotic insect that was a remnant of the robot managed to get to the top but Scarlett quickly crushed it with her foot. On a mission in Afghanistan, Scarlett met the Oktober Guard. After both groups escaped a gauntlet from Cobra, Stalker made the field decision to team with the Guard and go after the RTV, a decision of which Scarlett was highly critical. Her participation came in handy as she managed to keep the team from certain doom during a trap which flooded a tunnel in the Cobra stronghold. Later Scarlett was captured by Cobra and held at the Silent Castle. She escaped her cell, overpowering Storm Shadow, and fled the castle with Snake-Eyes. Discovering that Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow sported the same tattoo, she compared notes with Hawk and Stalker to learn more about their silent comrade's past. She subsequently met the Soft Master and learned more. At the same time a promotion was announced for Scarlett and all the other original Joes bar Snake-Eyes, being entitled to wear the Presidential Unit citation if and when G.I. Joe's activities were declassified, as well as being put in charge of operations at the Pit. However the Joes involved made their feelings clear that they wished to remain as field troops. Cobra tried to capture Scarlett again when she took a romantic trip with Snake-Eyes aboard the Staten Island ferry. She was observed by the Cobra agent Fred II and three others who did not recognize Snake-Eyes. The four were quickly overpowered. Around this time Scarlett was part of a Joe team sent to Afghanistan to capture a new Soviet a new helicopter-mounted laser canon. At the Pit Scarlett and other Joes discovered that the \"Ripcord\" they had saved on Cobra Island was actually Zartan. Soon after she took part in the assault on Springfield. Back at the Pit Barbecue's mouth got him in trouble when he criticized Snake-Eyes for letting the Cobra ninja Storm Shadow just walk out of the base, resulting in Scarlett hitting him. Subsequently Snake-Eyes disguised himself as Flint so that he could be captured and infiltrate Cobra operations in Sierra Gordo. Scarlett was deeply concerned for him and was part of the team that went in to steal a Terror Drome, though Snake-Eyes had been taken on to New York. Scarlett joined with Storm Shadow and Timber and helped Snake-Eyes escape. When Snow Job, Quick Kick, and Stalker were captured on a secret, off the books mission into Borovia, she and Snake-Eyes faked their deaths and along with the Blind Master, Billy, Storm Shadow and Jinx, went in to rescue them. Just prior to the Battle of Benzheen, she had sustained severe Head trauma from a shot to the head by the Baroness, causing a short-Term Coma, but she recovered in time to join the Battle, and was assigned to Ninja Force for the duration, along with Storm Shadow, Snake-Eyes, and Jinx. Much later Scarlett was given the mission of feigning defection to Cobra. She was deeply disturbed when she thought she had caused the deaths of Hawk and Stalker to maintain her cover. She was still not trusted by Zarana so sought to prove herself, working with Dr. Biggles-Jones in pursuing the fleeing Destro and Baroness. When confronted by Snake-Eyes the latter was forced to drive his sword through Scarlett, but the wound missed her vital organs. She received medical treatment, saving her life. Transported to Milleville, Scarlett found that Biggles-Jones claimed to know she was a double-agent. Scarlett tried to deny it but Biggles-Jones told her \"the whole truth.\" They were overheard by Dr. Mindbender who ordered Scarlett be placed under arrest but she broke free when Biggles-Jones was captured by the Decepticon Megatron. Scarlett escaped with the aid of Snake-Eyes, other Joes and a group of Autobots, but Biggles-Jones surrendered to Megatron to allow the others to escape the Decepticon. She was subsequently rescued by the Autobot Skydive. Scarlett and Snake-Eyes took time out in the High Sierras, but they received news that Storm Shadow had been captured by Cobra and she told Snake-Eyes he had to \"do what you have to\" and go to save his old friend. Scarlett was part of the team of Joes present when the team was decommissioned and the Pit deactivated.MUX History:  In 1997, G.I. Joe was reactivated once again. Scarlett was one of the first to return to duty with the G.I. Joe team, as she was dissatisfied with her work with other units of the Army. In early 2003, Scarlett ended her relationship with Snake-Eyes, throwing her engagement ring into the sewer in a fit of rage. Since 2004, Scarlett has moved on with her life without Snake-Eyes, remaining his friend, and her life with the Joes has gone on as normal, her missions unchanged. Undercover operations to draw out Cobra Operatives abound, inter-spaced with missions leading Joes into combat against Cobra. Most Notably, she and Temera spent time undercover in Colombia, trying and succeeding to gain access the Cobra Colombia Base, prior to the Joe invasion of that base. Scarlett helped Duke lead the invasion force, which led to the base's destruction. In 2009 rumors began circulating that Scarlett and Snake-Eyes may be seeing one another romantically again. In September of 2009, she was promoted to Sergeant Major and tasked with putting pressure on the Cobra Island command split. She is also, along with Stalker and Gung-Ho, one of the main Field Commanders for the Joe Team. She leads the Alpha Team. Four nights prior to Christmas, 2009, she was mortally wounded in a fight with Over Kill, not by Over Kill, but by a Vector, defending Wright Patterson Air Force Base. This led to a month of paralysis and another month of rehab and recovery. She was framed for an assault on Krista, just after she was able to rejoin active duty, and surrendered to the Pentagon, to avoid having the Joes have yet more issues with the media. General Colton promptly gave her a mission to go through the portal, into the SG World, to gather intelligence, and she gathered a team to do just that. Shortly thereafter Snake-Eyes also disappeared through the portal, and has not yet returned. During her time in the Shattered Glass Universe, Scarlett met with the Decepticon, Slickspin, and secured a semi-Alliance with him. Scarlett also infiltrated the SG-Pit, disguised as her SG double, Ebony. She was able to get a lot of information out to her team, (See the IC Journal Entries). However, Scarlett's presence was discovered by General Flint, with Ebony's help, and she was forced to attempt to fight her way free. She fought Flint, knocking him out, but as she was just about to escape, Ebony arrived and knocked her unconscious. Ebony than killed General Flint for his failure, blaming the death on Scarlett. If not for the timely arrival of Slickspin and Airborne, whom she had ordered to return to the Prime Universe, she would have been killed, or captured than killed. (See The Looking Glass Breaks.) Scarlett was returned to the Prime Universe, taken to the Pit, where she was in medical, recovering. When she awakened, she had knowledge of Infiltrators that she had to track down. When she recovered, she lead the group that tracked down the infiltrators, and she again went solo and took it upon herself to follow the infiltrators back to their base, and rescued Lifeline, Lowdown, and Raven from the SG-Joes (See: Red to the Rescue). After this, she completed an Intelligence evaluation of the Pit's current location, and sent her recommendation up the Chain of Command. She has also noticed that there may be in issue with the drug cartels in Mexico, that may require G.I. Joe, or at the very least, American intervention. All of this has been accomplished, while still awaiting her Security Clearance to be reinstated, and her 'Wedding' to Lifeline to be annulled. Her wedding to Lifeline was annulled, her Security Clearance returned... but this as just before Cobra Commander returned, and she flew a F-35 Lightning II into an Overpass, trying to get to the Scene in time to help the team of Joes that were pinned down. She ejected safely, but lost her Flight Clearance. She ran across Storm Shadow, and this set in motion events that would lead to yet another change in her life. She knew Snake-Eyes would once again have to chase down Storm Shadow, and try to \"fix\" him. This lead to a fight, verbal as well as physical between Snake-Eyes and Scarlett, culminating with her returning his Engagement Ring, and permanently calling off their wedding. She left Snake-Eyes in the Infirmary, and walked away from him promising to: 'Never cry over you {Snake-Eyes}, again.\" Scarlett's next tasking was to over see the construction of the new Pit, mostly due to the fact that it was her Intelligence that led to the new Construction. During Construction, she responded to the first raid by the newly aggressive Cobra, on Pensacola Naval Air Station. In the attack, she was wounded, but Lifeline was able to patch her up, and her duty of overseeing the construction of the Pit was not put behind schedule. Also during the new Pit construction, she located Storm Shadow, in Washington D.C. and went to him. (Sword Fight at the Lincoln Memorial) The fight resulted in Storm Shadow fleeing, but left her with a broken Right Elbow, requiring both surgical repair, and some replacement parts (Surgery!). It also led to the begining of a possible new relationship between her and Lifeline, the early stages are tentative, and wrought with unknown. While recovering, she was visiting Fort Hood, and was caught in the Final defense of the Pit located under it. She spent one week leading the survivors of the attack down through the rubble to the escape pods. She has recovered from that surgery, and continued to do her Intelligence duties, while also taking on more and more dangerous missions. While she has not admitted it to herself, she knows she is doing so, because of the breakup with Snake-Eyes, and the loneliness in her heart (The Lifeline relationship still growing too slowly to take the place of the Snake-Eyes relationship). She has also been more active in Command decisions, asserting herself in ways that she hasn't before, ensuring that the Joes move forward with their work of stopping Cobra. Greenshirts have noticed a chill about Scarlett in the Hand to Hand training classes that she still holds in the early mornings, but most Joes are writing it off to the break up, and think it is only temporary. Which it did prove to be, although she remains distant to all but close friends. She took many solo missions, be they infiltration or intelligence missions, or just missions where she took a team of greenshirts away from the Pit for weeks at a time. The visible scars from these missions are few, but the greenshirt reports to their superiors are concerning. Scarlett is taking risks she shouldn't, and while she has yet to be severely injured, it is only a matter of time. This happens in Late 2010 when she and Low-Light go to Delaware to stop Over Kill and his Vectors from stealing gold and diamonds from a repository there. She is injured from being over confident, but even this does not change her tactics. As soon as she is cleared from medical, she once again goes out and does more of the same. She is on an almost self-destructive path, but while on this path, she is dealing heavy blows to Cobra, and the Joe Command is having trouble reconciling the results versus the risks. Hawk, Duke, and Flint are arguing to pull her in, while the Jugglers are pushing to let her continue. Their thought is 'What is one solider, in the long run?'. When Cobra attempted to reclaim the Cobra Consulate, it was she that ordered a team to attempt to knock Cobra out of the building, and it was she that authorized, and personally led the team that went in after the first attempt failed. She is starting to subscribe to the philosophy that it is 'Better to beg forgiveness, than to get permission, especially when you are right', rather than worry about all the red tape. This second attempt succeeded, however, Baroness, Major Bludd and Interrogator, who had taken refuge inside, were able to escape, while leaving a troop of BATsbehind to wreak havoc on [[[New York City]], and Scarlett had to deal with the aftermath of this. In June of 2011 when Banshee went missing from a Hospital in San Antonio, Scarlett took it on herself to find her, and spent almost two weeks trying to find the woman, and just as she was giving up, Banshee returned, different. This caused Scarlett to reach out to the Autobots, for help. However, before she get very far with the Autobots, Cobra [[Al-Alawi Invasion TP}invaded Al-Alawi]]. Just as she and Spike were making progress on negotiations, she was ordered to lead a force into Al-Alawi to begin the process of removing Cobra. She took a flight of Boeing AH-64 Apaches Helicopter accompanied by Ghostrider and a flight of F-35 Lightning II's against the Cobra Terror Drome and their forces. The Apaches were wiped out, and the F-35's were forced to fall back. Scarlett was the only survivor from the Apache flight. She was able to escape the Ground forces, by using her Crossbow to fire a net around Interrogator and Over-Kill, and escape. See: Air Skirmish at Al-Alawi She was able to radio the Joes, and report the situation, but soon, a Jamming signal prevented any radio signals from getting out of the country. She stayed close to the Terror Drome, to gather intelligence, and was able to confirm that Cobra had captured the Crown Prince. However, soon after that, she was again confronted by Interrogator and Over Kill, and this time, they were able to severely injure her, and while she again was able to escape, she knew she was in trouble. See: Search Party and Settling a Score. She spent a week trying to get out of the country, many of them flat on her back. After two days of wandering the desert, a group of Kurds found her, and took her in. They had watched her battle Cobra, and decided she was on their side. They did their best to care for her wounds, while carrying her to the Al-Alawi/Iraq border, where she was able to get a signal to the Joes, bringing them up to date on the situation in Al-Alawi. The Joes launched a massive assault on Al-Alawi, but were pushed back. However, they did retrieve Scarlett, bringing her back to the Pit. See: Battle at Al-Alawi. While she recovered from her injuries, she was 'talked' to by many of her friends, and shamed into thinking about her recent actions, and how they would feel about her death, if she had died on one of her 'suicide runs'. She promised she would try to make sure she always had a way out, if possible. To prevent more suicidal runs, however, Hawk made her Duke's second, giving her more field command duties. Before she was even out of Medical, she was tested. The world started to flood. She was forced to give orders to many Joes she had never worked with much, while still working on ideas for kicking Cobra our of Al-Alawi. Before any of her ideas for Al-Alawi could be implemented, Cobra took the Country, renamed it to The People's Republic of Cobra Unity or the CU, and got official U.N. recognition. However, Scarlett submitted a plan to use an Old Mobile Command Center on the Iraq border to keep an eye on Cobra, and than turned her attention to the Flooding problem. When it was discovered Megatron and the Decepticon's were behind it, she was forced to swallow her pride, and form an Alliance with Cobra. This was after the Pit was flooded, and there was little way for the few people remaining inside to get out. Scarlett was trapped inside, but she found a way for her, and a few others to get out. In the Motor Pool were a wing of SHARCs, brought in for repair, that had been finished. They used the Elevator as an Airlock, and swam to the SHARCs. Scarlett used this method as a way in and out of the Pit many times. See: Strange Bedfellows In November, Scarlett joined the Joes on the USS Flagg, to prepare for an attack on the North Pole facility of the Decepticons, and while there, she had an encounter with an Autobot that made her wonder if some of them were more child-like than Spike ever wanted to admit. See: Housebreaking Air Raid. She was also forced to engage Windshear, where she lost yet another F-35, bringing her total of destroyed Prototypes to 3. She also was forced to eject into the icy waters of the North Atlantic, and suffered Hypothermia. While in the water, she decided she would never fly an F-35 again, as they seem to be bad luck for her. She assisted lead the raid on the Northern Facility, both from the deck of the USS Flagg, by using a Sniper Rifle to shoot out the optics of Scourge and by flying an old Skystriker XP-14F, one of the last aboard the Flagg, into combat against Valour, to prevent the Cobra Kingsnake from being destroyed. Scarlett's plan for the Mobile Command Center was approved, but before the base could be completed, in Iraq, Cobra forces attacked it, and destroyed it. (See Log: 8-8-2012) Scarlett spent the next two years in Al-Alawai, mostly with the Kurd Rebels, fighting a losing battle against Cobra's take over of the Country. She rarely emerged from the country, and when she did, it was only for short periods of time. One of the times she did emerge was for the unveiling of the new Skystriker, the Skystriker XP-21F. Finally in late December of 2013, she returned to the Pit, in bad shape, physically, emotionally, and with news of the total destruction of the Rebel Forces she was fighting with. She spent a week receiving medical attention, before she was even allowed to return to the Pit, and even after returning to the Pit, Lifeline recommended psychological therapy for her, which, for once, she did not fight, and she has been attending regular sessions with Psyche-Out. In Early January of 2014, She engaged Over-Kill in New York City (See Log: You making a Movie?), and sustained some injuries. While recovering from these injuries, she left medical, without clearance, and closed on a farmhouse, 30 miles west of Offut A.F.B.. In 2015 she was sent to Iraq to replace Beachhead as advanced infantry trainer. In 2016 she returned to the US. In 2017, she was re-assigned to Pit I in Fort Wadsworth.OOC Notes  Scarlett formerly Led the Alpha Strike Team of the Joes. She now leads Strike Team Bravo. She also spent long periods of time leading Rebel Forces in Al-Alawai/Cobra Unity.

I want all Intelligence personel to check into it, get with your Contacts, check known Cobra Bases for signs of a Military Buildup, Recon Flights and Satelite passes should be stepped up. Communications Personnel, I want taps into all Cobra Communications and Internet Networks. Confirm the rumors. All other Joes should be ready, on a short notice. The last time Cobra Island went Civil War, we were sent in to clean up the mess, and I want Assault Teams Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie on Full Combat Readiness. I have no idea which side we will be supporting, if any, but be ready to go. One team will remain on full Alert Status on each Shift. Alpha from 0 hundred hours, throu 0800, Bravo from 0800 until 1600, and Charlie from 1600 until 0 hundred. All times Central Time, based on the Location of the PIT. Team Leaders probably need to see me, after we get an Intelligence update. ScarlettSep 28 - RE: Destro  TO: Lifeline FROM: Master Sergeant Shana 'Scarlett' O'Hara RE: Destro Lifeline, if you spot Destro again, let me know immediately. I have been unable to contact him, as I have been ordered to, and I am not above coming to Seattle, and ambushing, metaphorically, on the street. ScarlettSep 30 - IC Report  TO: G.I. Joe Command And Intelligence Staff\nFROM: Master Sergeant Shana M. \"Scarlett\" O'Hara\nRE: Destro As per orders from Flint, I met with Destro, about the situation on Cobra Island. Things are not looking good for the Possible Civil War there. He told me that he handed Cobra Island, and by default, Cobra, over to Baroness. So, the Civil War is not going to happen, and we missed out chance to kick Cobra off the Island, and to make any deals with Destro, it appears. ScarlettNov 11 - IC: After Action Report  TO: Joe Command\nFROM: Master Sergeant Shana M. \"Scarlett\" O'Hara\nRE: After Action Report: 11/10/2009 - Cape Canaveral Upon learning about the capabilities of the latest Satellite NASA intended to launch, Geo-Exploration (Oil and Precious Metal Exploration), I decided to ensure the Satellite's safe launch, by attending in person, with a full Green Shirt Technical Crew. Corporal Oaks detected a pair of Incoming Vectors, and I prevented the Cobra Attack to either destroy, or more likely, steal the Satellite. Wisp, in her Lightning II was able to beat back their Airsupport Night Raven, while I engaged Major Bludd, and Over Kill. The Greenshirt Technical Crew handled the B.A.T.s effectively. NASA successfully launched the Satellite, and telemetry links are normal. ScarlettDec 22: After Action Report (IC)  TO: G.I. Joe Command\nFROM: Master Sergeant Shana 'Scarlett' O'Hara\nRE: Wright Patterson Air Force Base On the night of 12-21-2009 I was checking the Security around the Old Pit at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, when Cobra Attacked. Over Kill's Vectors bombed the Airfield, taking out most of the runways, all of the Support Buildings, and all Aircraft with the exception of three F-18's, two F-15's, and Slipstream's Conquest X-30. I was injured a little in the explosion, which is why it took me a little while to respond to Over Kill... He was on the ground, attacking the Base. Slipstream Responded immediately to the Air Threat, preventing the Vectors from causing any further collateral damage. During the fight with Over Kill, I had him disabled, but the Vectors tried to rescue him, and severely injured me. Thanks to Lifeline, I am not going to die, but at the moment, I can not move my legs... I hope that will change, but Lifeline will have to answer that question. Slipstream and Wisp must have gotten me back to the Pit, and they also must have driven the Vectors off.... But Wright Patterson will be ineffective as an Air Force Base for the foreseeable future... But it appeared that all the underground facilities were undamaged, and the prior Pit's Location does not appear to be compromised. ScarlettDec 23 - Scarlett's Medical Report, by Lifeline  Scarlett sustained some serious injuries in last night's attack, including abdominal lacerations which caused considerable internal bleeding. She had some minor bruising and lacerations to several internal organs, and one of the lacerations cut very close to her thoracic vertebrae and her spinal cord. Fortunately, nothing was severed. The paralysis that she's experiencing now is due to inflammation interfering with spinal nerves. In other words, it's a temporary situation, until the swelling and infection goes down. There may be need for a second surgery to stabilize some of the other internal injuries, but I really want to wait and see, because there's a chance it may not be necessary if she does well in coming weeks. I'm sending a notice out to Joes with 'O-Type' blood to please donate for Scarlett. She bled heavily during surgery, and she will need a steady supply in coming days. Donation is painless, and it only takes about half an hour.2010 January Jan 08 - RE: Snapdragon  TO: Command Staff, Psyche-Out\nFROM: Master Sergeant Shana 'Scarlett' O'Hara\nRE: Snapdragon I will reiterate my position from many months ago, that being: I do NOT trust her. Even more now that I saw her sucking up to Cobra Personnel, especially Major Bludd, at the Cobra Holiday Party. It seemed a lot more than just polite discussion, but I was unable to get close enough to listen in. I highly recommend that Ms. Arkoma not be given access to the PIT, or any Secrets we wish to keep. Perhaps, as such, we should consider relocating the PIT, if she already knows the location for certain. Call me Paranoid, or what you will, but I have my concerns. ScarlettFeburary IC NOTE Fri Feb 12  Note found on Scarlett's Intelligence Console. Posted to the General G.I. Joe Message Server by an overzealous Greenshirt Tech.

Repeated incursions from the otherside have included known members of the Othersides G.I. Joe Team, Copies of this Side's Cobra Vectors, and at least one person that claims to not be like the rest of the G.I. Joe Other-Sides. Slipstream. He is being detained at Fort Pendelton, awaiting questioning. We need more Security Details, and we also might need to go to the Otherside, and see what we can find out about what they are doing here. Personally, I recommend that if anyone goes, it be a small team, and it should be ordered to *only* be there for at most, 24 to 48 hours.\n Team should consist of: Intelligence Specialist Recon Expert Medic Heavy Weapons Specialist Communications Expert Computer Expert This mix will allow for the best possible Intelligence, and Defensive Action (If needed), they should all be members of the G.I. Joe team, if possible, as they will be able to fight their way out of most situations, if they have to. Recommend against any other than a Foot, or possibly Automobile/All Terrain Vehicle, Incursion, due to the possibility of them being out of place. The Intelligence Specialist should be either myself, Lady Jaye, or Chameleon. The three of us have an eye that allow us to gleem the most important information the quickest. Recommended Members of the Team include:\n Intel: Scarlett, Lady Jaye, or Chameleon\n Recon: Stalker Or Snake-Eyes\n Medic: Evac or Lifeline\n HW:Roadblock, Rock'n'Roll, or Heavy Duty\n Comms: Dial Tone or Mainframe\n Computers: Mainframe or Dial tone The Communications and Computer Experts, might possibly be filled by one person, but I would request than that we add another Weapons Specialist, Perhaps Bazooka, or an Infantry Specialist, Like Footloose, Leatherneck, or Grunt.

As such, I have ordered that he be treated more like a guest, than a prisoner. He is voluntarily staying at Camp Pendelton, in the Brig, but he will be allowed, under escort, outside for two hours a day, allowed to smoke, and be provided with soft drinks, from time to time.

Joe Command Staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff (Pentagon), Secretary of Defense, White House Chief of Staff, Vice President, PotUS (President) From: Sergeant Major Shana M. O'Hara, CODE-NAME: Scarlett RE: The Pit After throughly reviewing all Intelligence files for the last several years, I have been left with no doubts that Cobra likely has figured out where the Pit is located. If Cobra knows, and if they plan on resuming their Terrorist Strikes on American targets, like Baroness Anastasia DeCobray has claimed they will do if we do not re-open Peace Talks with them, than we have to assume the Pit would be a High-Priority target. I would like to recommend that we begin an immediate dispersal of all essential personal to a secondary site. I have chosen four sites that make the most sense, and listed them in order from best suited to our needs to least. (See attached Report on Site Reports) For a T-A-D (Temporary Away Duty) Assignment breakdown, I would recommend all Naval Personal be equally divided between the U.S.S. FLAGG and Ingleside Naval Air Station 20 Miles NorthEast of Corpus Christi, Texas. Our Air Force Personal should be T-A-D'd to Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi and Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Our Marine Personal should be T-A-D'd to Marine Corp Detachment of the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, and to the Marine Corp Air Station Miramar, in Miramar, California. The Army Personal should be T-A-D'd to Fort Hunter Ligget, in California, Fort Polk, in Louisianna, Fort Stewart in Georgia, and Fort Sill, Oklahoma. These T-A-D Assignments allows for maximum Coverage of the U.S. Mainland from attacks by our main threat, Cobra, from their main base, in the Gulf. It does divide the team, which I do not like, but until such a time as a central location big enough to handle the entire team is put together, we will have to break the team down into smaller teams. I can prepare a more formal breakdown of assignments as needed, and forward those to the appropriate people. The list of sites I have chosen for possible locations for the Pit V locations are as follows, with their Pros and Cons listed: 1) Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska Large, Defunct Strategic Air Command Base. Most of the Above and Below Ground Structure we need is already in place. The location is almost the exact middle of the Country. The only downside is that the SAC base is no longer in full service, but the Air Base is in full service. We could quietly reactivate the SAC part of the base, and having people there would not be too large of a problem. 2) Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma There is plenty of room to build, both above and below ground on the base. The base is located centrally in the Country and would allow the quickest response time to any part of the United States. However, the thousands of new people that the Pit would bring in Joes, Greenshirts, and Support Staff might be noticed. 3) Andrews Air Force Base, Prince George County, Maryland Close to Washington, close to High Value Targets. Influx of Military Personal would not be noticed. However, Difficulty in building the underground facilities and less than ideal centralization due lead to questions in idealness of location. 4) Edwards Air Force Base, Los Angeles, California Large Area for above ground building, however, Earth Quake Zone, and Location for Reaction time to Other Locations not ideal. My recommendation: Offut AFB, Omaha, Nebraska Master Sergeant Shana M. O'HaraMay 20 - IC Report: Mexico  TO: Joe Command FROM: Sergeant Major Shana 'Scarlett' O'Hara RE: Mexico I have noticed something odd going on in Mexico. Cartel Activity is High. And there seems to be new players involved. Attached are surviellence photos we have of known Cartel members, involved in a shoot out with At least two, if not three Cobra Agents in El Paso, Texas, Confirmed Identifications on Sebastian Bludd, AKA Major Bludd, Diana Bourne, AKA Artemis, and tenative ID, on Heather Pennington, AKA Tele-Viper 742, and believed to be now called Wiretap. Pictures of all three in Civilian Clothing. Each involved in a shoot out with Cartel Members, Artemis from the Back of a MotorCycle, Wiretap from behind a Bench, covering another Cartel Member, and Bludd from inside an SUV Bludd and the Blond, believed to be Pennington have been spotted across the border in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico. It seems Cobra is either fighting against the Cartels, fighting with the Cartels, or both. This also goes along with Signals traffic (OOC: Radio Chatter, Cell Phone Taps, Landline Phone Taps, E-Mail Hacks, Chat-Room Hacks, etc) that Headman may be active in Mexico. This may be where he went after escaping custody. I will continue to monitor the situation. --ScarlettMay 20 - \"Red in El Paso\"  Scarlett has heard of Cobra Operatives operating in Mexico and El Paso.

I found something gruesome in the remains of the Rage we destroyed... I found the remains of Dr. Jonathon Grimes, Veterinarian. He was bound, gagged, and strapped into the Rage, likely as a hostage. I found nothing to indicate where the Commander, Baroness, and Artemis went. I did however, find two more males, wearing the uniforms of Range-Vipers, although, Fingerprints and DNA will be required for Identification. Their heads were missing... Or, perhaps I should say, their heads were spread over a 30 foot radius from their bodies, like something blew them up from the inside.May 27 - \"Late Night Talk\"  Scarlett has Plans to Catch a Ninja...

Joe Members FROM: Sergeant Major Shana M. \"Scarlett\" O'Hara RE: The Pit It is the opinion of myself, and some of the Other in the Intelligence Department, that the Pit's location has probbly been comprimised, and that Cobra knows the location. We have been here for years, and as such, I have recommended a new location for the Pit. (See Intelligence Report Dated: 05-10-2010, Declassified for the whole team now.) Orders have come down from 'On High', regarding the Pit. The Pit will be closing shortly. We will be moving to the Old S.A.C. Base under Offut Air Force base, as soon as it has been retrofitted to be our new Base. The retrofit should only take 1 month, at most, and during that time, Team Alpha will provide Security and Intelligence Coverage for the Base, while Teams Bravo, Charlie, and Delta will be sent to different Military Instalations around the Country, to provide over all coverage of Hot Targets. Bravo will head to Edwards, Charlie, to Andrews, while Delta will be at Tinker A.F.B, along with most of our Air Assests. The U.S.S. Flagg will also be a location we place a Small Team. Three Members of Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta will be assigned to the Flagg, to be a mobile reaction force, along with the other half of the Air Assests. As soon as the Offut Pit is prepared, all teams will be reassigned to that location. Report to your Team Leaders for assignment. This Pit needs to be empty in 1 week.

'Scarlett' O'Hara RE: Washington D.C. After Action Report Storm Shadow was spotted by National Media in Washington D.C. and as the closest Agent likely to be able to stop whatever plans he had, I assigned myself the task of going after him. I commandeered an F-22 from the Offut Airfield, and flew to Andrews. I went to the location of his siting, and found clues leading me to the top of the Lincoln Memorial, where I found Storm Shadow. I attempted to arrest him, he refused. A Fight ensued, but in an effort to keep property damage down, I did not use firearms. In the fight, Storm Shadow sustained many injuries, I only recieved a couple. The worst was a shattered right elbow that required surgical repair. Lifeline has completed the repairs, and I am sure he will make a report on the surgery when his notes are complete. Storm Shadow escaped. I am not sure, if any of the violence is Storm Shadow's work, other than the explosions. They were too perfectly timed with the start of the combat, to be anything other than part of his plan.

ScarlettAugust 17 - IC: After Action Report - The Pit  TO: G.I. Joe Command, Joint Cheifs, SecDef, PotUS FROM: Sergeant Major Shana M. O'hara, Codename: Scarlett RE: The Fort Hood Pit I was returning to the Fort Hood Pit for a follow up check up on the elbow surgery I had, when Cobra launched an attack on Fort Hood. As I had feared, Cobra knew where we were. The dispersement plan I had set in place meant they did not catch many of us here, but it also meant, most of our forces were unable to respond to the attack. We beat back the ground forces they commited to the attack, but their air support started bombing, and we were forced to retreat back into the Pit. The Bombs from their Air Cover damaged the Hatches Leading to the surface, warping them. We can not get them open from the inside. We dare not try to cut them open from the inside, or outside, because we are on recycled oxygen. I have initiated evacuation procedures, and all Joes are ordered to the Lower levels to use the Escape Plans Beta and Delta. I will set the Demolition charges, so that if anyone tries to get in, before we return to remove our equipment, the place will blow... All G.I. Joe members in the Pit were ordered to report to Wright Patterson as a rallying point. I will be heading back to Offut, when I get out, to make sure the final preparations are complete, so that the Joes can move in. ScarlettAugust 19 - IC Report: Fort Hood Pit  TO: G.I. Joe Command FROM: Scarlett \nRE: Fort Hood Pit The Fort Hood Evacuation is complete. I have made sure that everyone has been evacuated, and no one is inside. Every computer has been purged, and the data sent via hardwire to the Central Database at the Pentagon's Secure Site. I have placed the Anti-Tampering Charges on the Computer Core Units, as well. We can attempt to open the hatches into the Motorpool, to get the vehicles stored in Vehicle Storage out, or we can blow the whole thing up, and bury everything under tons of rock, at your discretion. I have sealed off the Emergancy exits, and the sites are under remote surviellence. As of now, the Joes assigned to Fort Hood as a Station keeping unit should all have arrived at Wright Patterson. I propose a staged move to Offut, over the course of the next week, to slowly move them into the New Pit.

From my reading of the story, it could possibly be used to severely damage the weather patterns of the United States, and cause either a drought, or too much rain. Either would destroy the agricultural system of the United States, and require us to buy food from another country... one who pays Destro to do such evil. There is also the possibility of causing cold weather throughout all of the United States, or intensifying the cold in the North part of the country, again, causing us to purchase what is needed from outside the U.S., for example, Heating Oil. This could destabilize the U.S. Economy even more. We need to consider getting close to Destro, somehow...

'Scarlett' O'Hara\n RE: Cobra Consulate After Action Report Lowdown and I led a team of Greenshirts against the Cobra Consulate, to kick out the trespassers. Lowdown quickly took The Baroness down with Sniper fire, while I lead the Greenshirts in the assault on the main building. Lowdown engaged Interrogator, with Sniper fire, while I took Major Bludd in closer range combat. We forced the High Value Targets to flee, via the roof, while capturing many Vipers. However, Cobra deployed many BAT's via airdrop, and we were forced to engage them, giving many of these Vipers a chance to flee. By the time we took out all but the final five BAT's, who we have teams tracking, after they broke into the Sewers, too many Joes were injured, or killed, along with several NYPD cops that were trying to keep the BAT's off of civilians. If Cobra has returned to using BAT's in this manner, we will be forced to prepare for it. I have ordered that as many of the BAT's that is possible to be reconstructed, be taken to a secure location at Edwards Air Force Base, so that we might have training missions practicing on taking BAT's out quickly, and effectively. -ScarlettJune Jun 30 - RE: Abduction  TO: Joe Command, Intel Division, Air Command\n FROM: Scarlett\n RE: Banshee I want all Intel assets that can be spared, to be tasked with finding Banshee.

It did not take her long to arrive, and while in the process, she informed me that she had witnessed a Decepticon attack an Autobot, and provided a rough location. I passed this information on to the Autobots, via Spike Whitwicky. Mr. Whitwicky returned information on Anastasia DeCobray, AKA The Baroness, and her interest in Mr. Whitwicky's newborn daughter Megan, and in Ebony, by duplicate from across the dimensional rift. This information will be forthcoming in an Intelligence Report. Coldshot (P.O. Woolfe) and myself went to meet Lt. Henshaw on the flightline of Offut A.F.B., where she arrived in what I can only describe as a suit of what would appear to be Iron man Armor, but in a different color scheme. Her story is that she was taken from Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, Texas, by a Decepticon, named Thunderwing. He did.... whatever it is that was done to her. I was still in contact with Mr. Whitwicky, and I invited him and an Autobot scientist to Offut to investigate this Exosuit. They arrived and began a series of visual scans, along with some kind of scan that is beyond our technology, or my ability to explain, except that it looked like a cross between a Star Trek Tricorder, and a Star Wars Holographic Projector. They sent this information to something called Teletraan Two. They also invited Lt. Henshaw and myself to return with them to their base, for further tests. I am going to accept this invitation, for a few reasons. I am going to leave Gung-Ho in Command of the Pit, awaiting Duke, Hawk, or Flint's return from their other assignments, but I do imagine, in case of emergency, that the Autobots will not stop me from leaving their base. I will also be in daily radio contact, and my receiver will be on at all times. I am going to take a small group, myself, Lt. Henshaw, P.O. Woolfe (Coldshot), and perhaps one other. --ScarlettJuly 20 - IC Report  TO: All Joe Forces FROM: Sergeant Major Shana M. ' Scarlett ' O'Hara RE: Cobra Al-Alawi Invasion I have just confirmed that Cobra is involved in the Al-Alawi invasion. Recon Satelitte Imagery shows what appears to be a Cobra TerrorDome being built in the SouthEasternmost part of Al-Alawi. Between our Satelitte, and the Autobot Satelitte (Which I have just confirmed they have at least one of), it is obvious that Cobra is at least involved as a supplier of the Invasion Force. However, the construction is being handled by Techno-Vipers, their Purple Uniforms are impossible to miss. *Insert two different images, one conventional Recon Sat Image, one much sharper, much more zoomed in image, with an Autobot logo in one corner* Consider this a War-Warning, Joes. As soon as the Brass gives the orders, we will deploy to the Middle East to stop Cobra, or their puppets. All Vehicles should be spot checked, and made combat effective. All Leaves are cancelled. All personnel on leave, are recalled. All personnel are to gather their Combat gear, and be ready to board planes for deployment with one hours notice. I will have an advanced team ready to deploy within 10 hours. The TerrorDome appears to be 25% complete, or so, giving us less than 26 hours to take it down. Await Orders, Joes. Be vigiliant.

Joe Team, Special Attention Command and Intelligence FROM: Sergeant Major Shana M. ' Scarlett ' O'Hara RE: Al-Alawi Intelligence report I have speant many days watching Cobra forces, in Al-Alawi. I can confirm, for a fact, that they have captured Crown Prince Nassir Ali ibin Abassa. He is inside the Terror Drome. I can also confirm the presence of Baroness. She arrived Thursday, July 28th, late in the afternoon. I have been avoiding contact with Cobra Forces, as much as possible, after an encounter with a New Over Kill unit **Insert Photgraph of new Crimson Over Kill Unit, taken as he disembarks a Vector, heading for a Terror Drome in the Desert** and Interrogator. I sustained some injuries, and since than, I have made friends with a group of Kurds living in a series of caves in the Western most part of Al-Alawi. They helped me cross the border in Iraq, so that my Communications would get through. Cobra has some kind of Communications Blackout inside Al-Alawi, for all but their own forces. I will return to Al-Alawi, as it appears Cobra is massing forces for a major push, of some kind further into Al-Alawi. The Kurds are trying to pick off lone Cobra Troops, or small bands, but Cobra has taken to patroling in Squadron Size or better. It may have something to do with me picking off a few of their teams completely, early on. Or it could just be the fact that they have enough reinforcements to upgrade their patrol sizes. Don't take too much longer in getting here, or Cobra will be too entrenched to kick out.

Flagg is to maintain its present location and duties. Joe Naval Forces not assigned to the Flagg should begin a systematic search of the Polar Icecaps, what is left of them, for the source of the melting. Scientists agree this was too sudden for any natural cause, not to mention Megatron has taken credit for it. Joe ground forces not assigned to the Pit, which may very well be under water in the next few days, should head to high ground, the Rockies, by preference, and prepare to strike at whatever the Navy finds. The same is true for Air Forces. All Air Assets are being transferred to Air Force Bases above the potential flood planes, and their crews shall go along. Strike Team Alpha, currently assigned to the Pit, should be prepared for further orders, pending funding, to Iraq, to watch over the Cobra Forces in Al-Alawi. If funding comes through, we will have a base build... Otherwise, we will do so from the Mountains, with the assistance of the Kurds. If Offut is flooded, Emergency Protocol Alpha Niner Bravo will be initiated, sealing the Pit, making it airtight, and internal Life Support Systems will be turned on. If you are trapped inside the Pit when this happens, be prepared for a long term confinement. If you will not be able to handle this, you need to see me immediately, to get orders to deploy to the Flagg, or to one of the other teams. ScarlettSeptember Sept 19 - IC Report: The Pit Flooded  TO: All Joe Forces FROM: Scarlett RE: Flooding All forces inside the Pit are now trapped. The flooding above us has reached the 5 foot mark, and any attempt to unseal the Pit will lead to flooding the entire place. If there is an emergancy, the underground escape pods can be used, but only for medical emergancies that the Medical Bay is not able to handle. For now, we are out of the fight, unless we are ordered to abandon the Pit. ScarlettSept 22 - IC Report: North Pole Ice Cap  TO: G.I. Joe Command, Intelligence Division FROM: Scarlett RE: North Pole Ice Cap Satelitte Imaging indicated a Cobra Sea Ray flying over the North Pole, and the Pit Motor Pool Camera showed a S.H.A.R.C. that had just had repairs completed upon it. I used the Main Lift as an airlock, an swam to the S.H.A.R.C. and used it to investigate the Northern Ice Cap. I found no indication of the Sea Ray, but it appears Cobra is interested in the Ice Caps. We should run Recon Runs, in Force, over and under both ice caps, and see if we can learn anything. ScarlettSept 27 - IC Orders: Alert Status  TO: Joes FROM: Scarlett RE: Upcoming Mission All Joes, especially the Naval and Air Operations divisions, shall be on High Alert. We have an upcoming mission, that will involve us working with Cobra to destroy one of the sources of the flooding causing so much difficulty to the planet. No. I do not trust Cobra any further than I could throw a Mauler, but these orders have come down from the VERY top. However, whatever forces go in with Cobra's strike team will be backed by a strike team of our own, ready to pull them out of the fire, if Cobra gets any funny ideas, after the fact. Any one that can make it to the Flagg, or any of our remote air fields should begin making their way there, this mission will go off with little warning. ScarlettNovember Nov 7 - IC Report  TO: G.I.

We struck paydirt. I gave Major Bludd a copy of the Raw Data for Cobra Techs to Analyze, and a copy is attached to this as well, for anyone that needs it. I have Mainframe and Dialtone working their crews as hard as possible to analyze the data. Major Bludd and I will compare what both sides gleam for the Raw input as soon as the Analysis is complete.

' Scarlett ' O'Hara RE: After Action Report for Action Dated: 09 November 2011, 2100 EST I was speaking to Mr. Witwicky, Air Raid and Cuffs on the Flight Deck of the Flagg, and secured a promise of at least 20 Autobots to assist in the raid against the North Pole Facility, along with some Cybertronian explosives for the Demolitions teams to use in their mission. Shortly after Mr. Witwicky retired for the evening, and Air Raid went off to do... Whatever it is, that Cybertronians do when they are not busy, I continued to speak to Cuffs for a few minutes, about some underwater training missions in combination with the Joes and the Cobra Agents currently on the Flagg, when the Flagg's Radar picked up an Unknown Contact. The Alert Fighters had no pilots ready, so I took one, and went to investigate, while the Flagg prepared to scramble more fighter jets. The unknown craft was Cybertronian in origin, and had Decepticon markings. I ordered it to turn away from the Flagg, and when it refused, by opening fire, a battle ensued. A battle in which, I was shot down, and my F-35B Lightining II was destroyed. I was forced to eject 50 miles out from the Flagg, but Cuffs was able to drive the Decepticon Tetrajet off. He might be able to tell us the name of the Decepticon in question, if anyone wants to know it's name. I was picked up after 10 minutes, 3 of which I spent in the water. I have been informed my core temperature dropped at least 5 degrees, and that I am suffering the afteraffects of Hyperthermia. I am restricted to the Infirmary on the Flagg for the next 12-24 hours for observation. --ScarlettNov 15 - RE: Antarctic Assault  TO: G.I. Joe Command \nFROM: Sergeant Major Shana M.

'Scarlett'  O'Hara\nRE: After Action Report - Antarctica Assault In the last 24 Hours the Combined forces of the Joes, Cobra and the Autobots have assaulted the Decepticon Facilities at the North and South Poles. In both cases the Facilities were destroyed. In the North, the Flagg and Cobra Kingsnake were able to gain complete surprise over the Decepticon facility. Our Diving Teams were able to sneak in and blow up the facility, and our losses were minor. We lost a total of 20 jets, 30 more were damaged in one form or another. We lost 15 helicopters, 20 more damaged. Total Casualties were light up north. We had 15 killed, and 275 injured in one form or another. Some injuries were Hypothermia, but most came from falling debris hitting the Deck of the Flagg. At the South Pole, however, we lost 50 jets, with another 60 damaged. No Helicopters were involved. We did have ground forces involved, and they took a heavy cost from Megatron's Revenge, after the Installation was Destroyed. We sent in 50 Snow Cats, 20 Maulers, and 10 Equalizers; all were destroyed or abandoned. Casualty numbers there were much higher as well. 200 dead, 400 wounded. All have been evacuated to other bases. All Joes are to be commended, and as soon as possible, a memorial service will be held for our fallen comrades. -ScarlettDec 21 - IC Report (Skystriker XP-21F)  TO: G.I. Joe Command, G.I.

Ohara (Scarlett)\n RE: Africa Command Base - Germany (AAR) Last night the Africa Command base was attacked. I recognized one of the attackers as Artemis, but she was not wearing anything resembling a badge of Cobra. Instead she yelled something about the Red Shadows. I have attached a picture of the Red Shadow symbol she was wearing, and I am tasking the Joe Intelligence Group to find out whatever can be found out about the Red Shadows. Raven was injured fairly badly, Temera was only mildly injured, but Steel-Brigadier 910 is in serious condition. I am still awaiting reports from the Base Commander as to his losses, but they appeared severe. Recommend immediate influx of Joe Personnel to replace the Base Staff. Especially if this Red Shadows business is just a front for Cobra, and with Artemis leading last night's attack, I feel there is a chance the Red Shadows are related to Cobra.

Not long after I arrived, Cobra launched an attack. First a Mamba, than a Sea Ray. We fought them off, with the base taking minor, repairable damage. The Mamba escaped, but the Sea Ray was destroyed. It's pilot, I fought as they tried to escape back into Al-Alawi. However, I took a Spear-gun Spear through the leg, nicking my femoral artery, or so the medics tell me, and was unable to capture him. A flight of Cobra Rattlers were than dispatched, and they bombed the base. The damage was so severe, that there is no reason to attempt to repair it. We'll need to start over. I was airlifted to the Flagg, and after stabilization, I was taken to the Pit. I heard Cobra's faked news report, and at no time did I, or anyone else on the team, cross into Al-Alawi.

We will be using the 4 HISS Tanks that have been turned over to the Kurds, along with all the trained fighters. The Plan is fairly simple, but it has wrinkles in it. Two of the Kurd Squads will launch simultaneous assaults on a Water Filtration and Purification Faculty, and on the Cobra Hangars in Crown City. The rest of the force will be pre-positioned near the Oil Refinery, and as soon as any response is made, we will attack, if no response is made, it will be up to the onsite leadership, including myself, to decide if the attack should go forward.

'Scarlett' O'Hara\n RE: After Action Report: 2-3-2014 At approximately 1300 on 2-4-2014 (Local) Korean time, Decepticons attacked the Gwangyang Steel Works in South Korea. I responded to the call over the EARTH DEFENSE COMMAND frequency, as I was flying in Skystriker II #3140, on a routine C-A-P over the Pacific Ocean, and I was just crossing the Sea of Japan. Starscream, Valour, and an unidentified Decepticon were there in a Shuttle. Jetfire, Slingshot, and Silverbolt responded from the Autobots. We engaged the Decepticons, and were able to drive them off, without them being able to collect much, if any Steel from the Facility. The Skystriker sustained minor damage, and I was uninjured. Upon further review, we need to make sure all Joes are monitoring the EDC frequency, and if a call goes out over it, if we can get there in time, we need to respond to the attack.

As such, my first report is on what would appear to be the drawdown of personnel at the Mount Carmel location of the Church of the Coiled Serpent. I have had a Recon Sat. tasked to keep an eye on the place, since it was opened, especially consideing one of the members appears to be the Cobra Operative, Artemis. However, Artemis is not on site, and has not been for a week, at least. Thermal Imaging shows that only half the staff is left on site, and that has been slowly dropping to an even smaller number on a daily basis. My analysis of the situation is mixed. Either they are abandoning the Church, which without our intervention seems unlikely, or Cobra has a use for their operatives (As I have suspected from the begining that this Church was just a front for Cobra Activity) else where. I will try to ascertain the locations of where the known Cobra Operatives have been relocated to, but as yet, Artemis has not shown up anywhere in the World that I can find, and Customs does not show her leaving the country, at least not by legal means. -ScarlettFebruary 13 - IC Report: Tomax and Xamot  TO: G.I.

After a mid-air refueling north of Omaha, I recieved a message from Jetfire, Autobot, warning me to stay away from the Van Mark Production Corporation building in Detroit. Of course, seeing as how it is American property, I investigated. Three Decepticons, Valour, Dreadwind, and Slugfest were attacking the plant. I engaged them, after they failed to comply with orders to leave U.S. airspace. I was able to drive off Dreadwind, and than engaged Valour. After a few exchanbges of fire, I dropped a bomb on Valour, but it missed, and leveled the Van Mark building. I am on scene now, checking the building for survivors. I will report more, as I know it. -ScarlettApr 15 - IC: Report on Assignment  TO: G.I. Joe Command, G.I. Joe Intelligence \n CC: G.I. Joe Medical\n FROM: Sergeant Major Shana M.

The actions of the insurgents have not done a whole lot to force Cobra to withdraw from the country, but even with little to show for it, I believe we should continue to support the local population get their country back. The operations in Frusenland also came up empty, for the overall objective, but every little bit helps get the locals more confidence. For Medical, I will need a full physical before I can be returned to full active status, so as soon as someone is ready, they need only call for me. -ScarlettPlayers  Scarlett is currently played by The-Baroness.External Links Preferred Vehicles References Shattered Glass TP  TP Name: Shattered Glass TP Primary Characters: Ace (SG), Air Raid, Ansatsusha (SG), Aria (SG), Artemis (SG), Astrotrain (SG), Barbecue (SG), Blaster, Blazter (SG), Blizzard, Brawn (SG), Bug Bite (SG), Buster, Buster Witwicky (SG), Cain (SG), Carly Banas (SG), Chip Chase (SG), Circuit Breaker, Cobra Commander (SG), Cosmos (SG), Cuffs (SG), Dead End (SG), Deadline (SG), Deathsaurus (SG), Destro, Dr. Over-Kill (SG), Duchess (SG), Dust Devil, Ebony (SG), Flint, Gears (SG), General Flagg (SG), General Flint (SG), Goldbug (SG), Growler (SG), Gung-Ho (SG), Hound (SG), Huffer (SG), Ingenue (SG), Jazz (SG), Jetfire, Jetfire (SG), Jimmy Flagg (SG), Junkheap (SG), Kamakura (SG), Lowdown (SG), Lt Bludd (SG), Lifeline, Mainframe (SG), Major Bludd, Mal-Feasance, Megatron, Megatron (SG), Melinda Lossman (SG), Mockingbird, Mesocyclone, Old One (SG), Optimus Prime, Optimus Prime (SG), Over Kill, Perceptor (SG), Professor Arkeville (SG), Prof. Razorclaw, Prowl, Psyche-Out, Psych-out (SG), Ravage (SG), Ratchet (SG), Raven, Reflector (SG), Sandstorm (SG), Scott Bludd (SG), Scourge (SG), Sephie Beller, Shockwave (SG), Silverbolt, Silverbolt (SG), Skyfire, Skyfire (SG), Slugfest (SG), Snake-Eyes (SG), Snoop, Snoop (SG), Soundwave (SG), Sparkplug (SG), Spike, Spike Witwicky (SG), Stalker, Stalker (SG), Starscream (SG), Stormfront (SG), Stormwind, Taifeng (SG), Tasinia (SG), Temera (SG), Thundercracker (SG), Tomahawk (SG), Tonka (SG), Tunnel Rat (SG), Turborat, Typhoon, Ultra Magnus (SG), Xamot and Tomax (SG), Shattered Glass characters Primary Factions: Autobots, Cobra, Decepticons, G.I.

The Cons are gearing up to stop them, starting with an assault on the Ark's launchpad. Scouts from both sides have been sent to Earth, where they've gained the notice of G.I. Joe, Professor Arkeville, and the Witwicky brothers. Cobra has recently relocated to Springfield, and is hoping to now live at peace...MUX History  The Old One arrived on Cybertron in a flash of light in September of 2009, observed only by Turborat. Since then he has been seen in Polyhex, and has travelled to Earth, bringing Turborat with him. He infiltrated Autobot City, posing as this world's Alpha Trion, and gained access to Wheeljack's lab. In early 2010, the Decepticons staged a daring attack on the Autobots' stronghold in Iacon, destroying Iacon's launchpad and severely damaging the Ark, in hopes of delaying the Autobots' attack on Earth until after Cybertron enters the Plait Expanse, trapping the Autobots there. Meanwhile, back on Earth, General Flint and the G.I. Joes became aware of the Autobot and Decepticon advanced scouts on Earth. They captured Buster and Spike Witwicky to try to track down their former ally Goldbug, and hunted Skyfire, who only narrowly escaped an attack by Ace and Gung-Ho. In February of 2010, Alpha Trion discovered Old One in Wheeljack's lab. The Old One slashed Trion across the chest and activated a copy of Wheeljack's Seal-O-Tronic Interdimensional Channel Changer that the Old One had constructed using Wheeljack's notes and plans in Teletraan II, opening a portal to the Shattered Glass universe. Alpha Trion yelled an alarm, and Old One was interrupted by the arrival of Snoop, Spike, and Stormwind. Stormwind shot the Channel Changer out of Old One's hand, but he managed to escape through the portal. Spike and Stormwind got the injured Alpha Trion to the medlab, where Spike treated his injures and Trion disassembled the damaged Channel Changer, attempting to figure out how to seal the rift. Unnoticed, Snoop gave into her curiosity, and leaped into the portal. On the other side of the rift, Goldbug made himself known to Ebony, who was sitting on his hood in the Pit's motorpool. When asked his intentions, Goldbug revealed to Ebony that the Autobots were on Earth to learn of the humans' defensive capabilities -- something Ebony helped with immensely by bringing Goldbug into the Pit. Ebony suggested an alliance, which Goldbug sarcastically offered to mention to his superiors before blasting his way out of the Pit and escaping. Meanwhile, General Flagg at the Burpleson Air Force Base detected the rift opening up on the Shattered Glass side, and sent jets to chase the Old One as he escaped (although they failed to capture and apprehend him). He asked General Flint to sent help securing the Shattered Glass side of the portal, and Flint sent Snake-Eyes. Spacetime weakened by the Old One's act, a second rift opened in the southwestern United States, at the spot where Mirage had opened a similar portal by destroying the Space Bridge. Unnoticed by the Autobots for quite some time, a third portal opened just north of Decepticon City. Ravage and Sephie Beller travelled through the Southwestern rift, as well as many members of Shattered Glass G.I. Joe and a few Cobras. Scarlett also passed through the rift, infiltrating the Pit there and setting explosives before being discovered by Ebony and Flint. In the fight that followed, General Flint was killed. Mal-Feasance initially steered the V'Ger into deep space near Shattered Glass Cybertron, seeking to attack any ships that attempt to leave the planet before it entered the Plait Expanse. Following the Autobot Warship Ark and the Decepticon Interceptor Nemesis to Earth, on September of 2010 Capt. MAL-FEASANCE launched an attack against the Nemesis. Mal rammed the Nemesis with the V'Ger, and he and his crew swamped aboard, slaughtering all in their wake. While on the Nemesis Mal freed the prisoners Jetfire and Trailbreaker, and continued his rampage until stopped in battle by Deathsaurus. Mal was forced to withdraw, retreating to the far reaches of the Sol system to prepare for his next assault. Alpha Trion studied the rifts to the Shattered Glass universe, anxious to find a way to close them before permanent damage is done to the spacetime surrounding Earth. Traveling to the Temple of Knowledge, he found it ransacked, and the Underbase plundered and stolen. Fearing his nemesis was behind the act, Trion made contact with the Cyclonus from the other side of the rift, hoping the good Decepticons there would help him stop the Old One's destruction. However, he soon realized Cyclonus himself was compromised by the Old One. He turned to Professor Razorclaw and Lt. Commander Starscream for help, only to get Starscream arrested for treason. Taking the matter into his own hands, Trion prepared to seek out the Old One himself. When Mal used the V'Ger's space-folding drive to teleport past the Plait Expanse into orbit around Cybertron, and attacked the Weatherbots outside the Temple of Knowledge, Mesocyclone joined Alpha Trion, Dust Devil, Professor Razorclaw, and the rest of the Weatherbots in fighting them off. Mal's crew defeated, Mal was forced to retreat into the mountains, leaving his ship in the hands of the Autobots. Months later Alpha Trion, with the assistance of Dust Devil, infiltrated Skymount to rescue the rebel Starscream from Cyclonus's clutches. On the way there Alpha Trion transformed for the first time in recorded memory, shocking Dust Devil quite a bit. After rescuing Starscream, Trion and Dust Devil brought Starscream and the incidentally-captured Bug Bite back to the Temple of Knowledge, from where Trion planned his final assault against the Old One. Using information from Doctor Razorclaw, Trion directed the V'ger towards the Old One's last known whereabouts. However, the semi-sentient V'ger fought the Autobots' controls and crashed in Kaon. Undaunted, Alpha Trion and Dust Devil left the ship, setting off after the Old One on foot. Tracking his path, they found the Old One at last, who claimed to be waiting for them. After the Old One critically injured Dust Devil and escaped, Krunix interrogated Dust Devil while Alpha Trion went for help. Returning with Typhoon, Alpha Trion got Dust Devil back to the V'ger and saved his life, repairing him with what parts Blizzard could fashion aboard the Junkion ship. Trion ordered Dust Devil to remain in sickbay until he was fully recovered, which meant of course Dust Devil tried to escape as soon as possible. Longsight, who was in the V'ger's brig when it crashed in Kaon, had escaped into the walls of the ship. Longsight lay low until Dust Devil also tried to escape into the ship's infrastructure, at which time Longsight pounced, attempting to capture and eat Dust Devil. It took the combined efforts of Alpha Trion, Dust Devil, and Typhoon to drive Longsight from the ship; Longsight and Typhoon both had half their faces melted off in the process. Alpha Trion repaired Dust Devil AGAIN and resumed plans to capture the Old One. In March of 2012, Alpha Trion successfully tracked the Old One to his base, where the evil sage was waiting. Backed up by his henchman Blitzkrieg, the Old One attacked Alpha Trion with his Terminus Blade, critically injuring him before being driven back by Dust Devil and Firestar. Face shattered by Dust Devil's Ebon Blade, the Old One retreated with Blitzkrieg's aid, leaving the Terminus Blade behind. At first, Alpha Trion himself wielded the Terminus Blade, but quickly fell to its evil sway. Dust Devil fought Trion and won, taking the sword away from him. In return Trion built a special scabbard for the sword, entrusting it in Dust Devil's care for the time being. Together Alpha Trion and Dust Devil ventured to the Chamber of Omega Terminus to seek aid against the Old One. They were attacked by the re-animated corpses of Cliffjumper, Drench, and Hyperdrive, and were almost overwhelmed before Dust Devil drew the Terminus Blade, at which Omega Terminus called off his minions. Terminus told Trion what he needed to do to repair the rifts, and then sent the two Autobots back, erasing their memories of where they'd been or where they'd learned their critical information. Needing a scan of the Old One's Stellar Spanner in order to build a machine to close the rifts between the Shattered Glass universe and his own, Alpha Trion conceived a plan to lure the Old One out of Iacon so he could send in Chromia and Firestar to infiltrate the Autobot base. Alpha Trion and Dust Devil successfully lured the Old One away from Iacon, and using fake IDs programmed by Alpha Trion, the femmes were able to slip easily past Autobot guards Flattop and Subsea and venture into the city. After some minor run-ins with some additional SG-Autobot guards, Firestar and Chromia were able to successfully scan Old One's Stellar Spanner and return the schematics back to Alpha Trion. When Chromia and Firestar returned with the scans, they brought a mortally injured Frenzy (SG) with them. Chromia vowed his death would be avenged, but Frenzy stressed his wish to have no more bloodshed. Though Alpha Trion wasn't able to heal Frenzy's injuries, he was able to alleviate the pain he suffered from his injuries, and as a result, Frenzy died a peaceful death, surrounded by a new group of Autobot friends with Chromia was comforting him. Frenzy's last request that his remains to be taken back to Alpha Trion's world, but although he passed along Frenzy's wishes, he handed over Frenzy's body to Starscream and Windshear to make the final decision. Using the information brought back by the Autobot femmes, Alpha Trion isolated himself to work on a device to close the rifts, while Dust Devil worked with Trailbreaker to set up defensive installations in the temple. Meanwhile back on Earth, Lt. Bludd was captured by G.I. Joe and was being held at the Burpleson Air Force Base. In response to torture and threats again his family, Bludd revealed Cobra's hidden location in Springfield. After months of sitting on General Courage's desk, the information was finally acted upon by Courage in 2012 when he sent Joe tracker Tomahawk to Springfield to investigate the report. In 2013, Alpha Trion finally found a way to close the rift in the Temple of Knowledge, and transferred that information down to Earth, where Skyfire used it to close the rift in the Southwestern United States. When Buzzsaw came by Autobot City to gather information on the closing of the Shattered Glass rifts, Metroplex sent Scamper out to meet him. Scamper provided Buzzsaw with a dataslug containing information on the Cybertronian and Southwestern United States rifts, and logistical information in the goal of the Autobots and Decepticons working together to close the rift near Decepticon City. In August, after almost two years of investigation, the US government failed to turn up a single Cobra in Springfield, which had become a ghost town. Finally, in frustration, Secretary Hauser decided to use the situation to demonstrate the power of the GODS, and to have one last laugh at Bludd's expense, to punish him for the uselessness of his information. Zero took Bludd to a hill overlooking Springfield, and told him his family had been released and were living there safely. He then called down a GODS strike, destroying the entire town. Believing he'd just witnessed the death of his family (as well as the population of an entire city), Bludd snapped, savagely beating Zero and pinning him to his car. Zero begged for his life, telling Bludd his family was fine and had never been captured at all, and certainly weren't in Springfield when it was destroyed. Bludd didn't believe be could trust Zero, and felt it didn't matter anyway - he put Zero's gun against the Joe's broken face and fired, killing Zero instantly and messily.Post-TP  Continued in Shattered Glass The Movie.OOC  \"Shattered Glass\" is the name for the fictional universe and associated toys begun in conjunction with BotCon 2008. It is a \"mirror universe,\" where the bad guys are good, the good guys are bad, and (mostly) everyone has different paint schemes. The story is a Transformers take on the old sci-fi warhorse of an evil alternate universe, a concept previously seen in stories such as Star Trek's Mirror Universe and DC comics' Earth-Three. Bzero thought it would make a fun TP. Luckily, Carrie agreed. Carrie got a look at the Botcon issue of Shattered Glass and fell in love with it as soon as she was reading it. She loves it!\u00a0And Sephie Beller!\u00a0And\u00a0Ravage!\u00a0 The Shattered Glass comic and toyline are an inspiration for this TP, but there are many differences. For example, instead of Cliffjumper from our universe travelling to the Shattered Glass universe, we're going to have portals open allowing two-way travel between the worlds. Also, since Carrie hates *Master and Pretenders, any character using that technology in the comic will be a normal, non-shell pre-Master in our version of the SG Universe.Mature Themes Warning  The Shattered Glass universe is a little more hardcore and less PG than our usual MUX.Logs/Posts 1986 (SG) 1996 1991 (SG) 2009 Posts: Logs: 2010 Logs Posts: March 3 - Soviet Union Accuses US of Attacks  The Shattered Glass universe has been running a particular story all over the world lately.

He later joined the French Foreign Legion. He's worked as a military adviser in a number of countries and is wanted for crimes in Libya and Zimbabwe. He is proficient with every form of infantry weapon in current use. Bludd has a tactical mind like a steel trap. He is a qualified expert in all NATO and Warsaw Pact small arms. He also writes poetry... very badly:History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  \"All my life I've wanted to walk down the street with two million dollars in a Gucci bag. Now hand it over!\" -- Major Bludd (Comics history from Bludd's article on JMM's GI Joe Comics Homepage) Sebastian Bludd is one of the most infamous mercenaries in the world. He has worked as a terrorist, assassin and soldier-for-hire. His only loyalty is to money, and he has been known to turn on his employers if he finds a better opportunity. Bludd's expertise (and rank of Major) comes from his initial military training from the Australian Special Air Service. He later joined the French Foreign Legion, and finally became a freelance military advisor. He soon discovered that there was more money to be made in using his skills in the service of criminals, terrorists and revolutionaries, and his life as a mercenary began. Over the years, Bludd has also been known for writing poetry...bad poetry. (Though the Baroness once described his poetry as \"quite beautiful\".) He is possibly the only poet ever to use the word \"Uzi\". By 1983, Bludd was wanted for crimes in Zimbabwe and Libya. That same year, Major Bludd was hired by Cobra Commander to join his organization. The Commander kept his true agenda a secret: he had hired Bludd to kill Destro, fearing he could and would usurp his command.  Shortly afterward, Bludd participated in a battle against the G.I. Joe team in Washington, DC. He manned the turret of the HISS tank that was being driven by the Baroness. In the midst of the battle, Cobra Commander ordered Bludd to kill Destro. The Major took aim at Destro, but the Baroness realized what he was about to do and swerved, ruining Bludd's shot. The out-of-control tank crashed, and Bludd ran from the burning wreck, leaving the Baroness trapped inside as it exploded. The Baroness survived, but was badly burned by the blast. In the aftermath of the battle, Bludd made his escape, realizing Destro knew he had tried to kill him. Cobra Commander insisted that Bludd acted alone to keep the Baroness for himself. Bludd, meanwhile, made his way to a bus terminal where he hijacked a bus filled with passengers, including another fleeing Cobra agent, Scar-face. The Joes Stalker and Grand Slam caught up with the bus on motorcycle, as Bludd fired upon them. Bludd was taken by surprise when Grand Slam climbed atop the bus and smashed through the windshield, swinging inside. Bludd was momentarily distracted when he recognized Scar-face on the bus, allowing Grand Slam to subdue him. Once in custody, Bludd was taken to the hospital to be treated for his injuries. There, he learned the Baroness had survived the explosion the night before. He attempted to escape but was stopped by a patient -- Hawk. The Joes' leader had been shot during the battle and was being treated there. He had refused to give up his sidearm, and was able to recapture Bludd. The Major was later brought to Joe headquarters along with Scar-face and an unconscious Baroness. While they were in custody, Cobra staged a massive attack on the Joes' base. During the confusion of the battle, Bludd knocked out Doc while still handcuffed to the bars. Taking the keys from the Joes' medic, Bludd unlocked his own cuffs, and planned to escape with the Baroness in a Cobra FANG helicopter that had landed on the roof. It's pilot set explosives to destroy the fortress perched atop the Pit. He also decided to leave Scar-face in his cell, but Bludd was soon stopped in his tracks, held at gunpoint by General Flagg. Scar-face then kicked the pistol from Flagg's hands, allowing Bludd to pick up the gun and fire on Flagg, killing him. Despite Scar-face's help, Bludd still left him behind and took off with the Baroness (though he promised to write a poem about him). Scar-face was later killed by the explosion that destroyed the fortress. Eventually, Major Bludd made his way to Switzerland with the Baroness. He brought her to the Bern Institute of Reconstructive Surgery, where Dr. Hundtkinder restored her badly burnt face. While the Baroness recovered, Bludd made a phone call to Cobra Commander and demanded a ransom for the Baroness, threatening to tell Destro that he had been hired to kill him. The Commander was enraged, but had little choice but to pay him. The Commander made his way to Switzerland, allowing Destro to still believe the Baroness was dead. Once the Commander arrived, the Joes appeared, having been keeping Bludd under surveillance. In the fight that followed, Bludd and the Baroness escaped with the Commander's bodyguard, Storm Shadow. The Commander was captured by the Joes. Bludd and the Baroness returned to Springfield, where Destro was ready to kill Bludd for the attempt on his life. Fortunately for Bludd, Destro was taken aback by learning the Baroness was alive. Using the Commander's treachery and his feelings for the Baroness to manipulate Destro, she and Bludd planned to take control of Cobra in the Commander's absence. Their only stumbling block was Storm Shadow, who freed the Commander from the Joes. After the Commander returned to Springfield, Bludd was thrown into a jail cell for his treachery. The Baroness soon offered Bludd his freedom, in exchange for his help in planning the assassination of Cobra Commander. They sought out a boy named Billy, working in Springfield's anti-Cobra underground resistance. The brutal Bludd turned Billy into an assassin and provided him with the weapon to kill the Commander. The stage was set, and at a Cobra rally, Billy approached the Commander as a Cobra youth, holding a bouquet of flowers. The Commander was about to be gunned down when Destro stopped the boy from firing. His explanation was more surprising than his actions. He had recognized the boy -- he was Cobra Commander's son. In the inquest that followed, Bludd was pleased that the boy refused to give up his accomplices. After the inquest, Major Bludd eventually stopped working for Cobra altogether since the Commander knew he could no longer trust him. He contined his career as a mercenary, and was not seen by Cobra or G.I. Joe for years. After the apparent deaths of Destro and the Commander, Bludd was hired by Serpentor to pose as Destro in order to infiltrate his castle in Scotland and steal his copy of the plans to Cobra's Terror-Drome launch bases. The real Destro arrived home to discover the imposter, and with the Joes' help, he overcame his castle's defenses and beat Bludd in a fistfight. It's not known what Destro decided to do with Major Bludd, but the mercenary returned to his career some time after his defeat in Scotland. He had no contact with Cobra for the next several years. Major Bludd resurfaced in the Eastern European country of Borovia amidst the chaos that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. Snake-Eyes had been sent into the nation to rescue George Strawhacker, a member of the state department who was being held in a Borovian gulag. General Thurston Crowther, head of the committee of generals known as the Jugglers, sent Snake-Eyes on that mission, but he also secretly hired Major Bludd to kill Snake-Eyes. Strawhacker had been leaking false information to the Soviets, and if he returned to the United States, the false information would have been suspect. At the same time, Snake-Eyes' rescue attempt was staged so it would appear someone had tried to rescue Strawhacker. As the he arrived in the midst of ritoing Borovians, Bludd assured Metz, the man who hoped to be leader of the new Borovia, that his mission was for the good of the people of his country. When Strawhacker was killed anyway, Bludd opted not to kill Snake-Eyes, since Strawhacker's death made it unnecessary. He then sold out Metz by telling the people his plans. Bludd's actions could be perceived as honorable, but Snake-Eyes was becoming a hero to the Borovians and if Bludd killed him, he probably wouldn't have made it out of the country alive. Years after the incident in Borovia, Cobra Commander called upon Bludd to work for Cobra, but Cobra forces in Europe fell to a unified attack by regular military forces soon afterward. In the wake of this conflict, most of Cobra's \"high command\" disappeared. Bludd himself was captured and thrown into prison at Fort Leavenworth for two years until he escaped during a prison riot he himself incited. G.I. Joe, meanwhile, was disbanded, as well. Back in business, Bludd continued his mercenary work over the next few years. In 2001, Bludd was working for the former KGB agent, Colonel Nikita. Duke, the former Joe now working for a secret government agency, tracked Bludd down on orders to arrest him for various crimes including the murder of General Flagg. After Bludd sold weapons to a group of men in Italy, Duke arrived to arrest him. After a long chase, Bludd escaped by diving into the water from a high cliff. Duke didn't expect anyone could survive the fall, but Bludd managed to.MUX History:  In 1997, Bludd was hired again to work for Cobra, and put in charge of Cobra's ground forces. Due to the effects of the GI Joe: Eternal Youth TP, Bludd appears to be in his mid-forties. In 2001, Bludd was working for the former KGB agent, Colonel Nikita. Duke, working for a secret government agency, tracked Bludd down on orders to arrest him for various crimes including the murder of General Flagg. After Bludd sold weapons to a group of men in Italy, Duke arrived to arrest him. After a long chase, Bludd escaped by diving into the water from a high cliff. Duke didn't expect anyone could survive the fall, but Bludd managed to. Bludd was in command at Cobra's Colombia base for the last year or so it existed. He spent much of his time trying to figure out what makes Over Kill tick, and how to keep the android and his army of BATs and Vectors from storming off and forming their own army with Cobra equipment. He also took a side job from the Crimson Twins to hunt down an enemy of Extensive Enterprises. Major Bludd stayed on the sidelines during the brief almost-Cobra Civil War. Just before the not-war failed to break out, he made a very lucrative deal with Destro and as a result became the commander of Over Kill and his BAT and Vector forces again for a time. Eventually Over Kill, now known as 'X', broke with Cobra and Bludd's BAT contract expired. Following X's flight, Bludd left for a few weeks of R&R (and business) in Wales. During 2010 Bludd led an assault on Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, organised a snowplow convoy to free a suburban Philadelphia highway from snow during Baroness' positive PR campaign, retrieved a forgotten Cobra citizen from the ruins of the Colombia base, and conducted operations with his private military company in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. On returning to Cobra Island, he participated in raids on the Panama Canal and the Joes' PIT base in Fort Hood. Bludd left Cobra Island for a few weeks to find and capture his alternate self in the Shattered Glass universe. He was unable to complete this mission. He returned to Cobra Island in time to help Baroness deal with some troublesome events within Cobra. He took a side trip to New York to perform an assassination before he and the Baroness disappeared from Cobra Island for a couple of months. On his return in April of 2011, he investigated a warehouse where artifacts of Over Kill's history were stored. He, Interrogator, and Baroness broke into the closed and sealed Cobra Consulate in April of 2011. The Joes attacked them and forced the Cobras to retreat into the Consulate building, where they holed up for a few days before the Joes stormed the building. After recovering from his injuries, Bludd went back to the Shattered Glass universe and tried once again to capture his alternate self. Ebony, the Shattered Glass alternate of Scarlett, attempted to take Lt Bludd's wife Katherine prisoner, and Major Bludd went to her defence. Ultimately he and his alternate were struck down and captured by Ebony and were held at Burpleson Air Force Base (SG) for a time. Artemis' alternate unwittingly helped set up a diversion at the base, enabling Major Bludd to escape with the Baroness' aid. Lt Bludd was left behind and remained a prisoner for some time after the escape. Bludd headed up the Al-Alawi invasion in mid-2011 and orchestrated and led the assault that captured Crown City for Cobra. Al-Alawi has since been signed over to Cobra and re-named the People's Republic of Cobra Unity. After the world was flooded in late 2011, Baron Ironblood put Bludd in charge of orchestrating the assault against the Decepticons, with literally the world at stake. Bludd was part of the attack that defeated the Decepticons' flood operations, and was afterward assigned to Africa to lead Cobra's reconstruction efforts there. In 2012 Duke spent several months infiltrating Major Bludd's African contingent, hoping for a chance to apprehend and arrest the wanted mercenary. However, when he finally made his move, Bludd escaped, and Duke was badly beaten by Vipers before managing to extricate himself and flee the scene. Bludd himself returned to Cobra Unity. In 2013, Cobra Commander sent Major Bludd to Syria to offer Cobra's support to the beleaguered kingdom. In April, senior Syrian military commander Lt. General Ali Abdullah Ayyoub met with Bludd to discuss coordinating Cobra/Syrian efforts in retaking the southern Syrian town of Dael. On 27 June, Bludd led a devastating assault on the town, successfully reclaiming it for the government. On May 24th, Bludd, along with several other Cobra, G.I. Joe, and Transformer individuals disappeared from all over the world, awaking in the past. However, after helping to fix a problem threatening to alter the timeline, he was returned to the present. In late July, Bludd went to Zimbabwe, partly as a representative of Cobra, and partly because of his previous connections to Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. Mugabe was re-elected with a decided lack of violence, but Bludd stayed on in Harare for a time. He was out of contact with Cobra for a few weeks, but the Quintessons' interference with global communications may have been at least partly to blame for that. Major Bludd was later captured by bounty hunters and imprisoned. He eventually managed to escape. In December of 2015 Sly Rax recruited Major Bludd into working with VENOM. Bludd agreed to work with them. In 2016 Bludd was kidnapped by Dealiticus for psychological experimentation. He was eventually released unharmed, but not until after forming a strange friendship with fellow captive Kimber Benton. Soon after he helped VENOM agent Sly Rax escape after Rax infiltrated the Pine Gap facility in Australia. In the fall of 2016 Bludd was involved with Miles Mayhem's ruby crystal mining efforts in Australia. He parted ways with VENOM after MASK disrupted operations at the mine and has yet to make formal contact with Cobra. He was in New York City during the attack on that city by Dreadnoks and motorcycle gangs. After that, he travelled to Los Angeles to protect Kimber. While there, he saved Synergy from the burning Starlight Studios, and then offered to travel the world re-collecting the disparate Holograms. Raya was in Mexico visiting her extended family during Cobra's takeover of several US cities. Major Bludd found her there, and convinced her that he was an ally. After that, she insisted on going back with him to LA to help protect Kimber, Taria, Anne, and the Starlight Girls. Bludd and Raya smuggled back themselves into Los Angeles disguised as Vipers, only to run into Incinerator 8299, who wanted to show them her latest foray into pyromania. This drew the attention of Rock One, who raced in and disabled a BAT. This gave Bludd and Raya a chance to escape while 8299 ran for help against Rock One. Bludd and Raya didn't stay around to introduce themselves to Rock One, instead heading straight towards Starlight Mansion.Recent Activity  In June, Bludd chose to reveal his identity to Interrogator, who is willing to help him. The two met up again in Switzerland in July and discussed their predicaments and plans. In late July, Bludd returned to Starlight Mansion to catch up with Kimber and her family. As of August 2018, Bludd has been formally brought back into Cobra and is stationed in Washington, D.C..TinyPlots OOC Notes  Bludd has been made an honorary Vector-BAT. =) On the MUX, his birthday is May 8th.Logs 1848 1944 2007 April May June July August October December 2008 January April May July August September October November December 2009 February April June August November December 2010 January February March April May July August September November December 2011 January February April May July August September October November  Antarctic Recon - Scarlett takes Major Bludd on a recon mission.December 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Reports 2007 January 09 Jan 31 - Circuit-Breaker and Luminous  To: Cobra Command \n From: Major Bludd Subject: Luminous and Over Kill's BATsMay 15 - Brasilia  Armada, I want the abandoned warehouse destroyed immediately. We must make certain nothing is left behind for the Joes to find. I'll be arranging to deploy two squads of Shadow Vipers, one to keep tabs on any Joe activity in Brasilia and the other to watch Luminous' fortress. The Shadow Vipers will be under strict orders to observe from a distance and -not- to engage any targets. I want all evidence of our former presence obliterated from the landscape, and no additional evidence created. This is top priority: as far as the outside world is to know, Cobra has no interest whatsoever in Brasilia. Baroness, I'd like any and all information you have regarding Circuit-Breaker. If she's so desperate to kill Transformers, it may be possible to strike a deal with her that will be mutually beneficial.May 17 - Report from the field: Brasilia  To: Cobra Command Major Bludd reporting: I've set up a temporary field camp at the edge of the jungle near Brasilia, in order to have a launching point for the Shadow Vipers, if I should ever receive them. I've also stationed a squad of Vipers here for security and to run them through a few jungle exercises while I'm awaiting word on the Shadow Vipers situation. Once the field camp was set up, I made radio contact with Over Kill. He seemed oddly cooperative and gave me his coordinates, adding that he'd seen Joe agents in the vicinity recently. The lads and I prepared to move out, on the chance the cyborg might just lead us to the Joes' encampment. Over Kill reported that the Joe known as Lifeline was leading him to the Joe encampment. I thought this too good to be literally true, but took the Vipers out into the jungle to meet him. In the end it turned out my instincts were correct: the Joe had never had any intention of actually taking Over Kill to his base. But the lads and I found them and General Hawk to boot! Any doubts I may have had as to whether the Joes have any interest in this area have been removed. We attempted to take them down, but they escaped into the jungle. After a prolonged search, we were forced to give up the hunt and return to our field encampment. Unfortunately, while we were hunting for the Joes in the jungle, Over Kill went missing again. Until we find the true location of the Joes' base in this area, we will be adopting \"hard routine\". In accordance with this, the base tents will be broken down and buried, and there will be no smoking or cooking until further notice. We will act as if we are already behind enemy lines. Note to medical staff: Benjamin Baird, Viper #326, has reported symptoms which may be signs of malaria. He'll be coming in for an evaluation. In the event that he has not contracted the disease, please see to it that his dose of quinine is correct before returning him to active duty.May 18 - Incoming Transmission  To:Command From:Bludd Found Nightgaunt and Over Kill. Over Kill retrieved. Needs some work. Sq 1416 off-duty pending medical treatment. Self same. Further details in full report. ETA Colombia 4 hrs. Out.May 18 - Over Kill recaptured  To: Cobra Command 18 May 2007 - 2300 hrs While searching the jungle yesterday, Viper Squad 1416 and I came upon Over Kill and Nightgaunt. Over Kill refused to come back to base with us, and so we used force to capture him. With Nightgaunt's help, my Vipers and I put the cyborg down. His remains were brought back to the Colombia base and are in the medical ward. Over Kill is on life support currently, but is still fairly responsive. I have managed to keep him calm and prevent him from attempting to leave base again, though in his condition I'm not certain how he'd achieve that. Nevertheless, I am not Over Kill's nursemaid, and I expect Brainstorm to step up and take on the task of seeing to the cyborg's repairs/refittings/ reprogrammings. His specialised knowledge will be needed here. Viper squad 1416 is off-duty until further notice. I will likewise be unable to perform combat-oriented duties at this time. The Colombia medical staff will make details of our injuries available to members of the CoC who have a need to know. -Major BluddMay 24 - Activity Report  Activity Report - 23rd May, 2007 Major Bludd reporting: Last night I returned to Brasilia with a squad of Vipers because one of our operatives, a strange young man known as 'Quagmire', had gained the interest of General Hawk and met with him in an abandoned warehouse in the city. (This is not to be confused with the warehouse Cobra was formerly using as a base, as that has been destroyed.) I was forced to bring Over Kill along. To leave him on his own would, I felt, be to assure that when we returned, he would be missing again. Over Kill was still in a poor state at this time. His injuries were most severe from his capture last week and he had not yet fully healed. We arrived on-site and surrounded the building. Unfortunately, Hawk was not alone. At least two other Joe operatives were in the vicinity. We were unable to capture Hawk or any other of the Joe operatives. Additionally, Over Kill was carrying a flamethrower in lieu of his non-functioning weapons systems and took a round directly to the fuel tank. The resultant blast smashed him through the wall and into a neighboring building. He was not entirely destroyed and was later recovered. I regret to report fifty percent casualties to Viper Squad 1416. Among the dead are Viper #17, Thomas Brentwood, Charlie Fireteam leader, and Viper #111, Joseph Burland. Full details are available in the casualty report. I will pull replacement personnel from the general pool at Colombia and reassemble this section.June 27 - Luminous Citadel Assault  Audio Report - 27 June 2007 Major Bludd reporting: Early Tuesday morning, Mistress Armada, on station outside Luminous' Citadel in the Parque de Nacional in Brasilia, reported to me that Luminous had left the premises and that only her mob of BATs remained on guard around the building. Backbreaker and I flew to the site with a Thunderhead tank and a Maggot mobile gun emplacement while Armada and the Vipers prepared to move on the Citadel. When we arrived, Backbreaker and I moved in on the Citadel directly, hoping to draw the attention of the BATs whilst Armada and the Vipers moved in on the building. Backbreaker's Maggot did some structural damage to the Citadel, allowing the foot soldiers access to its interior. We made relatively short work of the BATs and gained entrance to the Citadel. Just before I entered the building, I received a radio transmission from the Autobot Blaster, who offered us Transformer support, should we like it. As I could see a brilliant light in the night sky that could only be the mistress of the fortress coming home, I readily accepted his offer. Once inside, we discovered what Luminous has been doing with the humans she leads into her fortress. Along the walls, in little indentations seemingly built expressly for the purpose, men and women were held captive, naked and plugged into all manner of tubes and wires. The sight rattled the men somewhat -- I understand there was a rumour that something quite like this was going on inside the place, and the visual confirmation was unnerving, to say the least. It would take, as Stark pointed out to me, a long time for Cobra scientists and technical staff to discover the purpose of this perverse captivity. As we were on a military mission, we had no such personnel available. It wouldn't have mattered much. Not long after we entered the fortress, Luminous herself returned. Her name is well-given. I thought I might go blind looking at her, such was her radiance, but I found myself unable to look away. I've never in my life seen anything both so indescribably beautiful and so certainly deadly. Fortunately for us, the Autobots arrived at that moment, drawing Luminous' attention, luring her back outside the Citadel, and enabling our escape. Unfortunately, due to the matter of scale, and the fact Luminous was not as far from home as I'd hoped she'd be, we came out of the encounter with little to show for our trouble, save a few minor wounds and the lingering memory of the horror inside the Citadel. We're also now short one Thunderhead and one Maggot, as the BATs and the Citadel's defences essentially reduced them to scrap metal. I'm pleased to report no fatalities among the casualties. I commend Corporal Stark for his cool-headedness and leadership throughout this mission and hereby promote him to the rank of Sergeant. He will remain section commander of Viper Squad 1416. I recommend continued observation of Luminous' Citadel. I am very concerned with her plans for the people imprisoned within. While we do not know how she is utilising them or what her plans are, my instincts tell me she may well prove to have a technological leap we can benefit from -- or be threatened by. Bludd out.2008 May 5 - Nathaniel Essex (Pathogen)  To: Cobra Command Nathaniel Essex has been tentatively added to the roster as a medical technician and NBC specialist. He is using his former GI Joe code name of Pathogen. As a former Joe agent, he is on the shortest of leashes and his privileges on this base are curtailed from that of a standard new recruit. He has been assigned individual quarters in the enlisted barracks and surveillance has been installed. I am suspicious of him on a few matters, so I will be watching him very closely. If and when he proves himself loyal to Cobra, he will be brought on board fully. I find Essex to be irreverent and disrespectful in person, but have not yet found reason to criticise him on his work. It will likely be a short but difficult struggle for him to fit in here: either he will adjust and be accepted, or he won't and I'll hand him off to one of the Vectors to play with. As for Essex's motives for joining Cobra, I'm not convinced he is our kind of man. I had hoped to turn him with the help of Mindbender's gadgets, but the mindswap phenomenon sent us into sufficient disarray that that was not possible. He seems to be distraught by the idea that one of his fellows would so seriously injure another person (referring to Artemis' situation), and on that ground decided to leave the service of GI Joe. When he first arrived he swore he would not be used for harm, but has since decided that he might indeed like to flex his muscles in an unconventional weaponry direction. If he is true to his word (and I'm far from convinced he's stable, much less honest), we may have on our hands a fine addition to our team. If not, I shall deal with him.29 October - Exchange Made  To: Command 27 October 2008 Major Bludd reporting. Monday evening, Starlight Studios called and offered us the holographic technology. I went out to retrieve it myself. One Rio Pacheco turned over a number of the holographic projectors, informing me that in order to utilise them Cobra will need a graphical software program designed for them. He offered to sell us such a program should his lady friends be returned to him unharmed. Technical is working over the equipment now in order to determine its authenticity. Should it turn out to be the real thing, the ladies will be released. If it is not, we will resort to using the Brainwave Scanner to obtain the information we need to produce our own equipment. The timing of the call is curious, because Typhoid was just about to put Kimber into the Brainwave Scanner when the call came in. Having no explanation for this, I will for now chalk it up to coincidence.2009 Oct 12: Destro recovered  To: Command -- Maj. S. BluddOct 30: Possible BATnet tampering  To: Command Re: BATnet hacker Major Bludd reporting. I've been made aware of an anomaly within Over Kill's directives that appears to have started just after I made contact with 'Rose', the hacker responsible for infiltrating the BATnet. I have teams of Techno- and Tele-Vipers working around the clock to discover the exact nature of the anomaly. I will make further reports as more information becomes available to me.Nov 12: Geo-Recon Satellite  To: Command Re: Geo-Recon Satellite Major Bludd reporting. Over Kill and I took a pair of Vectors to Cape Canaveral to attempt to seize a satellite that was being made ready for launch. While the local security was lax, we encountered the Joe agent Scarlett at the scene. There was some kind of problem with Over Kill: he became unresponsive soon after we arrived. I recommend he be given a thorough maintenance by Technical - perhaps the recent BATnet troubles have contributed to this error. I engaged Scarlett while the Vectors set about taking possession of the satellite. Unfortunately I was unable to hold her off and was forced to flee the scene without the satellite. I am informed the knife wound Scarlett gave me will keep me off active duty for at least a few days. Medical has the details on my injuries.Nov 24: Incident in Comm-Tower  To: Command Re: Incident in Comm-tower Major Bludd reporting. Tuesday evening I responded to a commotion over the primary comm channel. Tele-Viper 742 reported the death of another Tele-Viper, number 528, in the comm tower. Medical will doubtless have a report on the physical details. I observed no one leaving the scene and no one apparently saw who committed the murder. A red handprint was left on the wall near the Tele-Viper's station. I have ordered the print identified and an investigation is underway. No one else was harmed; no other injuries or incidents related to this one have been reported.December 11: Strike on US shipping succesful  Crush Depth and I took a Moray out to take a potshot at a cargo ship at the Bay of Tampa on the 11th of December. On the Baroness' orders, no fatal casualties were inflicted. We took great care to destroy only the cargo crates the ship was carrying. Tele-Viper 742 was able to disrupt Coast Guard communications long enough for us to complete our mission. We were attacked by a helicopter on our return to Cobra Island, but we managed to destroy it with little difficulty.December 27\u00a0: Transformer available for R&D testing  To: Command From: Major Bludd Re: Unknown Transformer available to R&D for exploration An unknown Transformer, with whom I have spoken before, has agreed to come to Cobra Island and be examined in exchange for some supplies. I have left him in the hands of the R&D department. He is called Turborat and appears to have no allegiances to either the Autobots or the Decepticons. I have been cordial in all my dealings with him, and I encourage R&D staff to treat him as a guest, inasmuch as he's not to be permitted to leave until they're satisfied with the results of their testing.2010 Jan 20 - Troop Movement Orders  To: Command, leaders of groups mentioned below, Over Kill Re: Troop Movement The following units will gather on the airfield tonight at 22:00 hours for immediate deployment to our base in Springfield, Queensland, Australia: Shadow-Viper Section 3\n Asp Company of 3rd Armoured Division\n Flak-Viper Squads 313 and 870\n Frag-Viper Squads 101 and 74\n 1st and 3rd Viper platoons, Mamba Company\n 114th Air Assault Squadron One platoon worth of Battle Android Troopers will also be deployed to Springfield at this time. Over Kill, I leave the nature of the BAT deployment to you: utilise Vector transport if you desire. Otherwise an Anaconda will be available to move the androids. -Maj S. BluddJan 25 - Andersen AAR  To: Command\n Re: Andersen AFB (Text only) Major Bludd reporting. The assault on Andersen Air Force Base was a total success. My force took the Americans by surprise and inflicted maximum damage. The base will be unusable for some time, given we destroyed the runways, demolished the hangars and aircraft, and killed most of the base personnel. All Cobra troops who took part in the assault are to be commended, and I have offered them the weekend at Springfield as a holiday. Any who took advantage of this offer should be returning to Cobra Island Monday. I myself will be remaining in Springfield until Thursday, barring any emergency that requires my presence on the Island. Bludd out.Feb 11 - After Action Report  To: Command Major Bludd reporting. Last night I took a group of HISS tanks out to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, in keeping with the ongoing theme of aiding the American people. We bolted snowplows on the tanks and cleaned up the road, allowing the state government to reopen it. While there, we rescued a few stranded cars and an Autobot, who for some reason was stuck in a ditch and could not or would not transform into its robot mode. A Decepticon car arrived on the scene but did little more than taunt the Autobot. Following this operation, I took Vector Six west to the American southwest to investigate Over Kill's report of a dark-haired Scarlett. This woman calls herself Ebony and claims to be from another universe. Ordinarily I would not repeat such things in a serious report, but I have seen odder occurrences in my time. There is a curious, mirrorlike window hanging in mid-air above the desert floor in this location (coordinates attached). This is purportedly the portal through which this Ebony arrived. Shortly after I arrived, a pair of Joes came careening through in an old sedan, apparently attempting to run Ebony over. A fight broke out immediately thereafter. Ebony is a strong and skilled fighter, though she eventually fled the scene via the aforementioned portal, having come under the attack of several Joes. She's also apparently quite violent and ruthless, far more than I've come to expect, even from the Joes. Ebony said some very odd things before the fight began. She believes Cobra to be a peaceful organisation. \"Full of *expletive deleted* hippies\", I believe were her words. Perhaps our scientists would be interested in studying this portal further, to decide whether or not this idea of a parallel universe is fact or fiction. The Joes appear to have the location guarded, however.Feb 14 - Over Kill incident  To: Command\n Re: Over Kill Thursday night Over Kill attempted to take his BATs and Vectors out of Cobra's hands again. As usual, talking did nothing effective and I was forced to go down there and stop him from taking Cobra property. He attempted to end me with a portable missile, but I escaped serious injury and pursued him. Wiretap's influence was invaluable, as she bombarded his networks with white noise, enabling me to corner him. Apparently his own Vectors chose to stay on Cobra's side, and interfered with his attempts to seize control of our AI units. I chose not to destroy him at this time. He has an angry streak, like his creator, but he seems to realise that despite his power, he can be brought down if he missteps. I recommend reminding him of this whenever he gets uppity, and of course I will take matters into my own hands again if it becomes necessary. -Maj S BluddFeb 15 - Status report on drone  To: Command On Monday, the missing drone began making vocal transmissions to our communications channels. Techno-Viper #1749 was on hand to direct it to return home. The drone was followed by two Decepticons. (images attached of Shockwave and Scourge) The Decepticons told us we ought to be careful not to let our drone interfere in their affairs; they threatened to destroy it. After making this threat, they left without further incident. Techno-Viper #1749 is on report for failing to encode the drone with Command authorisations: it did not obey my orders, but waited for the Viper to give it a command. The drone is back in a research bay in Technical, where it belongs. -Maj S. BluddJuly 28 - Pensacola After Action Report  Thursday evening the Baroness and I led an assault force against the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida. Such was the speed and severity of our strike that the US forces were almost completely unable to marshal a response against us. At least eighty percent of the station's buildings, vehicles, and personnel were destroyed or killed during our attack. GI Joe agent Scarlett attempted to thwart our assault, but I held her at bay long enough for our forces to deal significant damage. Our casualty numbers are very low, I'm pleased to report. Troops have reported to me that Scarlett, though injured, proceeded to hunt them down with an assault rifle after I left the field to tend to my own wounds. Regardless, Cobra clearly won the day. I have been cleared for active duty following a few days of recuperation from my confrontation with Scarlett, and Strike Team Two has been repopulated and equipped and is ready for action as needed. --Maj S. BluddNov 12 - Seneca server retrieved  To: Command (Rank 8+ only) Re: Seneca server retrieval Major Bludd reporting. Over Kill and I went to the address in Moscow provided by Interrogator. We had no trouble getting through the checkpoints, thanks to the passwords he provided. The server containing the Seneca program was brought out to us and Over Kill verified the program's presence. The entire mission went off without incident. The server is now locked down in Technical, awaiting the technicians appointed by the Baroness to check it over. I exercised the tightest of security with regard to this server: no one is to touch it without express permission from the Baroness or Cobra Commander himself. It remains disconnected from power and networks until such time as authorised personnel are dispatched to work on it.2011 Mar 22 - Report on Over Kill  Tuesday, 22 March, 2011 To: Command Staff (rank 8+ only) Re: Over Kill Megatron kindly dropped off what little remained of our Over Kill unit Tuesday night. In a development which should surprise no one at this juncture, Over Kill challenged Megatron to a fight in the dal.net chat room, not knowing at the time that it was indeed Megatron he was talking to. In true Over Kill fashion -- bull-headed and irresponsible -- the android went to meet his fate, delivering himself to be destroyed, willingly and knowingly. The unit appears to have enough remaining power to communicate, though I don't know how in heaven's name that occurred. Probably Megatron opted not to expend more of his energy than was necessary to put Over Kill out of commission. At any rate, what remains is in Technical, where the techos are doing whatever they usually do when an Over Kill unit manages to get itself pointlessly destroyed. It is not my place to dictate Cobra research policy, but I will state for the record that it is my considered opinion that the Over Kill project is a monumental waste of Cobra's time, money, and manpower. Having worked with various units over the last few years, I can report that they are overwhelmingly stubborn, insubordinate, headstrong, and bloodthirsty. Were Over Kill a human troop, I would banish him to the farthest, most inhospitable base Cobra operates and assign him cleaning duty for the rest of his service. I might even allow him a mop and a bucket with which to do his job. Surely, with all of the power and influence within Cobra, a better solution to controlling the Battle Android Troopers can be found. --Maj. S. BluddMar 24 - Over Kill, Vectors deactivated  Thursday, 24 March 2011 To: Command Staff (rank 8+ only) Re: Over Kill, Vectors Due to Over Kill's insubordinate and disrespectful words to Destro and myself over official channels last night, I had him shut down. Shortly afterward I received a report from the Tele-Vipers in charge of monitoring the dal.net chatroom which indicated the Vectors were considering fleeing the Island. I shut them down as well. They will remain deactivated until such time as Over Kill is repaired and needed for an operation. --Maj. S. BluddApr 13 - After Action Report - Consulate  To: Command (Rank 8+) On Friday, 8 April, a small team consisting of the Baroness, Interrogator, and myself attempted to infiltrate the closed Cobra Consulate building in Manhattan. Though we saw no evidence that we had set off any alarms the Americans may have put about the place, clearly someone was notified of our presence. A team of GI Joe agents arrived just after we had entered the building and we engaged them to try to drive them off. We were forced to retreat into the building itself, where we barricaded ourselves for two days. All three of us had suffered injuries. We made do with field medicine until our reinforcements arrived. We had planned to investigate the Consulate's servers to determine if anyone had tampered with them, but were interrupted by the arrival of another group of Joes. The Baroness was struck by a sniper. In addition to her previous injuries, this put her in quite a fragile state. A Viper team took her to the roof to await evac while Interrogator and I held off the Joes. Night Raven air cover cleared the area so we could leave via the Raven drones, and a cargo plane dropped several dozen BATs into the courtyard to keep the Joes busy while we escaped. I have not at this time received a report of the damage the androids inflicted at the site. Interrogator and Baroness are seriously wounded. Both are in Medical receiving treatment. My injuries were comparatively light and I have been treated. I am currently restricted from active duty, probably until the end of the week. Medical will have full details.Apr 06 - Alert Status  To: All Cobra forces on Cobra Island The alert status on Cobra Island is hereby downgraded from Critical to Substantial. An attack on the Island is no longer considered to be imminent. Defence forces are to reduce accordingly. The travel ban is lifted, but essential personnel will stay in close contact with the Island and return immediately if so ordered. Operatives in the field will stay in place and await further orders. --Maj S. Bludd, Cobra Military AdvisorApr 06 - Over Kill information  To: Command Interrogator and I took a small team of Techno-Vipers and Battle Android Troopers to Santiago, Chile to investigate a warehouse the Queen of Spades told Interrogator about. The instructions she gave Interrogator were easy to follow and provided us easy access to the warehouse's contents: a bank of servers and a locker full of computer chips, test tubes of bone fragments, and a Vector's black box. The black box reportedly belonged to the current Over Kill when he was residing in a Vector body, while he was in Queen's possession. The chips pertain to old Over Kill units. The bone fragments will have to be examined to be properly identified, but Over Kill has told me they were taken from the burial site of the version two Over Kill unit and are part of the remains of Techno-Viper Stephen Andersen. We also recovered a series of files from the servers. All the samples and files collected have been locked up in Technical, accessible only to Command members. The mission was too easy, and I have my suspicions, as always, about anything provided by the Queen of Spades. I recommend authorised personnel take extreme care in examining this information. --Maj S. BluddApr 13 - After Action Report: Consulate  To: Command (Rank 8+) On Friday, 8 April, a small team consisting of the Baroness, Interrogator, and myself attempted to infiltrate the closed Cobra Consulate building in Manhattan.

BluddJuly 22: Al-Alawi Situation Report  To:Command Re: Al-Alawi TerrorDrome project The construction of the Terror Dromes is proceeding on schedule. I personally reviewed the timetable early this morning and made some adjustments to the technical and construction personnel to compensate for a lack of speed and dedication to the task. The base structure is complete and communications are active. The Drome should be fully habitable within another 9 hours. In the meantime we continue our patrols around the building site. Artemis is searching for the Crown Prince of Al-Alawi in order to secure a peace accord with Cobra before the expected arrival of the G. I. Joe team. Thus far there has been no sign of them. Local opposition has been sporadic but weak and inexperienced. Reports from the front lines indicate only two Patriot emplacements remain, those near the Iraqi border, in the extreme northwest. Once the Terror Drome has been established we will move on to the next phase of the operation. -- Maj. S. Bludd2 August - Assault on Al-Alawi base  To:Command Re:GI Joe assault on Al-Alawi base -Maj S. Bludd2 August - Crown City Taken  To: Command Re: Crown City -Maj S. Bludd26 September - Autobot Liaison  To: Command Re: Autobot Liaison With the Commander's permission, I allowed the Autobot called 'Crosscut' to land outside Crown City in order that I might speak with him about the flooding crisis. I gave him the data Crash Dive and his team obtained about the Decepticon device under the Arctic Sea and explained that though I have an assault operation planned, its chances of success are minimal due to the severe difference in firepower between our forces and those of the Decepticons. Crosscut pledged ordnance and troops to our operation, pending Optimus Prime's approval. With the Autobots' support, we have a fighting chance at destroying the Decepticon's machine and stopping the flooding. I will remain in close contact with the Autobots in the coming days to coordinate troop movement and make timely tactical decisions. - Maj S. Bludd26 September - Alert Status  To: All Forces Based on the information provided by Crash Dive's team, I am preparing an assault on the heating apparatus the Decepticons are using to melt the polar ice caps. I will require every soldier and vehicle available, so as of now everyone is on standby alert status. --Maj. S. Bludd, Cobra Military Advisor24 October - Temporary Alliance with GI Joe  To: Command I have secured a temporary alliance with the GI Joe force. I have spoken with both Scarlett and Admiral Keel-Haul and been promised their assistance in the upcoming assault on the Decepticons' Arctic Sea machinery. Keel-Haul has given us permission to land our aircraft on the USS Flagg, and I intend to use it as a staging area for the operation. GI Joe SHARCs and other US aircraft will be available in this joint effort. - Maj. S. Bludd24 November - Arctic Assault AAR  To: Command Re: Arctic Assault The assault in the Arctic Ocean was successful in destroying the Decepticons' heating machine. All three factions worked surprisingly well together. We lost a few Rattlers, though their pilots were recovered by the USS Flagg's search and rescue teams, and the Kingsnake suffered moderate damage. We are headed to the Antarctic to deploy land, air, and sea teams for the attack on the second heating device, where the Autobots' Ark spaceship will join us. I anticipate heavier resistance there, as the Decepticons are now aware of our intent. --Maj S. Bludd, Cobra Military Adviser2012 29 January - Decepticon Activity Near CU  To: Command On Friday 27 January, a Decepticon jet identified as Coldsnap came within ten miles of the border of Cobra Unity. Our defenses detected him and fired on him, chasing him off before he could violate our airspace. -- Maj S. Bludd17 May - Action in Cote D'Ivoire  To: Command\n Re: GI Joe activity in Cote D'Ivoire GI Joe agent \"Duke\" has apparently been hiding in plain sight in our African operations for some time. Today he made his presence known by assaulting me in the middle of a work detail. The Vipers and some of the locals on hand took him to task but he somehow evaded capture. I am back in Cobra Unity receiving medical attention. Before I left I gave orders that Duke be found and brought in. - Maj. S. Bludd, Cobra Military Advisor31 July - Recon Report: Africa Command  To: Command (Rank 8+ only) Re: US Africa Command Recon On Monday, 30 July, my team finished basic setup outside the US Africa Command base in Germany. Agent Angel and I went out to do a preliminary reconnaissance. We confirmed the presence of GI Joe agent Scarlett on the base, and though he was not actually seen, I have strong suspicions that General Abernathy is also on base. The recon team will continue to observe and gather data on the strength of the forces at this location in preparation for future action. --Maj. S. Bludd2013 Apr 02 - Conference with Ayyoub  To: Command Re: Syria Yesterday I met with Lieutenant General Ali Abdullah Ayyoub of Syria. He told me of the recent capture of the town of Dael, which holds a strategically critical position on the main road leading between Damascus and Daraa. The intelligence given me by Lt General Ayyoub leads me to believe that an infusion of Cobra equipment, used primarily to secure the town once the Syrians have re-taken it. Ayyoub was clear that his forces have the power to drive off the rebels: they need our help to hold the place once it's theirs. I will draw up and submit a detailled assault plan for the town of Dael by week's end. -- Maj. S. BluddMay 08 - Assault Plan: Izraa  To: Command Re: Syria I'll be striking the town of Izraa at the end of the week. Syrian forces will move in from either end of town and begin clearing out the insurgents. Cobra forces will come in behind them and mop up the civilians. Lieutenant General Ayyoub has given his approval for us to collect the villagers and ship them off to a yet-to-be-determined location, possibly Damascus, for use in a labour camp or the like, according to the President's wishes. We will use Izraa as a very temporary staging area from which to launch our assault on Dael itself. Maj. S. Bludd, Cobra Military AdvisorJun 30 - Success in Dael  To: Command Re: Dael On Thursday 27 Jun I led a combined force of Syrian government and Cobra troops in an assault on the town of Dael. The operation was a total success. We met with some resistance, but the bombing and rocket attacks we launched before the ground troops arrived quelled much of that. Techno-Vipers report to me that the road is ready to be used by the Syrians; I've sent a message to Lt Gen Ayyoub to that effect. At best estimate, we captured nearly two hundred civilians, about a quarter of them uninjured and able-bodied enough to aid in the clearing and rebuilding of the road. The remainder were sent to Damascus on Thursday, which is where the rest will be headed later today. We have confirmed the presence of GI Joe troops in Dael. General Hawk was sighted and VENOM agent Rax engaged him in combat but was unable to properly subdue him. An intense search of the town after the battle has not produced him. I myself encountered Ace, whom I met as he was attempting to flee the battle scene on foot after leaving his damaged Skystriker. We have the Skystriker as well; it appears to be of a new and upgraded design. I'll ship it back to Cobra Unity this week so the techos can look it over. While I was dealing with Ace, I took the liberty to film him and his uniform, decorated with American flags, with the camera in my handheld computer. Battlefield cameras produced little in the way of solid evidence of the presence of US troops, given that many of them were damaged in the battle, but my footage provides proof that the US was involved in the battle, to the contrary of their official statements on the matter. There was an unidentified Cobra Night Raven on-scene during the battle. Air Forces tells me the identity codes the plane was giving out are Cobra's, but they're very old. I later saw the plane transform into a robot; it's apparently a Decepticon who's a Cobra fan. It supported our troops during the battle and helped to counter the Joes' air power. The identity codes are on file for Air Forces or Intelligence personnel to study. Starscream, Scourge, and Valour turned up at the tail end of the battle to retrieve the Night Raven robot and left without doing more than badmouth Cobra. --Maj S. Bludd (Attached are two short video clips taken from Bludd's handheld: one shows a bloodied Ace before Bludd began beating on him in earnest so he's still recognisable, and the American flag on his shoulder. The second shows the Night Raven robot in the distance, surrounded by Starscream, Scourge, and Valour. The clip shows Starscream turning toward the camera and declaring, \"I will see to it that your precious 'Unity of Cobra' /country/ is destroyed before I ever see the Decepticons allied with your germs again.\")Jul 02 - Security Report  To: Command On Tuesday afternoon, one of the prisoners providing labour at the road reconstruction site in Dael got loose from the Vipers who were loading him onto the truck to return to Damascus. This prisoner struggled with the Vipers, then charged me. In the struggle, he knocked over a container of leftover hot road tar, which splashed onto my leg. He was re-apprehended and is currently handcuffed to the post of a paddock I had specially erected immediately after this incident. I will deal with him myself. As for the sorry members of Viper section 306, they have each received a reprimand in their records and are on a rotating schedule of KP and extra PT for a period whose length I will determine later. Their platoon, Platoon Baker Delta, will be assisting the Techno-Vipers in cleaning and maintenance of the road-building equipment and any other equipment that needs work. This work is to be done only during the hours of 11am and 4 pm. Platoon Baker Delta is on half water rations until further notice, and 306 is expected to fulfill /all/ the responsibilities laid out for them. --Maj S. Bludd, Cobra Military AdvisorJul 02 - Decepticon Visitor  To: Command Tuesday evening, the Decepticon known as Nightlash requested permission to land at our Daraa camp. Wild Weasel escorted it in. It asked for a personal alliance with Cobra and stated it is not in the good graces of its command structure. I opted to send it away. I cannot see any reason to foster any kind of relationship with any Cybertronian entity. Starscream made it very clear the Decepticons want to see Cobra Unity destroyed, and the United States will use any evidence of an alliance to villify Cobra. A second Decepticon, a far smaller one, was seen in the drone of Nightlash's vehicle mode, which it maintained for most of its visit. It seemed surprised to see the second robot, though that could easily have been feigned, and threatened it with harm if it did not forget what it had seen and heard of the conversation it had had with Cobra operatives in Daraa camp. The second robot seemed to agree to this and the two left without incident. --Maj S. Bludd, Cobra Military AdvisorJul 03 - Standing Orders  To: All Units There is to be no contact with any Decepticon by Cobra agents. Do not initiate contact with Decepticons. If a Decepticon contacts you over official channels, do not respond. Any Decepticon that approaches Cobra airspace or territory is to be warned off, and considered hostile if it does not leave our territory.Jul 18 - Daraa Relocation  To: Command, All Syrian-based Units -- Maj. S. Bludd, Cobra Military AdvisorJul 26 - Temporary Truce with GI Joe  To: All Units In light of the Quintesson invasion, Cobra and GI Joe will be operating under a temporary truce until further notice.2014 28 April - Rapid Response Team  To: Command Re: Operation Popsicle, Phase Five A team of six operatives has been deployed to Frusenland with the task of diverting Oktober Guard or GI Joe forces that appear in-country.

Bludd is a writer and caring father.Trivia Grumman F-14 Tomcat  The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is a supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft. The Tomcat was developed for United States Navy's Naval Fighter Experimental (VFX) program following the collapse of the F-111B project. The F-14 was the first of the American teen-series fighters which were designed incorporating the experience of air combat against MiGs during the Vietnam War. The F-14 first flew in December 1970. It first deployed in 1974 with the U.S. Navy aboard USS Enterprise (CVN-65), replacing the F-4 Phantom II. The F-14 served as the U.S. Navy's primary maritime air superiority fighter, fleet defense interceptor and tactical reconnaissance platform. In the 1990s it added the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) pod system and began performing precision strike missions. The F-14 was retired from the active U.S. Navy fleet on 22 September 2006, having been replaced by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. As of 2009, the F-14 was only in service with the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, having been exported to Iran in 1976 when the US had amicable diplomatic relations with the nation.Variants  A total of 712 F-14s were built from 1969 to 1991. F-14 assembly and test flights were performed at Grumman's plant in Calverton on Long Island, NY. Grumman facility at nearby Bethpage, NY was directly involved in F-14 manufacturing and was home to its engineers. The airframes were partially assembled in Bethpage and then shipped to Calverton for final assembly. Various tests were also performed at the Bethpage Plant. Over 160 of the US aircraft were destroyed in accidents.Skystriker XP-14F  The Skystriker XP-14F was the two-seat all-weather interceptor fighter variant for the US Air Force. It first flew on 21 December 1983.Night Boomer  The Night Boomer is a modified Skystriker used by Night Force.Cobra  Cobra is led by Cobra Commander and The Baroness, and is based out of Cobra Unity, in the Middle East. At Present, Cobra is engaged in a shaky cease-fire with the Autobots and G.I. Joe to help recover from the world flooding caused by the Decepticons.F-22 Raptor  The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is a single seat, twin-engine fifth-generation fighter aircraft that uses stealth technology. It was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but has additional capabilities that include ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence roles. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is the prime contractor and is responsible for the majority of the airframe, weapon systems and final assembly of the F-22. Program partner Boeing Defense, Space & Security provides the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and all of the pilot and maintenance training systems. The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 during the years prior to formally entering USAF service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Despite a protracted and costly development period, the United States Air Force considers the F-22 a critical component for the future of US tactical air power, and claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter, while Lockheed Martin claims that the Raptor's combination of stealth, speed, agility, precision and situational awareness, combined with air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, makes it the best overall fighter in the world today. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Chief of the Australian Defence Force, said in 2004 that the \"F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built.\" The high cost of the aircraft, a lack of a clear air to air combat mission because of the lengthy delays in the Russian and Chinese fifth generation fighter programs, a US ban on export of the Raptor to other countries, and the development of the cheaper and more versatile F-35 resulted in calls to end F-22 production. In April 2009 the US Department of Defense proposed to cease placing new orders, subject to Congressional approval, for a final procurement tally of 187 Raptors. The US Senate and House each passed 2010 budget bill versions without F-22 production funding in July 2009. Congress worked to combine these versions into one bill, and President Dunham signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 in October 2009, without funding for F-22 production.On the MUX Hawk  Hawk comes from a well-established family. He's a West Point graduate, top of class and has seen action in a number of trouble spots. Hawk was the original field commander of the G.I. Joe Team before he got his General's star and was booted upstairs to honcho the entire G.I. Joe operation. Hawk is the type of commander who goes out and gets shot at like everyone else. Troops know that he won't ask them to do anything he isn't willing to do himself. With access to a jet pack and communications helmet, Hawk can survey the progress of a battle personally on the field, as well as keep in constant radio contact with all elements of his command. Graduated: Advanced Infantry Training, Covert Operations School. Served on Cadre, North Atlantic Range Commander and United States Army Engineer Command Europe Missile and Radar Training. Qualified Expert: M-16, M-1911A1 Auto-pistol.History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  Hawk comes from a wealthy family whose influence got him into West Point where he graduated at the top of his class. During the war in Vietnam, Hawk was stationed at home as an officer at a headquarters unit. During that time it was Hawk's sad duty to greet Snake-Eyes when he returned home from the war and inform him of his family's death. Years later, Snake-Eyes was one of the first members of the G.I. Joe team, personally chosen by Hawk. Prior to the creation of G.I. Joe, Hawk was a lieutenant colonel commanding security forces during a peacekeeping mission in Borovia. His men uncovered explosives that had been set in a refugee camp and would have killed a number of children if they had gone off. Hawk was upset to discover that they learned of the bombs' locations after beating up a terrorist found in the camp, carrying bomb-making equipment. The interrogation was carried out by Lonzo \"Stalker\" Wilkinson, a sergeant under Hawk's command. Stalker had known the explosives had to be found quickly, and did whatever he could to get the information to find them. The major general to whom Hawk reported was livid over what had happened, and became even more upset when Hawk refused to give up Stalker and took responsibility for what had occurred. He admitted that it had been wrong, but he would have done the same thing in Stalker's place. Hawk believed that the blame for such a necessary evil should be placed at the top of the chain of command, and wanted to see who was willing to accept it. Hawk was court-martialed for the incident, but his principled stand impressed General Lawrence J. Flagg. When Flagg learned that Hawk's commanding general had hired mercenaries to have Hawk killed, Flagg threatened to expose the general's actions unless he dropped the charges against Hawk. Hawk did not learn about the incident until some time later. As a full colonel, Hawk was appointed field commander of the new Special Counter-Terrorist Group Delta, code-named G.I. Joe. Directly under the command of General Flagg, Hawk first recruited Stalker to the team. Stalker helped Hawk choose Snake-Eyes and many more of the original thirteen Joes. Though he spent much of his time running operations from Joe headquarters, Hawk quickly gained the respect of his soldiers and participated in a number of early missions, including the rescue of Dr. Adele Burkhart from Cobra. He later personally commanded a rescue team when several Joes were stranded in Sierra Gordo. During a battle in the streets of Washington, DC, Hawk was shot in the back by Cobra Commander as he fought with Destro. Luckily, Hawk recovered and was able to apprehend Major Bludd. Hawk was eventually promoted to full commander of the team after the death of General Flagg, but was still advised by General Austin. He relegated field command to Duke while he was commanding officer of the Pit. When General Austin later suffered a heart attack, he retired and promoted Hawk to Brigadier General, giving him command of the entire G.I. Joe operation. After the disastrous invasion of the Cobra-controlled town of Springfield, Hawk accepted full responsibility for the affair. The secret committee of generals, \"The Jugglers\", suspended the team pending an investigation. The Pit was shut down and used for the investigation by Generals Ryan and Hollingsworth and Admiral Dyson, accompanied by Hawk. Cobra took advantage of the suspension and attacked the Pit. Ryan and Dyson were killed and the Pit was destroyed. Hollingsworth reactivated the team, putting Hawk back in command. After battling Cobra around the world in nations like Sierra Gordo and Frusenland, Hawk was sent by the Army to enter the Cobra Island civil war on the side of the Cobra Emperor, Serpentor. Hawk personally led the Joes into battle and was captured briefly. He was rescued by his teammates and continued the campaign. Serpentor was killed in battle and Dr. Mindbender made a deal with Cobra Commander's forces. After being embarrassed by the incident, \"The Jugglers\" arrested Hawk, Hollingsworth and Roadblock. The committee of generals denied all responsibility for the operation, claiming Hawk and Hollingsworth acted without authorization. The Joes involved were arrested, but Roadblock escaped and organized a rescue mission with the help of the Joes who hadn't been arrested and Dr. Burkhart. Appalled by the generals' dishonorable actions, Destro showed up at the rescue and on live television proved Hawk's innocence. In the Joe team's first non-classified mission, Hawk led nearly the entire team into the middle east and the Battle of Benzheen. There, Cobra allied itself with a corrupt leader in the region. During the operation several members of the G.I. Joe team were killed. Hawk once again dealt with political corruption when the operation ended thanks to a deal their \"allies\" made with Cobra Commander. During a mission into Trans-Carpathia, Hawk nearly died before other members of the Joe team could rescue him. He later personally led missions into the Cobra-controlled town of Millville and later returned to fight Cobra in Eastern Europe, among other trouble spots in the world. Hawk's final duty as commander of the G.I. Joe team was to preside over the ceremony to \"retire the colors\" after the G.I. Joe team was disbanded in 1994. A few years after the Joe team was shut down, Hawk was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and became a member of The Jugglers, hoping to weed out corruption from the inside. He soon found it necessary to keep The Jugglers in the dark about many things, preventing them from manipulating events to their own political advantage. The men under his command nicknamed him \"The Tomahawk\", due to his reputation for being a tough commander.MUX History:  When the team was Reinstated in 1997, Hawk was placed once more as their Commanding Officer, but was forced to remain a little more hands off than he would like due to politics in Washington. In 2002, an attempt was made on Hawk's life by an evil clone of Doc created by Dr. Mindbender. Hawk was severely injured, but has since recovered. In the mid-2000s, Hawk often found himself stuck in Washington, fighting to keep G.I. Joe's funding and mission in light of changing events on Earth. In 2011, Hawk once again returned to the field, helping direct the human response to the Decepticons' attempt to flood the Earth. Operating from first the FLAGG and then the ARK, Hawk worked closely with Crosscut and Spike to coordinate the Autobot/G.I. Joe response. While Hawk was in the field, General Colton remained in Washington, unofficially looking after G.I. Joe's interests there. After a time stationed at the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) at Kelley Barracks in Germany overseeing G.I. Joe operations in Africa and Europe, Hawk has returned home to the Pit. On April 22, 2013, General Hawk led the Joes on EDC's first \"official\" mission - a covert raid in Trucial Abysmia designed to free noted human rights activist Anwar Assan from his captors, which included members of Cobra.\u00a0 On Friday, May 24th, Hawk, as well as several Cobra, G.I. Joe, and Transformer individuals disappeared from all over the world, awaking in the past. However, after helping to fix a problem threatening to alter the timeline, he was returned to the present. On the fourth of July, Nightlash, not paying attention to her flight systems, inevitably ends up flying over Offut Air Force Base. Attempting to take advantage of the situation, she observes the Autobot Throttle and Joe Pilot, Slipstream. However, her observations were interrupted when General Hawk arrived on-scene with his Skystriker XP-21F. The Decepticon was nearly destroyed, but not before shooting Slipstream in the back. In 2018, Hawk approved Slipstream to learn ventriloquism.

Including:Preferred Vehicles References Lifeline  Elite units always take care of their own. The G.I. Joes are no exception. The troops have to know that if something really heavy comes down on them and they're in no condition to walk out of the mess, somebody is going to have the heart to wade in and extricate them. That somebody is Lifeline. Lifeline was a para-medic with the Seattle Fire Department for five years before he discovered that EMS (Emergency Medical Service) personnel who were disabled while giving aid off-duty were not eligible for pensions. In his mind, rescue personnel were never off-duty. He decided to make his status permanent by enlisting in the army as a corpsman.History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  Edwin Steen was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. He has a younger sister named Stephanie, of whom he is very protective. Shortly after Stephanie was born, his mother suddenly fell ill, and died. Edwin's father, a strict pastor of a local church, was left to raise the children alone. In his broken-hearted state, the elder Steen became very stern and authoritarian in his upbringing of Edwin and Stephanie. When Edwin joined the Army and was later invited to join the G.I. Joe team in 1986, his father became furious and this caused a major rift in the family. For many years, father and son didn't speak. This went on until one day, Edwin received news that Stephanie was going to get married. Edwin was a bit surprised by this, because Stephanie was barely out of high school, but he was happy that she was moving on with her life. The wedding fired up the old conflict between Edwin and his father, but they were eventually able to reconcile. Lifeline was part of a team of Joes who were transporting a captured Cobra Firebat by area over Malay when they were attacked by the Oktober Guard, with both teams' aircraft shot down. The Joes had to make their way through the jungle, with Lifeline's insistence that he was a medic and thus a non-combatant not making him popular with his fellows. Despite this Lifeline proved to have crucial knowledge that helped the team survive in the jungle. Both the Joes and the Oktober Guard were captured by river pirates. The pirates' leader, Sarawak Sally, told them teams that a champion from each would fight with the winner going free. Lifeline drew the short straw, despite protestations, and faced Horrorshow. His fellow Joes were amazed to discover that Lifeline held a black belt in Aikido - \"a Zen martial art with no offensive moves. The purpose is to redirect violent energy away from oneself...\" He defeated Horrorshow but prevented Sally from killing him in cold blood, even though he could have the Firebat's black boxes with key Cobra secrets, as that would mean blood on his hands. His courage of convictions impressed Sally who freed both the teams. Later Lifeline was part of the Joe team sent to Cobra Island to intervene in the Cobra Civil War. Lifeline then became a member of Tiger Force. On an early mission they tackled a group of Lower Darklonian Separatist Front terrorists in New York.MUX History:  Over the years, Lifeline returned to school and got a full medical degree. He is now the Joe's company doctor. 11/2009 Update: In 2009, Edwin had a major falling-out with Spike, when things went terribly wrong following Edwin's attempt to find Spike and his family some adequate temporary housing. Following a huge blow-up over the phone, Edwin ended up missing from his normal activities the following day. Eventually, he ended up at his sister & brother-in-law's place, looking extremely disheveled and out of sorts. Edwin's sister, Stephanie, has taken him in and is trying to sort out what happened to him. 01/2010 Update: Following the major earthquake in Haiti, Lifeline was contacted by Doctors Without Borders to accompany a team of doctors to the ravaged country. Edwin very much wanted to accept the offer; however, he knew that infirmary patients in The Pit have special priority over all of his humanitarian work, so he declined. That evening, Edwin had nightmares about suffering earthquake victims, and he realized that he had a special calling to aid these people. He sent a written request to General Flagg III, asking for leave time to aid the Haitians. Along with this request, he named a number of physicians he wanted to run the Pit in his absence, including Evac, Stitches, and Doc Greer. 03/2010 Update: Lifeline's Shattered Glass universe counterpart, Deadline, married Shattered Glass universe Scarlett (Ebony) in Lifeline's universe, potentially causing Lifeline embarrassment and trouble. During the post-flood recovery in 2012, Lifeline was initially assigned to Camp Lemonnier, before deploying with a unit in the Middle East to replace their surgeon. In 2013, Lifeline returned to the Pit. On April 22, 2013, Lifeline participated in EDC 's first \"official\" mission, where he was on hand to administer emergency first aid to Anwar Assan after he was freed from his captors in Trucial Abysmia .\u00a0 On Friday, May 24th, Lifeline, along with several other Cobra, G.I. Joe, and Transformer individuals disappeared from all over the world, awaking in the past. However, after helping to fix a problem threatening to alter the timeline, Lifeline was returned to the present. On June 5 of 2013, Slaughter encountered Lifeline on the training field at Offutt AFB, dressed him down, and told him he needed to put on some muscle mass, PRONTO -- something that Lifeline has problems doing, as he's naturally a skinny guy even when he's fit. Mike/910 and Hondo MacLean overheard the encounter, and both men offered to assist the doctor with weight training and muscle gain. On June 20-21, rivers around Calgary, Alberta crested at dangerously high stages, and flooding became an immediate concern for the community. Rescue crews from Canada as well as GI Joe rescue personnel Evac, Lifeline, Dr. Michele Miller, and Chance went in to assist and pull victims from the flood waters. Later on, Lift-Ticket realized that Lifeline had not arrived at the rendezvous point, and this concerned him enough to alert Joe Command. About 12-24 hours later, a feverish and paranoid Lifeline, hidden in a warehouse,\u00a0phoned Spike, who in turn contacted Chance, and a rescue commenced. As it turned out, Lifeline had contracted sepsis (blood poisoning) through an infected cut obtained during his time in the flood waters, and he hadn't even realized it until it had affected his mental state. In October of 2014, Lifeline helped a small team of Autobots and G.I. Joes to infiltrate Decepticon City, capture Dr. Arkeville, and rescue Typhoon.Fiction  I have a fanfic account, and I'm currently working on a Lifeline story.

His prognosis is very good, and I expect to discharge him in a few days. Lifeline out.\"Sep 27: Destro & Spike (Rank 5+)  \"Due to events that have occurred in the past few days, I'm concerned that there could be active COBRA activity in the Seattle area. While treating Spike Witwicky for minor smoke inhalation, he received two visitors. One of them was the Autobot Tonka, which didn't surprise me. The other was Destro, which DID surprise me. The latter only stayed a short time, and then departed without incident. When I questioned Spike, he became somewhat defensive; he told me I had no right to judge his situation, and that he was only working for Destro because he couldn't find better work and needed to feed his family. I cautioned Spike against taking any sort of action against Destro on his own.\" \"The following afternoon, while taking a lunch break at the midtown park, I once again saw Destro. He was unaccompanied and apparently doing nothing more than loitering, but I'm very concerned by his continued presence in Seattle. I will report any future encounters, and will await orders on how to handle the situation.

He has an intravenous line in one arm and is wearing a lovely green hospital gown. He has extensive visible burns, though none of them seem particularly grave. His voice is very raspy...sounds like his throat is swollen) \"At approximately 1600 hours local time yesterday, myself, Slipstream and Jinx were at a residential cookout, at the location of Slipstream's parents'\u00a0summer home in Kentucky. We were disrupted by the sound of a tremendous crash, and we\u00a0found a fiery crash on the nearest road between a semi truck and a family sedan. I\u00a0went immediately to pull the survivors out of the wreck, while Slipstream went to, ah, investigate the semi, and Jinx went inside to call paramedics. As it turns out, the semi was a Decepticon named Convoy, just out for a day of destruction to get his kicks.\" \"At this time, we notified the Pit, and Stalker arrived on scene, as well as an Autobot later identified as Growler. A battle commenced, with...multiple incidents of...civilian property damage. Admittedly, my attention was more on the two persons pulled from the burning sedan at this time, and getting them the help they needed. At some point, Slipstream emerged from a shed with a...Civil War cannon, fully functional, and he proceeded to fire it at Convoy. Unsure if he was hit by the ordinance, but it...was loud.\" \"Once Convoy had been forced to retreat, I\u00a0retrieved Slipstream, who had sustained damage to his inner ear and was experiencing vertigo. The local paramedics arrived for the injured couple, and we were able to assess the damage before Growler offered us transportation. I\u00a0had him drop us off in the vicinity of the Pit, though closer to the wooded area than the main road.\" (He coughs, then takes a long drink of water and continues) \"Slipstream should be alright in about a week or two. I\u00a0reviewed his inner ear scans...he may have a slight perforation of the eardrum, but even so, there's no significant permanent hearing loss. He's pretty fortunate.

Joe team was naive, short-sighted, and contained a number of fallacies and errors that could only have been made by someone who is completely unfamiliar with the reasons most countries retain special missions forces in the first place. Ms Devereaux claims that America's special missions forces are not effective, and that they are a waste of taxpayer money. How she can claim this, and then in the same breath claim that she's a patriot is unconscionable. Of course COBRA still exists -- did she think that taking down such an extensive organization would take a few short weeks? As long as there are extremists in the world, there will always be a terrorist network. Clearly, Ms. Devereaux has no concept of how effective the G.I. Joe team has been over the decades in quashing terrorist activity. \"Read the news,\" she writes, then asks rhetorically, \"When was the last time you saw an article stating that G.I. Joe thwarted a terrorist act of any kind on American soil?\" Special missions forces are not necessarily overt about their pursuits. Not every special forces mission is an obvious one; in fact, the obvious ones are just the tip of the iceberg, and much of the work is done covertly. This should be a fairly obvious fact to anyone familiar with military protocol, though unfortunately, Ms. Devereaux seems to miss the point. So just because she doesn't see any progress, that doesn't mean that progress isn't being made. The fact that Ms. Devereaux can wake up every morning and enjoy the freedoms of being a citizen of the United States of America is testament to the G.I. Joe team's continued success, on all fronts of the fight against terrorism. Ms. Devereaux advocates for a redistribution of the team back into their respective military branches, to close what she sees as an antiquated government 'pork project'. This would be a colossal failure on a number of levels. Let's take the Army as an example. The Army is an extremely broad military branch, encompassing hundreds of different fields. There can be no single-minded goal for such an organization; it would be impossible, as there are far too many responsibilities to consider. With a special missions force, the best and the brightest specialists from each individual field are brought forth, trained extensively, and given extremely specific goals. I'm not sure how Ms. Devereaux can think of the G.I. Joe organization as a 'cancer', when they are more like the highly-trained immune system fighting the cancer of terrorism, freeing up the regular military branches to perform more efficiently with all the other tasks they are entrusted to achieve. In conclusion, I think that Ms. Devereaux is entitled to her opinion, and I'm completely entitled to disagree with her -- which I do in every possible way. Capt. Edwin C. Steen, MD Fellowship, Johns Hopkins University ER Physician, Seattle Memorial HospitalNov. 22: How Spike and Lifeline ended up on YouTube  The elusive chameleon arrives at University of Oregon to do a little research of her own at the Library, when she happens upon this little scene right here...Nov. 24: Second Rebuttal to Krista  (Once again, this appears in a soldier's personal blog, and is forwarded virally, without the aid of syndication) One of the first things Ms. Devereaux pulls out of her arsenal this time is...a pop gun, with a sign that says 'Bang!' Really, I was hoping for something better, especially since she spoke very eloquently beforehand about being gifted with a mind. If she'd rather resort to playground tactics, I can *try* to stoop to her level, but gee, she could be a COBRA operative running a syndicated column under the guise of fame! Good heavens, Why doesn't someone investigate her?? Are we done with the finger-pointing? I hope so. It's terribly childish. I signed this rebuttal with my credentials to allow Krista to see who I am, that I don't hide behind anonymous names or computer handles. I'm a real person. She's more than welcome to discover this for herself. Let me continue by saying that while it's admirable Ms. Devereaux has military personnel in her family, and has finally demonstrated a working knowledge of the armed forces (which she probably should have done in her first column), this does not make her even remotely qualified to speak for them. It would be equally ludicrous for me to suddenly announce that since I have a younger sister who once starred as 'Annie' in a fourth-grade play (which is TRUE: Go Steph! I love ya, mwah!!), that I suddenly have credentials to know what's best for all actors. I'm sure Ms. Devereaux would surely take issue if I began telling her how things should run in her industry, as she should. It would be...obnoxious, at best. I'd like to know where she's getting the Joe mission response time data. Sounds like she's making it up. If it's such a secret organization, how is there unclassified response time data available for them? Curious... Additionally, if Ms. Devereaux has such faith and pride in her country and her government, she has a pretty difficult time trusting them enough to make such an important decision. If the Joes have been around for this long without getting their budget cut, then they must be doing something right. Capt. Edwin C.

She had some minor bruising and lacerations to several internal organs, and one of the lacerations cut very close to her thoracic vertebrae and her spinal cord. Fortunately, nothing was severed. The paralysis that she's experiencing now is due to inflammation interfering with spinal nerves. In other words, it's a temporary situation, until the swelling and infection goes down. There may be need for a second surgery to stabilize some of the other internal injuries, but I really want to wait and see, because there's a chance it may not be necessary if she does well in coming weeks. I'm sending a notice out to Joes with 'O-Type' blood to please donate for Scarlett. She bled heavily during surgery, and she will need a steady supply in coming days.

Now that I'm back at base, I feel I need to explain what happened, and why I missed the rendezvous point at Calgary during the flood rescue. While inside the flood waters, I obtained a moderate scrape on my left arm. Unfortunately, this went unnoticed by me until much later, and by then, I was in a lot of trouble. While helping the other medics at the City Centre staging grounds some time later, I developed a high fever due to the scrape becoming infected by streptococcus-A bacteria. I became paranoid and disoriented, and apparently...ended up in a warehouse, immobilized by the infection and subsequent blood poisoning. Thankfully, I still had the consciousness of mind to call Spike, who in turn let 910 know what was going on. Because of the quick response of Dr. Miller and 910, I'm alive to write this report. My arm is seriously infected, and it's going to take some powerful antibiotics to clear it up, but I'm just grateful to still have the arm, not to mention my life.

Rhino was back in our custody. Briefly. Unfortunately, he is no longer in our custody. I went to visit Dr. Miller in our Los Angeles satellite clinic facility, where I observed Rhino strapped to an examination bed with restraints. Dr. Miller informed me that Rhino had moments of lucidity where he would remember who he was before his alteration, and he would be cooperative in those instances. At the time I examined him, Rhino was conscious and aware of his surroundings, and he responded to his name, Matthew. I wanted to get a better idea of how the Quintessons were able to control him, so I examined his head to see if it would be possible to give him an electroencephalogram (EEG) and measure brain wave activity. What I discovered was that his physical modifications included the back half of his skull replaced by thick metal plating, but fortunately, the front part of his skull was still bone, so obtaining brain wave readings was awkward but possible. Around this time, a third person joined us in the room, someone who identified herself as 'Dr. Jones'. She was acting somewhat suspicious, and not long after her arrival, a strong signal began to override and overpower Rhino's EEG readings. Once this strong signal had established itself, Rhino once again behaved like an emotionless automaton, and easily broke the bed restraints to escape the clinic. 'Dr. Jones' also escaped in the ensuing chaos. I have no idea if her arrival and Rhino's reversion to his Quintesson reprogramming were in any way related, but the timing was suspicious. Rhino's current whereabouts are unknown, although a Junkion in the area went in pursuit of him. General Hawk, I understand completely that he's entirely too dangerous to have on the loose, but I would seriously rethink a takedown order. Rhino is still in that brain. Dr. Miller and I have both witnessed it. Some sort of signal causes him to revert and lose control. Chance suggested that perhaps a Faraday cage lining a confinement cell would be able to block a control signal, and it sounds like something we should try, provided we could get him confined and keep him there for any length of time.

Although vastly modified, he still suffers from the same experimental (and therefore, unreliable) technology of the original prototype. When in space, Starfire consumes quite a lot of fuel, which, if he's not careful, can leave him stranded. In jet mode, he has an inverted wing design, allowing him to fly at speeds up to Mach 5. With a set of extra fuel tanks and independent rocket boosters, he is able to whip himself around Earth's gravity and fling himself to space. It's a rather dangerous 'slingshot' move, but he generally doesn't care. In space, he can kick in his FTL engines and fly at speeds of Mach 25. During combat, he has three modes to choose from, all sporting an impressive payload. On the back of his jet mode, he carries a pulse cannon with a range of 200 miles. Along his wings are a variety of missiles from air-to-air to air-to-ground, and Starfire carries a large plasma rifle in robot mode. Starfire's limited programming tends to leave him unimaginative in combat, and easily outfoxed, for all his formidable weaponry.History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  Starfire was created from the same prototype as Jetfire, but exchanging intelligence for even greater speed. His programming is limited in hopes that unlike Jetfire, Starfire will remain loyal to the Decepticon cause.MUX History:  Starfire currently patrols the inner planets of the Sol system.OOC Notes  Starfire was a second attempt by Shockwave to create a loyal successor to his failed Jetfire project.Logs 2007 2008 Players  Starfire is played by his creator.Wheeljack  \"That guy can build a neutron bomb out of a wristwatch and a rusty can,\" says Bluestreak, and that's not far from the truth. As well as the Ark fashioned the Autobots, Wheeljack is always coming up with ways to improve them, particularly their weaponry. His knack for creating wild new gadgets has earned him a \"mad scientist\" reputation and their deadly effectiveness has earned him the respect of friends and enemies alike. He is also the Autobot most adept at driving while in his automobile mode (a Lancia Stratos Turbo racing car) and has pulled off tricks that Hollywood stunt drivers haven't even dreamed of yet. He fully enjoys showing off when the opportunity presents itself. In addition to those mentioned above, Wheeljack, while in Autobot mode, can use the solid-fuel rockets in his arms to fly at speeds of 320 mph with a range of 800 miles. His shoulder-mounted cannons shoot a variety of shells: a magnetic-inducer shell, which douses its victims in a magnetic dust that attracts ferrous objects from distances up to 4000 feet away that adhere to and eventually disable the victim; a shrapnel-needle shell, which explodes into millions of hair-thin filaments that can pierce even the strongest armor and disrupt internal circuitry; and a gyro-inhibitor shell, which implants itself upon impact and destroys the balance of its victims. Wheeljack is continually adding new gimmicks to his shells. Wheeljack is his own worst enemy. He frequently injures himself while experimenting with new weapons.History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  Wheeljack was one of the original crew of Autobots aboard the Ark when it crashed into the Earth four million years ago. Originally a boxy-shaped transport affixed with retractable, bumper-mounted cutting blades, Wheeljack was reformatted in 1984 to be a speedy and rare Lancia Stratos Turbo custom racing car. Wheeljack was part of the battle unit organized by Jazz to first challenge the re-awakened Decepticons on Earth. He was involved in the battle at an off-shore oil rig, where the Autobots would meet the Witwickys, human workers who would befriend the Autobots. Wheeljack developed an especially close friendship with Sparkplug Witwicky, as the two were both gifted mechanics. Wheeljack was next part of the team that attempted to stop the Decepticon plot to overload Sherman Dam. A restless engineer, Wheeljack has developed all manner of contraptions and equipment for his personal use and for use by his fellow Autobots, often with catastrophic results. He designed the compact yet extremely powerful explosive that nearly trapped the Decepticons in the ruby crystal mines of Burma, a magnetic inducer device capable of stopping Transformers cold in their tracks, an immobilizing device that could solidify almost any type of matter, and a gyro-inhibitor shell that could incapacitate even Megatron for short spans. Upon discovery of dinosaur bones in caverns within the Ark's volcano, Wheeljack and Ratchet were inspired to construct robotic version of dinosaurs. The Dinobots were originally too dangerous and too primitive to control, leading to Optimus Prime commanding that the project be abandoned, but Wheeljack secretly persisted. He developed memory components that increased the Dinobots' intelligence, turning them into valuable, if sometimes unpredictable, members of the Autobot forces. Concealed in Wheeljack's left wrist is a fire suppression system, which no doubt came in handy when one of his devices would blow up in his face.MUX History:  In 1997 Wheeljack built the Weatherbots as well as a few new OC Dinobots like Snoop. When Mirage destroyed a Space Bridge while it was in use, ripping a hole in time and space, Wheeljack was able to create what he called an Interdimensional Channel Changer which he used to repair the rift. It was also useful against the Deadite invasion and against the Junkion heralds of alt-Unicron. In 2014, when Autobot City fell to the Decepticons, Wheeljack was able to get out of the city with many of his inventions, leaving Benin-Jeri to incinerate the rest if/when the medlab was breeched. Wheeljack operated from the Ark until the city was recovered, and then headed to Cybertron to help gather supplies to rebuild the city. In 2018, during an assault on the Ark, Wheeljack kept the ship's functions going long enough to fend off the attack.OOC Notes  Wheeljack is currently the head of the Autobot Science division. He possesses an Interdimensional Channel Changer that he can use to access several different dimensions, including the Deadite world, the Unicron-controlled Junkion from where Evil Kaleidoscope hails, and Gobotron.Logs / Posts 2009 2015 February 11 - Galvatron is Dead February 17 - \"Attack on the Blackrock Oil Platform\"  The Autobots respond to an attack in the Gulf of Mexico.February 18 - \"Aftermath of the Oil Platform Attack\"  Autobots deal with the results of the Decepticon attack on the Blackrock Oil PlatformApr 08 - Flash Pak  \"Yeah.

He grew up in the shadow of his older and more famed brother Spike. Buster is highly intelligent, but dangerously inept when it comes to operating mechanical or electrical devises. He can ruin a VCR just trying to set the clock, and when it comes to his beat-up jalopy, he doesn't even trust himself to check the oil. After spending a good majority of his 20s, and his early 30s in college, Buster now teaches comparative literature at a college in Oregon, a field he must constantly defend to his brother and father who don't understand how it could possibly be useful in the real world. He enjoys visiting his brother and being an uncle to Daniel\u00a0and Megan, but he is sometimes jealous of his older brother's success and exciting adventures with the Autobots. He is just starting to become his own man, and the process is sometimes painful and slow.Description  place among the Autobots and his more famous family.History Canonical/Pre-MUX/Theme History:  Born in 1975, by the age of four Robert William \"Buster\" WITWICKY had amassed a remarkable score in several reading and comprehension aptitude tests. However, this was offset by a shyness that borderlined on debilitating. This dilemma required a series of parenting techniques that reflected the growing new parental trends that were popularized by such pioneers as Benjamin Spock (and not the stern, belt-ready parental ways enforced by his grandfather). Fortunately for Buster, his mother was well-versed in these techniques and worked patiently aside Buster to encourage him to break out of his shell, encouraging such \"baby steps\" feats as making it a goal to just say \"hi\" to one person his age. Occasionally when put in an unpleasant situation, Buster would cease conversation altogether, freaking out his mother as this behavior would last days, not hours. Susan responded by upping her son's speech therapy sessions, but even that approach failed to bring the youngest Witwicky to utter a word if he was overly distressed. In early elementary school, Buster preferred to stay indoors in class during recess and help his teachers with assignments or with clean up instead of playing with his peers outside. On Christmas Eve, 1980, Buster was stricken by a nasty croup, which prevented him and his family from going to his grandfather and grandmother's house for Christmas (Sparkplug didn't mind a bit). His older brother was also ill with an inner ear infection. On Christmas Day, Buster was given a Lionel train set.\u00a0 Susan's tireless work was showing noticeable signs of improvement for Buster until 1981, when Susan was killed in a freak auto accident. The death was devastating for all three surviving family members, but it particularly scarred Buster. \"Retreating into one's shell\" would be too slight of a comparison to describe Buster's reaction to his mother's death. In his case, he virtually bunkered himself in his shell. With the loss of the one parental member who understood his struggles, Buster shut down. In a move that many consider a textbook example of PTSD, Buster didn't utter a word for weeks after his mother's funeral. Sparkplug mistakenly took Buster's response as his son punishing him for the accident. It was only by the intervention of Buster's uncle, Ron Witwicky, that Buster began the long process of breaking out of his shell again. As Ron began transitioning from the unconventional living as a stage hand and concert promoter to a more grounded reality as a teacher, he studied Buster's condition and came to the conclusion that Buster needed more discipline (despite Sparkplug being no slouch in that field of parental responsibility), not less. The catch was that the discipline had to be dealt in a way that would give the illusion of control. When Buster was forced to stay at Ron and Judy's (Buster's aunt), he was awarded a room where he could do anything he wished in terms of decor. In addition, he was given equal voice in determining family meals. Most reassuring was that Ron set the boundary that Buster could shut his door and he had the full authority to allow or not allow Ron or Judy into his room. The tradeoff: Buster had to be in bed by 9 p.m. sharp and do every chore that was asked of him. In terms of not speaking, Ron calmly accepted Buster's muteness as a mere personality quirk. Whereas Sparkplug confusion and frustration with Buster proved to be counter-productive, Ron accepted Buster's communication as absolutely normal, accepting anything from written notes to non-verbal gestures like they were spoken directly from Buster's mouth. Ron's easygoing attitude toward his nephew was summed up by him saying \"It's no different than raising a deaf child.\" Sparkplug didn't appreciate the humor. The tactic worked, and slowly Buster retreated from his shell and began speaking again, haltingly at first, and then practically a motormouth in the conforting confines of Judy and Ron's home. In 1984, when Spike and Sparkplug were rescued from certain death on a collapsing oil rig by the Autobots, Buster was left to the care of his aunt and uncle, Judy and Ron. However, as Spike and his father became closer with the Autobots, Sparkplug asked Ron to care for Buster a few more weeks, which turned to months, which turned to years. Ron and Judy later took on the responsibility of raising Buster full-time while he went to junior high. Sparkplug, concerned that letting Buster live with the Autobots at such a young age would be a risk on his life, felt leaving Buster in the care of his brother and sister-in-law was the best solution to a problem that offered no easy alternatives. Though this decision was made for Buster's safety, it caused a tremendous rift within the Witwicky family. For Ron and Judy, the addition of Buster to their family affected their own plans on starting their own family. Judy, knowing that Buster barely knew his mother before she died, took pains in protecting and nurturing Buster. Ron, an English teacher, also tried his hardest to make Buster feel more like a family member rather than an extended houseguest. Still, the situation for Buster and his brother forced Sparkplug to side with one son. Realizing his earnings as an oil rig worker could never provide Spike and Buster the near limitless opportunities (mostly educational, but he hoped financial as well) that befriending the Autobots would offer, he allowed Spike the chance to befriend the Autobots, so long as he was close by to protect his occasionally reckless son. By doing this, Sparkplug hoped that when Buster was older (around 14 or 15), he would join the family at the Ark and help the Autobots defeat the Decepticons. Unbeknownst to Sparkplug, Buster showed little to no interest in following their footsteps.\u00a0 In 1985, Buster experienced his first major feeling of\u00a0schadenfreude (it wouldn't be the last time) toward his brother and father as the Autobots were apparently exposed by business tycoon\u00a0Shawn Berger as being phonies - every bit as evil and manipulative as the Decepticons. However, he was equally pissed when the mass population, instead of rejecting both factions, blindly threw their support to the Decepticons. Still, he hoped that Spike and Sparkplug would return and eventually begin resuming a normal family life (but only after getting a tomato or two thrown at them by an angry mob). That dream was short-lived when Spike and Sparkplug were captured by the Decepticons and were forced to work in an energy processing plant. And much to Buster's disappointment, that dream was utterly extinguished when the Autobots returned from exile to rout the Decepticons - and Spike and Sparkplug's steadfast loyalty with the Autobots only solidified their bond.\u00a0 The last years of elementary school and first few years of junior high were especially painful for Buster as he faced routine teasing and mocking from classmates who were either jealous of his family's association with the Autobots or were downright hostile to the \"new alien invaders.\" The fact that Buster didn't share his father and son's enthusiasm for the Autobots didn't seem to matter for his tormenters. Buster continued to cope with being an outcast the only way he knew how: by retreating inward and escaping into books and science fiction. Fortunately, he began to slowly develop some deep friendships in high school that would extend well into college. For Buster, the friendships formed with Alan, 'O,' Barry and especially Jesse, would replace the void left by the absense of his brother and father throughout the most turbulent years in his life. When Buster graduated high school in June of 1993, a number of colleges expessed interest in him due to his high test scores, but his low grades during his rebellious years prevented him from getting the scholarships needed to attend any decent colleges without bankrupting Judy and Ron (not to mention the fact that Buster didn't want to take anything from his real dad Sparkplug, nor dip into the small college fund Ron and Judy had set up for their son Sam). When Buster took his SATs, he checked a small box asking if he would be interested in possible military assistance with college tuition. He didn't realize that as soon as he turned 18 this would lead to several branches of the military contacting him, each trying to hard-sell him on military service. However, as the son of a Marine (even an estranged son), there was only one branch Buster would consider, even if he certainly didn't look the type or fit the stereotype. When Buster walked into the Marine recruitment office, jaws hit the floor. He tested far above anyone who'd every applied there, and the recruiters immediately began to salivate and talk to Buster about military intelligence. Working with Buster to help him (barely) pass the physical requirements, Buster slogged his way through boot camp, getting the first tan in his life, and was immediately trained in Arabic and sent to the Middle East. In the Middle East, Buster worked as a translator for the Marines. With his skill in languages, he was soon writing local dispatches as well. At first Buster enjoyed his work, seeking to help the situation through non-violent means, but eventually he became disillusioned, feeling he was contributing more to a propaganda machine than actually dispensing truth and easing tensions. When his four-year tour of duty was over, Buster left the Marines for civilian life. Returning to the states, Buster was quickly able to turn his military experience into a PR job at a major corporation. However, he sooned learned that he felt as unsatisfied writing spin for a company as he did creating dispatches on behalf of the US government. Risking the disapproval of his father, he quit his safe corporate job with benefits, and entered the life of academia.Favorite Books of All Time Favorite Albums of All Time MUX History:  In 1999, Buster enrolled at the University of Oregon in hopes of completing an accelerated three-and-a-half year plan to obtain his bachelor's degree, becoming the second Witwicky (after Ron) in recent times to graduate college. In 2003, Buster completed his bachelor degree and enrolled in the graduate program. In 2009, Spike and Buster slowly began to repair their straining relationship after Spike's mindswap with Motormaster and with their father being in a nursing home. Buster's uncle, Ron, paid for two tickets for Buster and his girlfriend to go to New York City. The only catch: he wanted Buster to make a stop to White Plains, NY, where Spike was receiving extensive rehabilitation for the after-effects from the mindswap. Ron didn't want, nor expected Buster to put years of strained ties behind him. However, with Spike's condition, Ron eventually convinced Buster that if any change were to happen in their relationship, Buster would have to make the first move since Spike was almost literally incapable of making the first move. The main reasoning behind Ron's generous offer was the fact that with their dad in a nursing home and Sam taking up more of their time, Spike was the only fully-functioning member of Buster's immediate family. Initially it was a \"one step up and two steps back\" type of reunion as the Autobots inevitably factored in with Buster and Spike's meetings. However, disasters have forged a closer bond between the two. In the fall of 2009, Megatron's weather-altering device resulted in the near-catastrophic flooding of Buster's college home. He was forced to stay in his university's dorm building, sleeping with other disaster victims on cots in study rooms while continuing to take classes. Over Thanksgiving in 2009, Buster announced his plans to Sparkplug and Spike that he would be seeking either a doctorate or another master's degree, guaranteeing another four or five years of college for the professional student. In 2010, Spike arranged for Buster's landlord and her husband to fix up the house Buster once shared with his roommates. Spike chipped in insurance money from the destruction of his own house to help Buster's landlord afford the repairs. As Spike anticipated living in the Ark when it returned to Oregon, the brothers would soon be living in close proximity once again. In May, Buster became the proud owner of a 1997 Chevy Cavalier with 196,000 miles on the odometer and a questionable transmission. Spike was under the impression Buster bought it for a $1, and thought it was worth every penny. Sadly enough, Buster actually paid $1000 for it, and just listed \"$1\" on the title to avoid paying taxes on it. On May 2, 2011, Buster became an uncle again with the birth of his niece, Megan. The next day, he completed and submitted his very last paper to be written for his last class in completion of his Master's degree. On June 13th he finally graduated and immediately began work on his doctorate. Soon after his long-time girlfriend convinced him to move out of the delapitated house he shared with his roomates and in with her. Since his car couldn't make the trip to visit Carly and Spike, Spike eventually brought Buster's new niece to Jesse's apartment so Buster could meet Megan. Due to world-wide flooding, in 2011 Buster relocated to the Ark with the rest of his family for safety. Buster seemed to adapt well to a life of hauling rescue supplies around, as a break from his normal academic routine. While at the Ark, Buster has began to win favor of a few Autobots, much to the surprise of his brother. The sometimes jovial, othertimes cantankerous Ratchet has struck up a fast friendship with Buster. The Autobot diplomat Crosscut recommended Spike recruit Buster's help in finding more effective ways to deal with military leaders. Because of these new developments, Spike's started to feel like his brother was slowly beginning to overshadow Spike's own position with the Autobots. Buster, on the other hand, was surprised to enjoy his time on the Ark so much, and decided to stay on the Ark after the crisis was over, at least until Jesse's apartment was restored. While at the Ark, Buster became a caretaker for his ailing father, though the time being spent in his old stomping grounds greatly improved the elder Witwicky's disposition. Crosscut began assessing Buster's strengths and started to direct Buster to assume some diplomatic duties catered to his social and physical strengths. Spike didn't feel threatened in the least by this action. Nope. Not at all.  In 2012, before leaving for Cybertron, Blaster built a helperbot to assist Buster and Spike in taking care of Sparkplug in Autobot City. Snoop assisted by giving Helperbot a Santa hat and teaching it how to dance. This immediate warping of the helperbot's personality didn't make Buster feel any more comfortable having it around, and Buster secretly worries it will become a danger to his dad. In late 2012, Buster found himself at another fork in the road in his life. With the world-wide flood no longer occupying all of his time, and winter semester starting before he could register, Buster began weighing his options: remain with the Autobots and continue to find a place in a world that he once viewed as hostile toward him, or finish his education, being the first Witwicky to achieve the academic title of \"doctor\".\u00a0 Buster returned to school in the fall semester in 2013 to complete his education. Until then, he had many potential projects to bide his time. In addition to being trained by Crosscut for possible diplomatic duties, he also had to learn the ins and outs of a computer system designed to effectively manage communication between G.I. Joe and the Autobots. On the side, he had three other projects occupying his time. The first one being a possible book written by Buster about his experiences with the Autobots. A second involves piecing together missing elements of the Witwicky family tree, including his great-great-great grandfather.\u00a0 The third was planning a handfasting with his long-suffering girlfriend Jesse. On April 7 Buster Witwicky became handfasted to Jesse Macchio.OOC Notes  Buster is a character from Marvel comics. None of his comic history is explicitly canon, but some of his personality is the same. On the MUX, Buster was born in 1975, and is 5 years younger than his older brother Spike. Due to the effects of the Timewarp TP, Buster seems younger than he is, although the more time that passes the less obvious it is. He is currently a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, studying Comparative Literature, although he has taken a year's sabbatical to work on his own projects. Buster wears a ring on his left hand that says, \"One Ring to Rule them All\" in Elvish.Logs 1978 1980 1981 1992 1993 2009 2010 2012 2013 2016 2017 \"What If\" Timelines G.I. Joe World Timeline  While most encryption is done these days on computers, there are still spies who do things the old way - numbered words in books, messages left in obscure languages, and the like. Robert \"Code Buster\" WITWICKY is a master of the more traditional aspects of spy-craft. A skilled comparative linguist, he knows several languages and has an encyclopedic knowledge of books and codes. Although a menace with real-world electronics and mechanical systems (he leaves that sort of thing to his brother), Code Buster is a master of both human and computer languages. Growing up at the knee of his father, the brilliant gadgeteer and top mechanic code-named Sparkplug, Code Buster encountered family tragedy early when his mother (Susan) was gunned down by an unknown assailant (widely believed to have been in retaliation against her and Sparkplug's covert work). He also saw his older brother institutionalized following several mental breakdowns and a suicide attempt. For nearly a decade, Sparkplug and Buster lived in the same house alone, giving Sparkplug plenty of time to mentor his younger and more accomplished son. Code Buster joined the Marines at a young age as a Special Forces recruit and was selected to his dream assignments - military intelligence work for G.I. Joe. His next employment was as a National Security Agency (NSA) security agent for the Center for Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland, before joining the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to work on IT security. Firmly ensconced in the worldwide security network, at first Code Buster couldn't be happier, and felt his work monitoring militants helped keep the world save from terrorism. In 2007, Code Buster was promoted to field work and given cover as a travelling columnist. To maintain his cover, Code Buster's columns began showing slight anti-G.I. Joe bent, which became more pronounced over the years, and began to include satirical cartoons as well. By 2013, Code Buster's articles and comics were beginning to have enough bite that they drew the attention of Joe brass, and some began to wonder if he'd started to believe his own anti-N.W.O. paranoid rants. Personality-wise, Code Buster possesses a confidence that borders on reckless. He's supremely confident in his abilities and isn't afraid to strike back at any organization, be it terrorism or his own bosses, that he feels has done him an injustice. His brashness has led to an occasional lecture by his far more measured father.\u00a0Witwicky \"What If\" Timeline  In 1984, Sparkplug and Spike returned from working on an oil rig, and being attacked by the Decepticons. Sparkplug's brush with death resulted in a renewed appreciation for his family and he vowed to pay more attention to Buster. The youngest Witwicky still harbored some angst toward his father and brother, resulting in the typical teenage moodiness, but Sparkplug's presence, combined with Spike's distancing from his father, resulted in Buster and Sparkplug gradually building bridges of communication. Sparkplug's confidence in Buster resulted in Buster finally breaking out of his debilitating shyness. In college, he excelled in English, and thanks to many scholarships, he was able to easily go from undergraduate, to masters, to doctoral degree. In 2005, Buster began laying the foundation of a science fiction epic, which would become his first novel. In 2007, his novel was finally published. While the book received \"good-to-mediocre\" reviews, it was notable enough to have reviews published in Library Journal, The New York Times, The Village Voice, and Washington Post. Backed with a supporting girlfriend (Jesse) and his father's beaming pride, Buster has amicably rolled with the highs and lows of life as a published author - and as a result, he continues to push forward with his sci-fi epic while also teaching English at the University of Oregon.Logs Players  Buster is currently temped by Bzero, but is available for application.Optimus Prime  If he had been born on Earth, he could be a doctor, a mechanic, a scientist, and a warrior. But on Cybertron there is no difference between these professions. So OPTIMUS PRIME uses his skills to heal and repair the world around him and, if necessary, to fight. Both in power and intelligence, he has no equal. He can be immensesly kind and his compassion extends to all that lives, including the creatures of Earth. Yet he will battle unceasingly to protect the weak and defend what he believes in. In robot mode he can split into three components. Optimus is the robotic sentient being that is the storehouse of his vast knowledge and strength. He can lift 4,000,000 lbs and a blow from his fist exerts a force of 12,000 pounds per square inch. He carries an energy rifle that can burn a hold in the nosecone of a Decepticon jet fighter at a distance of 30 miles. His second component is Roller, a small cart-shaped device that he uses to unobtrusively slip behind enemy lines. He can maintain radio control over it at distances up to 1200 miles; having Roller there is like being there himself. He can operate by remote control his Combat Deck module up to a distance of 1500 feet away. The auto-launcher can use a variety of artillery and radiation beam weapons. In Freightliner FL-86 Cabover semi trailer mode, he has a top speed of 150 mph and can make use of his trailer auto-launcher.History Canonical/Theme History:  Cartoon origin: Megatron, frustrated about losing air superiority to the Aerialbots, devises a machine called a Kronosphere that sends living beings back in time. Trapping the Aerialbots in the Kronosphere, Megatron sends the Aerialbots millions of years back in time (on Cybertron). While on Cybertron, the Aerialbots befriend a dockworker named Orion Pax. Pax expresses his admiration for Megatron as well as the new crop of Decepticons, though Silverbolt cautions Pax that Megatron isn't one to be admired. Silverbolt's warnings go unheeded and Pax\u00a0is mortally wounded by Megatron and the Decepticons. Fortunately a kind medic by the name of Alpha Trion\u00a0sees potential in the dying Autoobt and proceeds to reformat Pax in a new experimental procedure. Alpha Trion's efforts succeed and the young Orion Pax is resurrected into the form known as Optimus Prime. Optimus Prime's impact on the Autobots cannot be overstated. Facing certain extinction, Optimus Prime helped turn the Autobot resistance into a more military-oriented, efficient, and disciplined fighting force. Eventually, the Autobots under Optimus Prime's leadership were able to stop the Decepticons from taking over Cybertron. This also resulted in a prolonged military struggle that lasted for millions of years.\u00a0 During this time, countless battles were waged and tens of millions of Autobots and Decepticons lost their lives. This cycle was destined to be dragged into a stalemate with no side budging. That was until Optimus Prime and a team of elite Autobots chose to undergo a daring reconnaissance operation. Taking his top military advisors (Prowl and Jazz) and a team of other esteemed Autobots, Optimus Prime chose to investigate the energy resources in a then unpopulated (by humans) planet. However, their shuttle was ambushed by the Decepticons, led by Megatron. As the craft sustained heavy damage, Optimus Prime made the decision to crash land the crippled craft on the planet. The impact instantly knocked all occupants offline and they remained so for nearly four million years.\u00a0 The crash was devastating to both the Decepticons and Autobots on Cybertorn. However, the more mobilized Decepticons were able to take greater advantage of the crash as the Decepticons, led by Shockwave, began to retake much of Cybertron that was gained by the Autobots. The Autobots were pushed back into the role of having to resort to underground resistance tactics to stay alive. However, some Autobots, notably Ultra Magnus and Elita One, were able to step into the leadership void left by Optimus Prime's disappearance.\u00a0 In 1984, a volcano eruption within Mt. Saint Hilary\u00a0reactivated the Ark. Within days, the Ark had rebuilt all inhabitants. Optimus Prime's transforming mode was rebuilt into a semi-tractor trailer. The reactivation resulted in a new battleground for the Autobots and Decepticons. Inspired by the news that their beloved leader had not perished, the Autobots on Cybertron slowly began to reclaim much of the territories lost during Shockwave's reign. \u00a0Modern historians have referred to this time as the Third Cybertronian War.\u00a0Succession  Though Optimus Prime doesn't plan on going anywhere anytime soon, he's had enough brushes with mortality to know that his time as Autobot leader isn't infinite. Learning from previous mistakes (mainly not having a definitive, go-to second-in-command on Cybertron during the fated Ark mission), Optimus has spent the past 25 or so years mentoring a select few Autobots to ready them to receive the Matrix of leadership should he perish. Though he hasn't officially deemed any certain one as the next Autobot leader, most in his inner circle know Ultra Magnus and Elita One are considered to be \"next in line\" to receive the Matrix, followed closely by trusted Earthbound officers\u00a0Jazz and Prowl.\u00a0MUX History:  In 1997, Unicron arrived early. Prime tried to open the Matrix, but failed. Unicron was defeated anyway by a combined assault of the Autobots, Decepticons, and an alien ally. In 2004, the Decepticon army, including Trypticon, marched against the Autobots in Nevada. Metroplex returned fire, but was forced to retreat by the collective firepower of Trypticon and the Decepticon combined robot teams. Optimus Prime was beaten severely by Megatron and Starscream, and the Autobots fled the US. In 2010, when a rift opened between the regular and Shattered Glass universes, Prime went through to investigate the strange, off-kilter world. However, Jetfire, who Prime left in charge while he was gone, had somehow gotten word that Prime is due to return soon. However, In July of 2012 Optimus Prime disappeared once again for several months, during which Jetfire and Prowl ran the Autobots. In March of 2014, the Decepticon Windshear travelled to Peru to collect remaining shards of the Crystal of Power. Luisa received reports on Windshear's presence, and called in Optimus Prime to help. Confronted there by Optimus Prime, Windshear stood his ground, and was soon backed up by Megatron, who arrived in the Dictator. Megatron was defeated by Optimus Prime, but not before Windshear had time to gather many shards of the Crystal of Power. Windshear returned with Megatron to base, and Luisa gave Optimus Prime several shards of the Crystal that her students had recovered, so the Autobots could study and ascertain what the Decepticons were after. In October of 2014, Optimus Prime helped provide support for a small team of Autobots and G.I. Joes who infiltrated Decepticon City to capture Dr. Arkeville and rescue Typhoon. In 2015, while Megatron battled \"Galvatron\", Optimus Prime used the distraction to capture Galvatron's reformation satellite. Optimus Prime was commander of the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Spirit of Freedom. In 2016, Prime travelled with Arcee, Elita One, Kup, and Swish to Dread, where they destroyed Megatron's death crystal cannon and freed the Dread Slaves, cutting off the Decepticons' source of death crystals. In 2018, the Ark was attacked by a group of Decepticons led by Megatron. The Decepticons were driven back by Autobots commanded by Optimus Prime.OOC Notes  Traditionally, Optimus Prime's player is a member of TPStaff, in charge of providing role-playing opportunities for the Autobot players, as well as assisting CharStaff with Autobot applications.Logs/Posts 1985 1993 2007 Feb 24 - Re: Luminous  Optimus PrimeJune 06 - Snoop finds a key  Nothing is too well-hidden for Snoop to find.June 25 - Assault on the Citadel  Luminous finally leaves her fortress, and Cobra is ready to move in when she does.December 18 - Benin-Jeri comes clean  Benin-Jeri reveals his secret past as an Autobot deserter.2009 Oct 07: Returning To Earth  << The Autobot spinny appears, soon to be replaced by the familiar visage of Optimus Prime >> \"Autobots, I will be returning to Earth shortly, once the Federation is fully checked out -- it seems someone snuck into Iacon, possibly in an attempt to plant a device aboard the shuttle.

If anyone wishes to volunteer their assistance in helping them move in, it would be greatly appreciated. \"Second, I'm going to be trying to meet with General Hawk of GI Joe. At one point, we had a joint strike force that comprised several GI Joes and Autobots -- I want to see if perhaps we can resurrect that once more. \"Third, I'll be attempting to meet with the President soon -- I think it should be publicly known that we desire to move Metroplex -- while the Nevada Desert has been a good location, recent events have prompted me to reconsider the original decision, specifically the attacks on the East Coast. At the very least, I want to move us to a more central location. If we can... perhaps move Metroplex to the East Coast, near the Tennessee / North Carolina border in the Blue Ridge Mountains. \"Fourth, which depends on our placement of Metroplex if the President agrees to the move... if we move to Tennessee, I want to see about refurbishing the Ark for a West Coast base of operations for the Autobots. In this way, we can blanket the United States more effectively -- particularly if we can come to an agreement with GI Joe for another attempt at a joint strike force. \"If there are any questions or concerns, let me know. I'll be trying to set up the meetings over the next few days. 'Til All Are One... Prime out.\" << Prime's visage disappears, replaced once more by the 'Bot spinny >>Nov 07 - Standing Orders  << text-only >> All space-capable Autobots are to prepare themselves for immediate departure. With this new apparent 'weapon' that Destro (and by tacit association, Cobra itself) currently wields, we need to find ways to shut it down. I want all sensor logs checked for satellite activity, and the identities of each satellite (assuming there are more than one -- I'd prefer not to take any chances with this) is ascertained. Blaster and Cosmos, I want you both ready. In case he's using communications satellites for this, I want options to be able to hand Earth's leaders for assisting with maintaining their lines of communication. Wheeljack, Perceptor -- same goes for you. I want options for how to deal with this latest threat.2010 Jan 04 - Communications  << text-only message >> \"While I don't mind GI Joe having some access to our communications network for purposes of reaching us when needed, there have been several incidents in recent weeks where Cobra has apparently broken through our communications encryption. Blaster, I want you to oversee a communications frequency shift, and let the UN, the President and GI Joe know of the new frequency change. And my apologies for not bringing this to your attention earlier. Prime out.\"Jan 22 - Re: Proposal  << text-only message >> Good idea, both of you. Run with it. Anyone who's able to assist, please do so. Hopefully Flint has given you the green light as well -- this would be a good way to bolster relations with GI Joe as well as give humanity another demonstration that the Autobots do mean well.

It is full of static and broken lines at first, but it soon clears up, revealing the image of Optimus Prime. Behind him is the temporary Autobot Base in Valvolux. He is clearly not utilizing the best equipment for communication right now, but he seems nonetheless unperturbed. \"Autobots, this is Optimus Prime. I have been touring and helping with the clean up and recovery of Valvolux, and if I am needed immediately, that is where I may be found. For now, I am issuing the following orders, to supplement, not supplant, orders given by Elita One and others. I need all Autobots not otherwise engaged to participate in the rebuilding efforts in Valvolux. Specifically, I request the aid of the Dinobots. Grimlock, I know that you've been an active participant in this campaign, and I appreciate your valor and cooperation. The people of this city have suffered enough in the wake of the Decepticon's terror march, and I would see the Autobots show them that they are not alone. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome back Windblade, who we are all relieved to see safe and sound once again. The operation that saw her returned to us, however, will leave Megatron furious and embarrassed. He may be quiet for a time, but I am certain he will strike back with a vengeance. I would like to keep some scouts pinned to Decepticon territory for now, in case the Decepticons attempt retaliation. I believe what I'm hearing about Trypticon's status, but we don't know what he'll choose to do yet. I don't want any of us caught unaware. Finally, I wish to reinforce our defenses in Autobot City, should this human war with Cobra in the United States spread too close. I will be traveling between Iacon and Autobot City as time allows to inspect our fortifications. Please keep me appraised of any developing situations on both planets. Speaking of, be wary when operating on Earth. In the wake of information provided anonymously, the name Axegrinder has resurfaced, and if memory serves, that could mean IMORTAL will again as well in some form or another. There have been threats made and plans overheard to isolate lone Autobot patrols. I want this situation taken seriously, and if any Autobot is threatened or assaulted by unidentified machines or suits of armor, report it immediately. Do not travel alone on Earth without backup. Be alert and be safe. Autobots, I emphasize again that these orders are supplemental. If you are otherwise engaged, please continue your tasks and remember: my lines of communication are always open. If you need me, I encourage you to reach out. I will answer.

Since then he's been played by many distinguished admin, including MightyShoxy, Weavah and GilleyZ. In August of 2009, he was temped by TPHead Bzero. Darksabrz played Prime from October of 2009 through March of 2010. In September of 2010, Prime returned to the capable hands of GilleyZ. However, as of December of 2012, Optimus Prime was available again. As of May of 2013, however, GilleyZ was back! However, due to health reasons, he had to leave the character, and as of October of 2013, Colchek was temping the character. In November of that year, Colchek apped and made the character officially his until May of 2018. As of August of 2018, Optimus Prime is played by User:MightyShoxy.References Sources What If? Universes Bot World  \"Security is the right of all sentient beings.\" At a pivotal point in Cybertron's history, the young Optimus Prime managed to defeat the Decepticon Leader Megatron in single combat. Without a strong leader to unify them, the remaining Decepticons quickly turned on each other, breaking into small warring bands. Now, only Polyhex remains as a bastion for the Decepticons. Cybertron is relatively peaceful, and due to Autobot explorations, the planet is once again rich with Energon. Guardians keep the peace, and from the outside, things look perfect - at least, in Iacon. When Unicron attacked Cybertron in 2005, Optimus Prime was able to defeat the Chaos God using the Matrix, cementing the Autobots' feeling of invulnerability. Without a leader, Cyclonus and the Sweeps settled on Chaar, where they eke out a meager existence while plotting their revenge on the Destroyer of Unicron. However, without serious challenges, cultural stagnation has set in within the Autobots' ivory tower of Iacon. Prime is a distant, hands-off leader, leaving enforcement to his Guardians and lieutenants. The Autobots have grown lazy and weak, while envy grows within the Decepticons outside the walls, and the Quintessons gaze at the fractious world, seeing it ripe for the picking. The Bots have become soft without the constant threat of Decepticon attacks. They're complacent. Things seem calm and safe within the dome of Iacon, but should the Guardians be somehow compromised, the Autobots would likely be slaughtered.Con World  The Autobots' desperate attempt to launch the Ark ends in failure, and the majority of Iacon's inhabitants are permanently off-lined. Megatron took over Earth, and killed Prime with his bare hands. Megatron also reigns supreme over Cybertron, as well as many other worlds conquered by the Decepticons, now truly an Empire. The few survivors of the Ark Massacre live beneath the surface of the planet, determined to survive no matter the cost. Optimus Prime is dead, killed by Megatron, and the Autobots are in hiding, literally underground. When his spark merged with the Matrix, Optimus Prime was quickly banished by the elders, where he remained for hundreds of years until Alpha Trion joined the matrix after he was killed by Megatron. The elders blamed Optimus Prime for losing the Matrix and endangering the universe since the Autobots' greatest and most powerful possession was now in Megatron's hands. Optimus Prime could not explain his actions on why he chose to hold onto the Matrix and not pass it off to the Autobots who managed to flee the Ark, only that he felt the Matrix was leading him to hold onto it despite the fact that he was facing certain death. Alpha Trion used his vast knowledge, combined with the knowledge of the elders to show how the universe would have folded out had Prime handed off the Matrix. In that scenario, a power-hungry Megatron ended up killing the last remaining Autobots in order to obtain the Matrix. A mere few thousand years later, as predicted by the elders, Unicron would return to Cybertron and without an Autobot to open the Matrix, the chaos-bringer would have devoured Cybertron and all its inhabitants. When given that \"alternative\" scenario, the elders apologized to Optimus Prime, and Prime was welcomed back into the Matrix fold. When Unicron actually did attack Cybertron in 2005, Megatron forced Autobot prisoner Hot Rod, to open the Matrix that Megatron had ripped out of Optimus Prime's chest. Once Unicron was destroyed, Megatron killed this \"Last Autobot,\" believing then that he had extinguished the final spark of the Autobots forever. Bumblebee leads a ragtag group of survivors, preparing a last desperate surprise strike against the Decepticons.G.I. Joe World  In the G.I. Joe World universe, Optimus Prime was much more badly damaged than in the mainstream universe, and has yet to be repaired. Unknown to the Autobots and G.I. Joe, the Matrix still resides in his chest. Unfortunately, without the Matrix, Cybertron was destroyed in 2005.Cobra World  In the Cobra World universe, Optimus Prime's significance is lost to Cobra, and he was rebuilt as a simple transport drone, albiet one with a powerful mystical artifact hidden within him. Unfortunately, without the Matrix, Cybertron was destroyed in 2005.Witwicky What If? Universe  Without inheriting two good-hearted, but essentially unremarkable stowaways, Optimus Prime and the Autobots were still able to defeat the Decepticons' attempt at building a ship to return to Cybertron. After that emergency, with the luxury of time, Optimus Prime and the Autobots were able to begin a \"best and the brightest\" program to recruit human talent into their fold. For months, they scoured the globe for leaders in technology, culture, and physics. They had no lack of willing recruits. For the rest of the Autobots' time on Earth, they maintained a steady stream of these types of recruits. While The Ark remained the Autobots' home, Optimus Prime had engineers help design Autobot City to accommodate for human visitors. All of this was documented very clearly in the newspapers that Sparkplug read every morning with passing interest.Logs Spike Witwicky  SPIKE WITWICKY is a mechanical genius, as interested in why things work as how. A caring father in his late thirties, Spike prefers construction work over academic pursuits, enjoying the feeling of accomplishment that comes with building something with his own hands. He has an artist's heart, and he relates well with the Autobots, who have been his friends since he was fourteen years old. Spike has a great respect for Optimus Prime, and he shares the Autobots' intense hatred for the Decepticons because he understands their purpose and ideals more than he admires their powers and abilities.History Canonical Theme History:  The life of the future human ambassador for another species couldn't have had a more unassuming beginning. The first child of William \"Sparkplug\" and Susan Witwicky, Samuel Corey \"Spike\" Witwicky grew up in a decidedly blue collar background. During his early years, he has either shipped to day care or was cared for by his father if Sparkplug took on a job with unconventional hours while his more academic-focused mother took on a more structured '8-to-5' job. However, by the time their second child arrived, Susan reversed her longstanding declaration of wanting to have a full-time career as well as a family - and opted to raise Spike and Buster full-time, at least until Buster reached school age. For the five years without a brother to playfully torment and occasionally mentor, Spike gravitated toward his more rambunctious and rowdy father, but inherited much of his mother's sensitivity and empathy. He quickly picked up his mother's love for reading. While his reading skills were higher than average, a general consensus was that Spike would likely follow in his father's footsteps and would probably work as a carpenter or a mechanic and his far more introverted (and book smart) brother would probably end up taking a job as a reporter or a professor. Though Spike occasionally reveled in his big brother status, for the most part, Spike spent far more time acting as a mentor to his brother, reading to him regularly and instructing him on how to play Star Wars. However, Spike wasn't above the occasional big brother prank on his little brother, so long as said prank didn't result in his little brother going into one of his famous silent streaks. For those few years, the Witwickys' trials were similar to most any family with their financial background - sick kids, the occasional bill juggling, and dry spells in the construction industry for Sparkplug. Then, 1981 arrived, dealing a seismic shift in the Witwicky household. It was that year when Susan was killed in a freak auto accident. The accident left Sparkplug as the sole breadwinner - and left Buster traumatized to the point where he went weeks without muttering a word. A grieving Spike coped by trying to assume as many family duties as he could to help his dad out. The more stuff he did, the less of a chance he had to dwell on the horrible loss. By 1984 Spike was a 14-year-old adolescent working with his father Sparkplug on an oil rig. Though he never let on, the summer away from his few school friends, not to mention zero access to anything resembling the makings of a typical teenage summer (movie theaters, comic book shops, various hangouts that require some sort of land formation) was a monotonous bore for the teen as he often retreated into his journal to pass the few hours of free time he had. That boredom was shattered on a warm summer afternoon when the Decepticons attacked. After the Autobots rescued them, they volunteered to become their native guides to planet Earth. Spike had many adventures with the Autobots, taking part in just about everything they did on Earth for at least the next few years. He became especially close friends with the Autobot Bumblebee. At one point, however, Spike was injured in a Decepticon attack, and his mind was transferred to the unstable Autobot X. The process began to play havoc with Spike's mind, allowing Megatron to manipulate him into attacking Optimus Prime and the Autobots. Only after nearly killing his father did Spike realize that he was being duped. His mind was subsequently transferred back into his body. In the course of his adventures with the Autobots, he met Carly, an impetuous prodigy and MIT graduate. Despite being smarter, older (she could drive), and hotter than him, Carly displayed a noticeable affection for the tech-savvy Spike. However, Spike's youthfulness and Carly's collegiate demands caused a strain in their relationship and in 1988, the two broke up - not on the best terms. But as luck would have it, the two reconnected at a college party both were invited to in 1991 while Carly was in town for the summer. Both wiser and more mature (and slightly hotter in each other's eyes), they quickly rekindled their relationship. They eventually married and together had a child. Spike is a self-professed music geek. However, with real-life duties such as work, family and learning all he can about the Autobots getting in the way, he is finding it harder and harder to stay on the \"cutting edge\" in discovering music. More comfortable listening to old-reliables like Pearl Jam and Radiohead, that hasn't stopped him in at least trying to discover new sounds, even if his timing is off by about four years (in 2009, he just discovered The Arcade Fire). To compensate, he usually leaves the new musical discoveries up to Blaster, Jazz or his brother (though he usually secretly deletes a good majority of his brother's recommendations from his iPod after one or two listens).More than Meets the Eye  In\u00a01984, Sparkplug and his son\u00a0Spike\u00a0were working on an offshore oil rig. The day was like any other day, with Sparkplug asking his son to help him flush out a drill bit. Before they could carry out their task,\u00a0giant robotsdescended from the sky and landed on the oil rig, and with no provocation, were almost immediately attacked by Sparkplug's coworkers. Regardless, their intentions became clear when Sparkplug himself was pinned against a wall by a small purple robot, who then threw Spike overboard when he tried to help his father. Freeing himself from the robot's clutches, Sparkplug dived into the water after his son. While the rig workers hid in the ocean, another group of giant robots arrived and fought with the group of robots who were stealing oil from the rig. The leader of the evil robots destroyed the rig and set fire to the oil tanks as a diversion while he escaped. The good robots, calling themselves the\u00a0Autobots, saved the oil rig workers from a fate exactly the same as death. Grateful, Sparkplug and Spike happily latched on to the friendly alien robots, offering up their expertise and knowledge about planet\u00a0Earth\u00a0in exchange for joining the team. After the Autobots failed to stop the evil Decepticons at\u00a0Sherman Dam, Sparkplug, Spike and\u00a0Trailbreaker\u00a0had a tea party in the woods, ostensibly so they could eavesdrop on the nearby Decepticon base. After finding out that the evil robots intended to attack the\u00a0Ruby Crystal Mines of Burma, Sparkplug opined that he preferred being a spy to his old job at the oil rig, which was just as well, given the fact he was now unemployed. Later, Sparkplug's prior experience in the Burma mines came in handy when the Autobots needed to plant an explosive device inside the mine. As he left with\u00a0Bumblebee, Sparkplug declared that their mission was for both the fortunes of\u00a0Cybertron\u00a0and Earth. Moments later, they were caught in the explosion and buried alive. Oops. Fortunately, they were saved. Later, both father and son volunteered for the Autobot attack on the\u00a0Decepticon space cruiser. After\u00a0Optimus Prime\u00a0failed to stop the cruiser, Sparkplug tried to reassure the Autobot leader that he'd done all that anybody could do. Subsequently, the Decepticons were apparently defeated when their ship crashed into the sea, so Sparkplug and Spike were to join the Autobots as they went home to Cybertron, with fuel from the grateful nations of Earth.Long-Term Impacts  The reawakening of the Autobots and Decepticons had a profound effect on every single living Witwicky (and some dead). Sparkplug made the sole decision to help the Autobots. The decision eventually cost him his house as he and his son moved into the Ark to assist the Autobots full-time. The \"beyond once in lifetime\" chance to not only meet beings from outer space, but to actually LIVE with them was a dream come true for Spike. He bacame so enamored with the life, however, that he paid little to no attention to his little brother's inability to adjust to such a radical shift in their lives. After only a few days of living in the Ark, it was evident that Buster would never adjust at the young age of 9. As a result, his father arranged a \"long term\" living situation with his aunt and uncle. It began a long series of events where his father inevitably chose the needs of one son (Spike) over the other. This began a long-simmering grudge Buster harbored toward his father and brother. The strained relationship would take almost 20 years to repair. At its lowest point, Buster refused to visit his brother in the hospital, even after Spike was almost fatally wounded by Frenzy and ended up in a coma for months. On a personal level, the relationship with the Autobots challenged Spike in ways he never could have foreseen. Before meeting the Autobots, Spike was convinced his life would turn out much like his father's blue-collar career path. He began writing about his adventures and eventually became a part-time diplomat.\u00a0Transport to Oblivion\u00a0  For some reason, this did not pan out, and neither the Autobots nor Sparkplug and his son went anywhere. As their livelihoods had been destroyed, the Witwickys seemed to move into\u00a0the Ark\u00a0and were almost constantly hanging out with the Autobots. After the Autobots failed to stop the Decepticons at the local solar power station, Sparkplug helped\u00a0Ratchet\u00a0repair the stubborn old\u00a0Ironhide. Later, Sparkplug stopped the trigger-happy Ironhide from blowing up a shuttle full of Decepticon energon cubes, as he was the only one who bothered to remember the fact that Spike had been captured to pilot the shuttle through the space bridge.Long-Term Impacts  The development of a Space Bridge poses a challenge to Spike and the rest of the Autobots as the Decepticons can easily travel back and forth to Cybertron while the Autobots are forced to rely on much slower methods of traveling back and forth from their homeland. The episode also gave Spike the nasty introduction of being a hostage pawn. This would not be the first time he would be Con bait.\u00a0Divide and Conquer  Spike was lucky enough to be able to ride along with Optimus Prime solo on a patrol, getting some one-on-one time with a being he was quickly beginning to idolize. Optimus Prime receives a distress call from an energy plant, where Chip Chase is coincidentally working at. Prime orders a team of Autobots to rendezvous with him at the plant, where Starscream, Thundercracker, and Skywarp are raiding. On orders from Megatron, the three Decepticons are ordered to attack Optimus Prime. Prime is able to to fend off the three, but is stunned when a stray blast strikes a mainframe. Prime quickly acts as a shield to the exploding mainframe, saving the building's employees from certain death. The three Decepticons take advantage of the situation and strike Optimus simultaneously, gravely injuring the Autobot leader.\u00a0 Prime is taken back to headquarters (with Huffer offering to take Prime's huge cab). Ratchet assess Optimus Prime needs a replacement cosmitron, which is an essential part that regulates a transformer's energy flow. As Ratchet continues to operate on Optimus Prime, Laserbeak manages to sneak into the Ark and fires a direct blow to Optimus Prime's exposed chest panel, creating a massive explosion.\u00a0 Prime miraculously survives, but with his energy depleting rapidly, a group of Autobots (along with Chip) depart on a mission to hack the Decepticon-controlled Space Bridge and travel to Cybertron and retrieve a replacement cosmitron. Megatron catches wind of this plan and allows the Autobots to travel to Cybertron where he orders seekers on Cybertron to create a freak acid rain storm, which disrupts the electrical systems of Trailbreaker, Bumblebee, Bluestreak, and Ironhide. Bumblebee concedes the Autobots lost, but Chip manages to deliver a helluva pep talk - enough for Trailbreaker to activate his force field and Bluestreak to blast the attacking seekers. The Autobots manage to retrieve the cosmitron and successfully return to Earth.\u00a0 Meanwhile on Earth, the Decepticons embark on a massive raid on the Ark to finish off the leaderless Autobots. Some Autobots (namely Huffer) are ready to throw in the towel, but Spike gives a motivation speech of his own, encouraging the Autobots to fight back for Optimus. As the Autobots depart, Wheeljack and Ratchet volunteer to stay with Optimus Prime, providing a last line of defense.\u00a0 The Decepticons manage to wear down the Autobot resistance. As the battle wages on, the team of Autobots tasked with recovering Prime's spare part manage to get into the Ark and deliver the crucial replacement part before Optimus Prime's energy bled out. Outside, Megatron claims victory, but he soon is faced with a fully-recovered Optimus Prime, who challenges Megatron to a one-on-one match. With depleted reserves, Megatron is easily overpowered, and quickly orders his Decepticons to retreat.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Just a few hard-earned life experiences. The first one was seeing a beloved mentor almost die in front of his eyes. The second was hearing some frank fatherly advice: \"Sometimes nothing you do makes any difference.\" And finally, Spike realizes he may have a future in public speaking as he's able to singlehandedly rally a bunch of dejected Autobots to fight for their lives. On top of that, it cemented in Spike's mind the being (not even human) that he would most like to emulate for the rest of his life: Optimus Prime (sorry, Sparkplug - though his father would come in at a very close second).\u00a0War of the Dinobots  While traveling back to the Ark, Optimus tells Spike and Chip that he's happy with the Dinobots and plans to have Ratchet and Wheeljack build two more. Chip and Spike eagerly volunteer their services. Chip lays out the Autobots' needs and decides a stegosaurus and a pteranodon is the way to go. Their efforts pay off as the newly-constructed Dinobots are able to fight their Dinobot brothers to a stalemate, giving Optimus Prime enough time to recover from his injuries and save Grimlock from certain death.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  It's the first time that Spike gets a 'hands-on' chance to built a transformer from scratch. He'll use that experience to \u00a0both build new Autobots and rebuild critically injured Autobots from the base frame up.\u00a0The Ultimate Doom  Sparkplug was kidnapped by the Decepticons as a test subject for\u00a0Doctor Arkeville\u00a0and turned to their side by the doctor's mind control chips. The Decepticons allowed the Autobots to free Sparkplug so he could sabotage Teletraan I, which gave them an easy means to attack the\u00a0 Autobot headquarters. Spike confronted his father over the apparent betrayal, and Sparkplug appealed to his son to join the Decepticons. When Spike refused, Sparkplug declared that the next time they met, it would be as enemies. This caused Spike much emotional pain, until the Autobots found a way to use sound waves to counter the chips and bring the true Sparkplug back.Long-Term Impacts  Spike already lost one parent before meeting the Autobots. And in a span of a few days, he saw his father taken hostage, subjected to twisted medical experiments by a pyschopath, and finally, was almost gunned down by his dad. Needless to say, he carries some emotional scars from that event.\u00a0A Plague Of Insecticons  In Bali, locals have been living in terror as gigantic, robotic insects have been devouring crops. Skyfire takes a few Autobots to investigate. It's soon discovered that these insects are actually Decepticons. An intrigued Megatron takes a few Decepticons to meet these new arrivals, who have actually been here millions of years. It turns out that the three robotic insects, or\u00a0Insecticons, were ejected from an escape pod from a Decepticon cruiser. The Insections delight Megatron as they showcase their powers (building clones, a solid dropkick, lightning manipulation) and overwhelm the Autobots. Megatron finds out the key motivator for the Insecticons: food. He takes them to an oil refinery where he promises the Insections can dine on as many oil tankers as they want. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime intercept the Insecticons and engage in a heated firefight. Shrapnel utilizes the lightning from a gathering storm to blast any Autobot in his way. Spike, remembering some basic high-school science, remembers that rubber tires insulate, and tells the Autobots to transform. The Autobots do so, and are able to gain the upper hand.\u00a0 Optimus demonstrates some serious strength and manages to pull a burning tanker away from an oil platform...and tosses it to Megatron. Realizing the Decepticons are losing, the Insecticons argue that they may not have chosen the right allies, and retreat. An enranged Megatron orders his Decepticons to retreat and pursue the fleeing Insecticons. Optimus is relived that the Autobots won a convincing victory, but fears that the Insecticons will eventually go back into the Decepticon fold out of necessity.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike's knowledge of Earth science saves the Autobots from getting toasted by Shrapnel, which alone ALMOST justifies keeping him and Sparkplug on board the Ark despite the younger Witwicky's tendency to getting captured.Heavy Metal War  Megatron wastes no times trying to up the number advantage for his Decepticons as six more allies (collectively known as\u00a0Constructicons) come to Earth and build a device that is able to transfer other Decepticons' power chip rectifers to other Decepticons. Megatron uses this new device to absorb all of the abilities from his Earth-bound Decepticon fleet, from\u00a0Skywarp's teleportation to\u00a0Rumble's earthquake-making ability. He challenges an unknowing Optimus Prime to a final one-on-one duel, referencing Cybertronian code. The winner stays on Earth with the loser boarding being exiled in space forever. And this is actually phase 1 of Megatron's plan.\u00a0 Prime, bound by honor and confident in his abilities agrees, hoping this final duel will effectively end the Cybertronian war. The Autobots and Decepticons take their respective sides near the Ark and Megatron shocks Optimus Prime almost immediately when he singlehandedly throws Optimus Prime almost the length of a football field.\u00a0 Phase 2 of Megatron's plan begins when the Constructions begin to burrow below the Ark. The Constructions approach Teletraan One, determined to destroy the computer and this the\u00a0Ark. However, the Dinobots were ordered to stay behind and guard the\u00a0Ark.\u00a0The Dinobots intercept the Constructions and begin to overpower them, pushing them outside the\u00a0Ark. The Constructions try to regain an edge by combining into\u00a0Devastator.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Optimus Prime manages to get a few shots in during his own battle, but eventually is easily overpowered by Megatron. Spike, Chip, and Sparkplug watch helplessly as the being they've put the most trust in to protect Earth from the Decepticons get soundly trounced. Megatron declares the war over and blasts Optimus Prime into near-unconciousness. An angry Ironhide refuses to obey Cyberton code and moves to attack the Decepticons, but Prime stops him, claiming Megatron defeated him fairly. He orders the Autobots to return to the Ark and begin preparations for permanant exile. A stickler for rules, Prime even orders the Autobots not to engage in the Dinobots' fight with Devastator.\u00a0 At the Ark, Ratchet and Wheeljack quickly patch Optimus Prime up. Chip Chase runs a diagnostic scan on Optimus Prime and discovers Prime's injuries could only be caused by certain Decepticon powers. They quickly discover Megatron cheated, and Optimus recants his order and sends his Autobots out to stop Devastator and the other Decepticons. As the battle rages, another earthquake erupts, triggering a river of lava. The Autobots push the Decepticons back and manage to push them into the fiery river. Optimus confronts Megatron and blasts him into the lava pool. With all Decepticons apparently drowning in a fiery grave, Spike asks Optimus if the war is really over. Prime gives a noncommittal answer, first saying Megatron and the Decepticons are finished for good, but later saying that nothing is truly forever.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Optimus was right. Nothing is truly forever since every Decepticon survived what appeared to be certain death. In addition, with the introduction of Devastator, Optimus tries to quickly develop a fleet of Autobot combiners to counter such an awesome force of power.\u00a0Autobot Spike \u00a0  In an effort to show his friend\u00a0Wheeljack\u00a0that the Autobot wasn't the only inventor in the\u00a0Ark, Sparkplug once managed to take spare Autobot parts and put them together to make a functioning robot called Autobot X. Once activated, the mindless robot immediately bashed in everything and everyone in sight. After Spike was injured in a battle with the Decepticons, they formulated a plan to transfer Spike's mind into Autobot X while his human body was worked upon by surgeons. Sparkplug regretted this decision, as it drove Spike insane. Only the love Sparkplug had for his son prevented \"Autobot Spike\" from joining the Decepticons. Editor's note: the following events were played as a flashback on the MUX and were not part of the cartoon plot.\u00a0 In the subsequent days following the events that led to Spike's injuries, Sparkplug reassessed his decision to bring him and his son into joining the Autobot cause. Sparkplug still felt a purpose unlike any other in his life when it came to helping an alien species prevent the world domination of an invading alien force. But seeing his son precariously come within inches of death caused Sparkplug to consider other options. Some where unrealistic (Sparkplug's brother admitting that he and his wife would not be able to raise both younger Witwickys), and some were downright humiliating (government-assisted housing and food stamps while Sparkplug tried to find employment). The least painful option was sending his oldest son to military school until he turned 18 - an age old enough to serve alongside his father with the Autobots. However, Prowl's rather evenhanded argument of keeping Spike in the\u00a0Ark\u00a0caused Sparkplug to change his mind at the last minute, much to Spike's great delight. Prowl's argument centered on the argument that despite it being a military complex, the\u00a0Ark\u00a0was the only place that could virtually guarantee Spike and Sparkplug's safety as opposed to being out in the open in a place like the military school). Spike promised his father he'd be more careful and also promised that would be the last time his carelessness would lead to a hospital stay.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike was turned into a Transformer. It would not be the last time. Aside from going through such rights of passage as almost dying in a car accident, the after-effects of the operation used to save his life caused him to be a brutish, 'bot-mashing monster. He still says he has no memories of the time he was housed in Autobot X.\u00a0City of Steel  Taking advantage of some seriously lax city security standards, the Constructions are able to burrow under the Empire State Building. Clearing tons of dirt and debris in a short amount of time, the Decepticons are able to make the entire Empire State Building fall into a pit, where they begin to construct a new armored base.\u00a0 The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, go to intercept. The Constructicons detect that Prime is below them, and Megatron orders the\u00a0Scrapper\u00a0to dig below where Optimus Prime is. Prime falls several stories and Megatron quickly severs Prime's motor relays. Megatron then alerts the Autobots: leave the city at once, or the Decepticons will melt Optimus Prime into scrap. The Autobots agree, and\u00a0Hook\u00a0sadistically disassembles Optimus Prime, leaving only Prime's head for Megatron's trophy case. With the Autobots gone, Megatron declares New York City to be the home of a new Cybertron-like city, unoriginally called... New Cybertron. As the Autobots leave, Spike tells the Autobots there may be another way back into the city: through the underground sewer network. While the Autobots work their way back into the city, the Constructicons take Prime's remains and build weapons out of them, including a mechanized alligator. Spike, Bumblee, Mirage, Ratchet, and\u00a0Hound\u00a0manage to find Optimus Prime's head and they begin to go through the city to find Prime's other parts.\u00a0 Slowly the Autobots retrieve Prime's parts. However, his arm (and rifle) remain under the control of a computer atop the Empire State Building. Spike and Bumblebee make the near-suicidal decision to distract Megatron in the Empire State Building and are able to get Megatron to accidentally destroy the computer controlling Optimus Prime's arm. Meanwhile, on the exterior of the building, Devastator takes Optimus Prime and scales the Empire State Building. Wheeljack, taking a few cues from a human documentary called King Kong, orders a few helicoptors to attack Devastator. When Prime realizes he can use his arm, he sends a signal to it, and an expertly-placed rifle blast sends Devastator (and Prime) plummenting to the city. Prime is rescued, and the Decepticons retreat, leaving the Autobots to clean up a trashed city.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike proves he can get under Megatron's exo-skin, though his dad would have most likely killed him if he found out that Bumblebee went along with the idea of having the weakest Autobot and a teenager be the ones responsible for creating a diversion for the most powerful Decepticon in the galaxy.\u00a0Attack of the Autobots  The Decepticons stage a raid on the\u00a0Ark, but it's only a distraction to draw the Autobots outside while Megatron gets sprayed with an invisibility spray, enabling him to enter Autobot headquarters undetected. He manages to insert a personality destabilizer in all of the Autobot recharging stations. The next morning, the Autobots wake from their recharging station feeling a bit funny. Their eyes turn red and soon they are under Megatron's control. Megatron orders Prime to smash Teletraan One, which he dutifully does.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Jazz, Bumblebee, Spike, and Sparkplug are out testing Jazz's new speakers. The speakers emit a volume so shredding that even Spike complains about the noise. When the four return to the Ark, they realize that Teletraan One has been smashed. Jazz is attacked by Bluestreak, but manages to fend off his attack. Sparkplug quickly deduces that the problem was the Autobots' rest chambers were sabotaged and he manages to cook up an \"attitude exchanger\" that will restabalize their moods (technically \"drain evil and recharge good\"). The device is successfully tested on Bluestreak.\u00a0 Bluestreak, Bumblebee, and Jazz begin to pick off Autobot by Autobot at at rocket base, where the Autobots are gleefully smashing away human ingenuity. With one attitude exchanger back, Bumblebee carefully approaches Optimus Prime and begs him to fight Megatron's control. Prime briefly regains his bearings and begs Bumblebee to help. Bumblebee takes advantage of Prime's hesitation and plants the device on Prime's leg, re-infusing Prime with \"good\".\u00a0 With their bearings intact, the Autobots make a last-ditch effort to atone for their brief \"evilness\" and board a Decepticon-occupied rocket that contains a solar satellite. Jazz's speakers break up the rocket, forcing the Decepticons to retreat. Skyfire takes Optimus Prime into outer space where he throws the satellite into orbit.\u00a0 Back on Earth, a few Autobots bicker about who was most responsible for the Autobot victory. Prime said whoever is responsible, all Autobots will need to chip in to repair the rockets they destroyed. Spike makes a bad joke to Sparkplug and everyone laughs.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  None, except that Spike proves he's almost as good at joke-telling as his idol, Optimus Prime.\u00a0The Immobilizer  Sparkplug was pleased as punch when his son went out with\u00a0Carly, because she was clearly out of Spike's league.Long-Term Impacts  Spike met the hottest, most intelligent, most coolest, girlfriend EVER. They would later break up, only to reunite a few years later. The two would later marry (much to Sparkplug's delight) and have spawned twice.\u00a0The Autobot Run  Spike, Bumblebee, and Chip attend an auto race. After the race, Spike and Chip wonder how cool it'd be if the Autobots did their own race. Bumblebee and the two human sidekicks propose the idea to Optimus Prime. Prime, realizing that after being caught on television destroying rockets weeks earlier - as well as some continued criticism from some humans for allowing Cybertron to enter Earth's orbit and New York City to turn into a mechanical nightmare - agrees that some positive PR may be in order.\u00a0 The race is quickly assembled and thousands of fans attend. Unknown to the Autobots, the Decepticons have devised a weapon that will keep any transformer in their alt mode. With most of the Autobots converged in one location, Skywarp teleports to the race and uses the weapon on the Autobots. After the race, the Autobots realize they can't transform. The Decepticons easily defeat the Autobots by shooting out their tires and overheating their engines. The Autobots are rounded up and are led to Decepticon invention number 2: a grotesque Venus Fly Trap-like machine that chews Autobots into oblivion.\u00a0 Back at the\u00a0Ark, Wheeljack (one of the Autobots who stayed behind) deduces what happened and constructs an antidote...grenade. Bumblebee, Chip, and Spike go to where the trapped Autobots are. Ironhide is almost fed to the chopper, but Optimus Prime manages to ram the machine, freeing Ironhide. Chip and Spike play 'keep away' with the grenade from the Decepticons and the grenade detonates, freeing the Autobots. Wheeljack (easily the Autobot MVP in this incident) manages to steal the transforming-locking mechanism and fires it into Devastator, effectively collapsing the gestault. The Decepticons make a hasty retreat.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  None, with the exception of some very early diplomatic seeds being planted for Spike as he helps organize an Autobot charity race.Atlantis, Arise!  Spike helps a few Autobots blow off some steam ... by arranging a football game with the Dinobots. After a serious thumping,\u00a0Brawn, along with\u00a0Bumblebee,\u00a0Hound\u00a0and Wheeljack, volunteer to check out an energy flare in the Atlantic. Spike, bringing along his SCUBA gear, tags along. Upon discovering the underwater city of\u00a0Sub-Atlantica, the squad is ambushed by the Decepticons' new ally\u00a0Nergill. They are overwhelmed by Decepticon forces and retreat, with Wheeljack being captured by their enemies. Optimus Prime takes the Autobots to Washington D.C., where the Decepticons were headed. With Decepticon technology, Nergill is able to bring Sub-Atlantica to the surface. \u00a0Nergill arrives and turned the tables by using a disruptor to cripple Optimus Prime, along with the other Autobots. Bumblebee and Spike rescue Wheeljack, who called the Dinobots for reinforcements. Grimlock snapped Nergill's disruptor in half, freeing Prime and the others. The Decepticons retreat to Nergill's base, followed by the Autobots. Realizing impending defeat, Nergill sabotages his own city, sinking it once again.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  None, though Spike's father begins to suspect his eldest son may have an adrenaline-related, death-wish streak as he volunteered to be quarterback in a game where the Dinobots were playing defense.\u00a0Day of the Machines  Megatron and Soundwave stage a secret raid of Quantum Laboratories to reprogram a supercomputer known as TORQ III (in a weird programming gesture, the scientists choose to give a face to the computer). Under Megatron's control, TORQ III locks the scientists inside the compound and various machines are reprogrammed. The computer is also able to control nearby oil tankers; and as a result, the tankers begin to converge on an oil platform. The Decepticons surround the platform with a protective shield.\u00a0 The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, come to investigate Quantum Laboratories. Skyfire, Hound, and Spike go to investigate the oil platform. The Autobots at Quantum Laboratories are overwhelmed by the machines, but the Dinobots arrive to even the score. Skyfire, Hound, and Spike sneak aboard an oil rig. They are almost successful, but Laserbeak captures Spike and Megatron threatens to have Laserbeak \"drop\" Spike. Hound and Skyfire comply and the three are captured.\u00a0 At Quantum Laboratories, Prime gets into a brawl with a machine, and apparently loses as the machine implants a control chip on him. He is led to TORQ III. As TORQ III does some Megatron-like boasting, Prime says the chip that was planted on him was a fake - and he settles things by planting his fist directly into TORQ III, disabling the computer and attacking machines.\u00a0 On the oil platform, Spike finds an electromagnet and uses it to \"pin\" Rumble and Ravage. Skyfire punches through the wall and the three run to rejoin the fight, which has moved to the oil platform that they're on. Optimus and Megatron get into a brawl, and Megatron accidentally destroys the device that was controlling the tankers. Enraged, he activates a destruct mechanism and the platform begins to sink. Prime orders all Autobots to evacuate, but stays behind to find Spike, Hound, and Skyfire. He ends up rescuing the three and Skyfire flies them to safety.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike continued to show the Autobots the advantage of having humans as allies (e.g. not being vulnerable to an electromagnetic device), but that was offset by him getting captured and forcing Hound and Skyfire to lay down their arms and be captured. Sparkplug no doubt probably gave Spike an earfull about repeatedly breaking his promise about not putting himself in danger. He also probably got chewed out for getting in a situation that would put their Autobot friends in danger. Likely punishment: grounded for one week.\u00a0A Prime Problem  A small earthquake produces a formation of highly-energized crystals in a crevasse. The Autobots go to investigate. Megatron, one step ahead of the Autobots, discovers the crystals destroy all things electronic on contact. His plan involves cloning Optimus Prime and having said clone lure the Autobots into the crevasse. In a scuffle with the Decepticons, Laserbeak blasts Prime over a cliff, briefly knocking the Autobot commander out (and earning Laserbeak some major bragging rights in the Decepticon ranks - being one of the few Decepticons who can say they knocked out Optimus Prime). While out, a scanner scans Optimus Prime and a clone is quickly generated. The clone orders the Autobots back to the Ark while Prime remained unconscious.\u00a0 Prime returns to the Ark, only to find the Optimus Prime clone in the Ark. EvilClonePrime orders the Autobots to let Prime in ... and mow him down. Before the Autobots fire, Ironhide orders the Autobots to hold their fire. After a scan from Teletraan One affirms BOTH are Optimus Prime, the Autobots run some tests, which both pass equally. During the tests, Spike begins to have a \"gut\" feeling about who the true Prime is.\u00a0 The Autobots return to the crevasse with the unstable energy crystals. Windcharger and Spike discover Laserbeak flying out of a secret entrance in a mountain and go to investigate. Windcharger is blasted into the crevasse and Spike is captured (surprise, surprise). Megatron has Starscream create his own clone and CloneStarscream and EvilClonePrime engage in battle. EvilClonePrime blows Starscream away, gaining the favor of the the Autobots. EvilClonePrime orders the Autobots into the crevasse, despite RealPrime's objections.\u00a0 Windcharger climbs out of the crevasse and warns the Autobots they're being led into a trap - saying the only reason he's still alive was because his rubber tires insulated him. He also tells them that Megatron has kidnapped Spike. EvilClonePrime tells the Autobots to ignore Spike and continue on. The Autobots then realize who the true Prime is and blast the EvilClonePrime into the crevasse. The Decepticons retreat, but not before tossing Spike out from their escaping rocket, but Powerglide ends up saving Spike at the last second.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike's gut reaction to who the real Prime is was confirmed. With just a few months under his belt with the Autobots, he demonstrated that he knew Prime better than most of the Autobots. This was either a validation of Spike's emerging diplomatic skills, or proved that Prime really plays his cards close to his chest plate.The Insecticon Syndrome  Hound,\u00a0Beachcomber\u00a0, Bumblebee, and Spike respond to a distress call from a park ranger. The issue: something or\u00a0someone\u00a0has been devouring the massive trees in the park. The Autobots quickly deduce that the Insecticons are behind it. Meanwhile, Megatron, apparently over the last run-in with the Insecticons, organizes a search party to get back in touch with their quasi-allies. The Decepticons stumble upon the Insecticons, just as they kick a massive tree toward the Autobots. It looks like the tree crushed the Autobots and send their destroyed servos over a waterfall. The Insecticons gloat and depart with the Decepticons, unknown that the fallen Autobots were actually part of Hound's hologram.\u00a0 Megatron gives an offer to the Insecticons: Help the Decepticons, and enjoy an energy buffet at the Nova Energy Power Plant. The Insecticons gleefully feast on the plant's power core, but the core's effect causes the Insecticons to grow as big and as powerful as Prime and Megatron. The Insecticons again betray the Decepticons and Bombshell plants a cerebro-shell on Soundwave.\u00a0 The Autobots race to the Nova Power Plant to save the trapped humans, only to get their afts handed to them by the Insecticons. Wheeljack and Teletraan One deduce that the mutation the Insecticons underwent will eventually cause all of them to explode, the explosion killing all trapped humans inside the plant. Wheeljack concocts an antitode.\u00a0 Things get out of hand at the power plant, and Prime and Megatron again realize they need to work together to stop the Insecticons. Prime uses Megatron to fire an antidote into Kickback and Bombshell. Spike climbs up and plants the last antidote into Shrapnel... who blows up anyway (although not with the mountain-destroying force he would have without the Spike's cure). Bombshell uses his power to reassemble Shrapnel and the Insecticons flee, with the Decepticons in angry pursuit.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike running up to Sharpnel mere seconds before he explodes earns him some serious hero points. But his horrible, pun-laced sense of humor (\"The Insecticons sure gave us a lot of trouble, didn't they, but they seemed to bug Megatron even more!\") probably gave his brother yet another reason to hate him during their teenage years. \u00a0Desertion of the Dinobots  Spike picks up his father, who is sporting a suit after doing the talk show circuit. The suit was never seen again. The Autobots on Earth, out of commission because of a lack of the life-sustaining element Cybertonium, were forced to rely on Spike and Carly to travel on Cybertron and retrieve the element. \u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike and Carly entered a very small elite circle of humans who can lay claim to visiting another planet.\u00a0Dinobot Island  After flying through some intense energy waves, Bumblebee and Powerglide stumble upon\u00a0Dinobot Island, a Galapagos-like island that apparently evolution forgot as dinosaurs are still inhabiting it (take that, creationists!). The two go back to the\u00a0Ark\u00a0and relay their findings to Optimus Prime. The discovery couldn't come soon enough as the Dinobots are repeatedly breaking stuff around the Ark - the worst offense being the almost-destruction of Teletraan One. Grimlock apologizes to Prime, and Prime suggests the Dinobots train on Dinobot Island.\u00a0 Spike goes with Powerglide to return to Dinobot Island. Almost automatically, he gets into trouble as he's snatched up by a flying dinoasur who puts Spike in a nest with giant eggs. After getting rescued by Swoop (and getting a lecture by Swoop), Spike continues to investigate the island, only to get into a perilous situation LESS THAN TWO MINUTES LATER when a brontosaurus-like dinosaur grabbs Spike's shirt and attempts to eat him. Spike finally comes to his senses and leaves Dinobot Island to the experts. Spike promised he'd write the Dinobots, except they couldn't read.\u00a0 As the Dinobots train, the Decepticons catch wind of this new island. What really intrigues them is the vast energy resourses like tar pits, geysers, and volcanoes. The Dinobots form a quasi-kinship with the local inhabitants, which Megatron takes advantage of as he causes a stampede of a bunch of dinosaurs. Unable to fire on the inhabitants, the Dinobots are pushed back into a tar pit where they are soon engulfed.\u00a0 Elsewhere around Earth, time portals begin to open. In one area, a mammoth appears, destroying a section of the library where Spike and Bumbleebee were just walking out of. Bumblebee shields Spike and are soon rescued by Huffer and Sideswipe. Prime orders the Autobots into reactive mode as they begin to chase disaster after disaster as portals continue to open. Pirates, cowboys, ancient sea captains are now all over Earth!\u00a0 Free of Autobot (and Dinobot) interference, the Decepticons continue to plunder Dinobot Island's resources. Starscream cautious Megatron that the energy they are taking out of Dinobot Island may have disasterous consequences. Megatron brushes off Starscream's fear.\u00a0 Back at the\u00a0Ark, Chip and Teletraan One discover the portals have something to do with Dinobot Island. Prime dispatches a team to Dinobot Island while the other Autobots slowly begin to push the inhabitants of certain eras of time back to their respective portals.\u00a0 At Dinobot Island, the Dinobots are able to finally break free of their tarry tomb. A vengence-seeking Grimlock rallies the local inhabitants to attack the Decepticons. The Autobots destroy all the energon cubes the Decepticons gathered. The released energy closes the portals. Prime says the Dinobots have done so well that they are allowed to return to the\u00a0Ark.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Remember when Spike promised his dad he wouldn't get into danger after the Autobot Spike incident? Yeah, this wasn't one of Spike's finest hours. He broke that promise almost three times in a 36-hour span. Fortunately for Spike, Sparkplug believed he and Spike had gone past the point of no return for the Autobots - and as a result, they were allowed to stay. For more risk-focused Autobots like Red Alert, Spike didn't win too many friends during this incident.The Master Builders  Hoist and\u00a0Grapple\u00a0(the intellectual Laurel and Hardy of the Autobots) develop a prototype solar tower. They showcase it to Optimus Prime, who at the time was trying to learn basketball from Spike. Prime's basketball skills were still in development, but he could ably balance a spinning ball on his finger and perform a wicked pass that could take down an unexpecting human.\u00a0 Prime approves of the solar tower, but nixes the idea of building it until Grapple and Hoist can come up with a decent security plan to protect the tower (editor's note: Prime needs to start delegating responsibility. Let the geniuses build the energy devices, and let his security aces Red Alert and Prowl handle the security end). A dejected Grapple leaves and mourns the loss of his green energy magnum opus. A few Constructicons eavesdrop on Hoist and Grapple's conversation and attack the two Autobots, only to dig them out and tell them that they have defected from the Decepticons and want to help create Grapple's tower.\u00a0 Later, an enraged Megatron confronts the Constructicons, but the Constructions swear loyalty to Megatron and say they only did it to dupe the two Autobots into building the tower...for the Decepticons. Megatron gives the green light and building commenses.\u00a0 Days pass. Hoist ends up skipping his duties in the repair bay, which Prime notices when he knocks a few Autobots out of his way when he performs a Shaq-like slam dunk during a game of basketball. Prime sends Powerglide out to search for Grapple and Hoist, only to find out that the two are working with the Decepticons. Prime is pissed and orders the Autobots to intercept.\u00a0 The Autobots arrive at the tower, just in time for the Constructicons to betray Hoist and Grapple and blast them. The Constructicons form Devastator and attack the Autobots. Prime uses his great motivational skills by talking Smokescreen into staying still IN FRONT OF DEVASTATOR. Devastator attempts to kick Smokescreen, but he \"burns rubber\", causing Devastator to kick the solar tower and fall into it. The Autobots dig out Grapple and Hoist. Prime forgives both of them, but leaves the cleanup of the tower to the both of them.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  As a kid, this was one of Spike's favorite stories to relay. Not only did he teach his idol how to play basketball, he spent the majority of the mission riding shotgun in Optimus Prime's cab. Unfortunately for his brother, this story had three elements that he could care less about: basketball, Optimus Prime, and a full-scale robot battle. What's worse, Spike was so excited in telling the story to Buster during a game of pick-up basketball that he accidentally gave his brother a concussion when he charged his brother during a layup. \u00a0Megatron's Master Plan  The Decepticons stage a very unsuccessful raid at a solar energy plant at\u00a0Central City. It seems like another strike-out for the Decepticons. An elated, affable (but slightly clueless) mayor of Central City decides to honor the Auobots in a parade for their heroic feats of strength against the Decepticons. Meanwhile, industrial tychoon Shawn Berger stews in anger that the mayor will no doubt pick up some easy political points. But before Berger can stew in his angst, he is abducted by Laserbeak and taken to Megatron. Megatron tells Berger everything he knows about the Decepticons is wrong, and he intends to prove this by taking Berger to an oil field where the Autobots are currently raiding it for energy. Berger complies, but arrogantly bargains for control over Central City if he uses his influence to expose the Autobots.\u00a0 Berger flies in a news chopper and indeed discovers the Autobots raiding the oil field - and gloating about it. Wheeljack fires at the news chopper and dislodges a news camera containing the incriminating evidence. Megatron retrieves the tape and gives it to Berger.\u00a0 The next day, the Autobots are honored at the parade. The major mistakenly begins to give another speech before correcting it and honoring the Autobots. Berger enters a control room and orders the PA person to play his evidence. In front of the parade attendees, the tape of the Autobot raid plays. The crowd immediately turns hostile to the Autobots. Caught in the crossfire, Chip, Sparkplug, and Spike run to Bumblebee and are pelted by an angry mob. The Autobots return to the Ark and a few Autobots begin to express their disdain for humans and how ungrateful they are and how easily they are led. Bumblebee, however, continues to stick up for a few of his human friends. The mayor of Central City, along with Berger's army arrive at the\u00a0Ark\u00a0and arrest the Autobots and order a trial, which is to take place... on a football field in front of anyone who wants to attend.\u00a0 At the trail, the Autobots are found guilty and are sentenced to banishment from Earth. Spike is in the crowd and sneaks away in hopes of clearing the Autobots name. The Autobots are forced to board a shuttle and are banished from Earth and the shuttle takes off. Megatron and Berger go to the now-abandoned Ark and reprogram Teletraan One to send the shuttle carrying the Autobots to a destruction course for the sun.\u00a0 In the control room in the stadium, Spike discovers the truth on tape: the Autobots in the oil field were actually Decepticons in disguise (shocker). Ravage discovers Spike and the two tangle. Spike manages to shove an entire media shelf onto Ravage, briefly pinning the Decepticon, and he flees to show the tape to the mayor. During this time, the Decepticons manage to enjoy the adoration of fans as they're invited to parties and kids soon are drawing pictures of their favorite Decepticons.\u00a0 In the shuttle, Ironhide convinces Optimus to defy the order and return to Earth and clear their name. Prime reluctantly agrees and orders\u00a0Cosmos\u00a0to take them back to Earth. However, they soon discover that they are headed to the Sun and their systems begin to overheat. The shuttle falls into the sun and explodes.\u00a0 Back on Earth, Megatron appears at a press conference and announces his plan: worldwide slavery. The Decepticons take over Central City and parts of the United States and the Decepticons begin to treat Earth like their playground, smashing buildings and enslaving the population. After showing the evidence to the mayor and convincing him that the Autobots are innocent, Spike still vows to clear the Autobots name, but Berger tells him that the Autobots were destroyed when their craft flew into the sun. A devastated Spike flees, still hoping to clear the Autobots' name. Soundwave dispatches Ravage to intercept, but Berger manages to save Spike from getting devoured by smacking Ravage with a production light. Spike, Chip, Sparkplug, Berger are shackled and are ordered to work in an energy plant.\u00a0 In space, Trailbreaker managed to protect ALL the Autobots by emitting a force field that protected them from the lethal blast from the sun. All of them latch onto Cosmos and Prime orders them back to Earth, but Cosmos says he's still under Teletraan One's control and he (and the Autobots) soon drift back to the sun. \u00a0 Back on Earth, Spike stages a diversion to get Chip to escape and go to the\u00a0Ark\u00a0and access Teletraan One. Chip hitchhikes to the Ark and learns about the Autobots' fate.\u00a0Thrust\u00a0spots Chip in the Ark and fires his laser into Teletraan One, damaging the computer, but as a result, breaking its contol over Cosmos. In space, Cosmos rejoyces and Prime orders the Autobots back to Earth.\u00a0 On Earth, Chip is returned to the power plant. Spike comforts Chip, saying Teletraan wasn't much use without the Autobots. As they continue to work, Chip and Spike hear the unmistakable sound of Autobot engines. The Autobots return and liberate the humans and force the Decepticons to retreat. Berger admits his error and says he'll give up his army. Sparkplug sarcastically points out Berger already was without an army since his workers quit in protest (or in Sparkplug's words: quit when they found out what a dog lunch he was). Optimus says Berger will face justice - and the Autobots leave vindicated and exonorated as Berger is hauled away.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  The Witwicky's steadfast loyalty to the Autobots continues to pay off for Spike, Chip, and Sparkplug as the Autobots made no moves to bring any other human into their inner circle after seeing how the humans reacted to the weak evidence against the Autobots. And while he never got a chance to show the tape that exonorated the Autobots to a mass audience, the fact that he was able to find the evidence and find the right circles of power quickly (e.g. the mayor) made Prime believe that Spike's role with the Autobots may extend beyond just the repair bay.\u00a0Desertion of the Dinobots  Spike, Carly, and Bumblebee go to the airport to pick up Sparkplug, who was doing the talk show and interview circuit about his experience with the Autobots (and kicking much of the funds back to Buster, Judy, and Ron for his younger son's pre-college plans). Spike and Carly briefly didn't recognize Sparkplug since he was wearing a suit. At the airport, Bumblebee and Spike see military jets land inside a hanger. Turns out it those jets were Decepticons, and Bumblebee radios Prime for help. As a last resort (due to short staff), he deploys the Dinobots who easily overpower the Decepticons. However, when the Dinobots transformed, Megatron orders the Decepticons to fire on the nearby aircraft. The ensuing explosion knocks all the Dinobots out of commission. Red Alert and Inferno arrive to do damage control to the heavily-damaged airport.\u00a0 The next day, Optimus oversees the efforts in getting the airport rebuilt. He receives a distress call that the Decepticons were attacking an energy plant. He radios the Dinobots who outright revolt and leave. The Autobots who are able to intercept begin to have difficulties with their systems. The Decepticons have the same symptoms, unable to transform, fire upon their enemies, etc. Both factions end up retreating. Back at the\u00a0Ark, Perceptor concludes that their problem is everyone is suffering from Cybertonium depletion - a crucial element that Cybertron-based Transformers need to function correctly (think of it as the human equivalent of fiber). Carly theorizes that the Dinobots should be functioning OK since they were built on Earth and didn't require Cybertonium. Sparkplug, Spike, and Carly go to the Dinobots. A pissed Grimlock almost crushes the humans until Spike mentions Cybertonium. The Cybertron connection sparks Grimlock's curiosity - and he agrees to help.\u00a0 Grimlock and the Dinobots go to the space bridge to intercept a shipment of Cybertonium that was originally intended for the Decepticons. However, in the confusion of battle, the Dinobots get caught in the space bridge and are transported to Cybertron. On Cybertron, Grimlock says he's sick of working with \"bossy Autobots\" and vows to stay. Realizing that the only option left is for Spike and Carly to go, Sparkplug wires a communication device to Spike's thumb and reluctantly sends his son and Carly to Cybertron against Prime's wishes.\u00a0 Carly manages to drive her car past Devastator into the space bridge. Shockwave almost kills both of them, but Carly and Spike manage to sneak into the inner portion of a super computer. Carly manages to sabotage the super computer (getting a nasty ankle injury in the process), putting the space bridge offline and buying the Autobots some crucial hours. Spike and Carly reach Wheeljack's lab and are soon met by Swoop, who managed to escape after the Dinobots were captured.\u00a0 After learning a bit about the\u00a0Cybertronian War, the humans and Swoop flee from the Decepticons, but are captured and sent to the Cybertonium pits, where the captured Dinobots are mining the ore for the next shipment to Megatron. Carly manages to rewire the Dinobots personality circuits to their correct/non-taking-orders-from-anyone setting, and Spike comes up with a plan to get them all out. Spike and Grimlock get into an argument and when a sentinental comes in to break up the fight, the Dinobots overpower the drones and take Spike and Carly with them to the space bridge. Sparkplug and Teletraan manage to redirect the space bridge's coordinates to be right outside the Ark, and the Dinbots manage to escape into the space bridge and deliver the Cybertronium to the\u00a0Ark.\u00a0 Once repaired, Prime gives Spike and Carly the honored designation of \"Honorary Autobot\" (what, no love for Sparkplug?). Grimlock says he has a change of heart and has pledged that he will follow Prime's orders...until he doesn't feel like it.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Aside from the birth of his son and daughter, and his wedding day, this mission stands as the highlight of Spike's life in his opinion. He was awarded the title of honorary Autobot for this mission. In addition, the time Carly and he spent on Cybertron managed to\u00a0catapult him from cute but naively geeky foil to genuine boyfriend material for Carly, much to Spike's delight. Sure, they broke up more than a year later, but this mission served to somehow forever bond the two together. On a separate note, Buster absolutely hated hearing about how this mission played out throughout all of his adolescent years.\u00a0Blaster Blues  Spike, Carly, and Blaster attend a concert where Spike gives Seinfeld's Elaine Benes a run for her money for the title of \"Worst Dancer Ever\". While monitoring\u00a0Omega Supreme's weapon systems, Blaster broadcasts the concert, hoping to inject some culture into the Autobot ranks. Optimus Prime is not amused. In fact, Blaster's playing almost interferes with a distress call from a group of scientists who say their newest invention, a\u00a0voltronic galaxer, was stolen by the Decepticons. Prime orders all available Autobots to comb the Earth in search of the galaxer.\u00a0 Blaster and Cosmos locate the device, along with the Decepticons, on the moon. However, the two are captured and Megatron uses Blaster to amplify the galaxer to override all Earth airwave signals; and Cosmos to power the device. Megatron broadcasts his demands to Earth: let him plunder Earth of its resources, and he'll give the humans their airwaves back (but wait, doesn't it take energy to power these waves? nevermind - just go with it).\u00a0 In the absense of air traffic, Prime desperately tries to navigate some landing planes at an airport. Caught off guard, he is badly damaged by two seekers. While riding in Powerglide, Carly determines that the Decepticons are broadcasting from the moon (with the help from Blaster's signature song that he's secretly broadcasting). The small Powerglide manages to lift Prime's body back to Omega Supreme and Carly manages to put in some backup gear in Prime's damaged body. Omega Supreme lifts Prime's damaged body into his rocket and he goes to the moon along with Spike and Carly. Carly confides to Spike that she's never been to the moon before. Spike, perhaps thinking of something else (despite being in mortal danger) coyly says \"There's a first time for everything, Carly.\"\u00a0 On the Moon, Omega Supreme engages in a fight with\u00a0Astrotrain. Megatron discovers Prime's unconscious form and prepares to finish him off, but Prime awakens at the last moment and successfully wards off Megatron. Cosmos and Blaster take advantage of the distraction and blasts the Decepticon modifications, restoring airwaves to Earth. Prime praises Cosmos and Blaster, but Prime cautions Blaster that with his great power comes great responsibility.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Within the span of 2 weeks, Spike and Carly become the first people on Earth to set foot on another planet as well as the moon.\u00a0A Decepticon Raider In King Arthur's Court  During a spot of gosh and bother with some frightfully rambunctious\u00a0ruffians, Hoist Warpath, and Spike\u00a0were transported backwards in time to medieval England. The trio encountered\u00a0Nimue\u00a0and her father,\u00a0Sir Aetheling the Red, who were holding a jousting match. Spike, despite quasi-dating Carly, took an almost immediate liking to Nimue, so much so that he volunteered himself to be a part of a jousting match. Hoist whipped up a suit of armor for\u00a0Spike Witwicky, and he lost handily. The Decepticons abducted Nimue during the tournament, and the Autobots were too low on energy to catch up. Spike, perhaps reading too many heroic tales in his early years, scales a tower to rescue Nimue, only to find that she had made amends with a prince their rival village Blackthrone. Sir Aetheling led an assault on\u00a0Sir Wigend du Blackthorne's castle, and Hoist acted variously as a bridge across the castle moat and a siege ladder, until both he and Warpath were exhausted of energy and unable to fight on. The wizard\u00a0Beorht\u00a0gave them a boost of energy, and the two Autobots breached the castle wall, pretty much ending the feud. With more help from the wizard, they were able to return to the nineteen-eighties. Warpath comforts Spike, saying he can't win them all, forcing Spike to \"return\" to his hot, intelligent girlfriend in the '80s.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike travels back in time - and depending on what universe he's in - he becomes the first human to do so. In addition, he learns jousting, which to him was about as worthwhile as his college sophomore Lit class \"Religious Mysticism and the works of Franz Kafka.\"\u00a0 For some reason, the above events were \"the last straw\" for Spike's father in relation to his son's involvement with the Autobots. Fearing his son was spending far too much time with the Autobots, and not enough time in class and with kids his age, Sparkplug insisted his son scale back his involvement with the Autobots and focus more on school and making his friends his age. (editor's note - this is a likely explanation of Spike's relatively limited involvement in the remaining Season 2 episodes).\u00a0Make Tracks  As the Autobots expanded their operations, they installed a small urban base in New York City, concealed behind an auto-repair garage operated by Sparkplug. In the aftermath of the failed Decepticon plan to use stolen cars as robot drones, Sparkplug bemoaned the fact it would take weeks for himself,\u00a0Hoist, Ratchet and Wheeljack to return the cars to normal functionality.Long-Term Impacts  None. Spike had to hear all about this second-handedly from Sparkplug after his dad laid down some strict new Ark house rules that focused on hitting the books and hanging out with kids his own age (much to Spike's dismay).Quest For Survival  After weeks of being out of the game, thanks to Sparkplug ordering his son to focus more time on school and less time with the Autobots, Spike and Bumblebee go with Cosmos to retrieve a shipment of robotic insecticide, which they hope will destroy a growing Insecticon clone army bent on devouring all of Earth's crops, triggering a worldwide starvation crisis. On their way back to Earth, some mutant spores on Cosmos soon morph into a robotic plant that is later identified as a morphobot. While the robotic plant causes the Autobots and Decepticons plenty of trouble, they eventually devour the entire Insecticon drone army after Megatron destroyed the canister of robotic insecticide they retrieved.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Spike and his family are still able to eat after the Insecticon army is vanquished, which is good.\u00a0Triple Takeover  Optimus Prime saves Spike's bacon after he was swept up in a violent wave after a water main broke during a Decepticon coup.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  None, aside from further evidence of Spike's vulnerability during encounters between Transformers.The Girl Who Loved Powerglide  Optimus Prime orders Powerglide to watch over a wealthy debutante/CEO named Astoria. While fleeing the Decepticons, the two hide out in Sparkplug's garage. Astoria ambles around the garage. Spike makes a very weak attempt to hit on Astoria and gets soundly rejected. Dejected, he goes back to work and manages to muck up some of his dad's jobs. Astoria reveals her infatuation with Powerglide, who she later saves.\u00a0Long Term Impacts  None, other than showing Spike has a nasty jealousy streak (e.g. Astoria: \"He's (Powerglide) tall, and handsome and he can fly!\" Spike: \"Yeah, well there's a few things he can't do, you know.\"), and can get shut down pretty hard when he tries to flirt (e.g. Spike: \"Too bad I wasn't there. I'm always ready to rescue a girl as pretty as you.\" Astoria: \"Mmm. What do you know about Powerglide?\". He should really stick with Carly.Hoist Goes Hollywood  While driving with Hoist , Spike and Carly stumble upon a movie shoot. The director decides to recruit Hoist and a few other Autobots into the movie. However, the director soon just makes Hoist fetch him bagels. Around the same time, Megatron seems obsessed with a a mysterious cargo. The Decepticons were caught on camera retrieving said cargo, and do everything in their power to prevent the footage from reaching the Autobots. Using a bit of Hollywood trickery, Hoist hoists (get it?) Spike and Carly up on a chain with the film footage. He orders Megatron and the Decepticons to leave, otherwise he'll drop Spike, Carly, and the film into a vat of lava. Megatron calls Hoist's bluff, and Hoist drops Carly, Spike and the footage into the lava, appearing to destroy the evidence (and two humans as well). Megatron and the Decepticons leave, but it turned out that the lava was just a studio trick and neither the footage nor the humans was harmed.\u00a0 Back at Autobot headquarters, Wheeljack immediately identified the cargo as something that he was tooling with ages ago. He owned up to the fact that the cargo was essentially useless.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  Though Spike didn't necessairly do anything wrong during these events, this incident still fills him with shame - so much so that he barely brings up the event. It may be due to the fact the director made the Autobots don horrible rubber masks that even Ed Wood would have rejected.\u00a0The Revenge of Bruticus  Spike gets a science lesson from Perceptor and later almost gets cooked alive when the Constructicons attempt to pull the Earth into the sun.\u00a0Long-Term Impacts  NonePost-Canon  In the late 1980s, Spike continued to live a life that most any high school geek would disavow their parents for. But while in high school, Spike began to grow tired of repeatedly hearing that he was just \"the Autobot's pet.\" In addition, his high-school life strongly contrasted with Carly's demanding workload at MIT. In 1988, things came to a head and Carly ended their relationship, much to Spike's dismay (and Buster's delight). \u00a0 When Spike graduated high-school, he attended college, one of the first Witwickys to do so. To concentrate on school and family, he amicably parted ways with the Autobots. Around this time, he bumped into Carly at an otherwise horrible typical college party kegger. Spike's newfound maturity appealed to Carly, and Carly's more relaxed persona (now used to demanding finals, exams, lab assignments) appealed to Spike. The two quickly rekindled their relationship. In 1991, much to his father's delight (and his in-law's horror), Spike impulsively asked Carly to marry him. Much to his surprise, she accepted.\u00a0 Though Spike had a bright, exploring mind, after years of adventure and hands-on field work, he found it hard to prosper in a purely academic setting. He eventually dropped out, getting a job at Blackrock Construction on the promise of making far more money than he ever could being a newspaper reporter. It was during this time that Carly began to doubt her choice to marry the young Witwicky. Their martial woes deepened when in 1992, Carly discovered she was pregnant...about 5 years before she even considered that move in her life. Urged (strongly) by his father as well as Chip and Bumblebee, Spike eventually was able to mend his marriage - though with the knowledge that he didn't plan on returning to college. Spike's work ethic and mechanical know-how resulted in him quickly rising in ranks at Blackrock Industries. In 1993, he was promoted to foreman, one of the youngest ever to achieve that title at Blackrock Industries. Under his supervision, he helped turn the troubled construction of the 84-story Blackrock Towers into a project that was almost eight weeks ahead of schedule. In 1993, Spike was jumped by Frenzy. The debilitating attack put Spike in a coma for two months and resulted in countless months of rehabilitation. The 84-story Blackrock Tower was destroyed in the attack. Months after the catastrophic attack, Spike's father and his newlywed wife had to care for Spike almost on a 24-hour basis as he relied on both to do everything from feeding him to teaching him to walk again. During this time, Carly convinced Spike to rejoin the Autobots to protect not only himself, but their son. During his hospitalization and nearly one-year stay at a rehabilitation facility, Buster did not visit his brother once. In 1996, Spike accepted an offer from The Oregonian to join their staff as a part-time staff writer. Spike agreed to write a monthly op-ed about Transformer-related issues and their impact on Earth, but only on the condition that he could write an occasional news story that was not related to the Transformers. The move angered many in the journalism community because the newspaper's policy up to that point, was to only hire reporters with at least four years of full-time experience. However, the gamble paid off. In late summer 1996, Spike was amoung hundreds of humans captured by the Decepticons. While the majority of the humans were meant to be used as human shields and energon harvesters (courtesy of Dr. Arkeville 's hypno-chip improved modifications), Spike remained held in Dr. Arkeville's care. The doctor was told by his Decepticon captors to try to extract information about the Autobots from Spike's memories. The device was able to extract memories from Spike's experiences with the Autobots, including Optimus Prime's weaknesses, and the codes to Metroplex's shields.\u00a0 While most of those memories proved to be faulty for the Decepticons, Dr. Arkeville still was able to capitalize on Spike's misery. As a cruel leisure activity, Dr. Arkeville began to implant memories into Spike's brain. These memories include Optimus Prime's death at the hands of Megatron, the remaining Autobots being defeated and killed by the Decepticons, and the entire planet falling into Decepticon control.\u00a0 When he was rescued, Spike was in such a distraught state, that Carly and Sparkplug allowed First Aid to do a limited 'mind-wipe' from Spike's memories. As a result, almost all of Spike's memories of his capture were deleted from his memory. To this date, he doesn't recall any of his time with Dr. Arkeville.\u00a0 In 1997, Spike won a state Associated Press award with his three-part story about a family of Rwandan refugees who were living in Portland. As a side note, Buster submitted a well-received article he wrote for the school paper for the same award, but his article did not make it into the finalist circle. This again furthered the resentment between the two.MUX History:  After an unsuccessful stint at college and a few directionless months back in the construction world during the economic boom of the mid-90s, Spike rejoined the Autobots. Uncomfortable appearing in the limelight, he winds up spending most of his time in the repair bay, working hard to be the first human to attain the status of Autobot Medic. He occasionally works on call. However, Prime, sensing potential in Spike, has occasionally nudged him to more high-profile gigs, such as an occasional stint as a moderator between the Autobots and G.I. Joe. His relationship with G.I. Joe is guarded. However, thanks to a chance encounter at a comic book store (he was picking up a Spiderman comic for his son, Daniel, who was ill), he encountered Seymour Fine (Sci-Fi). The two formed a fast friendship and now the Witwicky household considers Mr. Fine part of the family. As for real family, Spike has an intense devotion to both his wife and his son. Aided by some excellent parenting from his father, Sparkplug, he has tried to provide for his family what he lacked when he was a kid (mainly stability). Aside from spending time with the Autobots and his family, he routinely checks in on his father, who was currently in a nursing home. Watching the slow decline of his father carries a weight on him that he seldom shows to others. He also had a contentious relationship with his brother, Buster Witwicky. Buster, no fan of the Autobots himself, and Spike had gone months without speaking to one another. Sometimes out of petty spite, and sometimes out of real-life interferences. Spike was laid off his job at Blackrock Construction when G.B. Blackrock sold the company in early 2009. Unexpected, he was contacted by Destro, who doubled his salary and offered him a sizable bonus to go to work for MARS. Spike accepted the offer, and later helped Destro and the Autobots evacuate people from the Sears Tower after it was damaged by Megatron and Starscream. In October 2009, Starscream destroyed Spike's house in retaliation for an interview he granted to CNN. In the interview, Spike said stated that humans could mount an effective counterattack against the Decepticons. Now homeless, he is trying to figure out whether or not to move his family into Autobot City. He also began to have disturbing dreams about an alternate version of himself and his brother, no doubt brought on by the recent stress. In early 2010, things seem to be looking up for Spike. After repeated prods from Cuffs, Spike agreed to accept a financial stipend from the Autobots and would now be able to work full-time in the Autobot medical facility and assume some minor diplomatic duties. In addition, Spike eagerly awaited the return of the The Ark as he hoped to move his family in the storied craft, enabling his son to hopefully share in some of the memories Spike had growing up in that craft. On May 2, 2011, Spike became a father again with the birth of his daughter, Megan Susan Witwicky . Late August, Spike was faced with his most daunting diplomatic challenge yet as a worldwide disaster forced the Autobots to make difficult decisions as to what affected regions should receive the brunt of Autobot aid as well as the possibility of forging another alliance with Cobra. While Spike strongly urged Optimus Prime to seek out a more seasoned diplomat for this crisis, Prime remained steadfast that Spike would be the contact person in terms of providing a human voice for the Autobots. To improve his diplomatic skills, Spike began leaning heavily on Crosscut for counsel. Crosscut's level-headedness, combined with Spike's inexperience, occasional bouts of self-righteousness, and his occasional blind devotion to Prime initially yielded a contentious relationship between the two diplomats. Crosscut further irritated Spike when he strongly suggested he consult with his brother about effective practices when it comes to dealing with the military. In 2012, Crosscut and Spike traveled to Trucial Abysmia for the sixteenth birthday of Sheikh Mohammed. Although Sheikh Mohammed was bitterly disappointed that Optimus Prime himself could not attend, Spike managed to negotiate, with slight help from Crosscut, a 10 percent increase in oil donation to world recovery efforts, 2 percent of which was to be delivered immediately. Crosscut later assigned Marissa Faireborn to assist Spike in forming the EDC, and left Spike in charge of Autobot public relations while Crosscut travelled to Cybertron. On November 6, Spike lost a friendly bet to Crosscut regarding the presidential election in the United States. Spike thought the president would win in a squeaker. Crosscut thought he'd get more than 300 electoral votes. Spike lost. As a result, Spike is now tasked with training his brother on all EDC-related systems.  Before leaving for Cybertron, Blaster built a helperbot to assist Buster and Spike in taking care of Sparkplug in Autobot City. In 2013, Alpha Trion sent Dust Devil to Earth, to receive the better that could be provided by the advanced medical facilities at Autobot City. Once Dust Devil was stabilized, he was flown back to Cybertron, to be rebuilt by Alpha Trion with the help of Spike and the Junkions. In March of 2013, Spike met with noted human rights activist Jumal\u00a0Reza Pahlavi. Jumal appealed for the Autobots to help release imprisoned activist Anwar Assan. After some severe reservations about the Autobots getting involved in human affairs, Spike, suffering from a severe crisis of conscience, appealed to Crosscut for the Autobots to help. Oddly enough, Crosscut agreed. Spike is now working with EDC members to stage a covert rescue of Anwar Assan; a rescue that will hopefully cannot be traced back to the Autobots.\u00a0  04Jul2013 - After being rigged with a tracker and repaired just enough to remain functional by Spike Witwicky,\u00a0Jetfire, and\u00a0Throttle, Nightlash was found by\u00a0Decepticon\u00a0forces in a comatose state. Assisted by\u00a0Rainmaker, the sweeps\u00a0Scourge\u00a0and\u00a0Plunder\u00a0managed to get her stabilized and back safely to\u00a0Trypticon. During the flight back, a tracking device belonging to the\u00a0Autobots\u00a0was found on Nightlash and destroyed. On April 7, 2014, Spike attended the handfasting of his brother Buster Witwicky to Jesse Macchio. In October of 2014, Spike helped lead a small team of Autobots and G.I. Joes, who infiltrated Decepticon City to capture Dr. Arkeville and rescue Typhoon. In March, 2015, Spike passed his medical boards exam on Cybertron. He becomes the first human to achieve the \"official\" status of medic, joining such esteemed Autobot medics as First Aid and Grapple. In September, Crosscut, Road Rage, and Spike travelled to Helex to negotiate with the ruling Triumverate. In 2016, Spike conferred with Crosscut about whether or not to give Arkeville over to G.I. Joe for detention. However, since Dr. Arkeville had not violated any clause of his agreement with the Autobots to help take back Autobot City, any move to surrender Dr. Arkeville to the Joes would make it appear that the Autobots went back on their word. Spike thought that would do irreparable harm to the Autobots in the eyes of the world, even for someone like Dr. Arkeville. Crosscut supported Spike's decision. Having concluded that (and much to Arkeville's luck), the Autobots decided to keep him. However, soon after Arkeville physically attacked Spike, breaking his agreement and making it easy for the Autobots to decide to turn him over to the Joes for good. Later that month, a dip in Sparkplug's health brought him very close to death. When Sparkplug recovered, he took what might be his last trip to Cybertron, to visit the building named in his honor. Spike went with him, bringing Ron and Judy as well. In 2017 Spike traveled to Cybertron to explore the Plasma Energy Chamber, contributing to the revitalization of Cybertron. Later that year he gave an interview to Melinda Lossman that may or may not have led to a major attack on Autobot City.OOC Notes Age  Spike was born in 1970. He was 14 in 1984 when the Transformers woke from their 4 million year slumber.  He was 35 in 2005.  He turned 40 in 2010, although the effects of the Timewarp TP has regressed his age closer to the early 30s.Wardrobe  Spike has a habit of continually wearing heavy equipment-style yellow boots (despite much teasing from others).\u00a0Mindswap TP  Spike has some residual effects from the Transformer mind swap TP. Spike's mind-swap didn't go so well with Motormaster - Spike spent a few weeks in the GI Joe medbay re-learning motor skills and he still goes to a speech therapist. The effects are the equivalent of a mini-stroke, but G.I. Joe doctors promised Spike a (probable) full recovery. However, in 2013 Spike still has a lingering effect here and there (as Blaster can attest to with Spike's rapidly dated record collection) - as well as occasional nightmares.Favorite Books of All Time Favorite Albums of All Time Notable Injuries and Imprisonments\u00a0  How many times has Spike been injured or imprisoned by the Decepticons during his life with the Autobots? Oh, let us count the ways (this doesn't count light injuries like being backhanded by Rumble):Published Works  Spike got a regional press award, when he tried to work at a newspaper (when he took time away from the 'bots) - now, I would say he's done a few 'contributing' pieces here and there - I'm thinking Esquire or The Washington Post would love to have a contributing article or two from a person who can write, and who is right in with Autobot City.Journal Logs /Posts 1975 1978 1979 1980 1981 1984 1985 1986 1992 1993 1996 2000 2007 2008 2009 Oct 09 - Exclusive Interview  CNN - *Spike's face appears near Autobot City, Anderson Cooper is talking to him via live feed* As the world continues to heal from the catastrophic weather events of the past few weeks, we at CNN have learned of a potential major shakeup in the Decepticon ranks. *dramatic video show An unconscious Starscream being brought, some may say paraded, into Autobot City by a phalanx of humans*.

I'm sure all of us would have rather seen EDC get a 'test raid' to iron out any kinks before our first full-blooded mission as EDC, but as for the 'bots, I'm sure the Joes are similar in that original plans to dissolve real fast in the case of crisis. Anyway - I just wanted to wish everyone good luck in the first of what will hopefully be many missions together. I'll leave the specifics to the 'higher-ups', but I'll just say that if all goes well, no one outside our organizations will hear of what REALLY transpired after Anwar Assan is freed from what now appears to be Cobra-friendly Trucial Abysmia. In addition to Assan's safe liberation and no one outside our organizations hearing of this raid, it won't be a success unless all of us come home safe and soundly.

I think a few months ago, both the Joes and the Autobots ... and myself - were thinking \"Let's do months of tests\" with this EDC alliance, then do a few light missions. But circumstances threw us together, and honestly, I don't think we could have done a better job. From Mainframe's ability to learn how to repair Springer on the spot, to Lifeline's life-saving first-Aid on Anwar Assan, to Wild Bill's heroics, to Jinx's crack shot, to Snapdragon's ability to effectively translate languages, to Springer's leadership to Throttle's improvising, and anyone else I forgot - it was an amazing synchronicity. Yes, we will have weeks to pour over what we will improve on, but right now - it's indisputable - we saved a human rights figure.

On a much lighter note, the Joes are continuing their move out of Autobot City, and into their rebuild headquarters, the PIT. I can't thank you guys enough for your generosity and patience this year.

Anyway, we managed to make contact with both Zarak, who apparently is the Hive ruler, and Gort, who is a resistance leader. The other Nebulon we spoke with, aside from Spoilsport, is Poise, who was extremely skeptical of our motives, and of our desire to form a diplomatic tie with the people of Nebulos. She is afraid that once we established contact, the Decepticons can't be far from us. However, Gort seemed to be receptive toward forging an alliance. For now though, I believe the best course of action is to gather all the data we've acquired over the past few days, and plan a strategy, even if it just means we continue to monitor the Nebulons. Regardless, I believe the best course of action is to ensure Poise's fears are not realized.

I know there's a pressing matter on Cybertron involving the Fallen. Unfortunately, we have another crisis on hand. Autobot intelligence has detected transmissions between Cybertron and 'The Hive' - a group of beings that supposedly 'control' the planet Nebulos. I've spoken with Zarak, who appears to be the 'grand leader' of all Nebulos. He's confirmed he's been speaking with the Decepticons. If the Nebulans form an alliance with the Decepticons, it will be a huge setback for the Autobots. From what we've gathered, Nebulos is rich in energy. In addition, they have a population that is highly advanced. Far more advanced than the humans on Earth. What's more - it appears that the Nebulans have the ability of telekinesis. What's not confirmed, but I have my suspicions, is that they also may be telepathic. Again, this is just a theory. We don't know much about this planet. And if they are telepathic, I don't know if it's just between themselves, or if they can read human minds, Autobot minds, or both. All I know is that whenever I meet with Zarak, I feel like he can see right through me, so it's useless to deceive him. He knows we've been in contact with Gort - a Nebulan who is leading the resistance against The Hive. *Spike pauses, seeming to choose the next few sentences very carefully* Zarak seems to know what he's getting into with the Decepticons. Regardless, I've showed him one of the planets the Decepticons bled dry of their resources. I showed him how easily the Decepticons tricked the people of Earth to believe the Autobots were evil about 30 years ago, and as a result, the Autobots were exiled from Earth. He saw how soon they enslaved us. But Zarak freely admits he's a tyrant, and he knows how to handle a tyrant like Megatron. *Spike pinches the bridge of his nose* I have suspicions that Zarak has enslaved the population of Nebulos - and because of this, we would NOT want an alliance with him. That said, I'm also afraid of forging an alliance with Gort, because if we align ourselves with the resistance, it will only push Zarak to the Decepticons. This decision needs to be made by upper Autobot leadership, but in my opinion, I think the best option is just to play 'defense.' In other words, if we can convince Zarak to NOT partner with the Decepticons, that would be a 'win.' Of course, the Autobots could likely overthrow The Hive, and establish a new government in Nebulos, but we've seen how disastrous getting into the affairs of others can sometimes be, regardless of the intentions. As sad as it is, Gort and his people will have to be the ones to gain their freedom. But in the meantime, Zarak has said that he's had not trouble getting the Decepticons ear, and he has heard nothing from the Autobots. Therefore, and again, I know everyone is justly occupied with The Fallen, but we NEED some Autobots to engage with Zarak, ASAP. I think I convinced him with the evidence of how the Decepticons plunder other planets - to hold off on an alliance, but this may be short-term. If the Decepticons form an alliance with the Nebulans, I fear they may possess a threat that could be as grave as the Quintessons.

A lifelong loser, Spike only got along with his brother BUSTER, and sometimes even that relationship was strained. Unlike his brother, Spike was all thumbs when it came to electronics, except in the creation of their mutual love: explosives! If it blew up real good, Spike could build it. Other that that, since Spike's divorce there was little in his life besides drugs, stolen cars and random violence, which ultimately led to his demise.What-If Worlds Witwicky What-If World Timeline  \"Yes, Buster's my brother. No, I won't introduce you to him.\"\u00a0 Patriarch William \"Sparkplug\" Witwicky and son Spike Witwicky witnessed world history when their oil rig was attacked by the Decepticons. Sparkplug briefly thought about volunteering to help the Autobots, but the fear of losing another family member a mere three years after losing his wife led him to let someone else handle the new alien visitors. This devastated Spike to no end. For a few moments after he and his father were pulled from certain death, Spike envisioned himself not as a \"mechanic to be,\" but as a key player in helping the Autobots not only get familiar with Eart, but to defeat the Decepticons. Just as Sparkplug's decision to help the Autobots led to enormous consequences (both good and bad with his family), Sparkplug's inactions caused a second rift in his family. Carly and Spike never hooked up - and as a result, Daniel never came to be. Instead of having one son idolize his father (Spike) and one son wanting nothing to do with him (Buster), both Witwicky brothers harbored serious resentments toward Sparkplug during their adolescence. Buster still saw Sparkplug as a distant figure who was either unwilling or uninterested in his son's interests. Spike saw his father as someone who singlehandedly crushed his dreams of become something more than a mechanic. Because the Autobots didn't have the unexpected arrival of Spike and Sparkplug, Optimus Prime and other senior-level Autobots took a far more strategic approach in recruiting human allies. Instead of having a father and son team show the Autobots about humans, the Autobots had a plethora of humans clamoring to help assist them adapt to their new home. For years, the Autobots carefully selected military, science, cultural, and space experts from all over the world. A few lived in the Ark occasionally, but none resided there full-time. As a result, the Autobots saw humans as collaborators to their goal, but never developed a family-like bond to any of their collaborators. When met with a new human, Bumblebee routinely assessed how this person could or would bring value to the Autobot cause.\u00a0 The stable family environment did benefit Buster. Living in a stable home with a father, who despite his ambivalence toward his son's interests still loved and cared deeply for his son's well being, focused Buster's attention on academics. He excelled in English and eventually became a professor and a published author. He obtained minor financial and critical success as a science fiction writer. Spike worked at his father's auto repair shop while in high school. For a few years, Spike cared little for the job, making common mistakes such as leaving the oil cap off of the engine during a routne oil change. Spike couldn't muster up the motivation to find a path in high school as the path he thought he was destined to take (helping the Autobots) was denied to him by his father. However, as Spike moved into his early '20s, his resentment toward his father ebbed. He took on his duties with renewed vigor and by the time he was 21, he was second only to his father in mechanical abilities at Witwicky Auto. In 1995, Sparkplug suffered a major heart attack while at Witwicky Auto. While he made a full recovery, Spike took over general duties at Witwicky Auto, where he remains today. In 2011, Witwicky Auto was awarded Top Marks in Angie's List for places to service your vehicle and the company received its first A+ rating in the Better Business Bureau publication of Most Ethical Small Businesses - much to Sparkplug's delight. Elated that Witwicky Auto was well on its way of entering a second generation, Sparkplug retired (minus the few part-time shifts he continues to work), handing over full administrative duties to his son, Spike.\u00a0 In his 20s, Spike met a woman by the name of Angela Dylan at a bar. While far from the best place to meet someone, Spike and Angela hit it off. In 1996, the two were married and have since had three children: Susan (18), David (13), and Olivia (9). Angela works as an office manager for a hospital and occasionally takes a bartending shift to earn extra money. Between jobs and children, Angela and Spike practically have to schedule date nights. While the two are close, both secretly feel that an essential \"spark\" between them is missing. It could be because they just never were \"quite\" the soulmates each had hoped, or it could be that the two have put so much work into their jobs and their family that at the end of the day when it's just the two of them, both have practically nothing left to give one another. In 2016, Angela and Spike made a secret vow - that when their youngest child Olivia turned 18, they would amicably separate. \u00a0Logs Con World Timeline  Spike was a brilliant scientist who worked for G.B. Blackrock until he was gravely wounded due to a Decepticon attack. Paralyzed, Spike managed to devise an exo-skeleton that could enable him to move. However, the attack caused irreperable psychological damage. The brilliant, enthusiastic scientist who wooed Carly while both were attending MIT was replaced by an angry, lonely, intensely bitter, and revenge-obsessed person. Spike eventually divorced Carly, left all of their possessions to her, and constructed an alter ego: Circuit Smasher, bent on destroying all Transformers.\u00a0G.I. Joe World Timeline  \"Never give up on the ones you love.\"\u00a0 Of all the Witwickys, Spike took his mother's murder at the hands of enemy G.I. Joe agents the hardest. When his father stepped down from G.I. Joe, Sparkplug initially devoted the majority of his time to his sons. Buster proved to be far more resiliant than his brother and was eventually recruited by top engineering schools for his computer hacking abilities. Spike tested high in reading comprehension and writing, but would routinely \"shut down\" for days or sometimes weeks. As a teenager, still haunted by his mother's death, Spike fell into a deep depression. With all other options exhausted, Sparkplug eventually admitted his son to a psychiatric hospital, where he stayed for more than a decade.\u00a0 While Spike was admitted, news about massive alien ship discovery began to circulate. Sparkplug was one of the first responders to these new alien visitors, known as Transformers. While Sparkplug began recruiting the Autobots found in that great space ship, the elder Witwicky asked Spike to assist him. Spike soon thrived in his new role as he began to teach the Autobots about Earth. In some instances, Spike has began to display an almost empathic ability to 'think' like a Transformer. In one occurrence, after watching a video of Megatron threatening to activate a space bridge to Cybertron unless the Earthbound Autobots surrender Optimus Prime and disarm, Spike rightly deduced Megatron was bluffing. Briefly putting himself in Megatron's boots, Spike told the Autobots if Megatron did indeed have such an ability, he would not bother to call for a cease fire - instead, he would ruthlessly show up at the Ark with his army, and permanently exterminate all of the remaining Autobots. \u00a0 \u00a0As Spike became more and more comfortable in his role, his deep depression began to fade as he began to accept that a future could be brighter than today.\u00a0Favorite Albums Favorite Movies Logs Spike Witwicky (SG)  SPIKE WITWICKY was a thug and a car thief, uninterested in anything in the world around him unless it brought him immediate pleasure or profit.

Unlike his brother, Spike was all thumbs when it comes to electronics, except in the creation of their mutual love: explosives! If it blows up real good, Spike could build it. Since his ex-wife got a restraining order against him, there was little in Spike\u2019s life besides drugs and stolen cars. When he met Deadline, he thought he'd finally found a friend, but instead ultimately that relationship got him killed.History MUX Canonical Theme Pre-History:  Spike was born in 1979. He and his brother Buster were raised along by their good-for-nothing father Sparkplug after their mother left them for another man. Spike turned to stealing cars are their father was permanently hospitalized for liver failure. When Spike's wife divorced him in 2008, Spike moved in with Buster. \"I only use cocaine to clean out my sinuses.\" \"The f*$# did I do??!!\" \"Officer...officer..occifer...I am unarmed. Everyone looking, I am unarmed. Don't taze me. Don't taze me. Officer don't ta...YEOWWW!\" \"Only God can judge me\" \"I only use coke when I party. Otherwise, I can stop at any time if I wanted to.\" Criminal HistoryMUX History:  As the TP opened, Spike Witwicky just came from the state hospital where his dad resides. Spike stole some cash from his wallet. Carly has a restraining order against him, and he has a bit of a coke problem - but he don't let it interfere with his work. High and hanging out with his brother Buster, Spike decided to steal a shiny gold car that appeared to have been left unattended downtown. The car, however, turned out to be the alien robot Goldbug, who offered him a deal -- tell Goldbug everything Spike knows about Earth, and Spike and his brother would be rewarded handsomely while helping \"defend the Earth against evil Decepticons.\" As part of the deal, Buster has offered to let Goldbug and his partner Snoop hide out in his garage... in return, when the Earth is \"saved,\" Goldbug has promised to take Buster, Spike, and Spike's son Daniel back to Cybertron. However, when Buster and Spike talked within earshot of selling out \"Goldmine\" to the highest bidder, Goldbug threatened to kill every member of Spike's family. Soon after, a man named Cain came by Buster's house, and threatened him with a world of pain if he didn't stay away from Carly and Daniel. Spike attacked Cain with a metal bat at Carly's house, and got literally stomped into the ground as a result. While being treated by Deadline for his injures, Spike let slip there was an alien robot living in Buster's garage. Goldbug has since left Buster and Spike's company, leaving them to deal with G.I. Joe alone. Subsequently, when Deadline came looking for the Autobot and found Buster's garage empty, he nabbed Spike instead, taking him back to the Pit. Spike and his brother were interrogated for weeks, but after Goldbug himself showed up at the Pit, both brothers were released. However, Buster subsequently beat up Spike and threw him out of his house, and since then Spike has been staying in a trailer with Deadline. As Ebony and Deadline discovered a portal that opens to the \"normal\" universe, Spike has been assigned to watch the growing list of imprisoned Joes, including Lowdown and Lifeline. Deadline wisely has only assigned Spike to watch the prisoners as the evil medic doesn't even trust Spike with the key to the cell. To amuse himself, Spike routinely teased Lifeline. When that got old, he further amused himself in his off hours by being a fixture at Trees Lounge, a neighborhood saloon, where he tried to score drugs, women and the occasional fight with a local.Operation Get Son Back  Due to Spike's incessant displays of verbal abuse and child negligence, he lost custody of his son to his ex-wife, Carly. Now, as Daniel has been sent off to boarding school, Spike hoped that a display of legitimacy, namely a letter from a physican on the \"normal\" side of the TF Universe spectrum, would be enough of a testament to regain custody of his son when he returns to his side of the TF Universe. The doctor in question, Edwin Steen, has vowed not to sign any letter of this kind, but Spike thought if he drafted a letter and then had Dr. Steen sign it, he would have a change of heart, especially since Dr. Steen is currently being held captive by Spike, Deadline and Ebony. The transcript of the letter* reads as follows: To whom it may concern: This letter is to tell you that Spike Witwicky is a supurb dad. As a prestegious doctor who has treated a lot of children, I know good dads when I see them. From my experience with Spike, I know that his son, Daniel has never gone without a toy he wanted or ever was homeless under Spike's care. With Spike for a father, I am confident that Spike will be a great disciplainar desciplien will discipline his son good. In addition as well and most importantly of all, Spike will teach Daniel how to stand up for himself. And he will be a great dad. Members of the boarding school board, I beeseach you to entrust Daniel into the care of Spike. Daniel has already suffered enough being without a father and also suffered under the care of Spike's ex-wife, Carly. He don't need to suffer any more. I will be happy to vouch for Spike's efforts and and I will be happy to talk about his parenting skills, but I may not be able to get a hold of because I will be in Africa and other poor countries helping treat sick people. In short, when I think of a good father, I think of Spike Witwicky. To prove it, I wrote this letter and have signed it. Yours Truely Dr. Steen April 21, 2010 * This letter has since been destroyed. Lifeline ripped it to shreads after Spike made the ill-advised attempt to contact Lifeline while he was in the middle of visiting with a patient.Spike's Death  In 2011, Spike's involvement with Deadline finally led to his death. Afterward, it was discovered after Sparkplug's passing that Spike left all of his assets (including a paltry $5,000 left by his father) to Buster and Daniel. However, since Daniel is still in boarding school, Buster offered to 'oversee' Daniel's finances in this department. Recently Spike's younger brother Buster discovered Deadline's involvement in Spike's death, and has set out to get revenge.OOC Notes Age  Spike was born in 1979. He died in 2010 as a result of a close-ranged gunshot wound to the head by an unknown assailant.Listening Preferences  Spike once listened to three songs (System of a Down's \"Deer Dance\" Godsmack's \"I Stand Alone\"\u00a0and Drowning Pool's \"Let The Bodies Hit the Floor\") on repeat for six-and-a-half hours on his stolen iPod, much to the dismay of people around him.Viewing Preferences  Spike's favorite movie of all time is Demolition Man. If he knew what \"allegory\" means, he would say it was an allegory for today's politically correct culture (which actually isn't too different than when the movie was released).Shattered Glass TP  This Spike was an evil version from a mirror universe.

The F-35 has three main models; the F-35A is a conventional takeoff and landing variant, the F-35B is a short take-off and vertical-landing variant, and the F-35C is a carrier-based variant. The F-35 is descended from the X-35, the product of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. It is being designed and built by an aerospace industry team led by Lockheed Martin. The F-35 took its first flight on 15 December 2006. The United States plans to buy 2,443 aircraft. The F-35 variants are intended to provide the bulk of its tactical airpower for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy over the coming decades. JSF development is being principally funded by the United States with additional funding from partners. The partner nations are either NATO members or close U.S. allies. The United Kingdom, Italy, Israel, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, and Turkey are part of the development program; Japan has ordered the F-35, while Singapore may also equip their air force with the F-35.History MUX  The first F-35A (designated AA-1) was rolled out in Fort Worth, Texas, on 19 February 2006. In September 2006, the first engine run of the F135 in an airframe took place. On 15 December 2006, the F-35A completed its maiden flight. A modified Boeing 737\u2013300, the Lockheed CATBird has been used as an avionics test-bed for the F-35 program, including a duplication of the cockpit. The first F-35B (designated BF-1) made its maiden flight on 11 June 2008, piloted by BAE Systems' test pilot Graham Tomlinson. Flight testing of the variant's STOVL propulsion system began on 7 January 2010.[329] The F-35B's first hover was on 17 March 2010, followed by its first vertical landing the next day.[330] During a test flight on 10 June 2010, the F-35B became the second STOVL aircraft to achieve supersonic speeds[331] after the X-35B. The F-35C's maiden flight took place on 7 June 2010, at NAS Fort Worth JRB. A total of 11 U.S. Air Force F-35s arrived in fiscal year 2011. On 25 October 2011, the F-35A reached its designed top speed of Mach 1.6 for the first time.[354] Further testing demonstrated Mach 1.61 and 9.9g. In October 2011, two F-35B VTOL aircraft conducted three weeks of initial sea trials aboard USS Wasp. On 15 August 2012, an F-35B completed air start tests, which involved shutting down and restarting the engine while in flight; the F-35A had previously completed these tests. During the fourth quarter of 2012, weapons separation tests were performed. On 6 October 2012, the F-35A dropped its first bomb,[359] followed three days later by an AIM-120 AMRAAM. On 28 November 2012, an F-35C performed a total of eleven weapon releases, ejecting a GBU-31 JDAM and GBU-12 Paveway from its weapons bay in the first ground weapons ejections for the F-35C. On 16 November 2012, the U.S. Marines received the first F-35B at MCAS Yuma, and the VMFA(AW)-121 unit is to be redesignated from a Boeing F/A-18 Hornet unit to an F-35B squadron. A February 2013 Time article revealed that Marine pilots are not allowed to perform a vertical landing \u2013 the maneuver is deemed too dangerous, and it is reserved only for Lockheed test pilots. On 11 February 2013, an F-35A completed its final test mission for clean wing flutter, reporting to be clear of flutter at speeds up to Mach 1.6. On 10 May 2013, the F-35B completed its first vertical takeoff test. On 5 June 2013, an F-35A completed the first in-flight missile launch of an AIM-120 C5 AAVI (AMRAAM Air Vehicle Instrumented) over the Point Mugu Sea Test Range. The missile was launched from the internal weapons bay of the F-35. On 3 August 2013, the F-35B completed its 500th vertical landing. The aircraft, BF-3, was the same aircraft that made the F-35B's first vertical landing at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in March 2010. On the 26 September a United States Marine Corps F-35B flown by VMFA-211 carried out it's first combat mission over Afghanistan. Sadly however this event was overshadowed by the loss of an F-35B belonging to VMFAT 501 at MCAS Beaufort S.C.. Two weeks prior to these events a F-35B flew from NAS Patuxent River and landed aboard the the Royal Navy carrier Queen Elizabeth.Notes  The F-35 Lightning II is the favored jet of the Joe pilot Wisp.OOC  MUX player iceSpark works on the Lightning II project IRL.
