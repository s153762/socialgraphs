It is a powerful, selective fire 12 gauge shotgun that boasts an automatic fire mode in addition to the pump action mode, capable of eliminating several targets in quick succession. As such, it is used as an offensive, front-line weapon with massive stopping power, capable of stopping almost anything dead in its tracks. It is the primary weapon for balaclava soldiers- they are extremely dangerous especially in close quarters as they can kill several unarmoured players very quickly. They use the SPAS-12 primarily in automatic mode and will rush to close the gap between players to make full use of the shotgun's devastating power. Players must ensure they have armour, are outside the shotgun's range and equipped with ranged weapons such as the MP5 to deal with these enemies carefully.Function  Seen in most Half-Life games and Mods, this is a popular choice for close range combat, used by mask-faced grunts and players alike, and best for monsters with ample health because of its high damage output. The SPAS-12 has 2 firing modes: primary fire makes it fire normally in pump action mode while secondary fire makes it fire more faster in automatic mode, albeit with lower accuracy. If playing on classic mode, the secondary fire will two shells simultaneously, resulting in decreased accuracy and longer pump times. If all pellets meet to one target, every pellet has specific points of damage, and likely a headshot scored will give a kill, note that this can only be successfully carried out in closer ranges.Pros Cons Notes External Links Sniper Rifle  The M40A1 Sniper Rifle is a powerful scoped weapon used in Sven Co-op.Function  A powerful manual weapon with a slow rate of fire, the M40A1 is a standard sniper rifle, fitted with optics to take out enemies from afar, and with a full powered rifle cartridge, it does kill with a single shot to the head of any enemy. If not aimed, the weapon will be inaccurate, aside the good bullet it hangs, it is mostly overshadowed by the more silent Crossbow, for the ammo max carry, and the only good thing is the bullet, notoriously used to kill in one hit, it is favored by AI Assassins and Bodyguards, who use it as one of their main weapons.External Links  M40 Rifle on WikipediaSven Co-op  Sven Co-op (abbreviated as SC) is a co-operative multiplayer game from the famous first-person shooter game Half-Life. Here, where players work together solve puzzles, combat enemies and complete objectives as a team. It was released on January 19,1999- before Valve's Team Fortress Classic- and therefore the oldest Half-Life mod in existence and development.Features from Half-Life  Sven Co-op is heavily based on Half-Life, as it runs on an updated version of the original GoldSrc engine nicknamed \"Svengine\", which extends the limitations with the GoldSrc engine and allows larger levels to be made and more entities to be used, giving mappers a much larger degree of freedom. Players will find familiar pickups such as medkits, armor batteries, and ammunition for weapons, which now can be set respawn after a period of time. There are health and armor recharge stations, which now can recover a players health and armor to maximum, and the stations and can replenish its reserves over time. It may also be set to have infinite reserve so all players are able to use it.Gameplay  It is important that players must be familiar with Half-Life and its controls, and it is recommended that they should finish the Hazard Course level. The single player campaign from Half-Life as well as the expansion campaigns (such as Opposing Force and Blue Shift) is officially supported by SC, but modified to be played co-operatively for a better challenge. It's multiplayer maps vary from scenario, which could be set in Black Mesa, cartoon like levels, WWII classical campaigns, custom made maps, and modern warfare scenes, which can be set by mappers and server operators.Life system  Unlike the original games, Sven Co-op does not have a save feature to save a players progress through levels. Instead, most chapters will be split into separate levels, at the beginning of which will have a spawn point where new players joining the server will spawn, and where existing players will respawn should they die while progressing through levels. There may also be rudimentary \"checkpoint\" locations, which when crossed will shift the respawn point to that location. This can be set by a mapper. Games will be typically played in survival mode: players have one life; if they die, they must be revived with the Medkit, or wait for a player to activate a checkpoint, which will spawn all dead players where the medal is located. Checkpoints appear as floating blue lamda symbols which are placed in different areas in each level- some may be unlocked after killing certain enemies.Arsenal  Sven Co-op\u00a0has a variety of weaponry that players can use to suit their needs in any given combat situation. Ammunition for most weapons are not in plentiful supply, however ammunition can be shared among other players. While firearms such as the\u00a0Submachine Gun\u00a0and the\u00a0Shotgun\u00a0are more commonly used for their adaptability to most if not all types of combat, there are many weapons that allow players to deal more damage, extend their range of attack and fight with enemies that are otherwise difficult to deal with standard issue firearms. In addition to standard munitions, players can also use heavy weapons and alien weapons. Sven Co-op for the most part uses the same weapons from Half-Life and its expansions. However, some weapons have been modified and some new weapons have been added into the players arsenal. Despite the new additions and modifications, many servers still retain the classic Half-Life weapons in a game mode known as \"classic mode\", enabling players to enjoy the original campaigns with the authentic experience. Unofficial, fan-made campaigns can also feature their own custom weapons. Note: Donors, playtesters, mappers, and members of the SC team have access to other abilities implied in specific weapons (like Uzis now are gold, and the crowbar has added electrical damage). External links Minigun  The XM214 Minigun is a powerful automatic weapon available in Sven Co-op that boasts a very high rate of fire.Function  The Minigun is heavy machine gun and is the heaviest weapon in the game. It is used by the Sergeant and the Bodyguard. It does hold more than the SAW, but it is not reloadable, however picking any 5.56\u00a0ammo boxes will replenish the supply. Note that it is heavy and is not suited when players holding it are alone, it is a support weapon, so have some players with you at all times.Stats Advantages Drawbacks Tactics Counter-Tactics Rocket Launcher  The HECU Rocket Launcher is a uncommon weapon in Sven Co-op. It is a very dangerous ordance weapon that fires laser guided missiles, perfect for destroying vehicles.Function  It launches a highly explosive missile capable of killing enemies close to the blast, and it is one of many weapons that can take out the Gargantua, the Apache and Osprey. Secondary fire allows it to activate the laser similar to the Desert Eagle's sights, which guides the rocket to the spot the laser is being pointed on. This makes it very useful for fighting airborne vehicles that are otherwise difficult to aim projectiles at- however is it recommended to use the Tau Cannon over the Rocket Launcher when available.Submachine Gun  The MP5A3 Submachine Gun is a common weapon in Sven Co-op. It is a compact machine gun that will provide moderate firepower, proving to be sufficient for any combat situation. It is the standard issue infantry weapon for HECU soldiers, and is best used by players as a general purpose firearm.Function  It is a fully automatic machine gun that fires 9x19mm Parabellum rounds from a 30-round magazine, allowing a user to carry a lot of ammunition. It has a moderate rate of fire and a quick reload time that enables it to be an effective assault weapon. The gun is best utilized for mid range combat, as the gun suffers from poor accuracy at long range, and lacks the stopping power at close range. However, it sports a new attachment to compensate for this. With the addition of an optic, the weapon's effective range can be extended somewhat: the user can now zoom in and obtain a much better sight picture of their targets to increase accuracy. Do note that this does not provide the level of magnification that the Crossbow or the M40A1 more powerful scopes provide.Pros Cons Tactics Counter-Tactics Notes External Links  MP5 on WikipediaMedic  The HECU Medic is an AI character seen is Sven Co-op. They are support infantry, capable of tending to wounds in the battlefield, players needing aid gets the medics' attention, coming in up close to heal wounds.Abilities  As the name implies, they are medical specialists, they heal wounds in the battlefield, and they can revive dead players. They carry unlimited medical supplies, but forcing medics to carry handguns as their standard self-defense weapon, their vulnerability means they must be kept behind the front lines, as their weapons are useless against automatic weapons, and aside from that, they, like regular infantry, can dodge grenades thrown in their direction.Equipment  They carry unlimited first aid supplies, but only to carry Desert Eagles or M9s in this case, so players must cover them to proceed. They are certainly of no other use than healing and reviving, but proven to be useful if the player is seriously hurt.Uzi  The Uzi Machine Pistol is an automatic handgun used in Sven Co-op. It is a weapon that can be dual wielded to allow players to deliver more firepower than what the MP5 Submachine Gun is capable of: while the MP5 focuses on accuracy and precision, the Uzi relies on a higher dps, making the Uzi a strong competitor, albiet with a higher spread. As such, players will use it as an alternative for the MP5, but it's not an easy find, in some maps, it's rare, and picking it up is difficult.Function  The Uzi is a 9mm machine pistol, capable of firing fast. It has the highest ammo capacity of any 9mm weapon, holding 2 bullets more than the MP5. However it is not as accurate as the MP5, and is best suited for close combat. Despite it's reduced accuracy, a second Uzi can be deployed and dual wieded, effectively doubling its rate of fire and increasing its damage output. However this makes the gun even more inaccurate, and drains ammunition very quickly.Difference between users  If the user is not a donor, the weapon is black and the damage output is weak. If the user of this is a donor, a mapper of the team, a playtester, developer, or a member of the SC team, these will be automatically be gold, and has a medium damage output.Strategy Tactics Counter-Tactics Notes Engineer  The Engineer is a HECU Soldier unit seen in Sven Co-op.Background  He is specialized to blow or cut doors open for fellow soldiers to get through, his large gas canister makes him a potential hazard in the battlefield, not just costing his life, but the lives of other troops. He is best kept once the area is clear.Abilities  He utilizes a blowtorch with a large canister of highly pressurized gas, and wields a Desert Eagle, his gas can is placed in his back to replace the standard knapsack, this, makes him a potential target, especially when they are in groups, a bullet in the gas can can blow him up, killing or injuring the others.Assault Rifle  The M16A2 Assault Rifle is a weapon in Sven Co-op designed for tactical combat. While still maintaining proficient accuracy and precision at long range, the rifle also offers significant damage dealing capabilities at mid range through the use of the M203 grenade launcher attachment. It is a very common weapon choice for HECU soldiers and they will use it often. It is acquired in the Half-Life campaign Chapter 4- We Got Hostiles next to a dead soldier inside the first room with a turret. It can also be found again in one of the laser rooms in the chapter Questionable Ethics.Function  The M16 is a 3-round burst rifle, sharing the same 5.56 ammunition with the SAW and the Minigun. Since it is not fully automatic like the aforementioned weapons, it boasts superior accuracy because of the reduced recoil, enabling users to deliver damage at long range. However it has minimal stopping power, in which case headshots or the use of the grenade launcher are methods that should be considered when fighting in closer ranges. The assault rifle's grenade launcher can fire 1 grenade and the player can carry on 11 grenades in total (1 in chamber, but seen as 0, and 10 in reserve). The grenade launcher attached to it must be manually reloaded after each shot. Despite the weapon's precision and power, both the rifle and the grenade launcher takes a long time to reload, which in addition to its 3-round burst fire mode, limits its effectiveness in closer range since it can leave the player vulnerable to counter-attacks in such ranges.Tactics Counter-Tactics Notes External Links  M16A2 rifle on WikipediaSergeant  The HECU Sergeant is a heavily armed HECU Soldier packing serious firepower. With his Minigun and imposing stature, he is a force to be reckoned with.Background  A standard marine trained to carry the Minigun like a piece of pipe, short to say, he's like a grunt on steroids and more firepower to boot. Although carrying a powerful weapon, he trades it off for slow movement: when firing, he is completely immobile making him vulnerable when alone. Nevertheless, he is highly fearsome in a group. In addition, he has an equally powerful sidearm, the Desert Eagle, should he drop his minigun.Abilities  He carries the Minigun, but this has several drawbacks:Crossbow  The Crossbow is a scoped weapon used in Sven Co-op.Function  Made by Black Mesa research personnel, this weapon is used to poison enemies for a short time, if not aimed towards them, the bolt explodes in contact with hard surfaces and wounds anyone near the blast, although light. This is one of 3 weapons that can fire underwater (the 9mm Pistol, and the Rocket Launcher being the other 2), and one of 2 weapons to take down the Ichthyosaur (the other being the pistol). It's drawbacks are that it is slow when bolts are launched, not like the M40 that takes a direct hit, and slower than the M40 sniper rifle, on loading another round. It's sights are not like the M40, which is like a sniper's scope, but rather of a simple, side dotted crosshair when zoomed.Strategy Pros Cons Tactics Counter-Tactics Chain Gun  The M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, more commonly referred to as the SAW or the Chain Gun, is a light and portable machine gun used in Sven Co-op with a high firing rate. It has a generous reserve of ammunition and can be deployed and deliver damage for the entire duration of combat- whether fighting several enemies at once or fighting a large alien, this gun will help pull it off behind the frontlines.Function  As the weapon's name suggests, it is a fully automatic machine gun that can be used to provide supporting fire for a squad of players- as such, it is best utilized as a defensive weapon for close to medium range combat. It has a belt of 200 5.56 rounds that feeds from a canister that has a generous capacity of 600 rounds total, which makes this gun very dependable for support. However this also leads to a considerably high reload time: unlike other weapons, the gun must first be opened and then a new belt can be manually placed into the firing chamber, then closed to be ready to fire. In addition to its long reload time, the recoil becomes increasingly higher the longer it is fired, making it less than ideal for frontline combat, in which case the assault rifle has a better capability to deliver damage at longer ranges while using the same 5.56 ammunition.Pros Cons Tactics Counter-Tactics Security Guard  Security Guards are Black Mesa staff that are assigned with controlling secure access locations throughout the Black Mesa facility. They have basic combat training to ensure the safety of coworkers and are armed with handguns.Abilities  Security guards can allow access to secured locations to players to obtain valuables such as health, armor and ammunition. Unlike the soldiers, they only carry their M9 pistol and the Desert Eagle as their standard sidearms. They are not protected against environmental threats but are suited with Kevlar vests with helmets as standard issue.Medkit  The Medkit (or Medikit) is the only tool used in Sven Co-op.Function  The Medkit is new in SC, that provides the player an oppurtunity to play medic. It can heal AI and players for 15 HP and it also has an in-built defibrillator: players are able to revive non-imploded teamates for 50 HP. Healing teamates can also gain a few health for the user. However the player holding it cannot heal themselves and must rely on AI Medics or other players to revive the player. It charges overtime by 5 HP.Notes Desert Eagle  The Desert Eagle is a powerful pistol used in Sven Co-Op.Function  A .357 chambered pistol, it does lower damage output than the .357 Magnum revolver, but carries a 7-round clip and offers a higher rate of fire, and offers an attached laser sight, if the laser is on, the pistol will have a lower rate of fire but drawing it for accuracy, but again, enemies can see it, a hit on the head for some can take down enemies in one shot (along with the sniper rifle and .357 mag).External Links 9mm Pistol  The Beretta M9 9mm Pistol is the standard player weapon used in Sven Co-op. While it is soon replaced by the MP5 Submachine Gun as a primary weapon for its fully automatic rate of fire and larger magazine capacity, the Pistol still retains its use in situations where the submachine gun is not up to the task of dealing with targets at long range or where the high rate of fire is wasteful of ammunition. As such, the Pistol serves as the main sidearm to the submachine gun.Function  It is a small, select-fire handgun that is chambered in for 9x19mm Parabellum rounds and uses a 17 round detachable stick magazine, making reloads very quick. In addition to its semi-automatic, single shot firing mode, the weapon can also be deployed in fully automatic fire for self-defense from close encounters with enemies. However using this mode, the recoil makes this otherwise accurate gun to miss shots beyond close range, wasting valuable ammunition. Note that the rate of fire for full auto mode is extremely low- only 100 more rounds per minute to the base 200 rpm for the single shot mode. This should be used as a last resort, if weapons like the shotgun are otherwise unavailable for use.Crowbar  The Crowbar is a weapon, famous in Half-life, used in Sven Co-Op.Function  The crowbar is one of the tools you will own in the map spawn, it does low damage but in quick succession, if the user is a donor, it has the ability to use the HEV power to double the damage, at the cost of the armor points, and in SC, tertiary fire is to throw the crowbar, hoping to hit. A thrown crowbar can be picked up again if it misses a target and lands in a reachable spot.Weapons  Sven Co-op has a variety of weaponry that players can use to suit their needs in any given combat situation. Ammunition for most weapons are not in plentiful supply, however ammunition can be shared among other players. While firearms such as the Submachine Gun and the Shotgun are more commonly used for their adaptability to most if not all types of combat, there are many weapons that allow players to deal more damage, extend their range of attack and fight with enemies that are otherwise difficult to deal with standard issue firearms.  In addition to standard munitions, players can also use heavy weapons and alien weapons.Template documentation  This category should contain all template documentation pages. See Template:Documentation for more details.Templates  This is the base category for templates. Templates should be placed in appropriate subcategories. See Project:Templates for collated information on templates.Hand Grenade  Hand Grenades are explosive weapons used in Sven Co-Op.Function  Introduced in all Half-Life games, the grenade plays an essential role in killing enemies in distances near it, killing or injuring anyone in the blast zone, in Sven Co-Op, 10 grenades form a so-called \"Banana Bomb\" attack, launching a single grenade, combining the blasts of 10 bombs together, like some MIRV warhead.Handguns  Handguns are one-handed weapons that are used as sidearms. These are the last resort weapons if their primary counterparts have ran out of ammo or are otherwise ineffective for the task. In SC, there are four handguns to select.", "\u9017\u8da3\u91ab\u9662 Fun Hospital Wiki": "\u9017\u8da3\u91ab\u9662 Fun Hospital Wiki ", "Club Penguin Pookie Fan World Wikia": "Club Penguin Pookie Fan World Wikia ", "Minecraft Universe Wiki": "Minecraft Universe Wiki ", "Phantom Doctrine Wiki": "Phantom Doctrine Wiki ", "Phantom doctrine \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "Phantom doctrine \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "The Tower Wiki": "The Tower Wiki Main Page The Tower Wiki  Welcome to The Tower Wiki!

It trys to install the \"Libery\" Plugin, but then fails. =(SimTower SimTower  SimTower is a 1994 simulation computer game published by Maxis. SimTower was made shortly after the release of SimCity 2000. Although published by Maxis, the game was originally developed in Japan and its license was acquired by Maxis. In Japan, it was published under the name of The Tower, and developed by Yoot Saito's company OPeNBooK Co., Ltd. A sequel to SimTower, Yoot Tower was also developed by OPeNBooK and was published by SEGA in the U.S. in 1999. A clone of SimTower for the PocketPC developed by eSoft Interactive was released in 2004 under the name of Tower Mogul. A port of SimTower was made for iPad called Yoot Tower. One major difference between the original and the iPad version is that the new version has expandable security offices, housekeeping, and recycling/garbage centers. It also had crime where rooms too far away from an inadequately sized security office would go abandoned. Tiny Tower, Corporation Inc., and Dream Heights were all inspired by SimTower. Gameplay As the name suggests, the objective is to construct and manage a towering skyscraper and keep its occupants happy. Offices, hotels, and condominiums give tenants places to live and work, while shops and restaurants provide commercial balance. Utilities such as hospitals and recycling centers become necessary as the tower grows in size. The player's progress is based on a star system, similar to how hotels are ranked, with new stars awarded for meeting population milestones and other conditions. Population is measured by the number of individuals currently in the tower; many hotel rooms will cause population to soar during the night. As the tower's rating improves, more facilities can be built by the player, such as a cinema. Like other Maxis games, gameplay is not designed linearly, and SimTower does not have a specific end point; however, the primary goal is a population of 15,000, which rewards the player with 'Tower' status. Another goal is to build a cathedral at the top of the tower and have a marriage ceremony take place there. One of the key activities of the game is effectively managing and building elevators in order to allow occupants to move between floors efficiently. In fact, the original game was a program to test effective elevator layouts. Many users felt a more appropriate title for the game would have been SimElevator. Waiting for an elevator for too long would cause the residents stress (indicated by a black, pink or red colour as they become more stressed). Too much stress would cause them to permanently leave the tower. Fires, cockroach infestations in uncleaned hotel rooms, thefts and bomb scares were the main challenges besides the financial aspect.Yoot Tower Press Release  (This is from the archived version of YootTower.com): WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD; LIVE, WORK AND PLAY IN \"YOOT TOWER\" Sega PC Builds On The Classic \"SimTower\u2122\" With \"Yoot Tower\" For Mac REDWOOD CITY -- (November 24, 1998) -- Sega\u00a8 PC today shipped the strategy/simulation game \"Yoot Tower\u2122\" for the Macintosh. Created by Yoot Saito, the mastermind behind \"SimTower\u2122\" by EA/Maxis, which won the Software Publisher's Association (SPA) Codie award for \"best simulation game\" and sold almost one million copies worldwide, \"Yoot Tower\" gives gamers familiar with the series an entirely \"remodeled\" experience. \"Yoot Tower\" for Mac is available at retail stores nationwide or online at www.yoottower.com. For a limited time, a free t-shirt and $10 discount are available to those buying the game online. Gamers can now build upon two new locations including Kegon Falls and Tokyo. For the first time in the series, the company expects to deliver unique \"plug-in modules,\" which include new gameplay elements. The content from the plug-in modules can be saved to players' hard drives and become a part of the original game. A resort location, Waikiki, is packed-in with the game. True to the series, a focal point of the game is to keep the people happy. \"Yoot Tower\" takes this to an all new level with an improved character AI that is so advanced, the people now feel stress, leave hotels with bad service and boycott stores with high prices. With the most advanced level of options seen in the series, gamers must not only choose the kinds of restaurants, retail stores and movie theaters to include, but also the menus, prices and types of movies shown. Best known for its quality PC translations of Sega arcade and character-based games, \"Yoot Tower\" marks Sega PC's first venture into the strategy/simulation genre. Analyzing the computer gaming markets, Sega PC saw the opportunity to realign its product line-up, focusing on the biggest segments in the market. With strategy and simulation as top genres for PC gamers (Computer Gaming World study) and the market for Macintosh games at more than $200 million annually, \"Yoot Tower\" is a big opportunity for Sega PC. \"Yoot Tower' pushes gamers' strategic thinking sky high, giving them a completely fresh, challenging experience,\" said Matt Wolf, executive producer, Sega PC. \"This game brings together the creative talents of two leaders in the interactive entertainment industry to deliver a totally new simulation experience for PC/Mac gamers.\" The Strategy An involving simulation of the complexities of high-rise development and management, \"Yoot Tower\" challenges gamers to build the ultimate five-star establishment and steadily increase the population of the structure. Given limited funds, players must construct and develop a balanced, profitable commercial property by leasing space inside for hotels, offices, movie theaters, restaurants and shops \"Yoot Tower\" pushes strategy to a new dimension of complexity, challenging gamers to perfect the process of where and when to place things and how to make them work. With the addition of new locations, gamers must consider the consequences in building a particular structure in a location. Don't build an office building in Waikiki; the people want to play. Instead, consider hotels with key tourist-type restaurants. Players must keep in mind the water level and seasons when building at Kegon Falls, and consider what to do in the off-seasons. The Population Because the people are smarter this time around, gamers must go a step further, checking their satisfaction level and thinking of ways to make their lives easier and happier. Gamers now have access to a \"stress meter,\" which reflects the reactions of people in real- time and can be used as a key tool for improvement. People leave the buildings at sun down, so players must constantly think of how they will get them back in the morning, by making additions to restaurant menus, adding better \"A\" movies to theaters or finding retail stores that fill a gap in what is available. Life in Yoot Tower \"Yoot Tower\" breathes real-life and authenticity to other areas of the game. Just like being in a busy city or resort, \"Yoot Tower\" is buzzing with realistic sounds ranging from honking horns, to moving elevators, to crashing waterfalls. People travel in families, kids goof off and run around the buildings and mothers try to track them down, just like in real-life. As an additional dose of realism, players must be more frugal than ever because the improved elevators and sky bridges are expensive. Elevator management is key in \"Yoot Tower\" and gamers must be smart and efficient in plotting out traffic flow. They must know how many elevators will be needed and where, when to use escalators or people movers, and when it makes sense to construct a sky bridge between two twin towers -- all in an effort to make life easier for the people. For, with too much traffic in the building, the stress level of the people will rise and they will leave. Therefore, gamers must think strategically and strive for the easiest navigation possible. Unlike other strategy/simulation games, \"Yoot Tower\" doesn't emphasize winning or losing, allowing for rewarding gameplay on all levels. With a focus on thinking smart and multi-tasking, players are not pressured to keep score. Gamers are also constantly rewarded with additional stars and thus, additional options to make their buildings even better. As an added bonus, \"Yoot Tower\" is filled with hidden elements, or \"Easter eggs,\" for gamers including VIP rockstars that visit your establishment in limos. \"Yoot Tower\" is available at retail stores nationwide and online at www.yoottower.com. The game operates on a minimum specification of PowerPC 601 with system 7.5 and 16 MB memory. For a limited time, a free \"Yoot Tower\" for Macintosh tee shirt is available with purchase online (while supplies last), in addition to ten dollars off the retail price of $39.99 (online only). The game will also be available for the PC in January. YootEntertainment is the U.S. affiliate of OPenBook9003.

Electronic Arts released the game for the Xbox 360 and PC in the spring of 2006, along with a collector's edition for ten dollars more, and an Expansion pack later, named The Rise of the Witch-king.  The game had a few slight differences from the original Battle for Middle-earth, like the controls and exclusion of build plots, but players soon forgot the old controls and will get used to the new ones. With the addition of a new difficulty level, The Battle for Middle-Earth II also added new factions and maps, as well as a system to create your own heroes in the PC versions. A new Evil Faction was added in the Form of Goblins and many of the units and Heroes in for the Good factions in the first game joined together to become one big faction. 2 new Good factions were therefore introduced: Elves and Dwarves. This time, the Campaign (which still contains a Good Campaign and an Evil Campaign) took place in the North to explain what happened during the films.Factions  The playable factions included for Skirmish and War of the Ring mode in The Battle for Middle-earth II are: Good EvilOther added features Maps  In The Battle for Middle-earth II, forty-one different locations of Middle-earth can be used for Skirmishes, and are all conquerable territories in the War of the Ring mode. See Category:BFME 2 Maps.Story-line and Campaign  The Good Campaign opens after the Fellowship of the Ring has set out on their mission to unmake the One Ring of Power, while Elrond and Gl\u00f3in planning a war in the North. The Elven hero Glorfindel discovers an impending attack on the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell and leads his remaining Elven armies to alert Elrond. Thanks to his early warning, Elrond's forces in Rivendell manage to repel the Goblins' attacks despite the arrival of a fire-breathing Wyrm. Following the battle, Elrond realizes that the Elves and Dwarves must join forces to defeat Sauron and his allies. Elrond sends Glorfindel and Gloin to ally with the Dwarves. Unfortunately, the High Pass is infested with Goblins, which have posed a major threat to this area. The Elves decide to clear the Pass of the Goblins, rescue an ambushed Haldir, and eliminate the Goblin settlements. The next battle takes place in the Goblin capital of Ettenmoors. Glorfindel, Gloin, and Haldir rush to rescue an Elven settlement from Goblin attacks. After rescuing the settlement, they lead an Elven army to destroy an ancient drum, free an Ent Moot, and destroy the Goblin-King and his fortress with the help of the Ents. After their victory, the heroes are informed that the Goblins, on Sauron's command, have enlisted the service of Drogoth the Dragon Lord who is laying waste to the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. The heroes make their way to the Blue Mountains and help the Dwarven army to defeat Drogoth and his Goblins. Unfortunately, the Dwarves refuse to help them and the leaders of the Free Peoples are forced to move to the Grey Havens to seek help from the Elves. The Grey Havens, an Elven port on the western shores, is attacked by the Corsairs of Umbar, allies of Sauron. The Elven ships, with the help of Glorfindel and Gloin, eliminate the Corsair blockade and capture Mordor's shipwrights. Soon after, the Corsair and Goblin armada prepare their assault on the shores. The Dwarves, who have been reluctant to ally with the Elves, eventually decide to come to the aid of the Grey Havens. With the Dwarves' help, the entire armada is destroyed. This signals the end of any major Goblin threats in all of northern Middle-earth, which is all very well because Mordor is now preparing to attack. Sauron decides to prepare his northern Mordor armies for war. The Dwarven king D\u00e1in leads a small group of Dwarves and men to defend Esgaroth, where they lead an assault upon the Mordor fortress on the opposite shoreline. Dain defeats the Mordor army, but they are forced back to Erebor. Dain and his mighty Dwarven armies prepare mighty fortresses outside Dain and prepare their armies and withstand huge waves of Mordor forces. A group of Goblins and Cave Trolls from\u00a0Mt.Gundabad\u00a0help the Mordor host to lay siege to the Erebor. Dwarves manage as well as they can on their own despite sneak attacks to seemingly vulnerable entrances, but Elven reinforcements from Mirkwood led by the Elven king Thranduil cement victory for the Dwarves. During the latter stage, the Mouth of Sauron attempts to lead a sneak attack force into Erebor, but a few\u00a0Phalanx\u00a0units and Men of Dale in the area, spring into action and defeat the siege party. To permanently destroy the Evil in the North, the combined Dwarven-Elven armies prepare to attack Dol Guldur, Sauron's main fortress in the North. Elrond leads the first attack, but later, Thranduil, Glorfindel, Gl\u00f3in, Arwen, and King D\u00e1in all unite under the Dwarven-Elven alliance, aided by the Ents and Eagles. Mordor, to counter the threat, attempt a counterattack from the forest and summon various creatures, including a Watcher, a Dragon, and even the Balrog. Despite these powerful comebacks, the Good forces and its three combined armies overcome the defenses. Using various ancient Elven and Dwarven powers (including horse floods, earthquakes, and sunflares), the army of the Free Peoples destroy the fortress, eliminating the last threat in the North. The Evil Campaign follows an alternate version of the War in the North. Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the Nazg\u00fbl to the North to muster wild Goblins. His lieutenants lead the Goblin army and launch an assault on the Elven forest of L\u00f3rien. Despite heavy resistance, the forest is overrun, with Celeborn slain and Galadriel having fled to Rivendell; even Caras Galadhon collapses under the might of the massive invasion. The Mouth peers eagerly into the captured\u00a0Mirror of Galadriel\u00a0for his next attack, as his Goblins celebrate their triumph over the Elves amidst the ruins of the once-mighty stronghold. Another group of Goblins, led by the Goblin King, attacks the Grey Havens by land and sea. The Elven port is destroyed, and the march across Eriador begins; Hobbits of the Shire are chosen as the next target. The Goblin-king's horde manages to crush the Hobbits and burn their country to the ground, but Wormtongue, one of Saruman's henchmen, suddenly appears with a large army of Isengard Uruks and claims the land for his master. The Goblins annihilate the well-trained army and kill Wormtongue. The Goblin-King continues marching and besieges Fornost, the fortified ruins of the ancient capitol of Arnor. The defenders, consisting of the D\u00fanedain and Dwarves, mount a heavy defense and even attempt to use a machine of destruction, the Earth Hammer. Nevertheless, they crumble under the relentless Goblin attacks, and Eriador falls under Goblin (and indirectly, Sauron's) control. Meanwhile, Sauron launches a concurrent campaign east of the Misty Mountains. The forces of Mordor, led once again by the Mouth of Sauron, march from Dol Guldur to eliminate the Elves and the Ents that guard the Forest Road in Mirkwood. Three of the Nazg\u00fbl (likely the same ones that attacked Lothlorien) and even Shelob also lead the Mordor army, consisting of Orcs, Trolls, and Corsairs. While claiming the Forest Road, they destroy the Elven stronghold in the woods and defeat the Elf King Thranduil, clearing the large majority of the Elves in the North. Afterwards, Mordor brings the war to the Dwarves, led by King Dain. The Mouth of Sauron, the Nazgul, and an army of Mordor advance through the Withered Heath, destroying many Dwarven settlements and releasing young dragons (Fire Drakes\u00a0) to aid them. After all the Drakes are free and the settlements destroyed, they move on to recruit Drogoth the Dragon Lord. In one of the most important battles in the North, the Mordor army lays siege to Dale and Erebor. Sauron's initial army attacks various Dale buildings and take the treasure in them. Later on, the Mouth of Sauron and two Nazgul arrive, set up a permanent base, and begin an organized attack on Erebor. Many Dwarven warriors periodically attempt to stop them, but they are all eliminated one by one. Gloin and some other Dwarves attempt to attack the base from behind but they too are slain. After full preparation, the Mouth of Sauron leads the armies of Mordor to the heart of Erebor. King Dain and his Royal Guard attempt to stop them, but they are slain under the relentless hordes. The army proceeds to destroy the Throne of Erebor and gain total victory. For the final battle, the Goblin horde and Sauron's forces from Mordor converge at Rivendell, the last surviving stronghold against Sauron in Middle-earth. Eagles, the Army of the Dead and the remnants of the Fellowship of the Ring arrive to help Arwen and Elrond, but Sauron (having attained full power through recovering the One Ring from the dead\u00a0Frodo) and all his gathered forces enter the battle and completely destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.Production and Notable cast  The game was produced by EA Los Angeles, but was distributed by New Line Cinema, the cinematic company that had distributed Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Read MoreGames Behind the Games Elements of the Games Guides(in the making) External Links Mordor (faction)  Mordor is an evil faction in all three Battle for Middle-earth games, and the most expansive of the evil armies. It is comprised of all who made up Sauron's armies and allies in the Third Age.Game performance  The faction of Mordor is made up of the servants of the Dark Lord Sauron, containing beasts, Orcs, and Men. Mordor's basic orcs are medium-strong, and take up a lot of command points, but are free in The Battle for Middle-earth. Haradrim are cheap, taking few command points but are weak unless in groups. Trolls are expensive, but take very few command points, making large groups feasible.  Mordor has three siege weapons: catapults for bombarding, rams for demolishing in close proximity, and siege towers for invading from a castle's walls. M\u00famakil are enormous, scary, and destructive to all infantry.Heroes Units Mordor Orc swordsmen  Orc warriors are the backbone of the Mordor army. They are weak, but are well known to be strong in numbers. Though they are not powerful, they are a very useful unit early in a skirmish, for their low cost.Mordor Orc archers  Mordor's basic ranged unitEasterlings  Mordor's only pikemen; effective against heroes, beasts, and cavalry.Haradrim archers  Mordor's elite ranged unitCorsairs of Umbar  A swordsman unit who can switch from swords to ranged fire-bombs.Mordor battering ram  Basic slow siege-unit; not the same as Grond.Mordor catapult  Ranged siege weapon that comes with flaming projectiles.Siege tower  A protective ladder allowing infantry to scale rampart-walls; less dexterous than Isengard's ladder.Attack troll  Unlike the weaker Cave troll, Attack trolls are not only powerful, but have armor, and wield a huge club.Mumakil (the Oliphaunt)  Mumakil are Mordor's most powerful unit. They trample all enemy infantry, and come with archers in their war tower.Grond  Named after the Mace used by Sauron's former lord, Melkor, Grond is the most powerful battering-ram in all of existence. Unfortunately, Grond can only be used during the campaign of The Battle for Middle-earth, and is not available in skirmishes.Buildings  See Category:Mordor structures.Powers  The Mordor faction and the Goblins are the only evil armies capable of summoning Balrogs. For all of the faction's powers, see Category:Mordor Powers.Isengard (faction)  The Isengard faction is comprised of the armies of the evil Wizard Saruman and his allies, the main unit-type being the mighty Uruk-hai orcs whom he bred in the fortress of Isengard.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heroes Gameplay  The legions of Uruk-hai are the strongest infantry units in the game, able to traverse the map quickly. Use this in combination with crossbows and the occasional pikemen and you have a well-balanced army. The Warg Riders are Isengard's answer to cavalry, used to trample enemy archers and flank exposed armies. Use Isengard's great seige weapons to the maximum advantage near the end of the game if things begin to become worrisome. The Explosive Mine unit is a devastating unit that can be used as a trap or can blow a hole in the enemy's defences. All that is needed to set it off is any fire source, from Saruman's fire ball to the berserker's torch ability. In terms of unit quality, the Isengard faction is very similar to the Dwarves, but is geared for more aggressive gameplay and tactics, and are as fast as human and Elven infantry. While the Warg Riders deal the most damage out of all the cavalry units, using their Howl buff or being buffed in the presence of Sharku, their captain. Crossbowmen deal very high ranged damage, but have shorter range than any advanced archers of the other factions, and the Ballista artillery deals the least damage out of all the siege weapons, but its projectile travels the fastest. Most of Isengard's Heroes are geared towards supporting the infantry than being anti-heroes or high-armor army-killers. In The Rise of the Witch-king, the Isengard's elite infantry are the Deathbringers; very powerful hero-horde infantry who have two powerful buffs: Stonewall, which grants god like endurance at the cost of speed, and Death Wish, increasing their attacks massively at the cost of health.Units Buildings  For Isengard's buildings, see Category:Isengard Structures.Powers  For Isengard's powers, see Category:Isengard Powers.Elves  The Elves of Middle-earth's forests have come forth to answer the call to arms against Sauron. With their knowledge of the woods and legendary skills in weaponry, this faction has the highest advantages with stealth, archer upgrades, and natural self-healing. The Elven faction was added in The Battle for Middle-earth II. In the prequel, Elven characters only appear in the campaigns.Lore  See Elves at One Wiki to Rule Them All.Heroes Units  In The Battle for Middle-earth II and its expansion pack (RotWK), the Elven faction also includes Ents and Eagles.Structures  See Category:Elven StructuresFactions  Factions are the teams, or armies, in the BFME games comprised of a certain prominent race or kingdom from the Third Age of Middle-earth. There are Evil and Good factions, but in Skirmishes and War of the Ring mode the player may put any factions against each other, and choose one to play as. All factions playable in the series (cumulatively) are Gondor, Rohan, Men of the West (Gondor and Rohan combined), Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Angmar, Mordor, and Isengard.Factions In\u00a0The Battle for Middle-earth  Good EvilIn\u00a0The Battle for Middle-earth II  Good EvilAdded in The Rise of the Witch-king  Good Arnor (but this faction is not playable) EvilMen of the West  The Men of the West faction in The Battle for Middle-earth II is the combination of Rohan and Gondor units and characters, who together fight the evil of Sauron. This faction has the largest variety of structures, and also of cavalry units.Heroes The Battle for Middle-earth  The first installment in the Battle for Middle-earth game series, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth (here abbreviated BFME 1 or BFME) was a real-time strategy game released in late 2004 by Electronic Arts. Based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien and the films by Peter Jackson, The Battle for Middle-earth took players into the world of The Lord of the Rings in the format of a real-time strategy game. Featured in the game are places, characters, monsters, and other features of Middle-earth as depicted by the film trilogy. A campaign mode takes players through the story of The Lord of the Rings, and Skirmish mode allows the player to battle at any Middle-earth location as a selected army against any faction. This game was preceded after two years by The Battle for Middle-earth II.Story  BFME has two Campaigns: the Good Campaign and Evil Campaign. In the Good Campaign, the player leads the Fellowship of the Ring to Mordor, and also defends Rohan from the forces of Isengard. In the Evil Campaign, the player follows and plays the development of Sauron and Saruman's gradual dominations over the free peoples of Middle-earth. In both Campaigns, the battles as well as some character dialogue imitate scenes from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, such as the onslaughts at Helm's Deep and at Minas Tirith, and the Fellowship's tarrying through Moria.Factions  The factions available in The Battle for Middle-earth are:Good Evil External link Goblins  The vile Goblin-hordes of the Misty Mountains have only recently risen up from the depths of the earth to fight for the Dark Lord Sauron, and with them come a variety of monstrous creatures, and the largest monster-variety of all BFME factions. They are strongest foes with the Dwarves, and like them, the Goblin faction has the least amount of structures among evil factions. The Goblin faction was added in The Battle for Middle-earth II, and along with some forces of Mordor, they are the antagonists of the Good Campaign.Heroes Units Buildings  See Category:Goblin Structures.Powers  See Category:Goblin Powers.Angmar (faction)  Angmar is a fourth evil faction, available only in The Rise of the Witch-king. Their units consist of lesser trolls, evil Men, Orcs from Gundabad, and Wolves. This faction is of the diverse armies of the Witch-king of Angmar, and of his conquests as laid out in the Angmar Campaign. In Middle-earth lore, this faction is therefore older than Isengard and Mordor. The many upgrades of this faction are almost all oriented around magic and ice, since the Witch-king, its lord, dealt in sorcery, and his domain of Angmar has always been a land of snow.Heroes Powers  See Category:Angmar Powers.Structures Units Dwarves  The Dwarves are a good faction added in The Battle for Middle-earth II, who hail primarily from Erebor and the mountains in the northeast of Middle-earth. Their structures tend to be angular and are all made of stone.Heroes Units Buildings Heroes  Heroes are main characters of the Lord of the Rings universe that appear in the Battle for Middle-earth games, for each faction. Heroes have very high health (among other elevated stats), and can fend off many regular units at once. Some very special powers are also given to heroes, which are often connected with the character's role in the stories. Most Heroes are real Lord of the Rings characters that J.R.R. Tolkien came up with such as Glorfindel, Azog, the Mouth of Sauron, King Theoden, and many others. Some heroes (like Gorkil the Goblin King or Berethor) are added by the game makers, though not created by Tolkien. In The Battle for Middle-earth II and its Expansion pack, custom heroes can also be created by the player. Heroes are summoned from the faction's Fortress - and if a hero dies, he/she can be revived and recruited back. The Rise of the Witch-king expansion added \"hero-horde\" units for each faction, which are elite and powerful units just a step down from heroes. See Category:Heroes.Rohan (faction)  Rohan is a strong offensive faction, and is limited to the first BFME game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The grunt of the Rohan army is the peasant , of which only one should be kept for repairing structures. Rohan's backbone is the rohirrim warriors and archers. Elven warriors are very versatile units for Rohan as well. Ents are very powerful and cost few command points. Rohan's main advantage is their heroes. They have Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Theoden, Eomer, Eowyn, and Merry. All these heroes have unique special abilities and powers. If you have an ent moot, Rohan can produce Treebeard. Treebeard is a sniper--hero, for his most powerful attack is his long rock-throw. His health is highest, at 6000 points. Gimli has 3000+ health and can deal a lot of melee damage. \u00a0Legolas is a very powerful archer whose hawk strike is extremely useful early on in the game. Theoden, Eowyn, and Eomer, provide leadership to Rohirrim, and Merry is able to sneak up on lairs. A different tactic on camp maps is to fully upgrade a peasant army, support them with archers and overwhelm your enemy.Units  Rohan Peasants: Trained at the Farm, and repair buildings Rohan Archers: Trained at the Archery Range. They can occupy towers and attack the enemy from there. Rohirrim: Trained at the Stable. These cavalry can use their spears to attack, but mostly just run over their foes. Rohirrim Archers: Trained at the Stable. Use bows to attack, whether running towards or from their targeys, or just run over their foes. Elven warrior: These warriors are from Lothlorien, and appeared at Helm's Deep in the Two Towers film. Ents: The 'catapults' and heavy duty units for Rohan. They throw rocks at enemies, or can melee-attack them. They are very vulnerable to fire arrows.The Rise of the Witch-king  The Battle for Middle-earth II: Rise of the Witch-king is the expansion pack for The Battle for Middle-earth II. In the plot-line of this game, the Witch-king of Angmar creates a kingdom nothing and raises an army from the inhabitants of the north, who are Wolves, Trolls, Orcs, and varying Black N\u00famenoreans; with the purpose of destroying the D\u00fanedain realm of Arnor. Electronic Arts developed and published the game in 2006, after announcing its release at the San Diego Comic-Con of that year. In Skirmish mode, there are now seven playable Factions to choose from with the addition of the Angmar faction.\u00a0 Unlike the two preceding games, The Rise of the Witch-king is compatible only with PC, and not also with Xbox 360.\u00a0New cast Campaign  Main article: Angmar Campaign The campaign of The Rise of the Witch-king is of the story before and during the war that the Witch-king was to wage between Angmar and Arnor, before Sauron returned openly to Mordor. Unlike BFME 2, there is only one Campaign, in which the player plays the conquest of the Witch-king and his faction. The campaign's finale is \"the Epilogue\".Additions to the game Angmar Heroes Units added to existing factions War of the Ring updates Maps  In The Rise of the Witch-king there are a total of sixty-nine regions of Middle-earth that can be battled throughout and explored. For all RotWK maps, see Category:RotWK Maps.External link Regular Units  Regular Units are the infantry used by each faction to fight or accomplish some other goal. Most units travel in organized groups of ten or more, but a few travel alone. Each unit has its own special powers, and most can receive upgrades. They add quite a bit of strategy to the games and can be used in various combinations to ultimately win or lose.Units by Faction  The following is a list of the factions in each game. Click the links to view each faction's regular units. The Battle for Middle-earth The Battle for Middle-earth II BFME II: Rise of the Witch-kingSee also Gondor (faction)  Gondor's role in BFME 1 (it's only in the first BFME) as a defensive faction. Most of Gondor's units were designed for defense (Tower Guards, Soldiers). Their primary offensive units are the knights. Rangers are meant for hit-and-run tactics and archers are best standing on walls with fire arrows.Heroes  Gondor's hero choices are\u00a0more limited\u00a0as the choices are Boromir, Faramir, Gandalf, and Pippin. Pippin is the cheapest, then Faramir, Boromir is after, and Gandalf is the most expensive. Pippin is best for scouting and building outlying farms, and neutralizing light resistance, such as orc warriors. Faramir is a versatile hero who can use a bow or sword. At Rank 3 he can mount a horse as a knight. His leadership ability give his troops an armor bonus. Boromir is a heavy soldier, well equipped to deal with infantry or creatures. His leadership gives his troops an attack bonus. Gandalf \u00a0is a heavy hitter, with abilities that can destroy infantry, creatures, structues, or, at later stages in the game, entire armies.Units  Gondor Soldiers Gondor Archers Gondor Tower Guards Gondor Rangers Gondor Knights TrebuchetsStructures The Witch-king of Angmar  The Witch-king of Angmar is the most powerful of the Nine Ringwraiths. He is playable in all 3 games of the series and is the leader of the Angmar faction in The Rise of the Witch-king, but also is a Hero in the Mordor faction in all three games.

Unfortunately, his health is low and goes down after a many sword strikes or arrows. Along with his health, his defence and offence capabilities are nearly low, making Gollum the most agile hero of the game. However, his speed is a little above average, and his area of sight is rather large, making him the perfect scout early in the game. The best tactic is to summon him early in the game and have him scout around the battlefield, but he loses value after awhile. Health: 350 Damage(melee): 150 Cost: 150Battle for Middle-earth 2  Gollum's role in BFME 2 is larger than in the previous game.\u00a0 He is no longer a playable hero, but runs around the map with the One Ring.\u00a0 If killed, he will drop it, and the units who kill him recieve the ring.\u00a0 The Ring is then used to summon a Ring Hero: Galadriel for the side of Good, and the Dark Lord Sauron for the forces of Evil.\u00a0 He does appear in War of the Ring matches but not on Campaigns.Mouth of Sauron  The Mouth of Sauron was the lieutenant of Barad-dur, the Dark Tower, and is a hero of the Mordor faction\u00a0who rides on a horse. He appears quite frequently in the Evil Campaign of The Battle for Middle-earth II as a leader of the many goblin assaults.Requirements  Recruited from: Mordor Fortress Cost: 1500 Command Points taaken: 50Behind the scenes  The Mouth of Sauron was voiced in the game by Roger Jackson.Campaign  The Campaign is a playable mode in all three Battle for Middle-earth games, in which the player is led through a certain story-line of Middle-earth through a series of missions.BFME  In the original Battle for Middle-earth, the Campaign follows the plot of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. There are mandatory missions, and lands that the player can choose to attack. Unlike the films, Gandalf is able to survive the conflict with the Balrog, \u00a0Boromir his battle with the Uruk-hai, and Theoden his confrontation with the Witch-king at the Pelennor Fields. The Good Campaign follows first the journey of the Fellowship through Moria\u00a0and the war between Isengard and Rohan, with Eomer as the player's primary hero against the orcs of Saruman.\u00a0Following the battles of Helm's Deep and Isengard (both mandatory missions), the War turns to Gondor, where Faramir most often leads the player's troops. All heroes then appear at the Battle of Minas Tirith, after which the player can either end the Campaign by assaulting the Black Gate, or attack other regions controlled by Mordor, such as Rhun or the Dead Marshes. The Evil Campaign opens with the betrayal of Saruman and his War on Rohan. The player must attack and conquer Fangorn to kill all the Ents before assaulting the Fellowship at Amon Hen (as took place at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring film). Once Rohan and all its armies fall, Mordor must secure the loyalty of Evil Men before making war upon Gondor and destroying its cities and soldiers. The campaign ends with the conquest of Minas Tirith, at which all surviving heroes die.BFME II  In BFME II, the player can play and progress in both The Good Campaign and The Evil Campaign. Both campaigns have eight stages, and describe the events that occurred in the North (specifically, a war between the Elves, alongside the Dwarves, and the forces of Goblins and Mordor) during the time of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring in the South.The Good Campaign  The good side of the storyline focuses on Elrond and Gloin's planning and organizing of the War in the North. The game starts out as the hero Glorfindel discovers an attack to be focused on the Elven city of Rivendell. Due to the hero's warning, Elrond is able to rally his army into the Elven sanctuary in prepare for the oncoming Goblin attacks. Elrond is able to destroy and rout the Goblins, for an Elven victory. Following the battle, Elrond discovers that he must join forces with the Dwarves in order to win the raging war. These events spark the beginning of an alliance and a friendship.The Evil Campaign  The evil side of the storyline displays the alternate side of the War in the North. The Dark Lord has assigned The Mouth of Sauron and the Nazgul to rally the Goblins inhabiting the Northern part of the province. The evil lieutenants lead the Goblin army to Lorien, and, despite heavy resistance, destroy the forest. This leads to Gorkil the Goblin King's Goblins and the Evil lieutenants amassing a great goblin army to combat the Good forces in The War in the North.BFME II: The Rise of the Witch-king  In The Rise of the Witch-king, only one campaign is available: that of the conquest of\u00a0Angmar. This tells an entirely new story, where the Witch-king tries to amass an army to conquer the free peoples of Arnor.Powers  Powers are special abilities you gain through use of power-points, in either Skirmish mode or in a Campaign.

If you don't need this box, you can comment it out () or use it for something else!Helping out Costumes  Costumes are special equipment that have a separate equipment slot from your normal armor. By donning a costume, your visual appearance will be overwritten by it. For instance, if you prefer the default look of your character, but want to keep the high defense or modifiers of your current armor, you can don a costume that provides the visual appearance you desire, without hindering your ability to fight. Costumes can be acquired through multiple methods, to include crafting or purchasing them from Andre Janzur, buying them off of the Market, finding them in  Karjalain Boxes,  Eyeglass Boxes and  Andre's Costume Boxes from the Premium Item Merchant, or buying them directly from the Premium Item Merchant.Stock Costumes  These costumes can be crafted with recipes sold by Andre Janzur, found inside  Andre's Costume Boxes (which are all tradeable, which means they can be bought with  Vis from the Market), or bought with Gold from the Premium Item Merchant. All of these costumes can only be used with the five Stock Classes, not UPC Classes.Accessories  Accessories come in a few different forms: Hats, Hair and Glasses. Many have Class, Sex, and even Level restrictions, and none can be worn by Unique Player Characters. Collecting all of these costumes can be very expensive, as many of the items listed can only be found from Bazaar consumables (Andre/Karjalain/Eyeglass Boxes), and the tradable items can carry Market price tags from hundreds of thousands to over a million Vis. Hats: Many of the hats can be bought directly from Andre Janzur with Vis. Others are drops from  Andre's Costume Boxes or rewards from various quests and missions, of which only a few can be traded or sold on the Market. Hair: The hair styles for stock characters are dropped from  Karjalain Boxes, but can be traded amongst players and found on the Market. Glasses: Glasses and Sunglasses are acquired solely from  Eyeglass Boxes, as they cannot be traded amongst players.UPC Costumes  UPC Costumes are bought directly from the Premium Item Merchant using Gold. These costumes can only be worn by a specific UPC, so be sure to pick the right one. They cannot be traded.UPC Accessories  UPC Accessories come in two types: \"Hat\" and \"Facial\". The main difference is that they have their own slots, so two \"Facial\" Accessories cannot be worn at the same time. Accessories can be found inside  Andre's Costume Boxes and  Karjalain Boxes. These items are specific to each UPC and come in various forms. Also, none of them are tradeable.Back Costumes  Back Costumes are unique in that any character can equip them, Stock and UPC. These are often found in  Karjalain Boxes as permanent costume items, but also come in the form of temporary costume items. The temporary back costumes are split into two types: Premium Item costumes (called Blessed) and Crafted costumes, both of which come with special enchantments. The Premium Item costumes can be bought individually from the Premium Item Merchant, or bundled with a special Premium Pack. If you find yourself with spare Permanent costumes, you can turn one into a Crafted costume of the same type, using a recipe bought from the Temporary Costume Merchant. It essentially turns your existing costume into a weaker Blessed version that comes with only one enchantment, but can be made in 7 and 15 day varieties. These recipes are bought with  Vis, not Gold.Costume Collection Chest  The Costume Collection Chest can be found in all major cities, often near the city's Waypoint. This Chest is used to dispose of costumes that cannot be \"Dropped, Traded or Sold\". Using it to destroy costumes comes with a benefit, too. Every costume you put in it will give you one random item, sometimes even an  Andre's Costume Box.List of UPC Quests  Listed on this page are all the quests required to get a certain UPC's  Character Card.Reboldeaux Angie Shirley  To complete Angie's Quests you will need the following Premium Items:Port of Coimbra Gracielo  The Following quests are completed once you have obtained Gracielo, and set him as your party's leader.

Once in the game, there are items (costumes, specifically) you will acquire that can change your appearance, such as hair styles, glasses, hats, armor and full-body costumes that can replace the appearance of your armor with something more desirable, even other armor types. See also: StatisticsStock Player Characters  Stock Player Characters consist of five basic classes that have Female and Male versions, each. Gender is purely visual and mostly has no affect on gameplay. There are a few armor pieces in the game that are only available to one gender or the other, but it's usually costumes that specify. The five classes each fill a unique role in this game:Unique Player Characters  UPCs can be found all over Granado Espada, and can be acquired by performing quests in the game where you receive that character's card. Their abilities can range from being a focused version of a Stock class to a mix of Stock classes, sometimes bringing their own unique Stances to the fight. One thing to keep in mind is that you can only create them once. If you delete the character, it can only be remade by trading with other players for their UPC card. With the exception of Back Costumes, UPCs cannot wear any of the costumes that Stock characters can, as they each have unique costumes specific to them. Also, even though a UPC might be able to wield Sabres or other weapons, they might not have access to all of them. When purchasing equipment for one of your UPCs, it can help to try and find the item on the Marketplace, then select the character intended to use it to see if the item is grayed out for them.List of Fighter Costumes Facial Costumes  Back to CostumesList of UPC Costumes See Also  Back to CostumesAndre's Costume Box Notes  Andre's Costume Boxes are mainly acquired from the Bazaar, but can also be received from the Costume Collection Chest as a gift, bought off of the Market, and found on Friday's Daily Treasure Chest list in the Premium Treasure Chest. In this box you will find either standard costumes or hats for Stock Classes, and hats for UPC Classes.Karjalain Box  After buying them, the Karjalain Boxes will be found in your Premium Item inventory. This item will drop one item on the ground after being used. The items it drops consist of the following: There's a couple of different things you can do with your unwanted costumes. Hair Costumes can be sold on the Market. UPC Accessories and the Cockatrice Hat can only be traded to the Costume Collection Chest, resulting in random goodies. Back Costumes can either be traded to the Costume Collection Chest or turned into a temporary Blessed version by purchasing (with  Vis) a Temporary Costume Recipe. These accessory boxes can be bought from the Premium Item Merchant in quantities of 10 and 20.Contains One Item  Back to CostumesFighter Stances  \u00b9This equipment is optional.Quests  See Also: Quest Walkthrough There are many different kinds of quests and missions throughout Sword of the New World, acquired from NPCs and Monuments throughout the different explorable areas and towns you'll visit during your travels. Note: unlike some MMOs where you have to repeat quests every time you make a new character, in SotNW the storyline quests are NOT repeated.Tutorial Quests  When you first begin playing, you will start off on the Sta Maria, and have the opportunity to take a few tutorial quests. These teach you about a few of the basic mechanics of the game. List of Tutorial QuestsPioneering Quests  These quests form the main storyline of the game, and they stand apart from other quests in that they reward you with, amongst other things, Polishers, which you can in turn exchange for useful equipment with the Pioneering Support Soldiers. This storyline starts off in Reboldeaux's Office of Pioneering Support. List of Pioneering QuestsNPC Quests  Most Quests are acquired from NPCs in towns and they will reward you with EXP Cards, special items and possibly Vis. Quests given by NPCs can normally only be accomplished once on that server, so starting with a new set of characters from the same family will not make it available again. List of NPC QuestsCharacter Card (UPC) Quests  Certain NPCs throughout the world are looking for a family to join. If you complete their quests, they may offer you their Character Card, so that you can add them to your own family. List of UPC QuestsPioneering Monuments  In explorable areas where monsters roam, you'll come across Pioneering Monuments that have quests available to you. These quests are simple, and only require you to kill a specific monster a certain number of times (The game will keep count on screen for you), rewarding you with more EXP Cards when you re-visit the monument. Since you'll find yourself killing plenty of monsters repeatedly, it's fortunate that some of these quests are repeatable.Missions  Missions are special types of Quests that are similar to those given by Pioneering Monuments. By talking to your local town Expeditionary Forces, you can acquire kill quests for unique boss monsters, or just regular monsters (but in greater quantities). The rewards for completing Missions typically consist of Family Reputation points as well as an Amber for the type of monster killed.Mission Lobbies  Mission Lobbies are started by using the Mission Lobby items that randomly drop throughout Granado Espada. These quests are meant to be completed with multiple players; some even require it for completion. The rewards for finishing a Lobby appear as treasure chests upon completion of the objectives.

They are found behind Demon Doors, in Silver Chests and by doing certain tasks. Many legendary weapons are confined to folklore, and are said to have been used by the Kings and great Heroes of the past.Nature of Legendary Weapons  Legendary weapons generally offer Heroes more power, granting their power to those worthy of using them. Filled with the powers of warriors from the past, these weapons of legend and myth are often great additions to any Heroes arsenal. Through special bonding, and mystical powers, the augments of the weapons are stuck within. Obtaining such weapons requires a test of Skill, Strength or wits. While most of these rare weapons are more powerful than weapons bought from blacksmiths, not all Heroes use them for combat. Keeping these relics of history as trophies, some armouries have been known to contain them in a collection. Those who prefer crafting their own weapon to become legend either collect or sell these unique objects. While it is known that these weapons have augmented powers, not a lot is known about the process used by Heroes or blacksmiths to create such permanent bonding. During the time of the Hero of Bowerstone a device is available that can remove augments the Hero puts in weapons, however it is unable to bypass the bonding from legendary weapons. Though the powers of the augments are readily available upon obtaining these weapons in Fable and Fable II, during the time of Fable III their power must be unlocked by the Hero of Brightwall. It is unknown how this change happened, or why, but it furthers the challenge of obtaining fully unlocked weapons.Properties of Legendary Status  To gain the legendary status these weapons follow special guidelines. Following is a list determined by common features, each displayed throughout the games.Trivia See Also Fable: The Balverine Order List of Fable II Weapons  In Fable II, the player can equip both a melee and a ranged weapon, and can use either alternately by pressing the assigned button, allowing them to quickly switch between them during combat. Players cannot, for example, change out one melee weapon for another melee weapon without accessing the game's menu. To further increase their power, players can find and buy augments to any weapon that has an empty augment slot.Children's Series Melee Weapons Ranged Weapons Legendary Weapons Melee Ranged Fable III  Fable III is the third game in the Fable series of games. In 2009, Lionhead Studios, developer of Fable and Fable II, announced that they were planning on continuing the Fable series with Fable III. The game is currently available in North America and Europe and some parts of Asia. Unlike Fable II, it was also released on the PC in May 2011. The PC version comes with the Limited Collector's Edition content included for free, but Understone Quest Pack and Traitor's Keep must be paid for and downloaded separately using Games for Windows LIVE. It is also the first game in the series where the Hero is shown to talk in full sentences.Synopsis  Set 50 years after the events of Fable II, the continent of Albion (where the Fable series is set) is under the control of Logan, a tyrant king and the Hero's older brother. The player's character, the \"Hero\", is forced into a quest to become a revolutionary leader to defeat Logan after he reveals his true personality to the Hero. Over the course of the first half of the game, the Hero will overthrow Logan and become ruler of Albion themselves. During the second half of the game, a strange force from Aurora, called the Darkness will threaten Albion and the player has to decide how to react to it.Gameplay  Players can only migrate the gender of their Hero save file from Fable II, no in-game choices affect Fable III. While the player is attempting to overthrow the current king of Albion, they need to gather support from the people. However, depending on the amount of control the tyrant exerts over a region, initial support can be hard to gather. To encourage citizens to join the revolution, the player must amass 'Guild Seals\" by completing quests, interacting with the people or performing good deeds to gain support and make promises to improve peoples lives when the Hero has the throne. These promises can affect anything from a single individual's life to affecting the entire population or a class group within it. After the player has gained control of the crown, they have the opportunity to carry out or ignore the promises they made that allowed them to achieve their position. As Peter Molyneux, Lionhead's Creative Director, explains: When queried over how the game would work after the player had assumed control of Albion, Molyneux was quick to deny that the game would become a Theme Park-style management game and that Lionhead would not be returning to its roots making strategy games.  A new mechanic, called \"Judgements\" has been implemented so that once the player becomes ruler of Albion, he/she will have assigned duties to perform some of which involve hearing two sides to a subject's proposal, a beneficial one to the people (Also uses money in treasury) by holding the A button or being beneficial to the treasury and unpopular with the people (Sometimes gains money for the crown) by holding the X button. This mechanic is present only through the main storyline. There are rewards for being a self-serving ruler, including a treasury filled with gold piles that grow or diminish based on the player's wealth. If the player chooses to be good, he/she will need to fund the treasury with his or her own money, making it much more difficult to be good than previous games. Expanding on the Judgement mechanic, the hero must also decide on factors of crime, poverty and child labour, though outside the throne room. He/She may also change taxes, guard budget and alcohol laws, changing people's opinions of the crown.  Like the character-morphing that defines the series, where the player's character changes appearance based on his or her actions, growing beautiful or ugly based on good and evil actions respectively, Fable III expands that to location-morphing. For example, if the player removes the limit of alcohol citizens can purchase per day, the amount of intoxicated/drunk people will increase, whereas banning it altogether will prevent citizens from becoming intoxicated altogether. Fable III also removes most conventional menus in favour of the Sanctuary, an interactive pause menu consisting of a set of rooms, each of which replaces the function of a Fable II submenu. Other options now involve holding the A, X, or Y buttons on the Xbox 360 controller to select an option.  The 'Expressions' system has been greatly overhauled, now it is referred to as \"Expression Touch\", in order to form relationships with people, the player must use a random order of expressions, until the NPC asks for the player to do a \"Relationship Quest\" to improve their relationship. This can range from being a courier, retrieving an item or taking the person on a date. The NPC's characteristics will determine how they react to the performed expression. Also new is the \"Dynamic Touch\" system, in which the player can either hold hands with someone or drag them to an objective point; the NPC's reaction is dependant on their opinion of the Hero and the Hero's intent. For example: if a villager hates the player they will not willingly accompany them anywhere. Alternatively, even if the NPC loves the player they will still put up a fight when being led to sacrifice or a forced labour camp. The Hero disciplines formerly known as Strength, Skill and Will\u00a0are not referred to as extensively as in previous Fable titles. In the context of the Road to Rule upgrade system they are known respectively as Melee, Ranged and Magic. In the context of effects on the Hero's appearance, they are known as Strength, Stature and Magical Aura; these are attained over time as opposed to being automatically incurred with upgrades. As seen in the item description of The Channeler, phrases such as 'Will User' have been replaced with 'Spellcaster' in keeping with gameplay.Development  At the beginning of the Gamescon announcement of Fable III, Molyneux stated that the game was taking a different theme compared to the others as he believes the third game in a series to be hard to do correctly. \"If all the rules have been established and all you offer is a new story and a handful of locations, people will start to lose interest.\" In an interview with OXM UK, he spoke about how Fable was at risk of becoming a generic game where the player started off underpowered and weak but slowly got more powerful after they met the bad guy. After the player killed the bad guy, the credits would roll. Believing that is the formula that applies to many games, he asked why games \"end at potentially the most exciting bit?\" It was this that formed the basis of Fable III, where the player can overthrow the tyrant before becoming ruler themselves. He stated that it was when the player was ruler that the consequences of \"who you are going to be, are you going to be good or evil, cruel or kind\" stopped applying only to the player, but affected the entire country. Molyneux hinted that there may be drawbacks to leaving your castle too often to investigate crimes or fight wars, asking \"Are you going to be a king that is the equivalent to Picard in Star Trek? Quite honestly, if the captain of the ship was going down to planets and getting involved in battles I'd be worried because I think he should stay in his chair. But if he chooses to go down and get involved, that's the freedom we give you as a king.\" But this is unfortunately either Molyneux hyping the game as he does usually, or unable to be finished in time for the game, as you cannot investigate crime or fight wars (end of game doesn't count it is obligatory) and neither is there any form of drawback for leaving the castle. Talking about the inspiration for Fable III, Molyneux said \"if in Fable I the inspiration was folklore and in Fable II the inspiration was King Arthur and Robin Hood, then Fable III is definitely the rebels and monarchs \u2013 both modern-day and historic.\"Video Diaries  The first of Lionhead's new season of video diaries, detailing Fable III development, was previously available at http://www.lionhead.com/Diaries/Default.aspxReception  Fable III received generally positive reception on the Xbox 360. IGN gave the Xbox 360 version an 8.5/10, praising the final segment of the game involving your role as king or queen, but criticizing its slow beginning and a lack of innovation. GameSpot gave the game a 7.5/10, saying \"This gorgeous world is brimming with humor and personality\" but felt \"a bevy of technical problems and overly simplified gameplay distract from the fun.\" Official Xbox Magazine said \"Fable III is most memorable not because it makes you laugh, but because it also makes you care. If a spouse gets carved up in your absence, you'll feel pangs of guilt. When your dog saves your bacon during a fight, you'll feel pride.\" The PC version of Fable III received more mixed reviews. IGN gave Fable III (PC) a 6/10, calling it \"a royal disappointment\" with \"interface not well tailored to the PC platform\", \"uneven story and pacing\", \"dull combat\" and \"repetitive quests\". GameSpot gave it a score of 7/10, saying \"It lands on the PC with graphical enhancements and tougher combat\" but criticised the \"simplified gameplay\" which \"still distract from the fun.\" Most negative responses came from the fans who pointed out the bugs that never got fixed in a patch, or that the child of the hero is generated randomly depending on the location of its parents; a design flaw in Fable III where the ethnicity of the biological children does not match that of the player character or its spouse.New Features  Peter Molyneux has confirmed that the game will have many new features, including: At Microsoft's X10 event in San Francisco , Molyneux announced some more new features: At the Game Developer's Conference , Molyneux' focus was on the new GUI in Fable III: The Lionhead Studios team went to E3 2010 to show off Fable III. During the Microsoft Keynote, they revealed a new trailer.

The game became available on Games on Demand (in Xbox Live) for US$19.99 (1600 MS Points) as of April 6th, 2010.Synopsis  Fable II StorylineGameplay Combat  Announced at E3 2007, all melee combat takes place on the X button. All ranged combat runs on the Y button and magic or will abilities on the B button. Flourishes will be shown in a different perspective and time will slow down to show finishing moves. Moves done in melee combat are also dependent on where the player is located. For example, if a player is on top of a tower, pressing the X button may cause the player to throw a certain enemy off of the tower rather than attack with a weapon. Also, in the Xbox 360 edition of the combat with a not yet ready combat engine shows you can use the environment which leads on to different combat reaches. The character can get into a bar fight shown in the combat demo (the first tested engine). There are multiple different weapon types: Clockwork, Turret, and Flintlock Pistols and Rifles, Cleavers, Axes, Longswords, Hammers, Cutlasses, Katanas and Maces. Crossbows were confirmed in the IGN.com video, posted October 9, 2008, showing all the types of weapons. It was been confirmed recently on the Lionhead blogs that the Longbows would not be in Fable II due to the appearance of guns in Albion. Although bows were no longer available, crossbows were upgraded to keep up with the firearms. All spells available in the game have a targeted and area effect version. To target, the player simply points the left thumbstick toward their desired target then releases their spell. Most spells do noticeably higher damage or have a much longer duration when targeted. When higher ranks of spells are learned, they must be charged for a certain amount of time (depending on the rank) before being released.Dog  In Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters, the Hero wandered Albion alone and saving all the people, with help sometimes. But Fable II brings a new ally on the scene, Man's Best Friend. Molyneux announced that the Hero of Fable II shall have a dog to look after, as well as himself. The player will encounter this dog early in the game, and it will stay with the player 'til the end. Every dog in the game will be unique and will morph depending on the alignment of the character. The dog has also been said to alert the player to threats, while not showing the player to the threat itself making for a stealthy kill. It is also replaced the radar seen in the original Fable by telling the player where he/she should be going. It will also attack the enemies that have an advantage over the player; for example, if the hero had a melee weapon drawn, it would attack the enemy with the Ranged weapon, though in reality the dog will only attack enemies that the player has knocked down. In a recent interview and game demonstration, Molyneux showed some of the interactions players can have with their dog, including buying treats, playing fetch and rewarding or punishing their dogs for their behaviour. The dog has been given advanced AI. The dog isn't controllable directly, but the actions of the player will control the dog. If the player goes to attack, the dog will attack as well, if the player starts to run, the dog will run as well. The dog's behavior is context specific, and when in towns, or if the player is injured, the dog will stay closer. If the player goes in a shop, the dog will wait outside the door, and go back to the player when that person walks out. Also, the dog can be trainable by expressions. Molyneux also revealed that if the player does not want a dog, then he/she will have to run away and escape from it (preferably when it is injured), although the dog will track down the player, requiring him or her to run away again. One example given is if the dog is injured and the player leaves and goes to the pub, later there will be a scratching at the door. Someone will open the door for it and observers will react negatively; however, this event isn't able to be recreated. The dog itself can be taught to do tricks using books, raise the level of its fighting abilities and treasure hunting by also reading a book, and even renamed using a collar. Learning the new expressions and teaching the dog to find treasure is as easy as reading a book. These books can be found throughout Albion as treasures, or by buying the books at the Bowerstone Book Shop.Co-op  On July 14th 2008 at E3 2008, lead designer Peter Molyneux demonstrated \"Albion Orbs\". These orbs show where other players are in their respective worlds and allow you to, at the press of a button, bring them into your world to co-op with. The actions of visiting players are permanent in the game, unless the safety feature is activated. Players will be able to give items to visitors. The players' dogs will not accompany them into another player's game. The mode of co-op is somewhat similar to that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game; in that players will be able to drop in and out of other player's games at will. The host player can set certain rules; eg. how loot gained is split between the players and if friendly fire is active or not. The online co-op patch was made available on October 21 at 12:00am for midnight launches. Online co-op is available to anyone who bought the game, has a high speed internet connection and Xbox Live gold membership. While on the same console, a second player with their own account can drop in and out as a \"henchman\" to the first player. If the second player on the same console does not have an account of their own, the henchman is made in a brief create screen that pauses the game. Henchmen created this way are not saved into the main player's game. The first player also decides how much bounty the henchman will obtain, e.g. gold and renown. The second player will also be able to port any experience, renown and gold to their own Fable II game via a memory card if they have imported their character and not created the henchmen from scratch.Family  As in the original Fable, you have the ability to fall in love, and get married. In Fable II, the idea of family has been changed so it fits more in with the theme of emotion. Additionally, same-sex marriage is possible. Children will stay at home, either with the mother or the father while the hero goes out to do heroic deeds. The hero's alignment dictates the child's alignment. To have children, the player must ask his/her spouse to follow to the bed, activate the bed, and select Unprotected Sex. Selecting Protected Sex will keep you from catching STD's or having unwanted children, but the option is only available if you have a condom on your person. Condoms can be bought from general stores found around Albion, and by digging up treasure/leafing through a treasure chest. At the beginning of the game, you will only be able to have one child, which remains a baby until you finish the Spire quest, after which the child will have grown to a nine year old. Any children you have after that will take about an in-game day to mature.Death  Originally, if the hero/heroine had died, the character would remain dead, but a child of theirs would become playable to replace them. This led to playtesters having more children than they ordinarily would have, in an attempt to farm extra lives. Then the thought came along of the player's character not dying upon defeat. Rather, he or she would fall unconscious once he/she loses all of his/her health. The enemies would then injure the character while unconscious by beating, kicking or stabbing which would leave permanent and humiliating scars. Falling unconscious could be avoided with one of three sacrifices: gold, reputation, or experience gained. At the Game Developers Conference in 2008, Molyneux indicated in interviews that the design for death had changed due to player feedback during play testing when it was found that players would rather turn off their console than subject their character to permanent disfigurement. In the new design, upon losing all health, a hero falls and loses a certain amount of experience which is uncollected at the time. This experience is exchanged for a \"burst\" of energy, allowing one last \"Heroic Struggle\" in which the player rises to their feet and knocks all enemies away. This would leave the player momentarily safe from harm, though the Hero will also receive a scar for each time. Resurrection Phials prevent loss of Experience Points upon death, and in so doing, prevent the character from getting scarred. Certain augments can also prevent scarring, or even just make it worse.Alignment  Unlike the original Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters, there are now other alignments apart from good and evil. Lionhead decided to add more choices concerning how you customize your player such as purity, corruption, attractive or scary. These alignments can be changed depending on common factors such as laziness and eating fresh foods from a produce stall.Achievements  See List of Fable II Achievements for the complete list.Features Expressions  Like in Fable, there are many expressions that can be used by the player in order to communicate with other people, including dancing, laughing, taunting, belching, etc. This feature has been improved as shown in E3 2008; the player can use a button to access the expression menu at any time, which is a circular set of buttons that each lead to a different category. In order to find out information about an NPC's attitude toward the hero, you target the NPC using the left trigger, then press the Y button to view their opinion of you. For example, if the player can get an NPC to like you, the NPC will give the player a reward. Similarly, if the player can make an NPC love the player, the NPC may marry the player (If you offer the ring). These scenarios can only be achieved through the use of expressions, sometimes through an extended expression mini-game. Some expressions have been taken to yet a further level of depth. In an interview with Game Informer Magazine, it was revealed that the player can even adjust the duration and tone of belches and farts. A number of expressions including belch, fart, dance, laugh and whistle can be held for longer, using a status bar similar to the one used in jobs, so try and get it inside the bar. Holding an expression increases its effect, but if you fail to finish the expression properly, you will mess up the expression and alter the resulting attitude change of nearby NPCs. One such example is failing a fart, which results in your hero releasing his bowels in his pants, and while performing the belch expression if failed the hero will double over and hold their stomach and mouth, accompanied by the sound of vomiting. After learning them, your dog can also make expressions and these are tied to your own actions. For example after learning \"Hide snout,\" when you fart or belch your dog will bury its nose in the ground, covering it with its paws.Content  According to an IGN preview, Albion will be about ten times the size it was in the previous Fable title. While Molyneux has stated that the player can complete the main story in 12 hours if they rush through it, it would take 100+ hours to complete everything in the game. Molyneux has stated that it will cost about 100 million gold to buy every item in the game.Cutscenes  There are both interactive and a few non-interactive cutscenes in the game. According to Lionhead, the non-interactive cutscenes consume less than five minutes of game time. In the fully interactive cutscenes a player can use their expressions during the dialogue or even run away from the scene, thus skipping it, afterwards the player can return to the cutscene location to start it again. If the player runs away from a cutscene which contained important information, the character will come and find you later on.Dynamic World  The world in Fable II is fully dynamic, interactive and free roaming with no set quest path to take and includes all 4 seasons. Since the game will take place over a hero's lifetime, many things will change; Molyneux gave an example of a trade camp that the player could either help or destroy. Trading in such camps would increase their profit, resulting in a small town growing around them, while stealing from the camp or massacring the camp will result in the abandonment of the area. Additionally, every accessible property in the world can be purchased, and ownership often unlocks further quests. When stores, or property is owned you will earn Gold every 5 minutes of play time. Players can furnish the houses with furniture and other items available for sale. In addition, titles will be awarded for buying property; if one were to buy every building and piece of land in a town he may become the mayor of that town; owning more land leads to higher titles such as king of the entire land of Albion. The environment in Fable II will feature trees with branches and leaves that are individually animated according to their own physics, each tree having roughly 120,000 leaves. There are also around 15 million poppies in Albion. Peter Molyneux also has revealed the \"bread crumb\" trail, a feature that shows glowing sparkles in a line in front of you to guide you back to the main story line. Molyneux also said players are free to turn off this feature at any time and venture on their own path to that quest, or just completely ignore the quest and explore more of Albion or partake in a side quest. In Fable II Pub Games, an unlockable concept art shows a map of a coastline unlike the one from the original game. Whether this is a new area or a revamp of the original is unknown.Pre-release Marketing Tales of Albion  Lionhead Studios released a section on their website entitled \"Tales of Albion\", which provides a back-story to Fable, Fable: The Lost Chapters, and Fable II. In \"Fragments of the Old Kingdom\", it details how the Archon came to power in Albion, and how the Heroes' Guild was founded. \"Tales\" also chronicles the ruin of the Guild in \"Fall of the Heroes\", and will describe Albion in Fable II with \"Travels in Today's Albion\".Online Competitions  Just as Lionhead has done with The Movies, online competitions were made available through Lionhead's forums. One such competition was naming a title to be used in the game, similar to the first game wherein a character was addressed by various titles that the character purchased from a \"Title Vendor\" Lionhead has stated these titles will be bought but they have to be earned first. They are bought from a town crier in Fable II; the winning title was Lionheart. On May 30th, Lionhead held a competition for artwork that would be used in the game.Video Diaries  -- On May 24, 2007, Episode One of The Lionhead Diaries, examining the love and emotion aspect of Fable II was released. -- On July 30, 2007, Episode Two was released, highlighting the one-button combat system, and featured the Lionhead staff playing a game of football against fellow Microsoft satellite Rare and winning. It also included a professional combat specialist instructing the animation staff. -- On October 8th, 2007, Episode Three was released, going in depth about the Central Technology Group, and featured Lionhead's 10 year Anniversary. -- On January 11th, 2008, Episode Four was released, focusing on how the graphics department made the world of Albion. -- On March 18th, 2008, Episode Five was released, looking at magic, GDC 2008 and co-op. -- On June 24th, 2008, Episode Six \"Art and the Hero\" was released. -- On October 2nd, 2008, Episode Seven \"Music and Audio\" was released. -- On January 8th, 2009, Episode Eight \"Finishing Fable II & Creating Knothole Island\" was released. -- In May of 2009, Episode Nine \"See The Future\" was released.Technology  The graphics engine is written in-house, but middleware is integrated for several other parts of the game: Havok is used for a physics engine and Kynapse is used for some AI. Alienbrain 8 is used to track assets such as 3D Models, files, and art.Collector's Edition  A Collector's Edition was also released, and included a bonus DVD with videos (including a Making-of feature) and concept art, a redemption card allowing the download of exclusive in-game content, and an XBox LIVE trial membership (also a redemption card). The in-game content is referred to as the \"Otherworldly Content\" package, and includes \"The Wreckager\" (a Legendary Cutlass weapon), the \"Hall of the Dead\" (a dungeon) and items modeled on the Spartan Armour and Energy Sword used by the character Master Chief in Halo. Originally the Collector's Edition was to be packaged in a premium box and include physical items: a collectible Hobbe figure and five different fate cards. These items were cancelled and never released.Game of the Year Edition  A newer version of Fable II called Game of the Year Edition was released in 2009. This was released after both the Knothole Island and See The Future DLCs came out, and has them both fully downloaded onto the disc - so there is no need to buy the features from Xbox Live. The game of the year edition featured a green tint to the cover art and can also be found with the usual red tint to the game cover art. The easiest way to identify the copy you are buying is the game of the year edition and not the regular version of the game is to look for the game of the year sticker in the top right corner of the cover art which reads \"Extra Content! More Quests, More Locations, More Choices!\".Awards See Also Character Downloadable Content World External links Fable II  This is a list of articles related to Fable II.Reaver  Reaver is an ex-pirate turned business man, factory owner, and the Hero of Skill.History\u00a0  Reaver was originally born in Oakvale and is well known in Albion for being an excellent marksman. It is said that he would capture ships by shooting the captain from across the water no matter the distance or conditions. The more impossible the shot was, the faster the crew would surrender. When leading the Hero of Bowerstone through the tunnels of his home, in Bloodstone, he tells the player how much he loves a good 'scrap', exemplifying his willingness to fight and competence in battle. He is blessed with eternal youth and often remarks on periods of time which he has lived in. His immortality comes from a deal he made with the Shadow Judges in the Shadow Court. They sustained his youth at the cost of other peoples' through an annual ritual. Reaver's diary (which is found in separate entries throughout his \"coastal paradise\" in Fable II once the player has bought the house) states that this deal also caused the destruction of his own hometown of Oakvale, though he was unaware that this would be the Shadow Court's price. An entry in his diary implies he had a close relationship with a woman who was killed in the fire.\u00a0 \"Then I see him running madly through fields, the realization of just what price he has unwittingly paid hanging like a tragedy mask from his face. He falls to his knees before the town he called home-- now a dark circus of screams. Hers is among them, but he can do nothing to stop it.Fable: Reaver  Captain Dread, the most feared of all\u00a0pirates in Albion, has come to an agreement with all other pirates that haunt the nine seas of Albion-they give him a cut of the profits, and he doesn't raid their ports of call. This arrangement, however, is utterly discarded by the young pirate Reaver of Bloodstone, who rebels against this policy by killing all of Captain Dread's envoys and sending their heads to the pirate king in a duffel bag. Outraged, the pirate king calls for a bounty on Reaver, only to be astounded when Reaver surrenders himself to Captain Dread. While imprisoned by Captain Dread, Reaver kills Albion's most feared pirate by shooting an oil lantern next to him, which spilled onto his head and gave him a slow and painful death. With Captain Dread killed, Reaver obtains the title of \"Pirate King\".Fable II  After the Hero of Bowerstone recovered Garth, they sought Reaver to complete the Hero Triumverate that would defeat Lucien Fairfax, knowing him to be the Hero of Skill. Upon meeting the Hero of Bowerstone, Reaver demands that the Hero have a certain amount of renown before even considering an alliance. When the Hero returns, Reaver gives them a Dark Seal and sends them to the Shadow Court, with the sole intent of using the Hero's vitality as a sacrifice to the Shadow Court to keep Reaver young. This would also serve to weaken them for transport to Lucien for the sizeable bounty that the lord placed on the Hero. Whether or not the Hero actually sacrifices their youth or sacrifices that of another potential victim, Elizabeth, is up to the player. Regardless of the choice made, Reaver is forced to abandon his plans when Lucien instead decides to claim the Hero of Bowerstone and the Hero of Skill by force, invading Bloodstone with an army of Shards and storming the town with Spire Guards. Forced into a temporary alliance of necessity, Reaver takes the Hero of Bowerstone through Reaver's Rear Passage, demonstrating his proficiency with firearms along the way. Once the duo join Garth and Hammer on Smuggler's Beach, they are beset by a Great Shard, which they destroy. Realizing that Lucien will hunt him down too, Reaver reluctantly joins the trio for the ritual at Hero Hill to summon the weapon capable of destroying Lucien when they are ambushed. Taken to the Spire by Lucien, Reaver is rescued by the Hero of Bowerstone, who confronts the power-hungry lord. Should the Hero of Bowerstone listen to Lucien's monologue in its entirety, Reaver will shoot Lucien for them, depriving them of the vengeance they sought for decades. At the end of the main quest, Reaver travels to Garth's homeland of Samarkand, citing \"exotic substances\" and \"uninhibited people\" as his reasons. The fate of his smuggling operation (and its members) in Bloodstone is never revealed. In the legendary book \"Reaver on Reaver\", an autobiography, Reaver reveals that after Theresa transported he and Garth to Samarkand after Lucien's fall, Reaver indicates that he became disappointed in the place and eventually that he was responsible for Garth's death during his last night in a tavern there which lead to his departure. However, the book ends before he explains what happened or if he was successful in killing Garth. Based on the description of The Channeler Sword, it's possible that Garth survived the attack. In Fable: Edge of the World, it is confirmed that although Reaver had boasted in the book that he had killed Garth, his target had indeed survived.Fable III  In Fable III, Reaver has returned from Samarkand and settled into a new manor in Millfields. With the rise of the Industrial age and with loose laws regarding employee treatment, Reaver has found an outlet for his greedy nature. Under the rule of King Logan, Reaver was granted control of the more benevolent industries of Professor Ernest Faraday when the professor refused to deliver his mechanical army to the monarch. Due to his profitable business tactics, including introducing child labour and cutting 100% of the employees' wages, Reaver became one of Logan's most powerful allies. Reaver runs the majority of Bowerstone Industrial, and is seen there when the Hero and Walter first arrive in the city. He quells a small strike from his workers at his main factory by shooting their leader four times, and explaining that any worker who rests longer than three seconds, whines, or breaks any other rule he may make up in the future, will be shot. Page and the Hero of Brightwall attempt to infiltrate Reaver's mansion during a ball to rescue several captured followers, only to find themselves in a trap. Reaver has them locked in an arena and sent into neighbouring arenas to fight various enemies for the amusement of his guests, deciding on the enemy by using a device called the Wheel of Misfortune. After facing four rounds, the Wheel chooses Balverines, at which point most of Reaver's guests are revealed to be Balverines in disguise and have some sort of bargain with Reaver which he announces, after they attack the Hero and Page, that they are \"even\". After killing the Balverines, Page attempts to shoot Reaver, who, with unnatural ease, deflects the bullet with his cane. Page then mentions that her companion is the Prince/Princess, in which Reaver says he will \"look forward\" to collaborating with the Hero, if he/she is successful in overthrowing his/her brother and begins to walk out. Page makes another attempt to kill him, only for her bullet to hit the door,\u00a0as he makes his way out and escapes from Bowerstone. With his absence, Page and the Hero were allowed to rescue Kidd, the only survivor. If you purchased the Understone Quest Pack, the Hero is able to re-enter Reaver's Arena. There will now be two sets of megaphones on either side of the Wheel as well as a score board to the right. You then hear Hatch's voice coming from the speakers rambling about nothing, at which point Reaver berates him saying that they are recording. Reaver continues, saying that he has opened his Wheel to the public as a way to earn money without being required to be there. {C}   In the second half of the game, after deposing Logan and the Hero's Coronation, Reaver acts as an advocate for the more corrupt sides of decisions you make. However, should you choose the moral path and reject his proposal, he will begrudgingly agree with you, admitting that the path you have chosen may be a useful one. It is unknown whether he actually believes this or is merely agreeing with you due to your position of power. Corrupt decisions proposed by Reaver can not be undone or converted in any way once you accept his proposal. Whatever decision you make, Reaver takes part in it, meaning he likely profits financially either way. If you decide to help restore Albion to its former glory or not, Reaver shows the player the results of their choices as if he is narrating a commercial. After the battle for Albion at the end of the game, Reaver leaves you a letter in the War Room. In this letter he states he enjoyed collaborating with the hero in the throne room in his/her trials and hopes he will host future trials. He then says he hopes you did well in the battle and that he would not like to come back to a dead city. He states that he had to leave for an important, but wearying, errand, saying perhaps he will explain it in better detail someday. Players of the second game will know that he is off to make his sacrifice to the Shadow Court. You may receive a unique sword called the The Inquisitor, if you pre-ordered from Gamestop, that has a history linked to Reaver. Recently it has been made available for download along with other pre-order exclusive items and quests.Fable: Blood Ties  Reaver is featured in the novel Fable: Blood Ties, which follows the adventures of Ben Finn after the events of Fable III. Reaver serves as the book's primary antagonist after it is revealed that he is responsible for the creation of the monstrous Half-breeds assailing Ben and the beleaguered citizens of the village of Blackholm, at the behest of the warlord Droogan. When Ben learns that the leader of the half-breeds is none other than his long-lost brother William, Reaver's slave, he implores Reaver to cure his brother and set him free. Reaver readily agrees, on one condition: Ben must kill the meddlesome Page. Desperate to free William, Ben initially agrees and lures Page away from Bowerstone, but when he cannot bring himself to kill her, the half-breeds arrive and kidnap Page. Ben gives chase, but is likewise captured by Reaver, who intends to force the pair to fight the half-breeds in his personal combat arena before an audience. However, before this can occur, Ben's gnome companion destroys Reaver's means of controlling the monsters, which promptly kill their guards, escape, and charge towards Blackholm. Not the least bit disconcerted, Reaver leaves Ben and Page to deal with the rampaging horde while he invites his disappointed guests to stay for hot cocoa.Fable: Edge of the World  Reaver returns once again in the latest Fable novel, Fable: Edge of the World. He serves as an anti-hero, as always, but later assumes a purely antagonistic role. Ten years after the defeat of the Crawler, Reaver returns to Bowerstone while the mighty Hero King leads an expedition to Samarkand to defeat the resurgent Darkness. Coming upon a distraught Queen Laylah, Reaver comforts her, learning that she feels abused by the misgivings of her military advisor, Jack Timmins, and betrayed by Page, who continues to support his view. Pointing out that her husband's concessions to his policies helped save Albion from the Crawler, Reaver proposes to help Laylah in any way he can, reasoning that while he stands to make a profit from aiding Laylah, his financial and military support would secure Albion and ensure a swift return for her husband. Gripped by depression at the loss of her husband and relieved at Reaver's open honesty, Laylah agrees, further admitting that she could use Reaver to counter the influence of Timmins. Managing to get in the queen's good graces through his honesty and his supposed compassion, Reaver manipulates Laylah into ignoring her other advisors and passing new laws, including the cessation of trade with Aurora, a nightly curfew, and the expansion of Reaver Industries. Eventually, he frames her other advisors with a series of expertly forged documents that claim the frustrated Timmins and her ally, Page, sought to overthrow the queen. Once the duo are thrown in prison, Reaver makes his next move, quickly usurping the queen herself by bribing some of her staff while convincing everyone else that Laylah is still in charge. He even goes so far as to gain control of the Sanctuary, arriving there by exploiting the heroic blood that flows through him. With this ruse, he goes about imposing his own laws and shaping Albion as he sees fit.Personality  Reaver has been described as being \"amoral,\" bearing no concept whatsoever of morality. He is narcissistic, egotistical, and displays a near psychopathic disregard for life, which netted for him considerable profits during the Age of Industry. By cutting wages by 100% and by extending worker hours in utterly unsafe conditions and casually executing those who resisted his rules, Reaver became Logan's greatest asset. Reaver is known in Albion for his debauchery and sexual impropriety. This is shown through his taking of several lovers of both sexes at the same time (when in the smugglers' caves below his house, he admits to three: Ursula, Penelope, and Andrew). One of his diary pages in Fable II mentions his crowded bedroom and the presence of bedfellows, insinuating he hosts orgies at his mansion. He offers the Hero of Brightwall and Page a chance to join him in the bedroom at his new manor in Fable III, further illustrating his utter lack of respect for even royalty. This new manor, located in Millfields, is shown to have a secret bedchamber that appears to be a pleasure chamber, filled with sadomasochist apparatus. Reaver's promiscuity is used to highlight his hedonistic, pleasure-seeking, self-indulgent lifestyle and his overall lack of concern for others or their sufferings. This is best described by Reaver's voice actor, Stephen Fry, by saying about the character in an interview 'I wouldn't describe as immoral, more ammoral, he dosen't even have a concept of morality'. In Fable II, Theresa tells the Hero of Bowerstone that the man who brought about the destruction of Oakvale did not know the Shadow Court's price and lost his friends, family and everyone he loved in its obliteration. This event, and the possibility that Reaver once had a soft side, are hinted at in the fifth entry of his diary which explained he did not know that the Shadow Court would kill the citizens of Oakvale. In this entry, he also states that he had a lover in Oakvale, lamenting 'her' death; the diary entry starts with him explaining about a recurring nightmare about these past events. At the end of this entry, he describes himself as a different man, saying that the man he was was a fearful, breakable man. His final words in this entry were, \"I am not he... I am Reaver. And I will sleep much better after this chalice of wine.\" This suggests he has changed his identity and even personality to deal with the pain of his past. It is unknown whether Reaver is his real name or a self-given moniker. He also has both a limited amount of patience and a vain disposition about his appearance: He shot both a sculptor and a painter for supposedly getting his statue and painting wrong, and finally shooting Barnum because the picture he took, while a perfect likeness, would take three months to develop. Reaver is shown to be somewhat flamboyant and eccentric. His mansions, full of portraits of himself, are richly decorated in accents of black, burgundy and Reaver Industry logos (Fable III). Both his voice and handwriting are flourished and exaggerated. He is usually portrayed with a smug smirk on his face and wears an elaborate fur-lined suit and high top hat in Fable III. Through his narcissism, his ego-maniacal nature, and his utter lack of respect for others, Reaver never shows any true signs of antagonism to even those who would consider themselves his enemies, viewing their attempts to foil him as almost amusing. This might be from how, due to being near-immortal, that most inconveniences to him are minor in the grand scheme of things, and anyone who goes up against him, he knows that he'll out live eventually. This is best displayed in his attitude towards Page, who he regards as a playful rival of sorts rather than a true enemy. This can also be displayed in his relation with the Hero of Brightwall, who he addresses with a friendly candor even if they refused all his suggestions. He also adds that he enjoyed working with the monarch, and looked forward to doing so again. Throughout different parts of Fable, he is at times portrayed as neutral, the villain, or the anti-hero. Whatever role he assumes, his actions, decisions and alliances seem solely motivated by want of personal gain, entertainment or his survival. He seems genuinely unphased and unconcerned about turns of events, merely making sarcastic remarks or moving on when his plans do not succeed.Combat  Reaver has a considerable competence in battle, likely due to his status as the Hero of Skill. His height in Fable III exemplifies his skills and Hero status. In combat, Reaver often stands in one place slowly firing his gun. He supposedly hits every shot, though he does not kill with each one. When an enemy gets too close, or strikes him with a melee blow, he will draw his cutlass, striking at the same time and performing a flourish attack, performing an instant kill. While Reaver's damage per second output with his Dragonstomper .48 appears low, nearing Smuggler's Beach, he demonstrates the ability to fire several shots in very rapid succession, scoring a head shot and a kill on many enemies within a very short time. He remarks \"You can tell them [your grandchildren] about that, too. Not that they'll believe you...\" Amusingly, if you go up ahead, you can use a ranged weapon to kill all the enemies in succession (indicating that it was a scripted event) and Reaver will start his dialogue, pause, and then continue talking as if he had killed them all. Reaver's Combat Skill doesn't seem to diminish with his age, 50 years after helping to topple Lord Lucien, when Page shot at him from close range, he was able to casually deflect it with his cane, and also is able of precisely shoot a man in a crowd protesting his cruel work methods, in areas that would not be fatal, several times. Despite this display of skill, Reaver seems to rarely enter combat in Fable 3, often relying more on others to fight for him, mostly for his entertainment in his Wheel of Misfortune, whether this is due to him gotten used to a more secluded and industrial life, or because he has gotten bored with combat being too easy for him is not revealed.Fable Heroes  In the Xbox LIVE Arcade title, Fable Heroes, Reaver makes an appearance as a playable character. He is one of the characters unlocked by default, the other three are: Garth, Hero, and Hammer. Reaver's weapon of choice is his trusty Dragonstomper .48, though it looks more like a Toy Gun than the formidable pistol in Fable II and Fable III. On the Hero Tile of the Abilities Board, Reaver can unlock the character Ben Finn for the price of 15,000 gold.Bugs/Glitches Trivia See Also List of Demon Doors (Fable II)  Demon Doors, as with Fable, The Lost Chapters and Fable III, play no prominent role in this game, due to the fact that no Demon Doors are necessary for Quests. They more or less serve as sub-quests, usually requiring you to perform a small task, collect a certain item and/or perform a certain expression. In Fable II, there are a total of 9 different Demon Doors.Winter Lodge The Arid Sea Forgotten Keep The Sepulchre  If for some reason one of these combinations doesn't work keep tapping the A button in front of the door to reset.Homestead Memory Lane The Vault Terry Cotter's Army  If there are still enemies attacking you at Brightwood Tower, but you've already gone through the marsh, get your entourage together. To be safe you will need probably need a level 4 or 5 raise dead spell. Then fast travel to Wraithmarsh: Drowned Farm and summon up your dead army. There are only couple of enemies here vs. the 10 or more that are at Brightwood Tower. The dead army will keep them busy so you can just run straight to the demon door with all your people safe and sound. Then the little scene will begin and you will have access to your reward.Notes Forest Sanctum  A small fun-fact: Even when the door is open, you can still hear it yawn when you get close to it when in the foyer of Fairfax Castle. When you unlock the demon door you might be able to go to a secret spot behind it.Jack of Blades  Jack of Blades is the main antagonist of Fable, Fable: The Lost Chapters and Fable Anniversary. According to the Snowspire Oracle, Jack was already ancient by the time humans came into existence, and appeared in the unnamed world from the Void with the Court. He used his Mask to take over host bodies and thus live forever. Whilst in his humanoid form, he was never seen without the Mask, nor his original body ever shown. He is a master of strength, skill and will.History  Later in the future, when William Black was consulting a tome, Jack transported William from Albion to the Void. Jack tried to enslave William with an ornate sword, however William managed to fight back and escaped, and at the same time managed to steal the sword from Jack, which was later discovered to be The Sword of Aeons. Their second meeting consisted of yet another battle. William Black managed to break Jack's body, destroying his form for a time. However, Jack's soul was believed to have escaped and possibly took refuge in his Mask.Appearance  In his human form, Jack of blades is a tall, lean man with an average build. His attire consists of hooded robe, crimson in colour, the robe only covers up to his pectoral muscles and is held together by a golden brochure, in the shape of a hexagon that has five red gems, four of them are small, and the fifth one is larger than the others. The robe also covers both of his arms, except the hands which is covered by grey gauntlets. The rest of his body; the chest, legs and boots is covered by a silverish-grey armour, that features small spiked protrusions. His most noticable feature are the masks. On his face, Jack wears a white mask with red and gold decorations at the top of it, On his stomach area, two more masks are situated there. The second\u00a0mask is more wider and seems angry-looking\u00a0with red and purple around the left side of the eye. The third\u00a0mask is thinner than the second, but is taller, and features red stripes around the right eye. Jack has blazing red eyes and grey hair. In his Dragon form, Jack is a colossal Dragon, and has an entire body covered in a darkish-brown colour. Jack is scaly around his head and his back. His back is covered in black scales, and features red and black fins along it.\u00a0Jack's eyes are completely red and his head features two, V-shaped horns on the sides of his head extending backwards, as well as two large black horns that slightly curve upwards. Jack's mouth is full of razor-sharp teeth, that seem to spill out of his mouth even when it is closed. His wings are vast and titanic, the insides are slightly torn at the end and are a dark crimson colour with stocky, grey, vein-like lines, the outside of the wings are covered in a striped red and black, shell-like armour with black spikes around it curving backwards, and the insides of the wings have some of the\u00a0shell-like armour situated in it that extend out of the range of the torn-area of the wings. Jack also has four legs\u00a0with the front\u00a0legs\u00a0being smaller than his back legs, and having prolonged grey toenails and his fingernails being\u00a0shorter, but still extensive, white in colour and take a diamond-like shape but the top part is longer than the rest.Fable  After the last fight in the Doubles Round at the Arena, Jack of Blades announced to the crowd that he is back, and that the Arena was a perfect place to reintroduce himself to Albion after \"spending an eternity\" away from them all. He then tells the Hero of Oakvale to fight Whisper. If you kill Whisper, Jack will give the Hero an extra 10,000 gold. Jack confronts the Hero as he is staring up at a statue of his mother in the Hall of Heroes. Jack tells The Hero that he knows where his mother is, and gives some other information before departing. The next time the Hero encounters Jack is when he tries to break Scarlet Robe out of Bargate Prison, though he stops the Hero, imprisoning him for one year. The Hero meets him again when he hears of his plan to take over Albion. Despite all efforts, the Hero fails to prevent him from activating the Focus Sites. The Hero eventually fights Jack after he kills Scarlet Robe, in which he implies to not only have killed his mother, but also his father. When the Hero defeats him, he makes the decision to either kill his sister, Theresa, and keep the Sword of Aeons for himself, or spare Theresa and throw the sword into the black abyss from which it was summoned. In Fable, the Hero is then given his Mask as a trophy, though in Fable: The Lost Chapters, it is made a quest item.Fable: The Lost Chapters  After Jack's defeat in his humanoid form, Briar Rose informs the Hero and Guildmaster that the Demon Door outside the Guild has awoken after centuries being dormant. Using the Mask to satisfy the Demon Door and thus enter it, he discovers the Prophets of the Fire Heart. Later, Jack takes the form of a dragon. After defeating him once more, the Hero will have the option of either throwing the Mask into the lava and ridding the world of Jack forever, or will eventually give in to temptation, and put on the Mask, essentially becoming Jack's new vessel. Upon donning the Mask, Jack takes over his body before raising his arms triumphantly and declaring in Jack's voice, \"I told you I could not be killed so easily, Hero!\", before laughing manically. If you choose to wear the mask, and do not skip the credits, then afterward you appear outside of the Archons Folly with horns, wearing Jack of Blades' mask.Fable: Jack of Blades  In the e-book, Fable: Jack of Blades, it first appears that Jack is ruling over the people of Oddwood\u00a0aided by his bandit allies to keep \"order\". However, at the end, Jack is revealed to be a bandit by the name of Fred. It is rumoured that Xiro, the hero of the story, is actually Jack of Blades in disguise.Trivia Fable/Fable: The Lost Chapters/Fable Anniversary Fable II Fable III Fable Heroes Fable: The Journey See Also Hero of Bowerstone  The Hero of Bower Lake (commonly referred to as the Hero of Bowerstone in the Fable community, and also known as Sparrow, the Hero of the Spire, the Old Hero King/Queen, and many other titles within the game universe) is the main protagonist in Fable II. The character may be either male or female, by choice of the player at the beginning of the game. The Hero is a descendant of the Hero of Oakvale; this is most commonly accepted, as Theresa states that the Hero of Oakvale was the Hero of Bower Lake's \"forebear\". This is also proven in the book \"The Hero of Oakvale\", which speaks of the Hero of Oakvale having a descendant who shall one day save Albion. There is more reason to believe this, with the addition of access to the treasure chest of the Hero of Southcliff in the Chamber of Fate. Out-of-game lore suggests that only the descendants of the Hero can open the chest. In the beginning of the game, the Hero of Bower lake is called \"Sparrow\" which, in the game, appears synonymous with being youthful, and prepared to set out to see the world. However, it is also possible that \"Sparrow\" is their real name, as opposed to \"Chicken Chaser\" or any other of the titles available for renaming. The Hero is more often referred to \"Sparrow\", including in certain cutscenes, despite their current title. If one keeps the title of \"Sparrow\" later in the game, villagers mock its childishness (\"sparrow\", or \"little sparrow\", is also a term of endearment, similar to \"honey\" or \"dear\", and is generally used with children, so it is also very possible that this is the case here). The Hero of Bower Lake had a sister, Rose, who was killed by Lucien Fairfax. Theresa acts as a guardian from the moment Lucien shoots the Hero until they reach adolescence, in which they begin to explore the world.Biography Childhood  As a child, Sparrow lives in Bowerstone Old Town with their sister, Rose, in poverty after the unexplained death of their parents, dreaming of living in Fairfax Castle. One day, they are disturbed by a loud commotion from the trader Mystical Murgo, who is selling many items of no real value, including a magical mirror that \"only works in complete darkness,\" as artifacts of the Old Kingdom. However, amongst his collection of trash, he has a true artifact, given to him by Theresa (however, the player won't find this out unless they download See the Future): An old music box with incredible power, which allows one wish. Rose is hesitant to believe this at first, voices her opinions to her sibling, and an eavesdropping Theresa who, after a few brief words, convinces the children to gather the five gold coins needed to buy the box. While searching for the coins, Sparrow and Rose encounter other villagers, save a dog from abuse by a bully, and collect some warrants for a guard, which can either be returned to him or be sold to a local crook (this decision later changes Bowerstone for better or for worse). Regardless of the decisions made, Sparrow and Rose gather the five gold coins by posing for a picture, finding a bottle of wine, exploring a warehouse, delivering a letter, and returning the warrants. They then purchase the box. After taking it to an overlook, they make a wish to live in the castle, only to find the box vanishes from sight. An angry and disappointed Rose takes Sparrow back to their home; to their surprise, they find the dog from earlier resting at the front of the ramshackle structure. They both proceed to go to sleep. Later, Rose is awakened by the dog barking at several guards who have been sent to retrieve them by Lord Lucien Fairfax. Rose awakens Sparrow, and they head off with the guards to Fairfax Castle. Once inside, they are greeted by the castle butler, who instructs them on proper behaviour in the castle as they are shown to Lucien's study. On the way, they are passed by Garth, an Old Kingdom scholar and \"man of few words\". Inside the study, Lucien is poring over old books, scrolls, and papers related to the Old Kingdom. He is curious about the box that they purchased, and asks Rose and Sparrow to step into a runic circle, which reacts to their presence. He reveals that one of the children is the \"Fourth Hero\" who has the ability to destroy all of his plans, as opposed to one of the three that he needs. Lucien draws a pistol and shoots Rose, killing her. After apologizing for what he \"must do\", he shoots Sparrow, who is knocked out of the window. After falling several stories, Sparrow lands on the cold winter ground. The dog and Theresa find Sparrow, and take them\u00a0out of Bowerstone to the Gypsy Camp near Bower Lake.Youth to Adulthood  Theresa tends to Sparrow's wounds. After Sparrow slowly recovers, it is said that they\u00a0trained to become a fighter and warrior for over ten years until the day they are\u00a0ready to leave the Gypsy Camp, at which point the Hero of Bower Lake heads into the Guild Cave for a final bit of training. Theresa sends the Hero into the cave, which is actually the destroyed Heroes' Guild. After fighting some beetles, the Hero unlocks their magical Will powers and learns how to update their abilities. Soon afterwards, the Hero starts their journey, but before they can enter Bowerstone, they are told that the bandit Thag needs to be taken care of, so the Hero goes and kills Thag. Theresa turns up in the market and tells the Hero about the Tattered Spire and what Lucien is trying to do with it. The Hero is told the story of the Tattered Spire by Theresa, who then hands over some fate cards, each one telling the Hero about one of the other Heroes they must get to before Lucien. Theresa tells the Hero that Oakfield is the best place to start, so now the Hero officially starts their quest. The Hero ventures through Rookridge and gets into a few fights with bandits.The Hero Of Strength  The Hero meets a man who has lost his son to hobbes. The Hero either kills the man and continues towards the cave to Oakfield, or takes the man along and tries to help him find his son. As the Hero enters the cave, they discover that it is filled with many hobbes, but eventually they make it through. The man finds out that his son has been turned into one of the hobbes. After the Hero kills the hobbe child, his father breaks down and cries that all the stories about children becoming hobbes were true; he loses the will to live and falls to the ground. The Hero escapes and heads off to Oakfield. There, they find the Abbot of the Temple of Light who is looking for a bodyguard for one of his monks. He believes that the Hero would make a good bodyguard, but he still needs more proof (though, you could already be well-known and start this quest straight away) and tells the Hero to get more renown. The Hero then heads off to the local pub, the Sandgoose, where they meet Barnum, from whom the Hero earned a piece of gold from his picture taking business when they were a child. It is discovered that Barnum had bought a bridge in Rookridge and was planning to charge a toll for it, but it was then overtaken and destroyed by bandits. The Hero's quest is to rid Rookridge of the bandits. After making their way through Rookridge, the Hero easily cleans the bandits out and kills Dash. The Hero then heads back to Barnum and, with their renown now high enough, to undertake what is likely to be their first real quest. The Abbot reveals that the other monk is none other than his own daughter, Hannah. The Hero meets Hannah, who is known by her nickname \"Hammer\", and Theresa says that they must find a reason to get her to become a Hero. After going through the a small part of the Wellspring Cave, the Hero and Hammer are attacked by hollow men. After making it through the cave with the holy water, another monk, Brother Robin, enters the cave and tells Hannah that her father is being held captive by one of Lucien's men. At this, Hannah breaks off a warhammer from a nearby statue and runs to save her father. The Hero is in quick pursuit behind Hannah when tragedy strikes. Not much is known of the event, but it is thought that the Abbot had tried to disarm the gunman and was shot dead in the process. Hannah kills the gunman with a single blow and falls to her knees at the side of her dead father, crying and sobbing over his body. The next day, the blessing of the Golden Acorn takes place on a hilltop in Oakfield overlooking the docks. The Golden Acorn is planted in the Abbot's grave. Hannah promises to get revenge for the death of her father. After a few moments, Theresa shows up and offers to tell Hannah everything. Hannah eagerly agrees and begins to go by her name of \"Hammer\"; Theresa and Hammer teleport back to the Guild Cave, leaving the Hero alone atop the cliff in Oakfield.Known Quests and The Hero Of Will  There were many quests that the Hero undertook, some for fame, some for gold, and others just for joy. It is reported that the Hero helped a ghost's former lover find love again, although other reports suggest that the Hero broke the lover's heart at the request of the ghost. The Hero also helped capture Ripper as a request from Giles, or killed Giles as a request from Ripper. The Hero returns to Theresa and Hammer at the Guild where Theresa tells them of the Hero of Will, Garth, a brilliant scholar who was formerly in Lucien's employ, but severed ties with him upon learning his true intentions. She tells the Hero to go to Brightwood where he resides and recruit him; Hammer reluctantly stays behind. Upon entry to Brightwood, the Hero sees that it has already been overrun by Lucien's Spire guards. Arriving at Brightwood Tower, Lucien's Commandant is already there and captures Garth before the Hero can get to him, escaping using an Old Kingdom artifact called a Shard. The Hero returns to the Guild, where Theresa then tells the Hero to seek out Lucien's old butler Jeeves, who might know where Lucien's old diary is located, and who, as Hammer notes, \"must have seen his share of dirty dealings.\" The Hero goes to The Cow and Corset at Bowerstone Market and finds Jeeves in one of the rooms. Jeeves apparently does not recognize the Hero from the night Rose died, and demands 1000 gold pieces for the location of Lucien's Diary (which the Hero must provide in order to continue with the quest). Jeeves discloses the location of where he buried the diary in a map. Upon arriving at the diary's location at Bower Lake, the Hero is attacked by a Troll and succeeds in killing it. The Hero then brings the diary to Theresa, who translates it. By reading it, she determines that Lucien is recruiting guards from Westcliff who succeed in defeating the Crucible, to which Theresa responds by stating those who win are physically tough and mentally weak. Hammer and the Hero depart for Westcliff. On their journey, they travel along Bandit Coast, so named as it has been overrun by bandits. They breach the barricade between the coast and the outskirts of the Westcliff Camp and continue. Shortly after, they meet a woman, Lilith, who sobs that balverines killed her husband and took her son, so Hammer volunteers them to help find the child. They reach the Howling Halls and find out that Lilith is not a woman, but a white balverine who has led them into a trap. Hammer and the Hero kill all of the balverines and find a way out of Howling Halls by making a makeshift bridge out of a pillar. Arriving at the camp of the Crucible, Hammer and the Hero meet the announcers, Murray and Mad Dog, the latter being a Crucible record holder. Hammer is not allowed to compete, due to her insulting Mad Dog, and the Hero's dog is not allowed in, so the Hero is forced to fight alone. First however, the Hero has to complete various other quests in order to be \"famous\" enough to be allowed in. The Hero emerges from the Crucible triumphant, conquering all eight rounds and being greeted by new adoring fans outside. It is here that the Hero has one last chance to complete any unfinished tasks before leaving for the Spire. One of these tasks involves a battle between the Temple of Light and the Temple of Shadows, but it is unclear which side the Hero chose. Upon completing their affairs, the Hero talks with the boat captain, who says that no personal effects, weapons, or their dog are allowed on board. Hammer promises to watch after the dog, and the Hero begins their career as a Spire guard.Difficult Choices in the Spire  Upon arrival at the Spire, the Hero sees Lucien once again, now an older man gone mad at the idea of the Spire and its capabilities. He informs the Hero and the other guards that the world is corrupt and does not punish evil as it should, and that they stand in an instrument of change, and subsequently puts all the guards to sleep using some sort of Will spell. Upon awakening, the Hero is fitted with Spire guard clothing and an obedience collar which drains experience away from those who do not obey. Along the way to the Commandant's Chamber, the Hero sees Bob, a man who arrived with them and appears to be friendly, and Garth, who immediately recognizes the Hero and advises patience. The Hero then meets the Commandant, who explains the \"project\" in greater detail, saying that their progress is not a miracle, but a product of obedience. The Hero can refuse to do anything the Commandant tells them to, resulting in their collar being activated. The Hero can withstand the pain two times, but on the third, they faint from the pain. In a span of ten years, the Hero faces two choices. The first choice being whether to starve disobedient workers or feed them, and the second being whether to kill or spare Bob. Whether or not the Hero kills Bob makes no difference as Bob will die anyway either by the Hero's hands or the Commandant's (although you may choose to attack the Commandant instead and gain a large amount of Good points for each hit). Later, the Hero is called to the Commandant's Chamber and ordered to find a missing guard from one of the construction sites. Upon finding the guard, the Hero discovers him dead at Garth's hands. Garth, who has spent the last ten years focusing his Will, has finally progressed to the point of being able to destroy the Hero's collar and to have killed the missing guard. The Hero must now do all the fighting for the both of them as Garth has no power left. The Hero fights their way to the Commandant's Chamber as Garth states that they're not leaving until the Commandant is dead. The Commandant appears with several guards and fights the Hero, but is killed. Garth regains his powers through the Commandant's death and opens a Cullis Gate down to the docks. The Hero and Garth make it to one of the boats and escape with a new batch of recruits. Upon arrival at the Oakfield docks, they are met by Theresa and the Hero's dog. Theresa informs Garth that he cannot defeat Lucien on his own, and Garth takes Theresa's hand as she teleports him to the guild. She also gives the Hero all their\u00a0equipment back.The Hero of Skill  Theresa tells the Hero to go see Hammer at Rookridge Inn. Hammer soon departs after catching up with the Hero to go see a source who might have information on the Hero of Skill. Theresa then tells the Hero to take some time to recuperate, and if they have chosen to have a family, go and see them again. If the player chooses to do this, they will see that their spouse thought them to be dead and their child (if they had one) is now ten years old. The Hero may stay with their family for a while or leave immediately and receive lamentations from their spouse, asking them what happened to them in the Spire and what made them so cruel. Theresa contacts the Hero and tells them that Hammer has information about the Hero of Skill and to return to the Guild. Upon arrival at the Guild, Garth informs the Hero that he had no idea what Lucien was planning the night that Rose died, and if he had known, he would have stopped him. Hammer arrives shortly thereafter, marking the first meeting between Garth and Hammer which is accompanied by a trade of insults. Hammer then says that she thinks the Hero of Skill is a pirate named Reaver who would make crews of other ships surrender by using his pistol to shoot the captain from afar. She says that he runs the port town of Bloodstone, surrounded on three sides by Wraithmarsh and on the fourth by ocean. Theresa notes that they can get to Bloodstone by travelling through Wraithmarsh, to which Garth has conveniently made a Cullis Gate to at Brightwood Tower. Hammer, Garth and the Hero all travel to the Tower. Upon arrival at the tower, Spire Guards are there again and a fight ensues. Garth attempts to activate the Cullis Gate to Wraithmarsh while the Hero and Hammer fend off a great many guards and commandants. Upon activation of the gate, the Hero enters first to find themself all alone in Wraithmarsh, and subsequently gets knocked out as the Cullis Gate explodes. The Hero then gets locked in a cage by Old Gregg, who seems to think they are from Bloodstone at first. He comments that Bloodstone would be burned to the ground if there was any justice, and reckons he'll to do the same with the Hero. Upon saying this, a blanket of fog covers the area. He leaves, presumably to investigate the source of the fog. This is followed by a high-pitched scream, and the fog lifts to reveal the old man's body. He is killed by what Theresa (upon establishing contact with the Hero again) identifies as a banshee. The Hero's dog comes out of the fog and retrieves the key from Old Gregg's body. Theresa says that the gate malfunctioned and Hammer and Garth were sent back to the Guild, and that the Hero must make it through Wraithmarsh on their own. Theresa identifies the sinister region as what used to be Oakvale, a village burned to the ground by bandits and later destroyed for a final time by a foolish young man who made a deal with the Shadow Court for immortality. The Hero eventually makes it through the marsh after defeating hollow men, balverines, two banshees, and a troll. Arriving at Bloodstone, Theresa tells the Hero to go and make Reaver's acquaintance. Reaver seems glad to meet the Hero and flirts with them regardless of their gender. Reaver, before dealing with the Hero, wants them to prove to him that they are worth dealing with by increasing their renown through several quests that are available after arriving in Bloodstone. Around this time, reports suggest that the Hero found alost pirate's treasure. After doing this, Reaver informs the Hero that he discovered that they escaped the Spire, and if they run an errand for him, he will help them. Reaver tells the Hero to deliver a seal to the Shadow Court, but there is more to the task than Reaver lets on (as noted by Theresa). Upon entering the Shadow Court and after defeating several shadows, the Hero meets a young girl who says that she and her friends were reading from a book and somehow ended up in the Court. Moments later, the Shadow Judges appear and the apparent leader informs them that whichever one of them carries the Dark Seal will sacrifice their youth and beauty so Reaver may keep his (this confirms that it was in fact Reaver who destroyed Oakvale). The Hero may keep the seal and be aged permanently or give the girl the seal, sacrificing her youth and beauty. It is unclear which the Hero chose, and Theresa justifies their choice either way. Regardless of the choice, Reaver has again fulfilled the bargain; but when the sacrifices stop, the Shadow Judges will come for him. When returning to Bloodstone, Reaver says that while the Hero was away, he made an agreement with Lucien in which Reaver hands over the Hero for \"a large heap of gold\". After saying this, one of Reaver's cronies informs him that the city is under attack by Lucien's men, and that their leader is saying \"find this Reaver\". Reaver seems appalled that Lucien broke their agreement and temporarily allies himself with the Hero to escape from Bloodstone by fleeing down an escape tunnel built by smugglers in his study. However, they are intercepted by Lucien's men, and Reaver and the Hero must fight through them to escape to Smuggler's Beach. After the Hero and Reaver exit the tunnels, Garth and Hammer are already outside waiting for them. Reaver then destroys the tunnels using some form of explosive and is about to flee on his escape boat, but not before it is destroyed by a Shard. Lucien's men try one more time to capture the four Heroes but fail when Garth discovers the weakness of the Shard; long, sustained Will attacks. All four Heroes then work together to destroy it. Once it is destroyed, Reaver is about to depart when Theresa shows up saying that if he does not join them, Lucien will control the world and everything in it (which motivates Reaver, because if this happens, then he will have no one to sacrifice to the Shadow Court). They then depart for Hero Hill.The Great Weapon  Upon arrival at Hero Hill to call forth \"The Great Weapon\" which will defeat Lucien, the Heroes start discussing Lucien's true intentions, but this talk is brought to a close when Theresa urges that they start the ritual in which the Hero stands in the center of the hill with the other three off to the side. Upon starting the ritual, there is a bright light as the three Hero attributes come together, and when it subsides, Hammer, Garth, and Reaver are weakened while the Hero of Bowerstone stands tall, and Theresa is gone. Shortly after, Lucien arrives with more Shards and chastises the Heroes, saying they had enough power to build a new world and they wasted it trying to save the old one. He then teleports Reaver, Garth, and Hammer away so only he and the Hero are left on the hill. Lucien then reveals that he killed their\u00a0family (if the Hero chose to have one) and \"the last of the heroic bloodline shall flow out onto this hilltop.\" When Lucien is about to shoot the Hero, the dog jumps in the way of the bullet and is killed. It is then that Lucien seems to show pity for the Hero, saying that the last time he killed them, it tore his heart out but they were both young. It is here that Lucien shoots the Hero. After the Hero is shot, the world goes black and Theresa's voice is heard saying the same phrase she used when she rescued the Hero as a child: \"Death is not your destiny today, little Sparrow.\"The Perfect World  The Hero wakes up in a sort of dream world as a child where Rose is still alive, and they are living on a farm with their parents. The Hero may perform various activities on the farm, killing beetles, shooting bottles, and rounding up the chickens. Once it is late enough, Rose suggests they go to bed. In the middle of the night, the Hero wakes up to strange music coming from outside the border of the farm. The Hero goes to investigate, with Rose following. Rose implores her sibling not to go, and that she doesn't want to be alone again. After the Hero leaves, the sky turns red and Rose screams and disappears. Along the road to investigate the music, the Hero sees several bodies all murdered brutally and eventually sees the way to put an end to all of the chaos that Lucien has brought about: The music box. Though its origins are unknown, the music box is, in fact, the Great Weapon. After reflecting on their life, the Hero goes to the Spire to confront Lucien once and for all.The Wish  When the Hero gets to the Spire, Lucien appears to be bending all three Heroes' power to his own Will. After remarking how astounding the Hero's power is to have cheated death a second time, Lucien attempts to put the Hero to sleep again. However, the Hero starts using the music box, and it appears to have an effect: Lucien's bond with the Heroes is broken, and he has no power left. At this point, the Hero may kill Lucien with ease or wait and Reaver will do it, remarking that he thought Lucien would never stop talking. Shortly after, Theresa appears and tells the Hero it is time for their reward. The Hero has three choices: Sacrifice aka The Needs of the Many, in which all who died in the making of the Spire will be brought back to life, but everyone the Hero loved will remain dead; Love aka The Needs of the Few, in which all the Hero's family, including their dog and Rose, will be brought back to life, but everyone who died in the making of the Spire will remain dead; or Wealth aka The Needs of the One, in which the Hero will get a million gold, but their family and all those who died in making the Spire will stay dead. It is unclear which the Hero chose, but a letter received soon afterwards may contain the answer. Garth says he wishes to return home to Samarkand along with Reaver (who tags along for the exotic substances and uninhibited people). Hammer wants to go north to study with the warrior monks. Reaver sarcastically thanks the Hero for dragging them into this mess, Garth says that he is glad they met and that they will meet again, and Hammer says that \"There's nothing left for me here, well, aside from the one thing, the best friend I ever had\" as all three are teleported away. Theresa then says that it is time for the Hero to leave; the world is theirs to enjoy, but the Spire is hers alone. Though originally seen as an evil statement questioning Theresa's motives, the answers to why she says this are found in two places:Knothole Island  Though many other quests were undertaken by the Hero for renown, gold, and other rewards, one of the more notable ones was depicted in the first downloadable content, Knothole Island. It begins with the Hero spotting a man, Gordon, down by the Bowerstone Market docks who seems to be waiting for someone. He reveals that he is looking for a Hero because his home, Knothole Island, is in trouble. Gordon takes the Hero to the island in his submarine, and the Hero finds that the place is freezing to death. The Chieftain, the leader of the island, informs the Hero that their warriors died out a long time ago and they were the only ones that had access to the weather shrines, which could quite literally control the weather, and that only a Hero like them could get inside a shrine now to change the weather to warmer conditions. The Hero accepts and with the ice seal, gains access to the ice shrine. Upon defeating several shadows, the Hero uses the totem to change the weather to scorching conditions which melts all the ice. Now, the Hero may take advantage of some of the stores that were previously closed during the weather, including the Box of Secrets, where \"every purchase is a mystery and a surprise\" in which the player may trade in certain items for strange new weapons and clothing. Soon, however, the people of Knothole Island became unhappy again as their island was now a wasteland as opposed to a glacier. The Chieftain demands the Hero's help to gain access to the sun shrine. The Hero does not disappoint and activates the storm totem to make it rain all day, as opposed to snowing or flaming. Yet again, however, the Chieftain complains and demands that the Hero return things to the way they were, snowing and freezing. Upon finding the storm seal, the Hero gains access to the storm shrine and after defeating several shadows and solving several puzzles (again), the island is returned to the glacier that it used to be. The Chieftain thanks the Hero and then asks the people of the island to pay a tax for the maintenance of the weather shrine. They refuse, as the Chieftain got them into this problem in the first place. The Hero may have sided with the Chieftain to get ten thousand gold, or with Jessica (the manager of the Box of Secrets) to earn the respect and love of the people of the island, which would result in the exile of the Chieftain. The Hero, regardless, gains access to the Weather Chamber and the power to change the island's weather whenever it suited. Also, if the Hero goes to the island after completing the main quest and they chose the Needs of the One or the Needs of the Many, they may trade the soul of a person in a strange shrine for the soul of their deceased dog. However, no morality or purity is lost for doing this.Seeing the Future  In the second downloadable content See the Future, the Hero is given one last quest in which Murgo, the man who sold the Hero the music box many years ago, has returned to Bowerstone with more \"interesting\" items. One such item is a cursed snowglobe which actually appears to be the resting place for the souls of those who inhabited Oakvale before it was destroyed by Reaver. All the colour has been drained from their world and the inhabitants ask the Hero to help them. It turns out Shadow Worshippers were responsible for this, and after they are killed, all the colour returns to the world, allowing the ghosts of Oakvale to rest in peace. The second item the Hero gets from Murgo, a cursed skull, takes them to a region (similar to Westcliff in a few ways) where a knight is caught in a large skull because of what he says was a necromancer who cursed him to be stuck there forever. The knight asks them\u00a0to retrieve wisps which help to unlock the chains that hold him. To do this, the Hero must wear ridiculous outfits such as Hobbe, Balverine, and Hollow Man costumes. Upon delivering the wisps, it is revealed that the so-called knight is the necromancer himself. The Hero defeats him and leaves. Upon exiting, Murgo's source comes through and he gives the Hero a model replica of the Spire, which he claims will give the Hero a small glimpse into the future. It turns out that Theresa was the source and, upon using the model, the Hero is teleported to the Spire itself. It is here that Theresa admits that the Spire had a gift for her, too: The ability to see all possible futures. The Hero takes Theresa's hand one last time and sees their future: the Hero is the ruler of all of Albion, with loyal guards and subjects who either fear their wrath or look to them for guidance. Theresa deems none of this as important, though, and says the only thing that matters is the Hero's unborn child, and that this child is destined for greatness and the fate of all of Albion will lie in their hands, along with the fate of Aurora. Theresa tells the Hero that, for now, they must live their life, and that she will always be watching them. On returning from the Spire, the Hero receives the Royal Suit, and Murgo delivers one last mystical item. This one is different from the others, and is a replica of a Colosseum. Upon activating it, you are teleported to an arena where you fight waves of enemies (everything from beetles to Spire Guards). The new arena holds records and has different awards, and if you get the Ultimate Prize from 15,000 points, you are rewarded with the Royal Sceptre.Fable III  It is told that, sometime after the end of Fable II, the Hero of Bowerstone unites Albion under a monarchy through \"strength, cunning, and conviction\". It is indicated that the Hero raised what is known in Fable III as the \"old guard\", which was led by such men as Major Swift and Sir Walter Beck; the remnants of this guard can be seen throughout Albion and eventually Aurora, and act as town guards did in Fable and Fable II. Walter was a good friend to the Hero, as he fought alongside them and eventually became their personal advisor once they claimed the throne. The Hero also opened the Brightwall Academy, which was the greatest hub of learning throughout Albion. Deep within the academy, they also built a reliquary which housed some of their greatest possessions, amongst which was the music box used to stop Lucien from destroying Albion. Some time during their reign, the Hero married and had two children: Logan and the Hero of Brightwall. Nearly fifty years into their reign, the Hero died, and the Hero and their spouse were buried in the royal gardens side by side. Hidden within the Hero's tomb was the Guild Seal, an item needed to unlock the Reliquary. The Hero left their kingdom to their eldest child, Logan, upon their death.Powers and Abilities  As a member of the Archon's bloodline, the Hero of Bowerstone was one of the most powerful Heroes in history. As a descendant of William Black, they could use all three Heroic virtues and were extremely skilled in each of them. Due to this, they were the most powerful Hero of their generation. Training themself\u00a0from childhood, the Hero unlocked their true power after visiting the Chamber of Fate. Throughout their adventures,\u00a0the Hero defeated countless formidable opponents, including the Commandant, Captain Dread, Darius Zing, Ripper, Thag, and\u00a0Dash, as well as countless hordes of creatures such as hollow men, balverines, shadows, bandits, and hobbes single-handedly. Throughout their journey, the Hero was also able to pass all stages of the Crucible intact, a feat duplicated by very few throughout history, and was even able to resist the horrible power of one of the most powerful weapons of the Old Kingdom, the Spire. The Hero also demonstrated their incredible resolve when fighting through the cursed Wraithmarsh and staving off death as a child after being shot by Lucien and falling from the heights of Fairfax Castle. Years after Lucien was defeated, the Hero of Bowerstone also demonstrated their cunning and intelligence when achieving a feat unheard of since the Old Kingdom: Uniting Albion under a strong monarchy, clearing the path for Albion to undergo its Industrial Revolution. Nevertheless, despite their\u00a0considerable power, Theresa believed that the Hero of Bowerstone was not powerful enough to defeat the looming forces of the Darkness, revealing in the Road to Rule\u00a0that she manipulated events so the Hero would produce an even-more powerful heir, even though said heir required the use of special gauntlets to use their Will.Trivia Gargoyle Locations  This page lists the locations of all 50 gargoyle heads that can be found in Fable II. If you still have problems finding them, listen for their insults - you can hear their taunting when you are near them.Sunset House  Sunset House is a region in Fable III. It is a bonus house, with several puzzle solving elements required to unlock. It consists of two reflected houses, joined in the dining room by a magical mirror. One is the house as it was before destruction, fully furnished, and the other is a mirror image, but dilapidated. The Hero will enter back into the house that they exited from, and can swap between them using the central mirror.Description  The house is made up of an entrance hall and two (originally) locked doors, one with a chest, and the other with a corridor to a dining room containing a mirror showing the reflected house. The staircase in the entrance hall leads up to a bedroom. The dilapidated side has a doll and a teddy bear several feet tall covered in fire behind the bed. The pristine side contains a near perfect room with cabinets and wardrobes as well as a lootable chest. The grounds have hollow men on the right side past the gate and hobbes on the left, as well as a Demon Door and a Golden Door. There is a Silver key and a Gnome near the right hand boundary of the house. Another Silver key can be found to the left of the Demon Door. To find the house, the Hero must travel from Mourningwood, with the access being along the road through the marshes, between the cemetery and the trenches. It will be up to the left if heading from the Fort and toward the village, past the turn off to the Ossuary. After the related quest is completed, however, the house serves absolutely no purpose. It cannot be rented out, the interior can't be customized at all, and the player cannot move their family there. Enemies will always continue to spawn on the grounds. It can, however, be sold for a sum of 18,000 gold (and also easily re-purchased any time for 20,000 gold should the player change their mind, since nobody will ever move into it if sold).Walkthrough  During the day time, the house is ruined, while to the left inside the fence is an untouched gazebo with four statues. During the night, the house appears as a ghost of its former self, and is glowing blue and cannot be entered. The gazebo is also glowing blue, and the statues can be interacted with, swapping between pre-set poses. By changing the night time poses to how you saw them during the day time, the house will become solid and can then be entered.Gazebo Puzzle Chesty's Chess  Once inside, there is a skeleton hanging from a ceiling, and a note explains how the owner burnt the house down, but suspected the house would return, and warns the Hero not to sleep in the bed. So of course, proceed up the stairs and sleep in the bed. (See Chesty's Chess for more details).Shattering the Mirror  Through the new corridor to the right of the stairs is a dining hall with a mirror that reflects a floating skull where the Hero's head should be. The reflected world also shows three glowing seals on the wall. By guiding the Hero to the position of the seal on this side, the skull will enter the seal in the reflection. After doing this with the third seal, the mirror can be vaulted through and the reflected house entered. If you are having trouble, this video will walk you through the steps: Shattering The Mirror (Video Walkthrough) Once the 3 seals have been unlocked, before vaulting through the mirror, Chesty can be seen in the mirror standing where the hero should be reflected, instead of the hollow head.Shot the Difference  The reflection is a cleaned up version of the derelict mansion you entered from. A note in the reflected entrance way reads 'Shot the Difference'. This refers to the glowing green orbs in both entrance halls being out of place. Shooting these orbs solves the puzzle and opens up the remaining locked door in each entrance way. Both hallways lead to a chest. The Hero can open the chest on the dilapidated side for a reward of Guild Seals and a Slow Time Potion, and on the pristine side for a random legendary weapon. Also, if you go to the bedroom on the pristine side, there is a chest containing random loot behind one of the dressing blinds. You may exit the building from either version of the house. When you next enter, you will arrive in the side you last left from.Golden Door  Off to the right side of the region is a Golden Door which can be opened by a Gold Key. The door contains a random legendary weapon.Demon Door  There is a Demon Door to the left upon entering the region. It wants to meet a Monarch, so return upon becoming King/Queen of Albion and enter the door to the Pools of Sorrow, wherein lies a chest containing 1,000,000 gold.Trivia Knothole Island  Knothole Island is the first Fable II downloadable content. Two versions were released, one for 800 Microsoft points and one for free. The free version only allows co-op play with someone with the premium version, you do not get to go to the island on your own. The content was released for download on January 13th, 2009. It is also included in all versions of the Fable II Game of the Year Edition.New Territory History  Hundreds of years ago, the tribe from Knothole Glade discovered the existence of an island far off the mainland said to offer its inhabitants full control over their weather. Tired of constant Balverine attacks and damp, dreary weather, the tribe elders decided they would make an exodus to this mythic island and settle there. The ancient civilization who originally lived on the island created the magical artifacts that control the weather, and hid them in dangerous caves so that their warriors would be tested every year. Read more.Geography  Knothole Island is a dynamic environment, changing based on the actions of the Hero; the landscape varies dramatically depending on the current weather conditions. Read more.New Activities Weather Quests  Three new quests are added to the game by this DLC package, and each is unlocked after completing specific sections of the Fable II Main Quest:Knothole Island Volumes  An activity focused on collecting the ten lost volumes of Knothole Island's history. Collecting all ten volumes will unlock the achievement The Bibliophile.Notable People The Chieftain  The Chieftain is middle-aged and a typical, slimy politician. He takes credit for everything the Hero does when things go right, and is quick to blame anyone else when they go wrong. Puffed up, avaricious, self-important, uses big words. After retrieving the last of the weather totems he offers you 10,000 gold to side with him, so that he can keep the villagers in line and tax them for the weather, or leaves Knothole if the hero rejects his offer.Jessica  Jessica is the owner of the Box of Secrets shop, where explorers can trade for extraordinary items she has collected over the years. She's independent and one of the only few people who stands up to the Chieftain.Gordon  Gordon is an inventor and submarine captain, who was sent to the mainland to find a Hero to save the island from the freezing weather.New Items  Knothole Island offers players a Plethora of new clothes, potions, and weapons. The clothes include the Chasm Armour, an evil aligned set; the Barbarian outfit, the Greaser Gear; the Knothole Skirt, the bandit gloves, the rest of the Assassin sets, and the Knight Armour. Most of these clothes are available for trade in the Box of Secrets shop, but the Knight's Armour is found throughout the three weather quests and Gordon, who supplies the boots. The armour is either gold and white coloured (Good), silver and blue coloured (Neutral), or black and red coloured (Evil), depending on the Hero's alignment. The new potions can be found at the Cosmetician's shop. They include a beauty treatment, fat/skinny potions, short/tall potions, and scar removal potions. Although all of these reduce purity. There are many new weapons to find as well. A holy cutlass, a mage's sceptre, a barbarian's mace, an evil sword, and Hal's Rifle can be found in the Box of Secrets. In addition to these new legendary weapons, new augments and weapons with up to four augmentation slots may be bought. And if you change your mind about weapons that you've augmented, the new augment-remover tool can take them off the weapon. Please note that you cannot take augments off Legendary Weapons. A complete list of all new items exclusive to Knothole Island is as follows:Food Potions Trophies Augments Dyes Melee Weapons Ranged Weapons Clothing Headgear Coats Upper Body Hands Lower Body Feet Masks Miscellaneous Items Books  There are 10 volumes covering the history of Knothole Island hidden throughout the island. Finding all 10 will unlock the achievement The Bibliophile.Key Features The Daichi  The Daichi is a legendary katana in Fable II. It has augmentations for greater damage to enemies, added lightning/shock damage and an augment that increases your attractiveness. The Daichi is widely considered to be the most powerful of all the legendary melee weapons in Fable II because it has a high base damage, fast swing speed, and long reach.Appearance  This is an ornate Katana which has a small gold curve as the pommel, a teal handle, a gold semi-circle bulge which looks like the head of a bird\u00a0attached to the top of the handle.Description  This exceptional sword once belonged to the legendary Zuna Daichi, a female warrior monk whose exploits in Eastern Samarkand have become part of popular myth. There are stories that she may have visited Albion once, while on a quest. Perhaps it was in this land that she died, and here she left her katana.Acquisition  You can find it in the dungeon called Archon's Knot, in a chest at the end of the dungeon. Archon's Knot is a puzzle dungeon that opens up only after you have used Garth's Cullis Gate to get to Wraithmarsh during the main quest. You do not need to purchase Brightwood Tower in order to access it. Return to the tower and vault over the short broken wall next to the Cullis Gate, and down into the 'well'. After making your way through Archon's Knot by completing its puzzles, you'll emerge on a ledge back in Brightwood. Before vaulting down, follow the path up to the right to a small platform and a chest containing the Daichi.Trivia Weapons (Fable III)  This is a list of Weapons in Fable III. Most of these weapons can be found entirely randomly inside the various chests and stores throughout Albion (see below), so there is no one place to find a particular weapon. This does not apply to a few weapons, such as The Bonesmasher, The Tenderiser or the Gnomewrecker, which are always found in the same place. Note that while there are 50 total weapons in the game, every Hero has around 26 weapons that can be found depending on decisions made; the rest must be traded for via Xbox/GFW Live or during co-op play. In addition to the Legendary Weapons listed below, there are also four Hero Weapons found in the Sanctuary during the quest A New Hero. You are given the Hero Sword and the Hero Hammer, one of which you need to choose to equip at the time. Later, you can choose between the Hero Pistol and the Hero Rifle. They cannot be sold to pawnbrokers, nor traded with other Heroes, and are always available in the armoury of the Sanctuary.Melee Swords Hammers Ranged Rifles Pistols Facts about Fable III Weapons Rarity Rating  Each of the 50 weapons required for the achievement has a rarity rating, Common, Uncommon, Rare or Relic, based on its value and ease of acquisition. The 18 weapons available through pre-order, Marketplace DLC and other bonuses cannot be traded, and are rated as Unique.Legendary Weapon Locations  Each location draws a weapon from a certain list based on their rarity rating.

Notes:Unique Weapons  These weapons do not count toward the \"We Need Guns, Lots Of Guns\" AchievementScythe  Scythe is an ancient Hero counted among the oldest and most powerful beings in Albion.History  Scythe is introduced as a figure of legend among even the Heroes' Guild, a Hero utterly obsessed with cheating death. Jack of Blades is often considered the only one who has \"seen and done more\". Scythe walked the earth long before the guild was created, and even the Oracle of Snowspire is unsure of many things that he has done. He is a withered shell of a man, resembling a tall, mummified corpse. One common theory regarding Scythe's true identity is that he is most likely William Black, the first Archon of the Old Kingdom. This is suggested in descriptions of the Archon vanishing while wearing golden mail and a blue robe, the same clothing that Scythe is dressed in at the time of Fable: The Lost Chapters. This theory is additionally supported in Fable: The Journey, in which Theresa details the story of William Black to Gabriel while traveling in Miremoor. After describing William Black's journey into The Void to cast off the Corruption that afflicted him during his first voyage to the Void, she claims that William Black disappeared, never seen again in a form that would be recognizable to the denizens of the Old Kingdom. If one studies the history of Albion, they first hear the figure referred to as Scythe mentioned after the fall of the Old Kingdom in the grip of Albion's anarchist period, known as the Fallow Wars. These histories mention Scythe serving as the mentor of the bandit-turned-Hero Nostro, who, under Scythe's guidance, created the Heroes' Guild in order to put an end to the violence that cursed Albion's people and unite the land under a single banner once more. Scythe, who had hoped that Nostro could bring Albion together for the first time since the days of the Old Kingdom, watched his dreams be dashed with the appearance of Magdalena, a power-hungry courtesan who became Nostro's wife. Through her influence, the Heroes' Guild became a degenerate house of greedy mercenaries and Nostro's influence waned. Scythe, refusing to aid his former pupil after bearing witness to his fall, nevertheless forgave him and stood vigil at his side after he was poisoned by an assassin, staying with him until he died at the first light of the sun. With Nostro's death, Scythe disappeared into obscurity once more.Fable: The Lost Chapters  Scythe makes a brief appearance in the original Fable story as a Hero of legend who can be found in conversation with Maze if the Hero of Oakvale explores the grounds of the Heroes' Guild. His appearance in the original game is relatively insignificant, however, as he soon disappears into the distant Northern Wastes. Like fellow Hero Briar Rose, Scythe's role is greatly expanded upon in the continued story of Fable: The Lost Chapters. A year after the Hero of Oakvale slew Jack of Blades, Scythe desperately called upon the Heroes' Guild to send its greatest champion to aid him in that frozen land in his efforts against a newly risen evil of great power. Once the Hero of Oakvale claims the Fire Heart and takes the Ship of the Drowned across the icy waters, he meets with Scythe, who briefs him on the situation in the north. He explains that he destroyed his Guild Seal to ensure that this great evil could not reach the Heroes' Guild, which greatly limited his communication with that organization, and that to plan his next move, the two Heroes would have to retrieve the glyphs that activate the Snowspire Oracle. Once the Hero ventures into the Necropolis and retrieves the glyphs, Scythe activates the ancient Oracle and learns that the resurgent evil is none other than Jack of Blades reborn. With this revelation, Scythe advises the Hero of Oakvale on how to confront Jack of Blades by opening the Bronze Gate, which can only be done by gathering souls of a certain criteria. Once the Hero defeats Jack of Blades, Scythe contacts him once more, urging him to destroy the mask in order to finally banish Jack of Blades' soul. It is up to the Hero if they follow his advice or not.Fable Heroes  Scythe appears as a playable character in the Xbox LIVE Arcade title, Fable Heroes. He is available for purchase by Hammer on the Hero Tile of the Abilities Board.Trivia Hero of Oakvale  The Hero of Oakvale is the main protagonist in both Fable and its expansion, Fable: The Lost Chapters. He is the only playable character in both of the said games. His name is never directly mentioned in the games, but he is often referred to as \"The Hero,\" \"Farmboy,\" or simply \"Boy.\" The people of Albion call this Hero by his customizable Hero title (purchased via Title Vendor), which is always \"Chicken Chaser\" at the beginning of the game. His appearance is also able to be changed, and thus depends on the player's preferences. In the cut-scenes narrated by the Guildmaster, he is depicted as having long dark brown or black hair, and clean-shaven. His outfit changes in almost every one of the cut-scenes. He is the most powerful Hero in Albion, because of his ancient bloodline leading back to the rulers of the Old Kingdom: the Archon. Because of this, he is a master of the three Hero traits: Strength, Skill, and Will.Biography Early Life  The Hero is the child of the famous heroine, Scarlet Robe, who is often away from Oakvale due to her responsibilities as a Hero. Because of this, the Hero's father, Brom, looks after him and his older sister, Theresa, most of the time. The Hero starts off on a seemingly normal day, getting a birthday present for Theresa by either performing enough good deeds to earn gold from his father, or performing bad deeds in order to gain money. He eventually gets the present and gives it to his sister. As much as she wants to celebrate the day, she warns him of a strange dream she had: A vision of great terror, chaos, and pain. As they head back into the village, a man runs by screaming about a group of bandits attacking the village, determined to rob and murder the humble villagers as they search for the boy. The boy hides behind a nearby fence; however, Theresa is captured by the bandits. The bandits pillage long into the night. The blue sky becomes completely enveloped in a blanket of total darkness as a fierce inferno engulfs Oakvale, burning homes and taverns down to the ground. The boy is unable to do anything but listen to the shrill cries of the villagers desperately trying to defend themselves against the bandit horde. The simple people of the village prove an easy task for the bandits, and almost everyone is killed. The terrified boy returns to the town, but not a soul can be found; only destruction. He wanders to his home, where he is heartbroken to find the corpse of his father and begins to cry. Suddenly, a lone bandit charges straight towards the child. Fortunately, Maze, a powerful Hero and the head of the Heroes' Guild, appears and kills the bandit in a single attack, saving the young boy. Maze warns the boy that if he doesn't come with him, he too will become a victim of the Oakvale massacre. The boy, scared and confused, reluctantly agrees, and Maze teleports them both to the Guild.The Heroes Guild  The boy is offered a home at the Guild, where he is given the opportunity to train to become a Hero himself; eager to avenge his family's death, he readily accepts Maze's offer. It was there that the boy spent the rest of his childhood, studying the ways of the Guild and Heroes, day and night, in the hopes that he might one day discover the bandits behind the vicious attack on Oakvale and take his revenge. There, he is accepted by the Guildmaster and begins training with Whisper, a fellow apprentice who becomes his rival and friend. After many years of intense training of both mind and body, he would, together with Whisper, graduate from the Guild and become a Hero.Life after the Guild  As the boy begins his new life as a Hero, he gradually becomes more famous and more powerful than any Hero ever seen. The Hero either defends Orchard Farm alongside guards, or attacks it alongside bandits. Either way, the Hero meets Whisper once again, and they fight. Whisper is defeated and the Hero gets the reward from the Guild. He then escorts a pair of traders through Darkwood, defending them against balverines and an earth troll before reaching his destination: Barrow Fields. Nearby is his hometown of Oakvale, which has been rebuilt. He is recognized by a young girl who, now grown, he had helped in the opening scenes by recovering her teddy bear \"Rosie\" from a bully. Maze contacts the Hero with news that his sister may have survived the bandit raid, and advises him to seek out the \"Bandit Seeress\" of the Bandit King and former Hero, Twinblade. After fighting his way through the bandits' camp, he comes face-to-face with Twinblade, and after a short but brutal fight, the Hero defeats him. As he winds up his weapon for the final strike, he is stopped by the Seeress, who is none other than his own sister, Theresa. Theresa explains to her brother what happened after the day Oakvale was burned down, how she had been blinded by torture and ended up being saved by Twinblade's clan. Though blind, her other senses became greatly heightened and awakened an inner strength which focused her \"dreams\" into prophecies. She talks about their mother, a choice that the Hero would have to make someday, and gives him a letter she had written, along with a book about their bloodline. She then leaves in search of their mother after magically unlocking some hidden energy within the Hero, making him stronger, then forever leaves Twinblade. The Hero may have then finished Twinblade, or spared him; either way, assassins are sent after the Hero. The Hero's next step, to find out about his mother, is to search for Maze's \"friend\", known as \"the Archaeologist\", an expert on the Old Kingdom. This search takes the Hero to Witchwood, where he vanquishes a rock troll along the way to finding the Archaeologist behind a mysterious Demon Door. After opening the Demon Door, the Archaeologist leaves and goes to find a new hiding place. The Hero then returns to the Guild, where he learns that Knothole Glade is having a problem with balverines. Once there, he is attacked several times by the white balverine until he receives a Silver Augmentation for his weapon from the wife of the white balverine. With this, he drives the white balverine out of the village before taking the fight to its home in Witchwood Lake, where he defeats the white balverine and all its regular counterparts. This heroic deed makes the Knothole Glade Chieftain eager to nominate him for competition in the Witchwood Arena. The Hero is successful in the early rounds and fights many brutal opponents, eventually being joined by Whisper. They handily deal with several rounds of vicious opponents, including the mighty Arachanox, a gigantic scorpion. While celebrating their victory, a mysterious figure, Jack of Blades, appears and commands that the Hero and Whisper fight each other to the death. Here, the Hero stands with the choice to either kill his old friend, earning a reward for doing so, or let her live. After becoming the Arena Champion, the Hero meets Jack in the Hall of Heroes, and is told where he can find his mother, who had also been an Arena Champion. The Hero's rivalry begins with Whisper's older brother, Thunder, who is jealous of the attention that Lady Grey devotes to the newest Arena Champion. The Hero understands that, to find his mother, he must rescue the Archaeologist, who has been abducted from Bowerstone Jail by strange demons called minions. He cuts his way through hordes of minions to get to the Archaeologist before he is shipped off to prison, who tells the Hero that there is an ancient, hidden entrance to Bargate Prison, where Scarlet Robe is being held, on a dangerous road through the Lychfield Graveyard. The Hero is led to the crypt of a legendary Hero, Nostro, who alone can reveal the needed path and whose armor has been stolen by the Gravekeeper. After collecting the four pieces amongst countless undead, he returns each piece to the crypt, causing Nostro to signal a Demon Door close by to open, revealing the path to the hidden prison. The Hero makes his way through several tunnels to the prison and finally finds his mother. Just as the Hero and Scarlet are about to escape, Jack of Blades, who is the head of the prison, appears in their path, revealing that he had set up the rescue from the start to trap them both. Both the Hero and his mother are captured and locked away.Hunt for Jack of Blades  At least one year goes by, and during this time, Jack is \"free to roam Albion\". Finally, the Hero finds the means of escape and, together with Scarlet, fights his way back through the tunnels, ultimately having to defeat a Kraken to escape. After a ferocious battle, he makes it back to Lychfield Graveyard, which is now seemingly peaceful. After a brief reunion with his mother, the Hero parts ways with her (though not before his mother unlocks another untapped source of power in his blood) to try and stop Jack from finding the Sword of Aeons, which will give him even more power. Scarlet goes to find Theresa while the Hero heads for Hook Coast to find the Septimal Key in which Jack needs to activate all the Focus Sites, which will lead him to the Sword. On his first trip to Hook Coast's old abbey, a magical barrier blocks his path, but his mother finds a book in Maze's quarters which can unlock the barrier. Upon returning to the Guild, he is a moment too late to save his mother from being kidnapped by Jack's minions. Nevertheless, he takes the book his mother has found and gives it to the Guildmaster, who is familiar with the arcane runes that will grant the Hero access to the abbey. He returns to Hook Coast and stands by the barrier as the Guildmaster reads the runes, unlocking the mystical force field. He then finds Maze, who has his sister imprisoned with magic. Maze lies that Theresa is being controlled by Jack. Theresa counters his claims, accusing Maze of joining Jack and betraying the Guild. Jack arrives and orders Maze to trap the Hero while he takes the Septimal Key, in the process revealing Maze's true allegiance. He teleports himself away so that he could activate the Focus Sites as Theresa uses her own Will abilities to free her brother before disappearing. The Hero and Maze then fight fiercely, their battle taking them all over Hook coast, culminating at the foot of the lighthouse. Maze's full power proves to be no match for the Hero and he is cut down. Before drawing his last breath, Maze reveals his motives for joining Jack and confesses that the Hero may be powerful enough to defeat Jack. He explains Jack's plan to activate all the Focus Sites around Albion and wishes the Hero success in his quest before dying. The Hero then chases Jack all over Albion to each of the four Focus Sites, hacking his way through the forces of evil, along with the help of Guild Apprentices, Guards, and the Heroes known as Briar Rose and Thunder. The Hero is not fast enough, and Jack manages to activate all the Focus Sites before heading for the Guild. The Hero rushes to his former home and when he arrives, the Guild is in flames. Jack has slain any who challenged his wrath, and has left the Guildmaster badly wounded at the base of a bookcase in the Guild Library. The Guildmaster informs the Hero that Jack's power is vast indeed and that they had no chance of stopping him, and that it is up to the Hero. As the Hero enters the Chamber of Fate, Jack mocks him and cuts Scarlet's throat in order to take the Sword of Aeons in hand. However, even with the Sword, Jack is overwhelmed by the Hero and, like his ancestor William Black had done ages before, the Hero destroys Jack's body utterly, casting his soul into the vortex that the Sword of Aeons had been removed from. He is now faced with the choice that Theresa had told him about so long ago: Take the Sword of Aeons and strike his sister down to have power greater than even Jack dreamed of, or destroy it and its darkness forever.The Return of Jack of Blades  An entire year passes, and the world settles back into the monotony of life, and the Guild is rebuilt. The Hero walks around Albion for a year, seeking a new purpose in his life. With Jack gone, people don't have as much need of Heroes. The Hero is summoned to the Guild by the Guildmaster and Briar Rose, and they receive a message from Scythe, an undead Hero in the Northern Wastes, about dangerous creatures called Summoners, and that the \"Chosen One\" should open the gate to the prophets and take the ancient relic called the Fire Heart. The Hero then has to solve a puzzle called the Mystery of Day and Night; if he filled the puzzle with suns, he let one of the prophets free, but if he fills it with moons, he kills one. He then collects the Fire Heart. If the Hero didn't take the Sword of Aeons, he returns to the Guild and finds a clue in Maze's quarters that leads him to the legendary Avo's Tear. He, together with Briar Rose, travels to Hook Coast and puts the Fire Heart in the lighthouse when, suddenly, Summoners attack, and the two Heroes have to stop them. When the Summoners are defeated and the Fire Heart charges up, the Ship of the Drowned appears. The Hero travels on the ship to the Northern Wastes. From the coast, he travels to Snowspire Village to talk with Scythe. Scythe's plan is to ask the Snowspire Oracle about the evil that curses the Northern Wastes, but in order to do that, he needs some glyphs to awaken it, so he sends the Hero to the Necropolis, a great city inhabited by ghosts. There, he searches and digs for the glyphs while fighting the monsters that live in the city. After finding all four glyphs, he returns to Snowspire Village and awakens the Oracle, who tells him that the evil is, in fact, Jack of Blades. Jack now dwells in Archon's Folly behind the Bronze Gate, the opening of which, it was foretold, marked the end of the world. The Hero is told that, in order to open the Bronze Gate, he has to collect, with Jack's mask, the souls of three specific Heroes to place in the Archon's Shrine. These Heroes were: a King of the Arena, the Heroine, and the Oldest. These descriptions could match a lot of powerful Heroes. The Hero can now hear Jack's thoughts as he tries to manipulate the Hero to kill Thunder, Briar Rose, and the Guildmaster to fulfill the quota, while the Hero can follow the path of good and try to take the souls of already-dead Heroes and leave others unharmed, taking the souls of an unknown arena fighter, his mother, and Nostro. After opening the Bronze Gate, the Hero enters Archon's Folly and faces Jack again, who takes on the form of a dragon. After a terrible battle, the Hero once again emerges victorious as he casts down Jack's new form and receives the villain's fabled mask, which he finally realizes contains the being's soul. Scythe telepathically explains to the Hero that he must cast the mask into the flames to destroy it forever, all the while the mask strives to convince the Hero to wear it, thus being Jack's new host. The Hero feels Jack's influence within him and his promise for power tempts him to the edge. At this point, the Hero has two choices: Wear the mask and become the most evil being in the world, or cast the mask into the flames. . It is unknown to the history of Albion exactly which choice he made, although it is known that he had eventually sired children before retiring in his old age to a secluded cottage at the Serenity Farm in Oakfield.Powers and Abilities  As a descendant of the ancient Archons, the Hero of Oakvale became the most powerful Hero of his age, and eventually rose to become one of the most powerful Heroes of all time. After passing the vigorous trials of Hero training, despite suffering through the loss of his family, he emerged a master of Strength, Skill, and an incredible variety of Will powers. When only a young man, the Hero managed to defeat the feared ex-Hero Twinblade and his entire army of united bandits, displaying not only Strength, but also cunning. He was also able to defeat enemies, such as endless hordes of hobbes, nymphs, balverines, trolls, and the long-elusive minions. Passing through all the Arena challenges alive, a feat duplicated by few Heroes in all of history, the Hero of Oakvale further demonstrated his skill when slicing through the ancient armies of Lychfield Graveyard. Despite being locked up in Bargate Prison for a year, the Hero managed to escape, defeating some of the best-trained in the Albion Guard using only the most basic weapons. Once Jack of Blades' plot was revealed, the Hero also skillfully lead the charge against Jack's minion horde, defeating Maze, who was considered to be one of the greatest Heroes of the era, in the process. Catching up to Jack, the Hero slew him in a mighty one-on-one duel, performing an act that even the legendary William Black never could. After a year passed, the march of time did nothing to dull the Hero's skills in combat. Demonstrating remarkable will and fortitude, the Hero survived the lonely journey to the forgotten Northern Wastes, able to emerge triumphant in his battles against the deadly creatures that called it home. When the Hero met Jack for the final time, he once again duplicated the impossible feat, slaying Jack of Blades for good.Fable II  In Fable II, after 500 years, the Hero of Oakvale is dead. He doesn't make any appearances in the game, but is mentioned in some books and stories. The Hero is said to have wielded the Sword of Aeons, yet in the Chamber of Fate, it shows him taking the good choice by casting it away. Also, Theresa is alive, which is impossible if the Hero wielded the Sword of Aeons, as it required him to kill her to wield it. He might have wielded Avo's Tear, which was crafted to look like the Sword of Aeons, thus confusing in-game historians (also, nobody had ever really seen the Sword before, so they would probably only recognize it by its immense power). There is a Demon Door in Oakfield where many believe the Hero of Oakvale spent his final years in a retreat called Serenity Farm, as it is written in the description of the property.Trivia Gnomes are Evil!

The character may be either male or female by choice of the player at the beginning of the game. The game begins with the Hero as the Prince or Princess of Albion in what is presumably their late teenage years. The first part of the game is called \"The Road to Rule\" and requires the Hero to gain support for a revolution to overthrow their elder brother Logan, the current tyrannical and troubled king of Albion. The Hero must make promises to people to gain support of various regions and then choose to fulfil those promises or break them when they become the ruler of Albion. The title of \"Hero of Brightwall\" is given to them early in the game by Brightwall Academy's chief librarian Samuel, after they promise to reopen the Academy.Biography Beginnings  The Hero and their dog are roused from bed in the castle by the butler, Jasper, and are told to meet their childhood friend, Elise (if the Hero Prince was chosen) or Elliot (if the Hero Princess was chosen). Elise/Elliot tells them that Logan seems more tired and cruel these days, and tells them that - supposedly - a factory worker was executed for speaking out. They also ask the Hero to speak to the castle staff and Logan. After the speech, the Hero trains with Walter Beck\u00a0and breaks his sword with a flourish; as Walter is about to say something important, Elise/Elliot bursts in to tell them of a riot taking place outside the castle: Walter goes to speak to Logan but they insist that they go talk to him as well. Logan, feeling betrayed by his sibling, forces the Hero to choose between the life of sweetheart or the lives of the riot leaders. Whatever choice is made, the Hero swears to Logan that they will never forgive him for doing this.Revolution  Later that night, Walter and Jasper take the Hero - along with the Dog - out of the castle through the tomb of their parent, the Hero of Bowerstone. There they are given the Guild Seal and meet Theresa in the Road to Rule who confirms the Prince/Princess is indeed a Hero. She also mentions that she guided their parent to power 50 years ago. She encourages the Hero to gather allies to claim the throne of Albion and to improve their skills. Going through the caverns underneath the tomb, the group finds a Cullis Gate, which takes them to the Sanctuary of the Hero's parent, and serves as their base for the Hero's journey. The Hero and Walter travel to the Dweller Camp of Mistpeak Valley via another Cullis Gate and meet the Dwellers and their leader, Sabine. Sabine requires proof from the Hero in order to trust them. First, the Hero travels to Brightwall and locates an item belonging to their parent which is said to be in an underground cavern beneath the academy there. The Hero does so, fighting off hordes of Hollow Men, and finds the item: the music box their parent used to defeat Lucien Fairfax. Back at the Road to Rule, Theresa shows the Hero a vision of how far Logan had fallen, and it convinces the Hero even more to stop Logan once and for all. Next, the Hero is tasked to stop the mercenaries hassling the Dwellers. Disguising as a member of the gang, the Hero sneaks into their camp, but is quickly discovered at the camp's third checkpoint. Fighting through the camp, the Hero is challenged by the mercenary leader, Saker. The Hero defeats Saker, and is given the choice to spare him and gain him as an ally, or to kill him; either way they would leave the Dwellers alone. Finally, the Hero is tasked to bring food to the starving Dwellers; the Hero does this by doing quests for the villagers of Brightwall. Afterwards, Samuel, the librarian of the the Academy, dubs the Hero as \"The Hero of Brightwall\", and asks for a promise to reopen the Academy. Samuel then sends deliverers to give food to the Dwellers in Dweller Camp for the Hero. With the music box, security, and food given to Sabine and his people, the Dweller leader also makes the Hero promise to give back the mountains to the Dwellers if they follow them into battle. The Hero meets Walter at the Monorail Station, but the monorail is attacked by Hobbes, and the two warriors fight their way through to Mourningwood, where an old fort is run by two of Walter's friends, Major Swift and Ben Finn. After helping them defeat a legion of Hollow Men, Swift, Finn, and the soldiers agree to follow the Hero, as long as they promise the guards to be able to, \"protect Albion's people, instead of oppressing them\". Leaving the fort, Walter and the Hero travel back home to Bowerstone. Arriving in Bowerstone Industrial, they go through the sewers and meet Page, the leader of the Bowerstone Resistance. She also requires proof of the Hero's capabilities, so the Hero once again goes out and does quests to gain favour with the people of Bowerstone. If the Hero chose to spare Elise/Elliot in the beginning of the game, the Hero would reunite with them. Soon, the people of Bowerstone begin to trust in the Hero, and Page has the Hero join her in a rescue mission in Reaver's mansion in Millfields. Disguising themselves, the Hero and Page enter the party, but are soon forced to battle against the monsters inside via Reaver's Wheel of Misfortune. Afterwards, when Page tells Reaver who the Hero is, Reaver allows them to leave with Kidd, the only survivor. Page pledges herself to the Hero's cause, but only if they promise to take care of the poverty and oppression in Bowerstone Industrial. A herald then announces that Logan has an address to deliver. The Hero and Ben Finn fearfully go to the front steps of the castle, where they witness Logan order one of his solders to execute Major Swift for treason. Luckily, Swift passed a message on that allies could be found in the desert city of Aurora. The Hero, Walter, Finn, and Page make their way to the docks to secure a ship; Page remains behind while the other three make their getaway. However, on their way, one of Logan's ships attacks them and all of them are shipwrecked on Aurora. Ben is missing, so the Hero and Walter go looking for him along the Unknown Shore. Travelling through many dark caverns, Walter and the Hero are taunted by the Crawler, who eventually kidnaps Walter and begins to corrupt him. The Hero manages to save Walter and they both make it outside. Forced to leave Walter behind due to his weakness from being possessed, the Hero goes looking for help as they cross the desert, while the Crawler taunts them with visions of Walter along the way. The Hero eventually passes out, but is found by Ben and Kalin, leader of the Aurorans, and brought to the temple in their city for aide, along with Walter. After recovering, the Hero and Ben learn from Kalin that the Crawler and its army came to Aurora five years previously, based themselves in Shadelight and had been a menace to the city since. She also tells how Logan came a year later and witnessed the death of his allies to the Crawler and promised to make Aurora an equal part of Albion and give the land protection, a promise he never upheld. The Hero makes the same promise and so the Aurorans join their cause. The Hero visits Theresa once again, and she says that the Hero has the army ready to take the throne from Logan. With all their allies and a recovered Walter gathered, the Hero decides now is the time to attack Albion. With the help of their generals and their soldiers, the Hero attacks from Albion through the Bowerstone Old Quarter and defeats Logan's Elite Soldiers and, along with Walter, make it to the castle. They bust down the door of the war room, where Logan immediately surrenders and offers to tell the truth of why he became a tyrant, but Walter says it would wait until Logan's trial. The Hero is finally crowned the new King/Queen of Albion.Monarchy  Now the ruler of Albion, in the day following the coronation, the Hero has Logan stand trial for all his terrible deeds as king. Although many of the people call for his death, Logan says that he made his decisions because he had been visited by Theresa, who had warned him that the Crawler was slowly making its way to consume Albion in darkness and would subsequently consume the rest of the unnamed world as well. Afterwards, the Hero can either spare him for this and gain him as an ally, or execute him with a firing squad in the castle front yard. The Hero confronts Theresa, yet again in the Road to Rule, who tells them it was true: in exactly one year, the Crawler would attack Albion, and the Hero needs to raise 6,500,000 gold coins for the Kingdom Treasury to pay the army that would defeat the monster's minions. Plenty of adventures lay ahead for the Hero as they try to raise the money for Albion's future, including either keeping or breaking the promises made during their travels. Each event is explained by the Hero's new adviser, Hobson. Two of these quests may include direct income to the Treasury, one involving collecting a Diamond in the Sandfall Palace and the other involving collecting a Balverine Statue in Silverpines. 364 days after being informed of the attack, the Hero and Hobson convene in the treasury again. Hobson says \"happy anniversary\" to the Hero and begins reading off the various trivial tasks on the day's agenda. Suddenly, Hobson is interrupted as a portal appears. The Hero enters the portal, travels to the Road to Rule and is greeted by Theresa, who proceeds to reflect and comment on the Hero's decisions as ruler over the past year before sending the Hero out to face the Crawler in what she calls the Hero's \"true form\", the ultimate manifestation of their morality. After leaving the Road to Rule, the Hero is warped one day into the future in the war room, alongside all their allies, where Walter mentions the results of the army's defence and says it is time for the group to attack. The Hero, Walter and Ben Finn leave the castle and go to the Market, where they confirm that the Crawler is indeed attacking Albion. The Hero and the others fight several of the monster's minions, as they make their way through the market, until they begin to confront the Crawler itself. The Crawler then makes a desperate move: it assumes control of Walter's body and attacks the Hero with it. With little choice, the Hero finally slays the evil creature, but also Walter as well. Walter says the Hero made him proud, and dies in the arms of his student. The Hero erects a statue commemorating Walter in the courtyard of the castle. At Walter's funeral, all the allies to whom the Hero kept promises to will thank them and say their farewells, while those to whom the Hero broke promises will be absent. Theresa then teleports herself from the Spire and onto the courtyard in order to congratulate the Hero on behalf of their actions and says \"perhaps we shall meet again someday\". The Hero responds by asking Theresa \"aren't you going to tell me my future?\" Theresa refuses to tell and says, \"The future will reveal itself when it is ready to do so,\" and disappears back to the Spire.Traitor's Keep  After the funeral ends, the Hero returns to the treasury with Hobson, who says \"it feels like an eternity\" since they last spoke, and says they should move to the throne room as soon as the decorators have finished to further the future of Albion. An unknown amount of time passes as Hobson addresses minor decisions for improving Albion, and the Hero begins to fall asleep from boredom. However, their boredom is quickly put to rest when an unexpected assassin attacks the Hero. After a long duel, the unnamed assassin is slain, and Commander Milton, warden of the Ravenscar Keep prison, arrives in Bowerstone Old Quarter and requests that the Monarch, along with Hobson, accompany him to the prison in order track down the three criminals responsible. First Professor Ernest Faraday is captured on Clockwork Island, then 'Witchcraft' Mary Godwin is found at the Godwin Estate. It is then revealed that the third criminal, General Solomon Turner, has been dead for six months. Milton is revealed to be the real culprit behind the assassination attempt, and he captures Hobson and the Hero and manages to use one of Mary Godwin's machines to copy the Hero's appearance, voice, clothing, weapons and abilities. He plans to kill the Hero and assume their place on the throne, but only so he can sabotage the Hero's rule and, in his mind, free Albion. However, the Hero manages to break free due to Milton threatening to kill their dog, and after a long duel the Hero manages to defeat him. With his last breath, Milton says the people of Albion will rise against the monarchy and decide for themselves how they should be governed and then he dies. Following Milton's death, the freed Hobson makes a commentary of the events and suggests that the Hero should decide the future of the prison with Lieutenant Hadley; either free the former Anti-Logan rebels, maintain the status quo, or subjugate their own citizens. Whichever decision the Hero makes, Hadley becomes Ravenscar's new warden. After the opposition of the three isles is vanquished, the Hero begins their reign over the peaceful times that were to follow for Albion.Fable: Edge of the World  Seven years after the defeat of the Crawler, the Hero of Brightwall has led Albion into an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. On the eve of his wedding to his new bride, Laylah, the King is interrupted by Sabine, who informs him of a Samarkandian refugee named Shan that he and the Dwellers rescued. Before passing out, Shan gives grim tidings to the Hero King, revealing that the Darkness returned in Samarkand with the aid of Samarkand's new dictator, the Empress. Resolving to defeat the Darkness once and for all, the Hero King forms an expedition of the Albion Royal Army, taking Ben Finn, Kalin, and Shan along with him across the seas into the exotic desert lands. Ambushed by a fleet of vessels crewed by Hollow Men, the fleet is forced to divert from the Samarkandian port of Fairwinds and makes a hard landing. Forced to leave behind much of the heavy artillery, the army marches through the desert, with the Hero King saving his soldiers from an encounter with the seductive Sirens of Sky Blue Lake. Eventually rejoining the Great Trade Road proper, the army rests and resupplies in the oasis town of Sweetwater Trees. The next night, the Hero of Brightwall is warned by a villager named Shalia that the villagers, under pressure from the local Sand Fury tribes, intend to kill him and the rest of the Royal Army. Armed with this knowledge, the Hero successfully defends his army from the villagers' treachery before leaving the town. They are forced to change course, however, when they discover that Sand Furies have blocked the way through the Great Trade Road. Instead of facing them, the Hero King decides to march around them by diverting through the ruins of Asur-keh-la, a buried Samarkandian city crawling with Hollow Men. Leading the charge, the Hero of Brightwall urges his army to fight through the undead hordes and to keep marching on while he uses his Will power to destroy the underground ruin, with reburies the Hollow Men armies. He subsequently rejoins the army and continues the campaign. In desperate need for fresh water rations, the army marches to the Cave of a Thousand Guardians, only to find that the Darkness has already spread its presence there. Rallying his forces, the Hero of Brightwall leads the charge against the Darkness, purifying the area of its taint. Subsequently, he is allowed to call upon the cave's guardian spirit in the form of a Dragon named Percival, who offers to take the Hero to meet Garth. Flying ahead of the army to the monastery, the Hero of Brightwall is further taught by Garth to become a true master of Will. Formulating a plan with his father's old friend, the Hero of Brightwall resolves to sneak into the capital city of Zahadar with a unit of Garth's warrior monks to capture the Empress while Garth leads the Albion Royal Army in a frontal assault. Unfortunately, while the group successfully infiltrate the palace and find the Empress in the Garden of Pleasures, the Samarkandian ruler uses her beauty to distract the group long enough to incapacitate them. She follows this move by releasing the Darkness on the battlefield, which infects the river and engulfs the army on the verge of victory. This results in the retreat of the army and the death of Shan. However, while the Empress tries to use these setbacks and her beauty to break the will of the Hero, he proves immune to her psychological attack and is instead locked up in the palace dungeon while his friends resolve to regroup and launch another rescue attempt. After his capture, Theresa appears to him in a vision and reassures him that, even though he has been taken out of the picture, the Darkness can still be defeated. After his vision of Theresa ends, the Hero realizes that the Empress was fatally mistaken: There were still Heroes\u00a0in Albion.Gameplay  When the Hero becomes King or Queen, they have a series of choices to make. Making the right choices and keeping your promises to those who helped you become King or Queen will put you in debt of 3,200,000 gold coins. Donate the two items (The Auroran Diamond and The Balverine Statue) will give back 1,200,000 gold, thus making the final total debt of 2,000,000. If you wish to keep all of your promises and save all of Albion, the total amount of gold you will need to save up will come to 8,500,000. While this may seem difficult to achieve, the best way of doing it would be to start buying up properties and renting them out from early on in the game, and all the businesses (pawnbrokers, taverns, and blacksmiths are good early choices). To help with this, when you have become the Monarch, go to Sunset House and open the demon door, which yields 1 million gold. By the end of the game, the Hero of Brightwall has followed in their parent's footsteps and has become the greatest Hero and warrior in Albion, and has become one of the greatest Heroes in the history of Albion. This is proven by the single handed defeat of the Crawler and it's armies, a threat even the greatest Heroes of the late Old Kingdom could not end; the selfless act of killing their beloved mentor, Walter, to save Albion; and finally, Jasper's greeting in the Sanctuary, stating that the Hero performed a feat not even the Old King or Queen could have bested. Because of the Hero's bloodline to William Black, the Hero can master all three of the heroic arts of Strength, Skill and Will. The Hero will physically change depending on each art, but unlike all other Heroes before them, the Hero can only access their Will energy by using a magical gauntlet that manipulates the power that they already have.Powers and Abilities  As a member of the Archon's bloodline, the Hero of Brightwall was the most powerful Hero of their time, and eventually rose to become one of the most powerful Heroes of all time. During their childhood, the Hero was trained by Walter Beck, a skilled and experienced swordsman. At a relatively young age, the Hero was strong enough to slice Beck's sword in two during a training bout, to the experienced soldier's great surprise. Shortly after, they unlocked their heroic power by grasping their parent's guild seal. Despite having never used Will previously, the Hero was immediately able to use it after acquiring specially-made gauntlets. After discovering the weapons in his parent's Sanctuary, they also prove remarkably proficient with firearms. During their quest to overthrow Logan, the Hero grew incredibly strong in each of the three Heroic disciplines, and in combat was able to switch between them quicker than their parent was ever shown to. With both melee and ranged weapons, the Hero could perform stylish and lethal counterattacks that would astonish their foes. Like their parent, the Hero could use Will powers indefinitely, and could charge up spells far faster than the former could. In addition, the Hero was able to combine, or \"spellweave,\" two spells together to form an even more deadly one, a feat no other Hero was shown to perform. Throughout their journey, the Hero defeated and killed hordes of Hobbes, Mercenaries, Hollow Men, ghosts, Balverines, Sand Furies, Shadows, and even Dark Minions. While trapped by Reaver, the Hero (along with Page) was able to defeat every round of his \"Wheel of Misfortune,\" including his Balverine guests, greatly surprising the Hero of Skill. The Hero continued to prove their extraordinary skill as a combatant and as a leader during the revolution, skillfully leading their revolutionary forces against the larger army fielded by their brother, Logan. Captain Saker, Lieutenant Simmons, Connor, and multiple Sentienels all tried and failed to defeat the Hero. During the Darkness' assault on Albion, the Hero reluctantly slew the Crawler-possessed Walter in single combat, performing a feat that both Theresa and Jasper believed even their parent\u00a0couldn't perform and defeating a force that had beaten even the greatest Three Heroes of the Old Kingdom. Shortly into their reign, the Hero's skills did not diminish. They defeated Professor Faraday, Witchcraft Mary, and Commander Milton (now their doppelganger) in battle. Seven years later, during his expedition to Samarkand, the Hero defeated many Hollow Men, Jackala, and Shadows in combat, often turning the tide of large battles involving his men. Once he met Garth, his father's old companion's training allowed him to further his Will abilities. After his failed infiltration of the Empress's Palace, the Hero was distracted by her beauty and shot from behind, knocking him unconscious. Despite being told his friends were dead, the Hero's powerful will allowed him to resist the Empress's seductions.Relationships Logan  Logan is the Hero of Brightwall's elder brother and is one of the main enemies in the game. Little is known about the Hero's relationship with their brother before the game began. But it is stated in the game that Logan changed much over the years of his rule, so the Hero and Logan could have had a close relationship before Logan's choice to become a tyrant. It is shown in the game that Logan has a rather protective view of his sibling, constantly referring to the Hero as a child and keeping them in the castle away from Bowerstone. The Hero and Logan's relationship took a turn on the day the Hero left Bowerstone Castle. After the Hero and their Elise/Elliot interrupt Logan's meeting with Walter, Logan gives the Hero a choice: to kill a group of protesters or their childhood sweetheart. The Hero, despite which choice is made, tells Logan that they will never forgive him. Once the Hero takes the throne, they have a choice; to be good and spare Logan's life and gradually become allies again, or to execute their brother. If Logan is spared, he will state that he knows the Hero will never forgive him for the crimes he has committed.Walter Beck  \ufeffSir Walter Beck was the Hero of Bowerstone's adviser, companion (when the Hero was monarch) and friend, and is the Hero of Brightwall's mentor; the Hero and Walter have a very close bond between them and Walter acts like a father figure to the Hero. Walter is also the Hero's guide and trainer, teaching them how to fight with melee weapons and later on organizing their takeover of the throne. Walter is considered to be the Hero's greatest ally in their quest, and will remain loyal to the Hero regardless of their morality. After the Hero flees the castle with Jasper and Walter, it is up to Walter to direct the Hero, starting with recruiting Sabine, restoring Brightwall, recruiting the Albion army, joining with Page, travelling with the Hero to Aurora and finally helping to lead the Battle for Albion and the takeover of the throne. Finally, Walter was the one who crowned the Hero after the defeat of Logan and his army. Walter also helped run the Hero's armies for them and was the Hero's adviser in court during the Hero's reign when Albion was preparing for the arrival of the Crawler. The Hero is later forced to kill Walter, when the Crawler possesses him, and Walter willingly accepts his fate. His last words to the Hero was that they always did him proud. Walter is also the first and last person the Hero of Brightwall faces in combat during the main storyline.Jasper  Jasper is the first person the Hero speaks to in the game and is one of the most seen characters throughout the game. Jasper is the Hero's very loyal butler, and was previously the butler of Logan before he was forced to step down for unknown reasons. Jasper originally served the Hero of Bowerstone, and has known the Hero and Logan since they were small children, thus is one of the Hero's oldest and closest friends and is the caretaker of the Hero's Sanctuary after the Hero flees the castle.Elise or Elliot  Elise/Elliot is the childhood sweetheart and close childhood friend of the Hero of Brightwall. The Hero meets them early the game and they are the person who teaches the Hero the dynamic touch. At the start of the game, Logan forces the Hero to choose to kill either a gang of protesters, or Elise/Elliot. Should the Hero choose to have Elise/Elliot executed, they will tell the Hero they made the right choice, and that they love them. It is possible to marry them later in the game if you chose to spare their life and have the protesters killed.Fable Heroes  The Hero of Brightwall returns as the playable character, Hero or Hero King,  in the XBL Arcade title, Fable Heroes. Hero, again portrayed as a male, is one of the four characters unlocked by default. On the Hero Tile of the Abilities Board, Hero can unlock Lucien for 15,000 gold. At one point during The Credits level, Hero, Hammer, Garth, Reaver, and Lucien can be seen atop Hero Hill after the ritual performed with the Hero of Bowerstone as seen in Fable II.Trivia References Fable III Weapons  All weapons in Fable III. Note that with the exception of weapons purchased as DLC, given as out-of-game rewards such as the ones included in the Collector's Editon, or items specifically stated in their description, all weapons in Fable III are randomly placed in weapon shops, certain chests, or as the rewards for certain quests.Elvira Grey  Lady Elvira Grey is the seductive, voluptuous, but villainous Mayor of Bowerstone. In her youth, Lady Grey was convinced by Jack of Blades to murder her older sister, Amanda, so that she could inherit the position of Mayor. Elvira locked Amanda in the cellar of their childhood house, the Grey House. She later sold half the school library to commision the Manor.Fable and Fable TLC/Anniversary  After the Hero defeats the Arena, Lady Grey can be found in the waiting area with Thunder vying against the newest Arena Champion for her attention. She is thoroughly impressed by the Hero's deeds and becomes increasingly infatuated with him, much to the chagrin of Thunder, who had been courting her for some time. If you killed Whisper, she also expresses her disdain for 'family ties' and 'past glories' when Thunder threatens you for killing his sister, calling him an 'old fool'.Marriage and Exposure  There are two intervening quests, Mayor's Invitation and Investigating the Mayor (in Fable TLC and Fable Anniversary only), which you receive around the same time: Note: There is a glitch in Fable TLC that prevents the Hero from having sex and interacting properly with Lady Grey after marrying her. Lady Grey responds to all flirting and gifts with giggling, does not say a single word and keeps changing directions when walking as if she is stuck in between invisible walls. She will still turn to green when she receives the necessary amount of gifts and flirts, but the player will never be able to get her to ask to go to bed. It seems that this glitch occurs when the Hero does the Investigating the Mayor quest without giving Lady Grey any presents. At the basement of the Grey House Lady Grey will ask the hero to hand over the Amanda's letter, if the hero accepts the offer and beats Thunder at Headsman's Hill, he will directly be able to marry Lady Grey without presents.Quest Details and Outcomes  In Fable TLC, you may start both quests, but by completing Mayor's Invitation after opening up the cellar of the Grey House, it is possible to both defeat Thunder to acquire Thunder's Helmet, as well as turn in Investigating the Mayor to become the new mayor of Bowerstone. It is at this point that:Bugs/glitches  If you intend to do parts of both quests (to see the most conversation perhaps), they must be done in a specific order. Otherwise the game will glitch, causing the Guild Seal and all Cullis Gates to become non-functional. Specifically, the glitch happens if you perform the following steps: If you instead choose to expose Lady Grey, or go to Grey House before you have started the Investigating the Mayor quest by speaking to Gethyn, everything will be fine.Becoming the Mayor  At the end of either quest in Fable TLC/Fable Anniversary, the Hero will become Mayor of Bowerstone and have access to Lady Grey's chamber in Bowerstone Manor, where a Silver Key can be found under her bed. A Silver Key chest is also accessible in the chamber to obtain the Katana Hiryu. Note: If playing the original Fable, you must complete Mayor's Invitation in order to gain access to Bowerstone Manor, as the Investigating the Mayor quest exists only in Fable TLC.Headsman's Hill  The Headsman's Hill area is only accessible through a fight with Thunder over Lady Grey during the Mayor's Invitation quest, where you will find a Silver Key and a Demon Door (see below).Silver Key  In order to receive all the Silver Keys (without cheating), the player must complete all the mini-quests in the Mayor's Invitation until the fight with Thunder. While fighting him, you will fall off a cliff to Headsman's Hill. Fish out the Silver Key after the fight, then you can complete either quest. However, there is also an exploit available in both Fable and Fable TLC to get Unlimited Silver Keys. This is not possible in Fable Anniversary as the save system has been revised.Demon Door Grey House Demon Door Trivia Timeskip and Canon  In Fable TLC and Fable Anniversary, the Hero of Oakvale is given the choice between publicizing her crime or destroying the evidence. While the Hero of Oakvale can marry her, canonically, it is revealed in Fable II, that Lady Grey was convicted of being a witch, murdered by an angry mob, dismembered, and had her body parts spread across Albion. Her head was placed in a tomb she had named after herself for when she died, her lower body was placed in a cave in Rookridge (the Hobbe Cave), and her upper body was deposited next to Twinblade's coffin in his tomb. There are no records of this happening in Fable, Fable TLC or Fable Anniverary however, if the events of the Hero becoming mayor are accurate, this most likely happened in the other town that Lady Grey fled to, some time after she left Bowerstone for good.Fable II  Lady Grey returns in Fable II through a quest called Love Hurts. Her appearance and personality change drastically from Fable to Fable II due to her resurrection. She is more capable of love than she was in life, on account of the nature of her revival, and seems to have lost her manipulative, power hungry edge. Her appearance has also changed quite a bit, though whether this was an oversight or just her resurrection is unknown. She also talks of having to resew herself, which proves the resurrection didn't fully restore her, but only revived her corpse.Love Hurts Quest  IMPORTANT! This quest becomes available after reaching Bloodstone. In this quest, Victor, the gravekeeper of the Bowerstone Cemetery, has an obsession with Lady Grey and wants to reanimate her corpse. The Hero will be asked to collect three of Lady Grey's body parts. Once you have given him the pieces of her dismembered body, he uses a spell to reanimate her, and make her fall in love with the first person she sees. The Hero can then choose to let the lonely, love-struck gravekeeper marry her, or steal his bride-to-be for her/himself.Marriage  If you choose to marry Lady Grey, make sure you have a 5-star ring on hand. If you don't have a 5-star ring and you wish to marry her, you can run out and buy one and she will wander around Bowerstone Cemetery, or you can tell her to follow you to a jewellery store and propose to her there. The ring must be given to her quickly or you cannot marry her and she can no longer be found in the Fable World.Evil Hero Consequence  Lady Grey becomes afraid of some Evil characters and, even though she is in love with you, proceeds to run on sight, making it very difficult to marry her. If she does run, there are a couple solutions:Post-Marriage Tips Post-Marriage Notes Quest Bugs/Glitches  It is advised not to start the Love Hurts quest until after completion of the main storyline due to a significant number of glitches associated with the quest reward, and effects on the playability of the end storyline.Speed  Unfortunately, this particular quest contains a major bug that often prevents players from finishing the final part of the quest, because the grave keeper will not actually respond when you return with the head. This has to do with the Hero's speed as he approaches the gravekeeper (sometimes speed will not make a difference and the glitch will not change):Marital Homes Other Notes Trivia References Demon Doors  Demon Doors are magical doors found all over Albion. They were created long ago, in the Old Kingdom, for the purpose of concealing treasures. To enter the door and obtain the treasure, you must first complete a challenge set by the door itself - this can be anything from answering a riddle, to battling guardians. Inside every door, along with the treasure, is a unique area of land. Some Demon Doors, as in Fable II, conceal houses in which you can live. Demon Doors are among many ancient oddities, like the Gargoyles and Expression Statues, but unlike the latter, actually have separate and unique personalities. Some are known to be rather simplistic in intelligence, speaking with poor grammatical structure, while others consider themselves sophisticates and playwrights. Whether they were created with these personalities or merely developed them in the years since their masters left is unknown. Some Demon Doors even said they were people in the past. In Fable and the The Lost Chapters, the Demon Doors had the appearance of a bald, though strong looking man with an unkempt beard. In Fable II and Fable III, they have a more intelligent appearance, with carefully groomed beards and a full head of hair.Nature of Demon Doors  Most of the Demon Doors, if not all, seem to be a cursed Human. The Bowerstone Cemetery Demon Door claims to have been a man, and is still longing for meat, and the Oakfield Door claims to be a heart broken lover, likewise the Bower Lake Door claims to be Albion's Greatest playwright, Wraithmarsh's Door is an actor, and the Bloodstone Door a musician. Apparently the Demon Doors are artificially made, as the Oakfield Door holds Homestead, supposedly made by a powerful Will user, while the Fairfax Garden's Door claims to have been made by the first Archon.\u00a0 Demon Doors seem to be incredibly 'long lived' as the Rookridge Demon Door claims to have been around for millennia, and again, the Fairfax Door claims to have been made by the First Archon of the Old Kingdom, and the Oakfield Door's realm, Homestead, was supposedly where the Hero of Oakvale spent his last days, making him at least five hundred years old. Every Demon Door seems to have some requirements for them to open, even the Brightwood Door who is extremely reluctant to do so. It requests cheese, believing there to be a great cheese famine occurring, and then requiring the Hero to dress ridiculously, believing no self-respecting hero to do so. The only Doors to flat out refuse to open are Fairfax Gardens' Door, which claims to be the first Demon Door ever made, and the Lookout Point Door, which is reported to be the 'Primal' Demon Door. However, doubtlessly the Brightwood Demon Door did whatever it could to prevent being opened. Oddly this same Demon Door laments having once great treasures (the reward is male prostitutes outfit held in a cemetery), one, this means he is conscious of the treasures inside, and two, that somehow this same Demon Door had once been looted previously. The closure of Demon Doors has not really been addressed, as most so far appear to remain open. Exceptions to this are the Lookout Point Primal Demon Door, which closes on exiting, and the Wraithmarsh Demon Door, which is in the same location as the Barrow Fields Demon Door, and must therefore have closed at some point. The Wraithmarsh and Oakvale doors however have very different personalities. When the player finally does open the Fairfax Door, he makes a comment about the other doors, saying they're probably having a great time without him, and decides to join them, if only to ruin their fun, unwittingly opening for the Hero. This means that a Door's consciousness goes to the same place where all the others go after opening, perhaps even returning to their original states. In Fable III behind the Demon Door of Mistpeak Valley all the Demon Doors from Fable II are found and as you walk up to them you can hear them mentioning things about how they were opened. The only Demon Door that is known to be from Fable II is the Brightwood Demon Door, who talks about the lengthy steps taken by the hero's parent in order for the door to open.See also Theresa  Theresa is the immortal older sister of the Hero of Oakvale. Possessing prophetic powers due to her ancient bloodline, Theresa has a recurring role in all games as a guide to the Hero, and is frequently referred to as \"the Blind Seeress\". Being over six hundred years of age, she is one of the oldest known living beings in Albion, as well as one of the most deep and important characters with powerful, yet unclear motives.Fable and Fable TLC  As the daughter of Brom and Scarlet Robe and older sister of The Hero of Oakvale, she lived quietly in Oakvale, where she was born, unknowing of her inherited powers, and the future they would bring her. At that stage of her life, the only awareness she had about her prophetic powers were the \"strange dreams\" she had from time to time. No one but her brother (and later her mother) knew about her mysterious powers. During the Raid of Oakvale, she was kidnapped by Jack of Blades, and his bandits. Unwilling to give them any information about her brother, who had fled Oakvale, Theresa was left dying in the middle of the forest, her eyes blinded. After three days in the forest, she was discovered by Twinblade, a former hero, and now the bandit king. Twinblade realised the extent of her prophetic powers when she spoke of the future in her sleep. In time, he made her his second-in-command. Despite her blindness, Theresa possessed extrasensory perception due to her exceptional Will abilities, and was thus more than capable of killing all who opposed her. As she grew older, her power to see the future grew stronger. In his search to find the \"Bandit Seeress\", and ask her about his sister, her brother, the Hero, defeated Twinblade in a duel. The Hero was shocked to discover that the Seeress and his sister were one and the same person. After reuniting with her brother and unlocking hidden powers inside him, she left her old mentor, Twinblade, to whatever fate her brother had in store for him. After the Hero succeeded in the Arena and became the new \"Arena King\", Theresa met him again at the Grey House. She told him what she had discovered about Jack of Blades - that Jack of Blades was the one who blinded her, and left her to die in the forest, as well as that he was secretly holding their mother captive within the Bargate Prison. Searching for their mother on her own, Theresa was eventually captured by Jack of Blades. After the first battle with Jack (the final battle in the original Fable), she told her brother that he had a choice: to strike her down with the Sword of Aeons and gain the power Jack dreamed of, or cast it into the vortex and rid the world of its evil forever. Due to the apocalyptic outcome should the Hero of Oakvale have chosen the evil path and wielded the Sword of Aeons, that is to say \"eternal darkness under the rule of the wielder of the Sword\", it must be accepted that in order for the storyline to even continue, the Hero of Oakvale had to make the good choice. Regardless, Theresa was not seen in Albion for hundreds of years. After the battle with Jack of Blades, Theresa headed off to the mountains, and was taken in by a nomad called Palgan. An old Will user from the east, he offered to take Theresa to his homeland in the Eastern Kingdom. When Theresa saw him try to steal her prophetic powers, she killed him, and used his amulet to transport her to the east.Travels in the East  It is revealed in Fable: The Journey that, following the death of Jack of Blades, Theresa wandered the land, travelling through places like Miremoor before going east, to the desert land of Samarkand. Staying there for centuries, Theresa learned of the Tattered Spire from the great libraries there and subsequently made it her mission to rebuild the Spire in an attempt to protect others from the same kind of evils that had befallen her and her family. Returning to Albion, she used the deaths of the wife and daughter of Bowerstone's ruler, Lucien Fairfax, in an attempt to drive him to build the Spire.Fable II  During the introductory level of Fable II, Theresa convinces the main character's sister, Rose, to purchase a Music Box from a street vendor after suggesting to her that it truly is magical. After Rose's subsequent death, Theresa adopts her severely injured descendant and becomes their guide for the remainder of the game. She sends Sparrow on a quest to unlock his or her Will powers as well as instructing Sparrow on the nature of these new found abilities. She acts as a distant guide, communicating with the Hero remotely through the use of the Guild Seal. When she does make an appearance, it is to recruit the first of the three Heroes of Strength, Skill, and Will. After The Hero of Bowerstone becomes of age, Theresa agrees to help the hero avenge their sister's death and grants them permission to leave the Gypsy Camp. Theresa gives them equipment as well as the ancient Guild Seal. Theresa then sends the Hero to awaken their hero blood in the depths of the Old Tomb on the island in Bower Lake. Theresa later explains how to take down Lucien and gives the Hero Fate Cards. The fate cards show the future and the three other heroes of Strength, Skill, and Will that need to be collected before Lucien collects them for himself. Through The Hero's efforts, they recruit Sister Hannah who is destined to be The Hero of Strength. She is a monk at the Temple of Light in Oakfield. After Sister Hannah's adoptive father the Abbot of the Temple of Light is killed by Lucien's men, Theresa makes an appearance and persuades Hannah to join the group. Sister Hannah asks Theresa to be called \"Hammer\" from then on. Theresa brings Hammer back to the abandoned Heroes Guild in order to explain her role in Lucien's downfall. When The Hero returns to the guild, Theresa reveals that Garth, the man from the visit to Castle Fairfax is the Hero of Will. Theresa explains the relationship between Lucien and Garth and how their research together ended \"violently\". While Theresa orders Hammer to stay behind, The Hero goes to Brightwood Tower to recruit Garth. Garth is captured and taken to the spire by Lucien\u2019s Commandant. Though she is blind, Theresa is able to read\u00a0Lucien's diary to acquire information on gaining entry into the Spire. When asked how she is able to read without eyesight, Theresa claims she can look into worlds other than her own. From the diary, Theresa discovers that Lucien is recruiting Crucible champions as guards for The Spire. Theresa directs The Hero and Hammer, to Westcliff so that Sparrow might become Crucible Champion and subsequently infiltrate the Spire and rescue Garth. When the Hero returns from the Spire, Theresa welcomes their return after being gone ten years. Theresa then welcomes Garth and asks him to join them to end Lucien\u2019s plans. Garth agrees and the two retreat to the guild while the Hero catches up with Hammer. \u00a0\u00a0 Theresa, the Hero, Hammer, and Garth discuss how to access the third and final Hero of Skill. Hammer mentions that this Hero is likely a pirate called Reaver, who runs the port of Bloodstone. Theresa reveals that the only way of getting to Bloodstone is by going through Wraithmarsh, but Garth suggests using a Cullis Gate instead in order to bypass Wraithmarsh. Garth\u2019s plan\u00a0fails, and Hammer and Garth are separated from the Hero and their dog. The fog from Wraithmarsh temporarily dampened the guild seal which made it difficult for Theresa to give her instructions. \u00a0\u00a0 Upon the Hero's first entrance into\u00a0Wraithmarsh,\u00a0Theresa mentions,\"This used to be Oakvale, though it has changed\u00a0radically\u00a0since I saw it last, and that was a long time ago,\". Then she mentions, \"A reckless young villager made a deal with the forces of shadow,\" causing the destruction of Oakvale a second and final time. Once the Hero reaches Bloodstone, Reaver untruthfully agrees to join the Hero to take down Lucien however; Reaver needs the Hero to take his dark seal to a place called The Shadow Court back in Wraithmarsh. Theresa informs the Hero through the guild seal that the Shadow Court is responsible for the destruction of Oakvale. Theresa adds that there is more to the task than Reaver lets on. After uncovering the truth of Reaver's betrayal, Bloodstone comes under attack by Lucien's forces and The Hero and Reaver flee the town together. After the two meet up with Hammer and Garth on the Smuggler's Beach, the four of them defeat the Great Shard. Theresa finally appears on the beach and persuades Reaver to join them. Finally assembled the four Heroes, Hammer, Garth, Reaver, and the Hero of Bowerstone, she gives them the instructions on how to begin the ritual to summon the great weapon. After the ritual is complete, Theresa disappears until after the Hero of Bowerstone's final confrontation with Lucien. She then gave the Hero a choice between reviving everyone who had died from the Spire's construction, reviving specifically the Hero's loved ones, or giving them a large sum of money. Regardless of their choice, Theresa sends all the heroes away to where they wish then claims the Spire for her own. Theresa remained behind in the Spire for her own reasons.  In the See the Future DLC, Theresa was seen again, still at the top of the Spire after the Hero receives a model of the Spire from Murgo the Trader in Bowerstone. Using the Spire model would transport the Hero to the top of the Spire, placing them before Theresa. She greeted the Hero and insinuate that she intended them to make it back to the Spire. She would then give the Hero a glimpse of the future, showing the Hero as king/queen of all of Albion, with a loyal army and citizenry. Towards the end of the vision, the focus turned to a baby carriage, with Theresa standing next to it. A newborn lay inside, and Theresa mentioned the name Aurora before the vision ended. Afterwards, Theresa sent the Hero away from the Spire for a second and last time.Fable III  Theresa returns in Fable III, as a minor character, but has an important role as the Hero's guide and adviser. She temporarily resides in the\u00a0Road to Rule\u00a0in Fable III. When the Hero first enters the Road to Rule, Theresa introduces herself as, \"Theresa, Seer of the Spire,\" implying that she intends to permanently reside in the Spire. This explains in part why she chose to keep it as her own at the end of Fable II. While she is a main character in the plot line, she rarely appears outside of the Road to Rule, diminishing her role in comparison to Fable and Fable II. As always, the Seer is an elusive woman, telling the Hero only the basics of what they need to know. It is revealed by Logan that Theresa visited him four years prior, telling him of the impending attack that the Crawler will visit upon Albion. She fails to mention her responsibility for Logan's tyranny to the Hero on the Road to Rule. When the Hero becomes the King/Queen, she will admit her deception was necessary, as Logan's action proved that only with a Hero on the throne could Albion survive. The only two people known to have seen Theresa in the game are the Hero and Logan, though the Crawler and Reaver are aware of her existence. After the seer\u2019s second plan to downfall the crawler becomes a success, time stops and she appears to the new ruler of Albion in the gardens of Bowerstone Castle (during Walter\u2019s recognition). She congratulates the hero on their triumph and explains what consequences or achievements they now face by keeping or breaking the promises of their allies. Before she leaves for the last time, the hero asks Theresa if the time has come for their future to be disclosed. Theresa states \u201cThe future will reveal itself when it is ready to do so.\u201d Time resumes and Theresa disappears.Fable Heroes  Theresa appears as a playable character for the first time in the Fable series in the Xbox LIVE Arcade title, Fable Heroes. She is unlocked with Fable: The Journey, via gameplay on the same memory device and with the same profile. In the character introduction on Lionhead's website, Theresa is officially confirmed as a powerful Will user where it is also stated that her weapons of choice consist of the Force Push Spell Gauntlet and Fireball Spell Gauntlet.Fable: Edge of the World  Theresa does make a minor appearance at the very end of Fable: Edge of the World. The King of Albion has a dream, and Theresa appears before him. Theresa holds her arms out, and a dove lands on her right arm, and a raven on her left. Theresa then speaks \"Born a hero you were, and a Hero you are. Darkness has indeed come to Albion, and few there are and will yet be who can stand against it. But do not despair, King of Albion. The world has changed. The time approaches swiftly when Heroes are not born... they are made.\" Theresa then throws her arms up causing the birds to vanish. The King awakes to find two feathers, one white, one black. The King then understands that his dream was actually a vision.Fable: The Journey  Theresa appears in the Kinect title Fable: The Journey. She had been wounded by the Devourer, an agent of a darkness slowly taking over Albion, and encounters a regular Dweller named Gabriel driving his carriage through the Edgelands following the recent destruction of Reaver's Reach. While she does not seem to be seriously injured, it turns out that the wound severely weakened her powers. Trying to escape the Devourer, she pleads with Gabriel for his help; he agrees and pulls her aboard just before the Devourer arrives and starts destroying the woods around them. The Devourer hurts Gabriel's horse, Seren, so Theresa convinces Gabriel to earn the Gauntlets to heal Seren. Unknown to Gabriel, however, the gauntlets\u00a0attached themselves to Gabriel's arms. Theresa then makes a deal with the young Dweller, telling Gabriel that he must retrieve the first Willstone, found at\u00a0the Forge of Fire, and she would use it to remove the gauntlet. Gabriel reluctantly agrees. Travelling through the lands north of Albion, the duo arrive in the forest of Thorndeep, where they come upon the local woodsman of Woodseed, Fergus. Grateful, Fergus agrees to shelter Gabriel and Theresa for a night, but the next morning, the three are found once again by the Devourer. With Fergus guiding the group, they come upon the Forge of Fire, where Fergus is killed while battling the Devourer. Gabriel, inspired to do his duty following the loss of his friend, rejects Theresa's offer to remove the gauntlets, instead pressing on. Gabriel then finds the other two Willstones, and he and Theresa head off to the Spire to close the rift before the Corruptor's arrival. During their long journey they both make many resting points. Sometimes Theresa would tell stories to Gabriel, and he enjoyed them. One story she expresses to him is about her youth. Theresa states: \u201cPerhaps it is hard to believe, but I was not born as I am now.\u201d Theresa\u2019s point of view refers back to the original Fable. She tells Gabriel that once she was a sister, a daughter she had no knowledge of her gaining a power of seeing visions; she knew only the innocent life as a child, until Jack of Blades stormed her village and hauled her mother away. It was the last thing she saw and then, \u201conly darkness.\u201d She closes her story to Gabriel by telling him that when she was blinded, she was found by\u00a0the Bandit King, Twinblade. She entered into his service, and in return, he protected her; it was from that point on she discovered her power, and before long, she was protecting him. On another stop, Theresa\u00a0finally reveals what she did after\u00a0the death of Jack of Blades, travelling east into Samarkand and studying in the great libraries there. Learning of the Tattered Spire, Theresa resolved to\u00a0have it rebuilt and use its power to protect Albion from evil. It was with this in mind that the Blind Seeress finally returned home and sought out someone with the means to rebuild the spire. Using the deaths of Amelia and Helena Fairfax,\u00a0Theresa manipulated Lord Lucien Fairfax into rebuilding the Spire\u00a0to resurrect his family. Unfortunately, Theresa soon realized that in rebuilding the Spire, Theresa finally re-awoke the Corruptor's chief lieutenant, the Crawler. Desperate to end one of Albion's greatest threats, Theresa recruited the Hero of Brightwall to destroy the Crawler, but knew that the Corruptor would return. Finally ending her stories, it is then that Theresa admits to Gabriel's role in\u00a0her plan, as his new-found power is the only way to stop the Corruptor from reaching Albion. When Gabriel and Theresa reach the Spire, Theresa makes a wish and states that her time in this world is over and that a new age is upon us. She then gives the heart of the Spire to Gabriel and vanishes. Her blindfold is then found by Gabriel in the sand.Notes Trivia Video  Theresa's first appearance in Fable II (at the 3:03 mark, to the left)Quests  Quests are the main parts of the overall story, or separate side-stories, in the Fable series which can result in a reward of gold, renown, both or other. They can be optional or compulsory. They usually include various objectives.\ufeffFable and The Lost Chapters  There are four types of Quests in Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters; Gold, Silver, Bronze and Side Quests. Gold Quests are the Main Quests to help you progress in the games story line. Silver Quests are optional quests that are not part of the main storyline in the game. Despite being optional, these quests are a good source of money, renown and experience. Most Silver Quests are available at the Heroes' Guild in the form of Quest Cards, however, some of them are started by interacting with some NPCs, such as the trader in Orchard Farm Escort. The Bronze Quests are not given to you by the Heroes' Guild, but by the people of Albion, and also do not progress the storyline. And finally, Side Quests are very minor quests, like helping out a beggar or winning a race.Gold Quests TLC Gold Quests Silver Quests Uncompletable Quests TLC Silver Quests Bronze Quests TLC Bronze Quests Side Quests TLC Side Quests Fable II  In Fable II there are two types of quests: Main Quests, which progress the storyline, and Side Quests, which earn you renown and other rewards.

Relationship Quests are similar to the original Fable's Bronze Quests in their interaction with the inhabitants of Albion. They are an integral part of Fable III and will be performed throughout the game. Fable III has replaced renown with Guild Seals. Each quest you complete will reward a set number of Guild Seals.Main Quests Side Quests Criminals to Jail Quests Villagers to Work Quests Limited Collectors Edition Quest DLC Quests Fable: The Journey  Fable: The Journey does not have any side quests. Instead, Optional Stops are built into the main story.Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 The Red Dragon  The Red Dragon is a legendary weapon in Fable II. It is a clockwork pistol that has augments which make you cause more damage to enemies while taking less yourself.Description  This unique and exotic pistol once belonged to Wicker, the finest shot Albion had ever seen. Until Reaver appeared. Wicker visited Reaver and challenged him to an honourable duel to decide who had the greatest skill. Reaver's reply was to shoot him in the head. Although not obvious at first, The Red Dragon is one of the best weapons in Fable II due to it allowing the player to fire shots as fast as possible. This results in a typical damage output of around 125-150 damage per second (DPS), reloading inclusive. Comparing this to The Enforcer, which is a typical single shot Blunderbuss that only allows the specified 177 damage (approximately 85 DPS), the resultant DPS is much higher. It should be noted that as a player improves their skill level, guns will reload and fire more quickly with Speed Experience, and damage will increase with Accuracy. The Enforcer will\u00a0always give a player a minimum of 177 DPS. There is no reduction equivalent compared to a multi-shot weapon. It's obvious that to match the sheer destructive power of The Enforcer, a lower rated clockwork or turret handgun must get off more shots per second. A player with high experience is going to cause more damage with whatever weapon is used. The base point ratings of all weapons stays the same, whereas the player's character morphs and improves. The improvements add to the base point damage.How to Acquire  In order to acquire it you have to score at least 175 points at the Westcliff Shooting Range. The easiest way to get over 175 points is to always aim for the head. Headshots are worth 3 points, instead of just one. This means that you have to get at least 58 head shots and 1 body shot over the three rounds. It is also preferable to donate 5,000 gold to Barnum before completing The Spire so that you may aim for the bandits (who have bigger heads than the villagers). However this is not necessary. Take your time instead of shooting like a madman. And don't focus on the damage of the weapon you're using: Focus on the firing and reloading speed. It's recommended to use Clockwork Pistols, since they have 6 shots and reload quickly. It is not recommended to use rifles or blunderbusses because they block half of your vision. Blunderbusses fire multiple shots, which means that you can hit your target but the other 2 stray bullets can hit other targets that may reduce your score.Trivia ", "The Suffering Wiki": "The Suffering Wiki The Creature  The Creature is an apparent beast, or monster, that Torque seemingly becomes during periods of great stress. After prolonged fights with monsters on the isle, Torque appears to have a psychosomatic break and, at least in his own mind, becomes a raging beast. While no other person has reported witnessing the change, Clem has reported seeing the creature itself. Its appearance is described as a large muscular humanoid-like beast with inhuman speed and power, a blade replacing one hand, and extremely long sharp claws replacing the other, along with some sort of animal lower legs resembling a horse or large dog. Other specifics of his appearance tend to be slightly different depending on a number of things. The more Torque regresses into this state, the more physically powerful he becomes.The Creature (Carnate Island)  After arriving on Carnate, the inmate, Torque, first transforms into the creature after being attacked by several inmates in the holding area next to the docks. However, he later learns to transform at will after being provoked by the three ghosts of Carnate. From then on, Torque can raise his \"insanity\" level simply by defeating malefactors. After this level has peaked, Torque is able to transform. While in this form the level of his insanity slowly drops. However, when this level is fully drained, Torque will begin losing health and eventually suffer from another mental break, this time falling to the floor assuming a fetal position while sobbing.The Creature's Attacks  While Torque is transformed, he attacks in three different ways. He can simply slash in a flurry combination of his two limbs which seems to be a standard attack. Second, he quickly throws himself forward leading with his bladed limb, impaling most any type of enemies in front of him. And his third type he jumps, pounding the ground when he lands sending shock-waves out and damaging nearby malefactors. The more he uses this specific attack, the stronger it gets, adding to it the style of attacks of the enemies he's slain while transformed. This attack seems to have five stages. Stage 1: A simple shockwave damaging surrounding enemies. Stage 2: The shockwave accompanied by several Slayer blades emerging from the ground damaging surrounding enemies. Stage 3: The shockwave accompanied by a small explosion and debris that looks like bullets, similar to the marksmen's attack when one gets to close to them.. Stage 4: The shockwave accompanied by a number of chains like those of the burrowers extending out in all directions damaging surrounding enemies. Stage 5: The most powerful attack, The Creature pounds the ground resulting in a widespread explosion severely damaging, if not instantly killing, all surrounding malefactors or people in a very wide area. Similar to the Inferna special attack, but much wider and more damaging. When Torque is in this enraged state, and if he uses these widespread attacks, they do not discriminate between malefactors, enemy COs or inmates, friendly COs or inmates, or even explosives and collectable items that could be damaged (like throwing weapons.) Anyone nearby will be hurt or killed when he uses these attacks.The Creature (Baltimore) General  Though Torques enraged version changed very little, if any, while on Carnate, his \"creature\" form undergoes a few major differences as he begins to travel through Baltimore. The Creature's appearance depends on the multiple moral choices Torque makes, changing subtly in looks as well as attacks. Additionally, Torques dependence on this side of himself is much more crucial to his survival in Baltimore as opposed to Carnate, requiring its powers in order to eliminate certain malefactors and remove some obstacles which he normally could not. \u00a0 The Creature's Appearance (Good Morality)  The Creature obtains a bluish glow & clean-bladed arm, as well as bearing a bit more resemblance to Torque. This manifestation is most likely Torque's most humane transformation, and as such, it shows that Torque is still holding on to his humanity. This version of the creature also walks more naturally and grunts the least when moving and attacking. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Creature's Appearance (Neutral Morality) The Creature looks like a cross between its Good appearance and its Evil Appearance. It bears a strong resemblance to The Creature's Carnate Appearance. It represents a halfway point between Torque's Good and Evil personalities. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Creature's Appearance (Evil Morality) The Creature looks nothing like Torque. Instead it looks inhuman, with an insectoid and skinny appearance, seemingly with a complete loss of Torque's former humanity. The blade on its arm is blood-stained & jagged. This creature moves more erratically and grunts the most when moving. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Creature's Attacks  The Creature has three sets of attacks. The first attack is where the Creature uses it's blade-like right arm to cut through creatures (Press the Fire Button). The second attack is where the Creature lunges forward, grabs a creature and throws it to the ground, killing it (Press the Grenade Button). The Final Attack depends on your moral choices (Press the Jump Button). The Creature's Attacks (Good Morality) The attacks demonstrated by the Baltimore creature once again shows a mix of the Baltimore Malefactors' attributes. Level 1 - Burrower Chains The Creature extends two whip-like chains. This only affects enemies directly in front of you Level 2 - Triggerman Guns The creature bows and produces several high caliber machine guns, all of which fire as long as the JUMP button is held down. This only affects enemies directly in front of you. Level 3 - Isolationists Blast Hold the JUMP button to create a powerful energy field surrounding Torque, and then release the button to send out a devastating shock wave. The power of the shock wave depends on how long the JUMP button is held before releasing it. Level 4 - Cataclysm This attack causes massive, continuous damage to all enemies in the area, and ends only after ALL enemies are destroyed. This attack is a temporary ability. A meter will appear to show you. (Like the Health and Insanity meters) To fill it, you must kill in Insanity Mode or perform a Good deed. \u00a0 The Creature's Attacks (Neutral Morality) Special Attack - Ground Pound The Neutral form has only one special attack. He leaps into the air and slams his fist on the ground, knocking all nearby enemies to the ground. Similar if not identical to the creature from Carnate. The Creature's Attacks (Evil Morality) Level 1 - Slayer Blades The Creature bends low, and produces giant blades in a tight circle all around, damaging anything within range. Level 2 - Wretches Attack Wretches (Similar to the ones emanated by the Isolationists) leap out of the creature's back, exploding on contact with the ground or enemies at close to medium range. Level 3 - Arsonists Blast Press and hold the JUMP button to build up power, and then release the button to unleash a ring of fire that damages enemies in all directions. The power and range of the attack is determined by how long the JUMP button is held. Level 4 - Cataclysm This attack causes massive, continuous damage to all enemies in the area, and ends only after ALL enemies are destroyed. This attack is a temporary ability. A meter will appear to show you. (Like the Health and Insanity meters). To fill it, you must kill in Insanity Mode or perform a Evil deed. *Note: It's possible (by extreme hacking) to mix attacks from different moralities. For example, the creature can (good morality) use the Wretches Attack (evil morality) or ground pound (natural morality).Creatures/Malefactors  Here are the collected archives of all creatures encountered on Carnate and Baltimore. Only three characters have tried to study the creatures; they are Jordan, Dr. Killjoy and Clem. On each page there are notes from each of these characters. They're the encarnations of various forms of death and execution, and seem to have human characteristics. In particular those which bear great wrong doing and vengeance, or otherwise the suffering incarnate of the victims. They attack each other on sight and only work together to attack people only to continue fighting each other immediately afterwards. They are most likely the actual souls of the victims themselves (or their executioners) to seek vengeance (or ease their suffering) on others indiscriminantly. Their behaviour is related directly to how, and why they're killed and whether it's the victim or the killer. They're all extremely deadly to the average person and unless they're capable in some aspect (they have a gun, and good aim) they'd end up dead shortly after an encounter. They have appeared in other places other than Carnate, but in very small numbers, and hatred is the direct cause of their appearance. It can be said they're like hateful and vengeful ghosts. They have a special attraction to Torque and people like Torque for unexplained reasons (but most likely if anything how evil and tainted they are). And these people's presence (Torque's in particular) is enough awaken a whole history's worth of them in droves.Carnate Creatures Baltimore Malefactors Main Page   I adopted this wiki a while ago and have tried to keep an eye on it; undoing vandalism and poor editing; fixing typos, grammar, and spelling; adding info; generally slowly molding it towards being a good wiki. It is far from that, and I don't have a heck of a lot of time. But I am probably the biggest fan of this game that exists, and someone has to do it. There is a small list of pages below. If you know how to edit a wiki, feel free to add more of the important ones to the list. If you would like to add a page, or edit some old ones, that would be nice too. But, please see note to editors below. -Dr. Quincy Lancelot Killjoy, M.D., Psy.D.Notes to would-be editors  I am not an RPer. But I would like to see at least the opening of each page, and preferably the entire entry, be written in a style as though the events of the game are real. I believe this is known as an \"In universe\" style while also keeping the language encyclopedic. It's extremely hard, nigh impossible, to write wiki articles on comics and games without the in-universe style. And seeing as that rarely goes on here at wikia, and I am an all or nothing type of person, I find it best to just go with that style. The obvious exclusions would be the two articles on the two games themselves, but even those could be in an in-universe style if you think of the games as a sort of interactive movie based on the events they tell... or whatever. In keeping with this in-universe style, one of the hardest things to do is give tips on how to defeat a malefactor. A good example of doing this would be as such: A bad example of this would be (more to come)Torque  Torque is the main character of The Suffering series. He was found guilty on one count of manslaughter and two counts of murder by a Baltimore County court and sentenced to death at Abbott State Penitentiary. His last known official location was the docks in Baltimore where he was delivered by the last ferry coming from the island. After various sightings throughout Baltimore, his exact whereabouts and condition are currently unknown.Early Life  Torque was born on 12th of March, 1974 in Baltimore to unknown parents and eventually placed, and raised, in Garvey's Children Home, facing bullying from other children there. It was there that he met his future wife Carmen. They married and had two children together, Cory and Malcolm. Before the birth of Malcolm, Torque was allegedly set up for murder by the criminal gang lord Blackmore, and spent an unknown amount of time in Eastern Correctional, a Baltimore prison. It was during a visit there that Carmen informed him of her intentions of divorce. They apparently reconciled some time later as they were living as a family at the time of the deaths of Carmen and the children. The staff at Garvey's Children Home where troubled because Torque made references to a \"tall man\" visiting him at home despite having no records of visitors. According to Blackmore, Torque might have worked in a gym.  Torque has suffered from black outs his entire life. He alleges that some of the most heinous things he's been accused of he does not remember and blames said blackouts.Murders, Trial, and, Sentencing  In summer 2004, Torque's wife and his two children were found dead at their home in Baltimore. Carmen was found in the master bedroom bludgeoned to death, Malcolm was found drowned in the bathtub, and Corey had apparently fallen to death from the second story window of his bedroom. When police responded to scene, Torque was found unconscious in the main hallway of the house. Though he claims to have no knowledge of the events or how his family died. However, with no other suspects, the fact that Torque was at the scene and covered in his wife's blood, and through questionable practices on the part of the prosecuting attorney, Torque's trial was fast-tracked. He was found guilty despite no witness testimonies and a severe lack of substantial evidence. However, shortly after his sentencing, the prosecutor of his case was indicted and Torque's trial was to be reheard.Events of Abbott Cataclysm  Shortly after arriving at Abbott State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, large scale seismic activity struck the island. Video surveillance throughout the prison shows strange creatures appearing shortly after. Such surveillance of D-Block shows the deaths of all of the death-row inmates save for Torque, who's cell doors seem to malfunction allowing him to escape and arm himself. Fighting his way through the prison and the rest of the island, Torque learns about Carnate Island's horrifying past as well as what happened to his family during his black out. Ghosts from Abbott's past either help or hinder Torque, and human characters often need or offer assistance to escape the island. The ghost of Dr. Killjoy, Abbott's former prison doctor, takes special interest in Torque and tries to cure him. Depending on the player's actions through the game, the mystery of Torque's family's death will be revealed in one of three endings.The Creature  In The Suffering, after so much fighting and killing enemies, Torque can transform into a beast known as The Creature. To the player and Torque it looks like a large beast, with dog-like legs, a blade instead of an arm, and large powerful claws for his remaining hand. In this form Torque is very strong and can dispatch most enemies with ease. However, to all other characters, it is suggested that Torque appears no different, instead simply seeming to be enraged. Dr. Killjoy links Torque's black outs with the appearance of this creature and blames a combination of psychosis, such as schizophrenia, severe and chronic melancholia, and dissociative personality disorder.Malefactors  This category contain the creatures from the Carnate and BaltimoreSlayers  The Slayer is one of the first and most common enemies found on the island after the cataclysm. Most slayers can normally be taken down by any inmate or officer trained with a firearm. However, this creature has since found a way to regenerate any damage dealt to it, or even seemingly revive from death, aside from removal of it's head, likely connected to its representation of beheading. The Slayer is remarkably swift and agile, however, and should be taken care of quickly.The Carnate Slayer  The Slayer is seemingly the representation of death by decapitation. It has long blades for arms and legs, and its head is held apart from its body by apparatus made of flesh and steel. For reasons unknown, slayers have the ability to traverse along walls and ceilings making them often elusive. They are not often the most stealthy of creatures when on the move, their blades causing a signature sound when moving. This causes them to be easily locatable, and commonly ensures they cannot effectively ambush an inmate or C.O., unless they are distracted. While there are small variations in the appearance of many slayers, there seem to be two distinct forms (aside from the ones that can regenerate). The average and most common slayer has a single blade resembling a rusty machete at the end of each limb (arms and legs). There are some less common ones that stand much taller and have a heftier build along with more complex compound blades. These larger slayers have the ability to block small arms fire with their larger blades and can often take much more damage making them more difficult to kill.Attacks  Slayers are fast and athletic, having the ability to crawl on walls and ceilings. The Slayers have many different attacking techniques, including;Archive Entries  \"I first witnessed these creatures jumping out of the ground itself. Their heads are detached from their torso, held aloft by hideous contraptions. Their limbs have been replaced by blades of the sharpest steel. To my eyes, they appear to be a manifestation of decapitation, yet it seems improbable that anyone ever had their head cut off in Abbot. I suppose on Carnate anything is possible. I have dubbed these monstrosities Slayers.\" \"This creature moves with the grace of a ballet dancer but kills with the precision of a master swordsman, a most troubling combination. The creature's origins lie with that form of execution popularized by those ingenious French: beheading. Each Slayer seems to have its own unique head, attached by a vile apparatus which evokes something I wish I had created. Indeed, here is a creature whose very existence fills me with jealousy that I did not construct it myself. I admire this work of homicidal craftsmanship.\" \"This is the most pervasive of all malefactors we've encountered. The Slayer has a basic human body shape, but with blades replacing the legs and arms and a metallic apparatus suspending the head. Given its context, the Slayer's appearance evokes blade wielding street criminals, though this malefactor's blades are longer and sharper than one normally finds on even the most violent Baltimore streets.\"The Baltimore Slayer  This Slayer is the embodiment of death by sharp blade-like objects. To this effect, it is first seen at the scene of a robbery at knife point, where it attempts to attack Torque. Slayers in Baltimore are very similar to their appearance in Carnate, albeit with a red tinge. They represent murderers who used blades in their crimes.Tactics  Keep moving to avoid the Slayer's attacks. Staying still during a Slayer's onslaught is suicide, so continue moving and shooting with an automatic weapon. A very handy tactic is to shoot the Slayer's head off. The Slayer will no longer be able to see the player, and will blindly flail it's blades around in a vain, and will be an easy target. The Slayer is also weak to any form of light. If you see a spotlight, shine it directly onto the Slayer, and it will instantly die. Encountered:The Suffering: Ties That BindSlayer Captain  Slayer Captains are distinguished by their black armour and smokey look. Like all Captains, it can only be killed in\u00a0Insanity mode.Dr. Killjoy  Dr. Q. L. Killjoy was a psychiatrist and medical practitioner who's known career existed primarily on Carnate Island, at the facility known as Carnate Asylum. Despite his well known disregard for individual human life and controversial methods, it is believed that his underlying intentions stemmed from a good will. His specific study was in the treatment and curing of conditions such as schizophrenia, paranoia, severe and chronic melancholia, disassociative personality disorder, and other severe psychoses. Despite this, his treatments were considered dangerous, abusive, and often deadly. He is voiced by John Armstrong.In The Suffering  He once worked out of the Asylum in the early 1900s. He used many deplorable methods on his patients, more often than not resulting in their death. No one knows what happened to him, but his spirit now lives on through old film projectors. Killjoy gains an interest in Torque during their first meeting and tries to cure his mental instability, though the reasons for this are ambiguous at best. Torque meets him at several points of the game and confronts him in the old ruined Asylum, wherein he destroys Killjoy's projectors. Following this, Killjoy delivers Torque a diagnosis and makes a final apparition right before the final battle to deliver him his \"cure\". This \"cure\", which is a device patented by Killjoy which allows energy to be fired, is crucial toward the end of the game in defeating Torque's Hatred at the docks, thus curing Torque's instability and allowing him to be rescued from Carnate by the skiff. He represents the past.In The Suffering: Ties That Bind  The former operator of the Carnate Institute for the Alienated who has followed Torque to Baltimore. As a doctor he wants to help Torque understand his mind and ultimately cure him of his dementia. To this end he serves as something of a guide for Torque although his methods of guidance are questionable at best. In his journal entry for the character Jordan, he mentions that malefactors have been appearing in different parts of the world in small numbers for many years, and the incidents from Carnate Island and Baltimore are the first time they have appeared in large numbers. This would indicate that perhaps Torque, with his horrible past, has something to do with these apparitions. Or perhaps even Blackmore himself, who might not be just an alter-ego born from Torque's supposed mental illness, but perhaps a demon or spirit of supernatural origin, similar to the malefactors. Not long before the final showdown between Torque and Blackmore, the Doctor claims that he met Torque's mother once, hinting that he and Torque share a deeper relationship that has yet to be explained.Archive Entry  One of Abbott's most persistent legends tells of Doctor Killjoy, the quite insane psychiatrist/surgeon who ran an asylum on Carnate. Doing research of my own, I found that he did indeed exist, though which stories are true and which are fabrication is anyone's guess. Since the cataclysm I have three times seen a surgeon formed of pure light, reminiscent of sixteen millimeter film projection come to life. Could this be the fine doctor?Characters  This category contain characters from Carnate and Baltimore.Mainliners  The Mainliner is a common enemy encountered in both Suffering games. There are two documented strains of this creature.Carnate Mainliners  First Appearance: The Suffering Chapter 4, \"Abbot Prison Blues\"Representation  These Mainliners are a representation of lethal injection, making them the most modern Malefactor on Carnate.Appearance  The Mainliner is a small, squat humanoid creature with withered orange skin. Their most distinguishing trait is that they possess several glowing green syringes stuck into their back. Their eyes are also replaced by syringes, one of them protruding from the back of its head as well. They have an inconsistent amount of limbs, having one arm with two fingers, the other stumped at the wrist, and having one footless leg, while the other ends at the knee. Due to this, they slither around along the ground in a grotesque manner. They are clad in what appears to be white briefs. Their blood is green, and appears to be replaced almost entirely by a mixture of sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride (chemicals in the lethal injection needles), indicating they suffer when they move.Baltimore Mainliners Representation  Baltimore Mainliners are an embodiment of Baltimore's history of drug scandals, such as the numerous junkies found in its poorest neighborhoods, though the Mainliner is believed to represent an agressive drug dealer rather than a junky.Appearance  Baltimore Mainliners are noticeably more human-like in appearance and having greenish skin, although they still retain their withered limbs. Another obvious difference is that the needles are now orange, containing a purified heroine-derived narcotic. They have buzzcuts, and only one of their eyes is replaced by a needle, the other being sewn shut. Their right arm has a leather band tied extremely tightly around it, and a needle jammed just below it. They also now wear green shorts. Their blood is still toxic, but is now orange.Telltale Sign  Large blood stains or shallow pools of liquid on the ground tend to hint that Mainliners will appear, as they are able to spawn from, and travel between, these pools. They will also let out a guttural squawk when they see Torque, signalling their appearance. Although it is much less prevelant, corpses covered in syringes may also signal that they will appear.Attacks  The Mainliner's primary attack is to pull a syringe from their back and to throw it at Torque or others. They can be thrown from a decent distance. The screen turning a sickly green indicates that Torque is hit. They will also attempt to jump on Torque and inject a syringe directly into his neck.Strategy  Mainliners have relatively low health. It is important to look around to see where they can spawn. The Mainliners' needles will immediately cancel out Torque's monster form, so use normal weapons to dispose of them.Baltimore Mainliners Archive Entries  Clem's Entry \"In the 1970s, lethal injection was introduced as the most humane means of state sanctioned killing. To date, twenty-five such procedures have taken place in Abbot. This creature - I call him the Mainliner, appears to suffer with every move he makes. Perhaps the mixture of sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride in his veins is not to his liking. The numerous needles jabbed into his body cannot help his disposition.\" Dr. Killjoy's Entry \"Surely the most pathetic of all the creatures, this vile thing slides along the floor, preferring to stay out of sight until presented with a chance to pounce. The glowing needles on its back work against its stealthy nature, however, with the light dashing its best attempts to stay concealed. This is the most modern of the creatures, using a means of execution far too scientific to have ever taken place during my time: the people of modern times call it \"lethal injection.\" Even I find this perversion of medical science upsetting, because it is so extremely cold and calculated. My own patients may not have had a terribly high survival rate, but my experimental and risky work was done in the name of science. My patients' deaths were not because I perverted medicine with the express intent of snuffing out their lives.\" Jordan's Entry \"An offshoot of the mainliner seen on Carnate, this malefactor's appearence is evocative of the numerous junkies that one finds in Baltimore's poorest neighborhoods. Its innate behavior is to assault enemies with its syringes, suggesting that it is more an aggressive drug dealer than a drug abuser. The syringes that we have analyzed contain a unique heroin-derived concoction that is capable of insantly killing almost any human immediately upon injection.\"Marksmen Carnate Marksman  First Appearance: The Suffering Chapter 2, \"Descending\"Representation  Marksmen are a representation of execution by firing squad, being an incarnation of both the firing squad and their victim.Appearance  The Marksman is a huge, muscular creature. They either lumber around, almost dragging their knuckles, or gallop. Their skin is tan and decayed, covered in bullet wounds. It has a bald head, and wears a blood-stained blindfold over its eyes, yet can somehow still see. On its back is a huge, fleshy mass that has four rifles attached to it, and is attached to a rotating turret. They are clothed by green-brown pants, army boots, and fingerless gloves. They also have bayonets protruding from their shoulders.Baltimore Marksman Representation  In Baltimore, Marksmen represent Union troops being sent to quell civilian uprisings in 1860s Baltimore. These Malefactors are forced to continue this task.Appearance  These Marksmen are near-identical to the Carnate Marksmen. They, however, have red glowing goggles over their eyes. Their pants are now blue, and they have metal bars sprouting from their shoulders. Their bodies also appear to be much gorier, looking like their intestines are partially pouring outTelltale Sign  These guys have no specific sign other than the lumbering sound they make when they move, but due to their size, they are often hard to miss. If you're taking damage, and you don't see the source, make sure that a Marksman isn't sniping you from afar. They will, however, erupt from the ground, attached to a wooden pole, so if they appear in this way, a rumbling will signal their appearance.Attacks  Periodically, they will get down on all fours, aim all of their turrets at you, and fire one to five bursts of bullets, or a constant stream like a machine gun. Move quickly out of the way to avoid both attacks. While the damage from said attacks may seem minimal, it really adds up when fighting more than one Marksman, so watch your health bar. They also have a close-range attack, where they are able to make bullet shrapnel burst from the wounds on their bodies.How to Kill  The Marksmen can take a lot of damage. The best way to know when the Marksmen are dead is when it throw it's hands up and finally fall over. Aiming for limbs and shooting or cutting them off will kill them instantly. Killing the Marksmen up close with a melee weapon can be very reliable, but sometimes risky because an attack where it shoots out bullets from its chest at short range.Special Notes  They will often pop right up out of the ground, tied to wooden posts, representing the way firing squad victims were restrained. This also gives you a small window during which you can shoot them without fear of retaliation.Archive Entries  Clem's Entry \"Based on the battery of rifles attached to its back and the blindfold around its head, these Marksmen appear to be the reincarnation of a military firing squad. Abbot was originally a P.O.W. camp during World War II, so it seems likely they would have had executions of that sort. Indeed, there are stories of a rogue Colonel who was to be court martialed but instead took his own life. Perhaps he is connected to these abominations.\" Dr. Killjoy's Entry N/A Jordan's Entry \"This malefactor is nearly identical to ones we saw in large quantities on Carnate Island. It wears a giant battery of rifles on its back, and is able to erupt out of the ground, a particularly impressive sight due to its significant size. In Baltimore's troubled past, there were a few rare occasions of the military being called out to quell civillian uprisings. One can only imagine how this Marksmen ties to those intense events.\"Fester  The Festers are malefactors encountered on Carnate Island. First time fought: The Suffering Chapter 13: Dancing at the Dawn of the Apocalypse.Representation  The Festers are a reincarnation of slave traders that crashed a slave ship on Carnate's shores several decades earlier. Albiet it is very abstract, the Fester represents being eaten alive. Specifically, the slaves were left in the hull of the ship by their traders, unable to escape, and eaten alive from the outside-in by rats. They are forced to continue setting this punishment on their victimsAppearance  The Fester is an immese, bloated Malefactor. They have mottled grey skin, which appears to be made of some sort of metal, and they possess several large sewn-up gashes on their torso, the most notable being on it's massive stomach. It has a bloated, caucasean head, which is contained in a tight metal cage with spikes along the neck. They have metal braces on their wrists and ankles, and a large hook piercing their left hip. In their right hand they wield a large metal ball-and-chain, which they use as their main weapon. A colony of Festering Rats lives inside each Fester's stomach.Telltale Sign  The Festers rarely are able to surprise Torque. They mostly only spawn by emerging from bodies of water, such as the ocean on Carnate's beach. Because of their massive size and weight, the ground quakes with each step they take. The clanking of their ball-and-chain is also very audible.Attacks  The Fester's main method of attack is to use their ball-and-chain to hit the ground in front of it, which causes a damaging shockwave. Beware, for their attack can (rarely) kill you in one blow. The Fester may also allow a swarm of Festering Rats to burst out of the seam on their stomach. If you get too close to a Fester, it will smack\u00a0Torque\u00a0with the back of it's hand. Festers can also (but only for a very short time) sprint forward after Torque and slam him.Tactics  Festers are unique among enemies in that bullets have no effect on them whatsoever, simply reflecting off it. The only way to kill them is to either throw whatever bomb you have on you at them, or to hack them open with the shiv or fire axe. So, basically keep your distance until you see an opening, and run up and slash them before they hit you with that heavy mace. Also, a well-thrown Molotov Cocktail will not only ensure the Festers' doom, but also kill the Festering Rats that they will release when they die. On harder difficulty settings, Festers take more explosives to defeat, averaging around 2-3 on Normal difficulty alone. On a side note, Festers can be easily dispatched by attacks in Insanity mode, which is useful in confined spaces.Special Notes  When they die, Festers will release Festering Rats once again, as a final hurrah. If the corpse is burning when they do this, all the rats will explode before getting a chance to attack. On later chapters, Slayers will often attempt to attack Festers with their blades, so an ideal tactic is to wait for the Slayers to dispatch the Fester and then deal with the weaker malefactors.Archive Entries  Clem's Entry \"Continually emerging from the slave ship, these are the festering creatures who foil my attempts to escape this confounded rock. Rats live within their flesh, writhing within it and then springing forth randomly. They appear to be a reincarnation, not of the slaves- for then, they would be of darker skin tone- but instead of the slave traders. In this form, they are forced to live out again and again the fate they forced upon those hapless slaves.\" Dr. Killjoy's Entry Festers do not appear in The Suffering: Ties that BindInferna  The Inferna is one of the latest and least common enemies found on the Carnate Island. They are rather difficult to kill as they move quickly and have to be evaded just as quickly, making it difficult to sustain an attack on them. Once they have taken a significant amount of damage in their flame form, they are reduced to a pile of ash. If the ashes are not destroyed, they will revive to their flame form and have to be defeated again. While their flaming and aggressive form is mostly seen in the area around the lighthouse and the roads leading from their to the docks (chapters 18 and 19), signs of their existence can be noted in and around the quarry (Torques path from the prison yards to the asylum). Sounds of little girls giggling, small fiery footsteps, and even a chain-link fence that has been obviously burned through. Some even report glimpsing them in their more human form running away on occasion. The first time they are fully seen they are in their human form and they set a large fire in the the quarry that Torque must put out before proceeding.Appearance  In human form, an inferna may appear as a seemingly harmless young girl in a white Puritan dress, and sometimes clutching a doll. In their aggressive form, however, they have blackened charred skin and their dress is ragged, black, and burning. Infernas cannot be damaged in their human form. It is possible that they have some sort of protective aura since no source of damage effects them in this form. Bullets even seem to stop short of the target and fall to the ground. However, approaching them usually results in their transformation.Combat  By moving quickly, encircling their enemies, and leaving dangerous paths of flames on the ground, they are masters at being quite deadly without a lot of offensive action. They only have one actual move that can be considered an attack. They will stop moving, pause briefly, and then send out a flame-front in all directions. However it dissipates after about 6-8 yards. They are susceptible to seemingly all forms of damage in their flaming and ash forms. However, guns and, to a lesser extent, explosives should primarily be used as melee weapons need proximity to be used. The Tommy gun seems to be the most proficient weapon when aimed well and fired in short to medium bursts. It is best to learn the infernas patterns and engage with caution. An offensively defensive style of battling them is best, retreating slowly while firing. Once their flame form has been damaged enough, they will pause and then fall into a pile of ashes. The pile must be dispersed, which takes more effort than you might think. Several shots are needed from any gun aside from the shotgun. If the ashes are not dispersed, the inferna will reemerge in her flame form completely healed.[This section needs revision]  Flames that Infernas are going to come out of ALWAYS make a hissing noise that resembles giggling, which is possible to hear even if you aren't close enough to see it. To stop the Inferna from coming out of said fire, just wait until the Inferna makes that really high-pitched scream and just toss a shrapnel grenade into the fire.Clem's Entry  \"From what I have witnessed, this manifestation of evil appears to have two distinct forms. The first, a young girl, Puritan dressed, perhaps 13-years of age. This transforms into an all together more disturbing, flaming creature. Both clutch a small hand made doll. To my mind, there is no doubt that these creatures are tied to the three young girls who made witchcraft accusations in the late 1600s, and lead to the incendiary death of eleven innocents.\"Trivia Noosemen  The Nooseman has only been encountered on Carnate Island. First Appearance: The Suffering Chapter 6: I can sleep when I'm dead.Appearance  A torso, hanging by its neck from a long rope. It has lost its lower body, and thus can only attack with its arms. It also appears to have a sack covering its head, either that or very few facial features. As odd as it may sound, the Nooseman's rope may be keeping it \"alive\", as it's death animation is reminiscent of someone strangling to death on the floor. The Noosemen represent the COs who were lynched as an act of revenge for inmates they left to die in the mines. The COs were skinned and mutilated, much as the Noosemen are.Location  Sometimes, if the player happens to look up, they will see a large spot of blood on the ceiling, or even suspended in midair. Noosemen drop from these spots, and only these spots. The player could play through the entire game without so much as encountering a Nooseman just by avoiding walking under these spots.Attacks  The Noosemen's only attack is to drop from the aforementioned blood spots and grab Torque. Once they grab the player, they will strangle until they are shaken off by rapid button pressing. After that, they will hang for a few seconds (where they are vulnerable to attack) before returning to the ceiling.\u00a0The player can avoid this attack by spending as little time as possible under the blood spots. It demonstrates its attack when a CO stands under a pool of blood on the ceiling. It will drop down and strangle the CO. If you shoot the Nooseman before he finishes strangling the CO, he will drop the CO, the CO will then stand,\u00a0fall to\u00a0his knees as if hes been shot and die.Method  After they attack the player, in the period where they are just sitting there, they are vulnerable to attack, but the player's window of opportunity is very small. The player must attack the Nooseman with a weapon before it returns to the ceiling. There is also the rare case where they will drop down and miss the player, but those opportunities are few and far between.Special Notes  It's not really productive to kill Noosemen, because they can appear infinite times out of the same blood spot. It's best to just avoid them.Archive Entries  Clem's Entry \"Not only is this Nooseman dead from being hung by the neck, but he also appears to have had his skin removed. I wonder if these creatures are tied to the legendary story of the inmates who, outraged by the death of fellow workers in a Quarry mining accident, hung and skinned five C.O.s. The Nooseman are more supernatural the many of their brethren, ripping themselves straight out of the ceiling in an entirely impossible manner.\" Dr. Killjoy's EntryBurrowers  Burrowers are one of several types of creatures that appear both on Carnate Island and in Baltimore, MA. Following the cataclysm, they were first seen in and around the quarry and the surrounding mining caves located on the island. They have since been seen nearly everywhere else on the island. Along with many other creatures from the island, burrowers have also infiltrated the mainland. According to the unofficial documentarian of the creatures of Carnate, these seem to be connected to a story of a mine cave-in that allegedly occured at the quarry. Thus, these creatures apparently represent those buried alive.Carnate Burrowers  Carnate Burrowers are a representation of those buried alive and are seemingly connected to the old legend of the quarry cave-in. One of Carnate's many stories is that of a cave in at the local quarry. The quarry was mined to supply the construction of the prison and possibly the assylum. Though it was ran by the Maryland Correctional and supervised by C.O.s, it was mainly staffed and worked by many inmates. The cave in story, quite simply, is that a good number of prisoners were working in a newer, shallow mine shaft that was far less stable than the guards let on. The mine shaft caved in and it was reported by the C.O.s that all of the inmates died instantly. There was a rumor, though, that was so persistent that it has survived to this day without any documentation. The rumor is that the cave in did not fill the entire shaft, but only blocked the entrance, trapping the living inmates inside. The rumor goes on to tell that the guards knew of this but were either filled with such hate for the inmates or such indifference that they left them to die slowly. The supervising C.O.s were investigated, but the D.O.C. found no evidence to convict them. However, in retaliation, a group of inmates overtook and lynched five C.O.s.   Like all of the Malefactors, the Burrower has a basic human appearance. The Carnate Burrowers resembles a human body tied up in a gunny sack with a considerable amount of wear to it, tightly constrained by leather straps. Attatched to these straps are four long steel chains, tipped with sharp metal hooks. It's head is exposed, though is contained inside a metal apparatus. It is shown to have a heightened sense of hearing, which is advanced enough to hear footfalls on the earth above it.Baltimore Burrowers  In Baltimore, Burrowers also represent those buried alive. However, they tie to the construction of Baltimore's underground tunnel systems, which took the lives of countless Irish tunnel workers during construction due to cave-ins. In Baltimore, the Burrower is slightly larger. Unlike the Carnate burrowing, it is not enclosed in a sack. It appears as a tall, male form, with a slightly distended stomach and mottled yellow skin, wearing brown working pants. It's shoulders and head are encased in metal armor and they have a pair of bright, old style, mine/tunnel workers lights in place of their eyes. It possesses three long chains, two replacing it's arms, and one on it's back, each of which is tipped with a pickaxe.Telltale Sign  Since they burrow, the sign that one is near is ground being turned up around your feet, as if something is moving under it. They also make the noise that one would expect from a burrowing creature, sort of a rumbling sound. When not moving, The Burrower is silent and the earth does not move, so be cautious.Attacks  Burrowers have several attacks and use their chains for each. Their most basic attack involves them emerging from the ground, leaning away from their target, whipping two chains towards them, and quickly reentering the ground. Another common attack they perform is simply emerging from the ground as before and spinning quickly, causing their chains to swing in a wide circumference dealing damage to anyone within a certain area.Tactics  Staying mobile is a good tactic as they will usually strike where you were standing when they emerged. When the Burrower emerges move out of the way as you shoot it with a weapon.\u00a0A Shotgun blast or explosive can knock them back and interrupt their attack. But if it doesn't kill them, they will re-submerge.\u00a0A well aimed shotgun blast will shred it to pieces instantly killing it. Another reliable method of defeating the burrowers is to time their attack, dodge as they emerge, and then throw any explosive device you may be carrying into the hole they just created as they re-submerge. The explosion will kill the burrower, and force its body above ground.Archive Entries  Clem's Entry \"These Burrowers are some of the most lethal creatures I have encountered, primarily due to their ability to spring fourth from the ground itself and just as quickly, re-submerge. They are closely tied to the very soil of Carnate, a theme among these monstrosities. Its appearance is of a human body tied up in a gunny sack and constrained by leather straps, with deadly steel chains attached at various locations. I believe they represent those buried alive.\" Dr. Killjoy's Entry N/A Jordan's Entry \"Cities are built on the backs of those who labored and died to build their underground infra-structure. Just as those laborers needed to adapt to their hostile working conditions, so too has this Burrower. This malefactor actually moves beneath the surface of the earth at tremendous speed. The exact physics of how it accomplishes this remains a mystery, especially given that it can successfully tunnel through a wide variety of materials.\"Hermes T. Haight  Hermes T. Haight was the former executioner at Abbott State Penitentiary. He was known during his time there for his insistence on using the antiquated gas chamber for a majority of the executions he oversaw, and for how much he enjoyed his job. Since his suicide in the very gas chamber he used, there have been innumerable reports by both a majority of C.O.s and inmates alike claiming to bear witness to his ghost. So many and so similar that it is a general belief that they are true.Appearance  As a C.O., Hermes wore the standard uniform issued by Abbott. However, since his suicide, he appears floating, half dressed, and seemingly made of a translucent green gas. Most sightings are near the old gas chamber and near grates and open pipes. Since the cataclysm, several claims have been made that he has killed several people, notably with the gas that accompanies him. From being a former Abbott executioner, he has a mind obsessed with killing and enjoys the satisfaction of terminating human life. To this effect, he reveals that he envies Torque as he never got to \"snuff a woman\" in his line of work. He also shows disdain if the player is not of an Evil morality at points in the game.\u00a0In particular, he relishes Carnate's dark history, branding it the perfect place for himself and Torque.\u00a0Toward the end of the game, he feels he must test Torque's ability to kill and thus confronts him in the base of the lighthouse. Hermes represents the future.History  The former executioner of the prison, Hermes had been working in Abbott for many decades and expressed great pride and pleasure for his job, until he decided to \"take it one step further\" and committed suicide in the gas chamber. As a result, his ghost manifests itself through a deadly green gas, which he calls \"the colour of life\". When alive, he prided himself in rejecting the use of a new, invisible, and relatively painless form of gas for his executions, reasoning that his preferred method of visible, painful and choking gas would not rob the condemned (or himself) of the full experience. He's a particularly cruel and sadistic individual, and seems to encourage Torque into giving in to his dark side. It is also interesting to note that he was the executioner responsible for the death of Horace P. Gauge.Archive Entry  Since the cataclysm, I have several times saw myself mysteriously surrounded by noxious green fumes. I have fled in each case and I think if I had not, I might not be alive to write this now. When in the gas, I have seen a humanoid who seemed to take great joy in the prospect of my death. Could this be Hermes, Abbott's resident executioner for several decades? If I recall, he took his own life in the gas chamberTorque's Hatred  Torque's Hatred is the final boss of the game. It represents all the anger and wrath within Torque himself. Clem cannot describe it, but it resembles a gigantic version of Torque's creature-self wrapped in chains, and have a little bit of each creature within its body. What appears to be a miniature version of Torque can be seen dangling from its body via an umbilicus of sorts. Three appendages on its back shoot fireballs, and a barbed halo on its head can disorient Torque for a short period. It also have a halo of spikes up in its head. Its only vulnerable point is its exposed heart, which in turn can only be hurt by Killjoy's \"rebirth\" machine.Archive Entry  \"I only briefly saw this enormous creature a single time, near the docks. I cannot even begin to describe him, save for one thing: he seems to be quite literally connected to an inmate, the convicted killer Torque. Incredible as it may sound, this creature appears to have a miniature version of Torque attached to him via a long umbilicus. Beyond that, I can only say that I view him as the most evil of all the creatures, a pure manifestation of fury and hatred.\"Trivia Horace P. Gauge  Horace P. Gauge is one of the spirits of Carnate\u00a0Island and the second boss\u00a0in The Suffering.\u00a0He was voiced by John Armstrong.History  Horace was first sent to Carnate Island after an alleged assault charge, and became one of the many Abbott\u00a0inmates. Whilst he\u00a0did his time\u00a0Horace was driven mad by the influence of the island, and became\u00a0paranoid\u00a0about\u00a0what would happen to his wife while he was not able to protect her whilst in jail. He managed to persuade the COs\u00a0to\u00a0allow a conjugal visit, and during that\u00a0time had sexual intercourse with\u00a0her. Afterwards,\u00a0he gave in to madness and\u00a0murdered her, as he felt that the only way to\u00a0ensure she was protected from the world was to kill her, calling it a \"crime of passion\".\u00a0He was then condemned to the electric chair and his spirit is forced to relive his execution time and time again. Horace represents the present.Appearance  Horace appears as an emaciated man wearing a shirt and jeans, often witnessed near sources of electricity. His distinguishing features are a burnt scalp, face and hands due to the burning effect of the chair's electricity. His speeches are often ended by his torture at the hands of the electricity, as he roars in pain before disappearing. He shares many things in common with Torque, and wants him to escape Carnate in the hopes that he will not suffer the same fate.\u00a0In particular he wants Torque to pursue a Good morality path, as he warns\u00a0Torque not to be driven mad by the island as he was. \u00a0Horace is eventually freed from his torture in a \"battle\" with Torque in the electric chair room, and returns him the favor by opening the way for him on the final escape.Archive Entry  Many inmates break once inside Abbott, but none of them snapped more extremely than Horace Gauge, who, as the tale goes, became convinced his wife wasn't safe without his protection, and sliced her to ribbons during a conjugal visit. He ended up in the mercy chair, electrocuted by Abbott's then-executioner, Hermes Haight. For years, inmates have said he haunts Abbott, and I believe I saw him ten minutes ago. I surely wish I had not.Characters  This is a list of characters present in the Suffering games.Characters on Carnate Characters in Baltimore Ranse Truman  Ranse Truman (also known as RT) is an inmate of Abbott State Penitentiary and Eastern Baltimore Correctional whose cryptic writings feature on the Chapter loading screens of both Suffering games.Appearance/Characteristics  Ranse, when encountered in the second game, is shown as a disheveled, but calm civilian whom is very talkative. He is shirtless when encountered, with white shoes and blue pants tied at the waist, and numerous bandages cover his body and hands, giving the impression that he has been holding his own in the cataclysm. His midriff is covered in blood from a neck wound, which looks self-inflicted. A Fire Axe is nearby, presumably his discarded weapon. Mentally speaking, Ranse seems sane, but accustomed to the Malefactor hordes to such a degree that they don't even notice him when they spawn from the room's Hell-Hole. From his writings, it can be derived that Ranse is very observant, morbid and even philosophical when discussing the history, legacy and phenomena of Carnate and the prison system. If Torque stands in earshot of Ranse, he will talk about the urban legends of Carnate and Baltimore, including The Creeper's legacy, the riots in the prison and how he apparently was removed from Abbott for \"trying that thing with a sharpened spoon\".The Suffering: Ties That Bind  In The Suffering: Ties That Bind, he is found after you leave Blackmore's Drowning Pool. He is encountered at Chapter 17, sitting solemnly beside the Hell-hole on the floor in the abandoned house, and will share his knowledge of Carnate and Baltimore if you stick around with him. Later, in Chapter 18, Blackmore will inform the player that he has sent a wave of Malefactors after Ranse, and if the player chooses, they can run back and save Ranse for Good morality. He is voiced by David Markus.Ranse's Messages  The Suffering Chapter 0, Waiting to die \"What makes it unusually cruel is the waiting.

Environment is everything, and when placed in jeopardy, children will imagine what they need to survive.\"Blackmore  Blackmore is the main antagonist of the The Suffering: Ties That Bind. He was voiced by the late actor Michael Clarke Duncan.Appearance  Blackmore, when seen by Torque, appears to be a man close to Torque's age, characterised by a deep voice and a red buttoned shirt. He has a shaved head and his most distinguishing features include his different-coloured irises and facial scars. Interestingly, he somewhat resembles Torque when playing Ties That Bind with evil morality, minus head and facial hair. In the final confrontation at the Garvey Children's Home, he is revealed to transform into the Evil version of The Creature, which supports his role as Torque's evil alter ego.Description  A mysterious crimelord who lies at the center of Torque's struggles, Blackmore ran the drugs trade in Baltimore, as well as funding the Foundation's research into the Malefactors. He is inexplicably tied to every major event in Torque's life including his imprisonment and the deaths of his family. Blackmore works in the shadows, often letting his subordinates carry out tasks and threats, and only gets involved with work himself when it directly concerns Torque. It is also assumed through dialogue at the beginning of the game that he is Torque's employer and confidante. Later it is discovered that he is actually Torque's alter ego, who takes control of him every time he blacks out. Torque claimed during his court case that he blacked out during the deaths of his family, which is true or not depending on his morality at the end of the game. Almost viewing his 'better half' as a best friend more than anything, Blackmore acts willing to do almost anything to bring Torque over to his side; force him to understand and embrace the reasoning that so violently drives the crime lord. Blackmore's voice is now Torque's evil mental sprite in morality situations, as he can be heard goading Torque to perform evil acts throughout the game.Final Battle and Fate  Blackmore is battled in Chapter 18 of the game, atop the Garvey Children's Home in Baltimore. During this fight, he will walk around and frequently pass or fly through Torque, as well as using a purple energy to steal Insanity from Torque's Insanity meter. Whilst fighting Blackmore, Malefactors will be spawned by a Horde at the side of the arena, which Torque must kill throughout the fight to gain Insanity. Shooting or otherwise attacking Blackmore is ineffective in this battle, as he will only laugh and taunt Torque when shot. The only way to harm Blackmore is to attack him using The Creature's attacks, which will knock him back and cause him to appear elsewhere in the arena. The player must be wary of Blackmore, as his purple energy can cause him to siphon the player's Insanity and allow Blackmore to become The Creature himself, where he can inflict major damage on Torque. Once Blackmore is suitably damaged, he will appear atop the arena, where the player approaches him to finish him. His ultimate fate is directly affected by Torque's morality during Ties That Bind. He is, regardless of morality, resposible for the deaths of Torque's family. In the \"Neutral\" ending of The Suffering, it was \"rock\" bought from Blackmore that caused Cory to kill Malcolm and himself; in the \"Evil\" ending, it was Blackmore's advice that caused Torque to murder his own family. In the \"Good\" ending, it was Blackmore's thugs that killed Torque's family. If the player starts the game as good, by either loading a saved game from the first Suffering or selecting good at the beginning of the game after another play through, it will be revealed that Blackmore had not intended for his men to kill Torque's family; only scare them. Blackmore (and by extension, Torque) was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan Archieve Entry Jordan's Entry \"Blackmore is one of the multiple fictional personalities of our prime target, Torque. Blackmore is highly intelligent, fiercely determined, and brilliantly charismatic, but is only dominant a small percentage of the time. Nevertheless, he has managed to build a substantial criminal empire and has been using his ill-gotten gains to fund the Foundation. He is included here because of his unique connections to the malefactors.\" Dr.Killjoy's Entry \"Now here is a most interesting case of study. A man of iron convictions and unstoppable determination, Blackmore has established a criminal enterprise that holds Baltimore firmly in its grip. Having come from much the same upbringing as Torque, Blackmore knew that to go far he would not let petty morals stand in his way. Shrewdly intelligent, he keeps himself free from the watchful eye of law enforcement by never personally breaking any laws. In so many ways, Blackmore is the polar opposite of Torque. Not physically violent himself, he prefers to always have underlings carry out his wishes. It is his inner self that is horribly violent in nature. Despite his determination and even with all the success he has achieved, his one peculiar eccentricity is his near obsession with Torque. For example, when Torque was sent to prison, Blackmore was driven to follow Torque inside to keep an eye on the man he hates so much. It is as if Blackmore lives to always be one step behind Torque making sure his tenuous grip on his sanity becomes weaker and weaker.\"Isolationists  Isolationists are malefactors encountered in The Suffering: Ties That Bind.Representation  Isolationists are a representation of those who were left to rot in solitary confinement.Appearance  It appears as a large, obese humanoid with discolored yellow skin. It drags its seemingly broken legs behind it on crutches strapped to its forearms. Most of its face, except its lower jaw, is replaced by an iron lock with a keyhole in the center. Their stomachs are hollow, with a barred cage covering the gap. They also appear to have small insectoid limbs sprouting from behind their back and head. One of it's crutches has a tube strapped to it, filled with bullet-like stones that it fires at its opponents.Telltale Sign  The Isolationist moves by using its crutches to drag itself along; this makes a loud, metallic clanking and/or dragging noise that gives away its presence. They may also make noises like electrical surges, or spawn Wretches before you get too close. They tend to appear in dark places, as they hate light, and its electrical surges will cause nearby light fixtures to break.Attacks  The Isolationist can use a number of electrically-based attacks against Torque, whether extending in a shockwave or fired like a gun from one of the Isolationist's crutches. It can also release Wretches to seek out and attack Torque (much like the Festering Rats from the previous game). And if Torque gets too close to the Isolationist, it can attack him by swinging its crutches.How to Kill  Isolationists can take a lot of damage before dying; make sure that you have enough ammunition before entering dark places. They may have a metal skull cap, but they can still be killed by way of a headshot.Special Notes  Isolationists appear far less often than the other monsters, but they are also more difficult to kill. Fights against Isolationists can take a while; keep an eye on your health gauge and ammunition while fighting them.Archive Entry  Jordan's Entry \"This malefactor thrives in the darkness and tries to make its environment as dark as possible by disabling or destroying light sources. We have not been able to get a good look at the Isolationist, let alone capture one. It appears to have a unique relationship with a cockroach-like malefactor, the Wretch, which it spawns in large numbers. One cannot help but think of inmates locked away in solitary when one glimpses this Isolationist.\"Gorgers  The Gorger is a common malefactor in The Suffering: Ties That Bind.Appearance  Gorgers are large, hulking Malefactors, slightly taller than Torque. They have decayed, green skin, covered in countless open wounds, and have broad shoulders, hunched backs, and distended stomachs. The Gorger's face resembles that of a human, but with a long, thick neck, a significantly wider mouth, the edges of which almost reach it's ears, and a highly muscled jaw. Alongside a set of normal human teeth, Gorger's also possess four long, fleshy mandible-like appendages, each ending with a knife-like blade. These appendages are retractable, and will disappear into the Gorger's mouth after they are killed. Gorgers are only clad in a pair of baggy green pants, and have numerous metallic clamps along their spine and ribs, as well as metal leg braces. They possess four long, clawed fingers on each hand, and dog-like feet. They make noises that sound similar to heavy, guttural breathing, and will also gurgle and roar when attacking. For some reason, there're smaller versions of Gorgers that appear right after killing the captain Triggermen.Behavior  Gorgers are compelled by a constant need to feed, and will in-hesitantly attempt to consume anything it finds, primarily living beings, like humans. They will feed on nearby corpses, whether they are a human or a Malefactor, randomly stopping what they were already doing to shovel large chunks of flesh from the corpse. They will even attempt to pin Torque down and eat him head-first. They also appear to be fairly aggressive, even for a Malefactor, as they will willingly attack other Malefactors, and inanimate objects, even if Torque is around and easily accessible.Representation  The Gorger is a manifestation of starvation, and possibly, cannibalism. The creatures seem to be connected to an old urban legend told to children in Baltimore during the Great Depression. When impoverished children would ask why their family had no food, their parents would tell them that an insatiable creature, called the Gorger, had come up from the sewers and eaten all of their food. They were also told that it would eat them if they misbehaved. They seem to be tied to another story; during the Great Depression, a reverend was part of a soup kitchen. When food ran out, rather than letting them starve, he began to serve meat from human corpses to his followers. The people then rallied against the reverend when they learned of his sin.Tactics  The player must use powerful weaponry such as a Shotgun\u00a0to stop a Gorger's advances, as it is a large creature. Successful shots can remove its arms, or even decimate it from the chest up. When a Gorger pounces on Torque, mash buttons to fight it off before it can inflict damage. Insanity mode is useful for defeating a Gorger and ensuring it cannot pounce on Torque. Gorgers may run to fresh corpses and eat flesh from them. This has no apparent effect on the Gorger other than distracting them. This is a prime opportunity for the player to attack and kill a Gorger. Gorgers may also fight other Malefactors or objects they encounter. Archieve Entry Jordan's Entry \"Along with the Carnate Island malefactor the Fester, this \"Gorger\" is distinctive because of it's constant need to feed as part of it's innate behavior. With it's incredibly sharp teeth and highly-muscled jaw, this malefactor seems built to do precisely that. This creature appears to be the incarnation of a popular Baltimore urban legend that tells of an insaciable creature that feeds on whatever it can find.\"Suppressors  The Suppressor is a malefactor encountered in The Suffering: Ties That Bind.Representation  The Suppressor represents police brutality. However, they are not the prisoners themselves; instead, they are apparently an incarnation of Eastern Correctional Emergency Response Team (CERT), which is known for it's brutality.Appearance  The Suppressor appears as a humanoid form with decayed yellow skin. It's legs have been amputated at the knee, so it moves by dragging itself along the floor with it's arms. It also appears to be wearing a Corrections Officer's (CO's) outfit, the shirt having been ripped open to reveal a distended stomach, and four Tommy Guns embedded in it's torso. It is bald, and it's face (aside from it's lower jaw) has been replaced by a single, bright floodlight embedded in it's head. It has several spiral-shaped scars on it's arms, resembling prison arm tattoos. It has also lost most of it's senses, the floodlight being it's sole method of finding humans.Behavior  Suppressors drag themselves around along the floor in a patrolling manner, only noticing someone when they step into the light being cast from it's floodlight. Once it spots an enemy, Malefactor, or even a breakable object, it sits up, and begins firing relentlessly at them with it's Tommy Guns, not stopping until they die (or break), it dies, or if it loses sight of them.Telltale Sign  As they drag themselves along the floor, they leave thick trails of blood along the floor wherever they go. This is a dead giveaway that a Suppressor is nearby. They also make dragging sounds and emit low grunts as they drag themselves along.Attacks  The Suppressor's only attack is to fire rapidly at enemies with it's Tommy Guns, which can cause considerable damage if Torque doesn't move.Method  The best way to attack a Suppressor is from behind. Once attacked, they will quickly turn around and retaliate, so a powerful gun or Grenade is recommended. Archive Entry Jordan's Entry \"The Suppressor is surprisingly mobile given that it is missing a number of its limbs and seems to have lost some of its senses. This malefactor can only see enemies when they step into its intense beam of light, but is relentless once it has spotted a target. Given its appearance and its tendency to show up near Eastern Baltimore Correctional, it seems to be connected to that institution's infamous and brutal Correctional Emergency Response Team (CERT)\"The Creeper  The Creeper is an evil specter who appears throughout Baltimore in The Suffering: Ties That Bind. He was formerly known as Luther Stickwell, an infamous killer pimp in Baltimore's history.\u00a0His voice was provided by Scott Bullock.Background  Reports from Consuela's Archive scrapbook and loading screens tell the story of a pimp named Luther Stickwell, who started murdering his own prostitutes before turning his attention to any female he came across, eventually killing between 50 and 200 women and becoming the basis of an urban legend. The Creeper can be found roaming through dark alleys, or down in the sewer system, in which he appears to Torque surrounded with the dead bodies of seemingly hundreds of women. At various points in the game, the Creeper's quavering voice can be heard recounting his vile exploits, such as how he killed women in the sewers because he liked the damp conditions and elaborating on his misogynistic tendencies and his violent attitudes against women.Sightings  Torque first has a vision of The Creeper during the riot in Eastern Correctional at the start of the game; this is where The Creeper's most infamous line is uttered: \"Blood is the best lubricant.\" The Creeper makes several other critical appearances to Torque, which often show him attacking female characters and stalking Foundation leader Jordan. One appearance reveals that The Creeper is also a homophobe, as he can be heard berating and killing a gay inmate in the Eastern prison. The Creeper presents himself in one of Torque's moral situations when he is teamed with Consuela (assuming she is not left behind or killed on sight); when she separates from Torque, The Creeper will attack her. The player can either let The Creeper kill her, or attack Creeper (who will feel betrayed by the act) to save her life. In the chapter \"The Greatest Story Never Told\" near the game's end, The Creeper will accompany the slavehunter Copperfield and Torque's \"psychologist\" Dr. Killjoy to form a tribunal, judging Torque's actions up to that point. Players with an Evil morality status will fight the Creeper in the sub-boss battle, who will explain \"I took [the prostitutes] to a warehouse and when the police got there the whole place was already burnt down.\" Ironically, if played in a Good morality, it would seem that the Creeper is trying to warn Torque of Jordan's impending treachery, due to his general hatred and distrust of females.Appearance  His appearance is of an overweight man, not fully bald, in a large trenchcoat and gloves. His face is oddly doll-like (seemingly a combination of decay and cabaret make-up) and the heads and torsos of three scantily-clad women are hidden under his coat, viscerally connected to him by bladed tentacles, with long blades sticking out of their mouths. After he is defeated (if he is fought in the sub-boss battle), the women will turn their hooks against him and kill him, but strangely, even to Torque, he enjoyed it.Trivia  In battle with The Creeper, if fought long enough, he will reveal the history of his crime, how he died, and the names of the three girls attached to him - Alicia, Alana, and April.Triggermen  Based on the idea of gun violence, this creature has a lifeless body clutching two Scorpions and it has spindly legs growing out of bullet holes in its body. It also has spider-like qualities but moves in a more mechanical and powerful way. Its front legs have Shotgun like weapons fused at the ends, and it alternates between Scorpions and Shotguns depending on how far away it is from a target. Triggerman also has a total of six legs and either stands on all six in spider-like form or can rear up on its back three legs.How to kill  Normal weapon fire to its exposed stomach will suffice to kill this Malefactor. Be warned as it can fire the Scorpions at Torque at close range. If Captain versions of these are encountered, they will spawn normal Triggermen for Torque to kill to fill Insanity, in order to combat the Captain. Archieve Entry Jordan's Entry \"A human corpse forms the center of this malefactor. The body appears to have suffered multiple gunshot wounds, particularly to it's head, which has lost a significant portion of it's mass. The malefactor's legs are vaguely arachnid in form and incorporate some type of automatic rifle. As with the Slayer, this Triggerman seems to tie to Baltimore's tragically prevalent street crime, with a high number of homicides each year resulting from gun violence.\"", "Mons Aventinus - The Aventine Hill": "Mons Aventinus - The Aventine Hill Ancient Greek Male Names (Greek Community)  ACHILLEUS: Original Greek form of Achilles, meaning either \"pain\" or \"lipless.\" ACTAEON (Act\u00e6on): Greek myth name of a hunter who was torn to pieces by his own dogs, meaning \"effulgence.\" He was then transformed into a deer, thus himself becoming the hunted.

Scholars have accepted that the royal Persian name, Kambujiya, is a form of Sanskrit Kamboja and Greek Cambyses/Kambyses and believe that it is probable that the legendary Kamboja of the Mahabharata was an earlier Kambujiya from the royal line of Persian Achaemenids who gave his name to the clan. As for its meaning, there are several possibilities, the most likely being that put forth by scholar Dr. Moti Chandra who says that it literally means \"handsome king.\" His view is reinforced by Valmiki Ramayana, as well as by several verses of the Mahabharata which strongly testify that the ancient Kambojas and their princes were extremely handsome.

The names relate to their language, religion, and political life. The Greek civilization is one of the oldest civilizations. So, they have long history and rich culture. Their history spans as far as 13th century BC. Their names appeared in ancient tombstone, vases, papyri, inscriptions, coins, gems, manuscripts, seals, and stamps. In the past, their main purpose to name is to identify. The name validates your language, religion, ethnic origin, civic subdivision, and political life. Their name may include the given name, parents name, ethnic origin, and civic subdivision. During the 13th century BC, their names are only one given name. In literature, ancient Greeks are usually identified by only one name -- whether male (e.g., Socrates) or female (e.g., Thais). This is absolutely true for female or male baby names. The given name is enough to identify themselves. Perhaps, the population is so less at the time. For example, Socrates, Alexander, Thais, and Homer are example of given names. Traditionally, the first born are given the name of the paternal grandfather. And for the second born, they are given the name of the paternal grandmother. Then, the use of parents name comes into play. The parents name tells the family where you belong. The parents name improves the ability to legitimately identify a person. For example, Socrates son of Homer, or Alexander son of Adelphos legitimately identifies the person and family. In Athens, it became mandatory in 403/2 B.C. to use the demotic (the name of their deme) in addition to the regular name on official records. It was also common to use an adjective to show place of origin when abroad. As they started to move from one place to another, the Greeks saw the need to tell the origin. A city may be divided into organization. In the name, the Greeks will include the organization. In English we see this in such names as Solon of Athens or Aspasia of Miletus. For example, Alexander son of Adelphos, Athens or Socrates son of Homer, of the deme Athens tells the family and organization of origin of an individual. The name could be simple or compound. The simple names are made of a noun or adjective. For example, Cressida, Ophira, and Titian are baby names meaning gold. Another example, Zoilo, Zosima, Zosimo, and Zotico are baby names meaning lively. The compound baby names are combination of nouns or adjectives. For example, Niko-Lysandra means victorious liberator. Another example, Nicodermus means victory of the people. It is a combination of Nicole and demes. Nicole means victory, while demes mean organization or people.Mons Caelius - The Caelian Hill (Mons Aventinus)  www.novaroma.org Community Praefectus: Q. Valerius PoplicolaWelcome to the Caelian Hill  The Caelian Hill (Latin Collis Caelius, Italian Celio) is one of the famous Seven Hills of Rome. Under reign of Tullus Hostilius, the entire population of Alba Longa was forcibly resettled on the Caelian Hill. According to a tradition recounted by Titus Livy, the hill received its name from Caelius Vibenna, either because he established a settlement there or because his friend Servius Tullius wished to honor him after his death. In Republican-era Rome the Caelian Hill was a fashionable residential district and the site of residences of the wealthy. Archeological work under the Baths of Caracalla have uncovered the remains of lavish villas complete with murals and mosaics. The Caelian is also the site of Basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Rome) and the ancient basilica of Santo Stefano Rotondo, known for its centralized, circular plan. The Emperor Claudius had a special relationship with the Caeilian Hill. Not only was the great Temple to his divinity built at its crest, but he built the great aqueduct which traversed part of it and brought bountiful fresh water to Rome. Atop the Caelian hill, directly across a narrow valley from the Palatine Hill, the neighborhood was focused on its great Temple of Claudius [dedicated to the deified Emperor Claudius) and the temple courts that surrounded it. The Caelian Hill was always a quiet, fashionable residential neighborhood. The Caelian is the most south-easterly of the Seven Hills of Rome and lies south of the Esquiline. It had two high points, referred to as the Larger Caelian (Caelius maior) to the west, and the Smaller Caelian, (Caelius minor) to the north. The Romans believed that Tullius Hostilius enlarged the city by adding the Caelian hill. The Caelian originally was named Querquetulanus Mons. The earlier name was thought to be a reference to the oak trees with which the hill was covered. (Historians continue to dispute whether this represents a bona fide tradition or whether it simply was a later invention to explain the Porta Querquetulana.) The name Caelian derives from Caelius Vibenna, an early Etruscan warlord and adventurer who reputedly came to Rome in the time of Tarquinius Priscus and settled with his followers on the hill which later bore his name. The Caelian was crossed by the Servian Wall, which traditionally was attributed to King Servius Tullius, but actually was built in 378 BC. It was densely populated during the days of the Republic. However, after a devastating fire in 27 A.D., the Caelian was occupied by the houses and extensive gardens of the wealthy. The chief buildings on the hill included the temple of Divus Claudius. The temple was almost entirely destroyed by Nero to build the nymphaeum which was part of his Domus Aurea. However, the temple of Divus Claudius was restored by Vespasian. Nero also constructed a new food market on the Caelian Hill. The Caelian served as the headquarters and barracks for several of the military units stationed in Rome, including the peregrini and the Frumentarii, the vigiles and the equites singulares (the mounted bodyguard of the emperor). A major feature of the Caeilian, of course, was the massive aqueduct built by the Emperor Claudius, drawing abundant clear water from the hills far outside Rome itself.

Vipsanius AgrippaWelcome to the Campus Martius  Before the founding of Rome, the Campus Martius was a low-lying plain enclosed on the west by a bend of the Tiber River near Tiber Island, on the east by the Quirinal Hill, and on the southeast by the Capitoline Hill. According to one legend, the Campus Martius was once a field of wheat owned by Tarquinius Superbus, last King of Rome, but was burnt during the revolution which established the Roman Republic. In the first centuries after the city's founding, the area was still outside the Servian Wall. The Campus was used for pasturing horses and sheep, and for military training activity of both the army and of private people who could use the training equipment the army had left. As such, it was dedicated to Mars, the Roman god of war, with an ancient altar, and became closely linked to soldiers and the army. Initially, the field was often used by soldiers for purposes of training. Later, it was the assembly-ground for triumphs, the celebrations of successful military campaigns. Because at the time it was outside the city walls, the Campus Martius was a natural place for audiences granted to foreign ambassadors who could not enter the city, and foreign cults were housed in temples erected there. In 221 BC, the Circus Flaminius was built on the southern side of the Campus Martius, near the Tiber. This large track for chariot racing was named after Gaius Flaminius Nepos, who also constructed the Via Flaminia. Starting in the time of Sulla, building lots were sold or granted to influential Romans, and insulae (apartment blocks) and villas encroached on the common land. It later became the meeting-place for the comitia centuriata, other civic meetings where the attendees carried weapons, and the city's militia. Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey) built the first stone theater in Rome on the Campus Martius in 55 BC: this was the first real monument in the area. After the Curia Hostilia burnt down in 52 BC, the theater was sometimes used as a meeting place for the Senate. It was here that Gaius Iulius Caesar was murdered in 44 BC. The area was also used as the meeting ground for elections. Iulius Caesar planned for the saepta (enclosures used for elections) to be placed there; they were later completed by his heir Augustus. In 33 BC the latter dedicated the Porticus Octaviae, built from spoils of the Dalmatian War. During the Augustan period of the early Empire, the area became officially part of the city: Rome was split up into 14 regiones, and the Campus Martius was divided into regio VII (Via Lata) on the east and regio IX (Circus Flaminius) nearer to the river. The Campus Martius also held the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace), built by the Senate to mark the establishment of peace by Augustus. It was intended to symbolize the successful completion of Augustus's efforts to stabilize the Empire. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa had the original swampy ground made into a pool and baths in a setting of parkland and temples. These were known as the Laconicum Sudatorium or Baths of Agrippa. He also built the Porticus Argonautarum and, most notably, the Pantheon, which was later rebuilt by Hadrian in its present form. In 19 BC Agrippa completed the Aqua Virgo to supply water to these new baths and fountains. In the non-populated northern area there was the huge Mausoleum of Augustus. Other buildings were made: the Theater of Marcellus, the temple of Isis (from around the time of Caligula), and Nero's baths and bridge. After the great fire of 80 CE, the emperor Domitianus rebuilt the burnt monuments, and added a stadium (today's Piazza Navona) and an odeion (a small performance hall). Gradually, the Campus filled with temples and public buildings, circuses, theaters, porticoes, baths, monuments, columns and obelisks. Interestingly, even though the area was originally named for Mars, there was no monument dedicated solely to him in the later Roman period. Although the region had been left outside the earlier walls, it was finally protected defensively when the Aurelian Walls were built around 270.Community Streets for Residents  Via Flaminia\nVia Fornicata\nVia Lata\nVia Recta\nVia Tecta\nVicus StablariusSites of Interest Community Administration  Praefectus: G.

Both Eutropius and Livy indicate that Servius Tullius (the sixth king of Rome) was responsible for adding the Viminal to the City of Rome. In early times, it was a flat-topped, steep, and weathered spur which once served as a site for a Servian fortress. Viminus is a cult title of Jupiter and some sources indicate that the Viminal was named for the presence of Jupiter Viminus on the hill. However, other sources state that it was called the Viminal because of the osiers (vimina) growing there. The majority of those who lived on the Viminal resided in insulae with various shops and the working space of artisans located at ground level with the upper floors reserved for apartments. The baths of Diocletian were built at the foot of the hill, in an area traversed by the Vicus Patricius. When the Servian wall was built, the Viminal seems to have been regarded as reaching across the plateau as far as the line of the wall and the Porta Viminalis. Later, this district was included in the sixth region of Augustus. The Viminal was always the least important of the hills of the city and contained few monuments. For the most part, traffic passed on either side of it. In the valley which lay between the Imperial Fora and the Quirinal, abutting on the Viminal, was the celebrated Subura [sometimes written Suburra]-- the quarter of shops, markets, and artificers,--a busy, noisy, vulgar section, not beautiful, but full of life and enterprise and wickedness. If you want to experience the Subura, find an insula (apartment block) among some of its great streets - the Via Collis Viminalis; the Via Labicana, the Prata Flaminia (near the Flaminian Gate), or the Clivus Suburanus; watch out, though, the landlords here are the greediest in Rome! Then move in and become a Roman among Romans. The origin of the name \"Subura\" is as hazy as the exact boundaries of the area, but this neighborhood lay to the east of the Forum Romanum in the hollow between the Oppian spur of the Esquiline Mount and the Viminal Hill. It was connected with the Forum by the famous street Argiletum and continued eastward between the Oppius and the Cispius by way of the Clivus Suburanus. The boundaries of the Subura ended near the Porta Esquilina or Esquiline Gate. Another natural depression extended from the Subura northward between the Viminal and the Quirinal, and a third northeast between the Cispius and the Viminal that was marked by the vicus Patricius. The beginning of the Subura was called primae fauces and was situated perhaps near the Praefectura Urbana, just northeast of the Forum. By the time of Julius Caesar or earlier, the Subura was one of the most characterful districts in Rome, notorious by references in Latin literature and in inscriptions. It was seething, noisy, dirty, and wet, a resort of harlots, of dealers in provisions and delicacies and finery, and of tradesmen of various sorts. Crowded, noisy, dirty, smelly, it was also full of little shops where the poorer people went for their eggs, cabbages, bread and the few bare necessities of life, which was all they could afford. There were also to be found many barbers, cobblers, ironmongers, and shops selling cheaper fabrics, all thronged by a jostling motley crowd among which were many slaves on errands for their masters and mistresses. There were also dwellings of more distinguished persons. Julius Caesar once lived there and the consul L. Arruntius Stella. But in general, it was low on the 'class' list for would-be social climbers. It is said that Caesar's contemporary, Marcus Licinius Crassus, used to wait for the inevitable fires in the Subura, race to the scene with his slaves, and bargain to buy the house while it still burned - and when he did so, had his slaves promptly put out the blaze! (for many centuries, Rome had no firefighting forces). The Subura, the Sub Velia, and the Velabrum, built in the valleys, were choked up with tall houses in insulae (multi-story apartment blocks) sometimes as much as 70 feet high. In the late Republic, as dispossed and ambitious Italians poured into the great city, the wealthy became increasingly attracted to the high, fresher air of the Roman hills. In particular, the Palatine and the Esquiline became the home of the wealthy, while the Subura remained for those who could afford no better.Community Streets for Residents  01 - Clivus Cosconius\n 02 - Via Labicana\n 03 - Via Lata\n 04 - Vicus Aesculeti\n 05 - Vicus Bellonae\n 06 - Vicus Collis Viminalis\n 07 - Vicus Fanni\n 08 - Vicus Ianuclensis\n 09 - Vicus Longus\n 10 - Vicus Panispernae\n 11 - Vicus PatriciusSites of Interest Community Administration  Praefectus: vacant The position of Praefectus (Prefect) of this community is currently vacant.

Contact: lucius_vitellius_triarius@yahoo. com www.novaroma.orgMons Capitolium - The Capitoline Hill (Mons Aventinus)  www.novaroma.orgWelcome to the Capitoline Hill  The hill was the site of a temple for the Capitoline Triad, started by Rome's fifth king, Tarquin the Elder. It was considered one of the largest and the most beautiful temples in the city (although little now remains) and was probably founded on an earlier Etruscan temple of Veiovis, the remains and cult statue of which survive. The city legend starts with the recovery of a human skull (the word for head in Latin is caput) when foundation trenches were being dug for the Temple of Jupiter by Tarquin's order. At this hill the Sabines, creeping to the Citadel, were let in by the infamous Vestal Virgin Tarpeia. For this she was the first to suffer the punishment for treachery of being thrown off the steep crest of the hill to fall on the dagger-sharp Tarpeian Rocks below. When the Senones Gauls settled in Central-east Italy raided Rome in 390 BC, after the battle of River Allia, the Capitoline Hill was the one section of the city to evade capture by the barbarians, it being fortified by the Roman defenders. When Julius Caesar suffered an accident during his Triumph, clearly indicating the wrath of Jupiter for his actions in the Civil Wars, he approached the hill and Jupiter's temple on his knees as a way of averting the unlucky omen (nevertheless he was murdered six months later, and Brutus and his other assassins locked themselves inside the temple afterwards) [1]. Vespasian's brother and nephew were also besieged in the temple during the Year of Four Emperors (69). The Tabularium, located underground beneath the piazza and hilltop, occupies a building of the same name built in the 1st century BC to hold Roman records of state. The Tabularium looks out from the rear onto the Roman Forum. The main attraction of the Tabularium, besides the structure itself, is the Temple of Veiovis.Community Streets for Residents  01 - Centum Gradus\n 02 - Clivus Capitolinus\n 03 - Gradus Monetae\n 04 - Vicus Iugarius\n 05 - Vicus Unguentarius\n 06 - Vicus VestaeSites of Interest Community Administration  Praefectus: vacant The position of Praefectus (Prefect) of this community is currently vacant.

It stands 40 metres above the Forum Romanum, looking down upon it on one side, and upon the Circus Maximus on the other. It is the etymological origin of the word \"palace.\" According to Roman mythology, the Palatine hill was where Romulus and Remus were found by the she-wolf that kept them alive. According to this legend, the shepherd Faustulus found the infants, and with his wife Acca Larentia raised the children. When they were older this is where Romulus decided to build Rome. Rome has its origins on the Palatine. Indeed, recent excavations show that people have lived there since approximately 1000 BC. Many affluent Romans of the Republican period (510 BC \u2013 c. 44 BC) had their residences there. The ruins of the palaces of Augustus (63 BC \u2013 14), Tiberius (42 BC \u2013 37) and Domitian (51 \u2013 96) can still be seen. Augustus also built a temple to Apollo here, beside his house. The Palatine Hill was also the site of the festival of the Lupercalia. One building, believed to be the residence of Livia (58 BC \u2013 29), the wife of Augustus, is currently undergoing renovation. Situated near to the house of Livia is the temple of Cybele, currently not fully excavated and not open to the public. Behind this structure, cut into the side of the hill, is the so-called House of Tiberius. Overlooking the Forum Romanum is the Flavian Palace which was built largely during the reign of the Flavian dynasty (69 \u2013 96) \u2013 Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. This palace, which was extended and modified by several emperors, extends across the Palatine Hill and looks out over the Circus Maximus. The building of the greater part the palace visible from the Circus was undertaken in the reign of the emperor Septimius Severus (146 \u2013 211). Immediately adjacent to the palace of Severus is the Hippodrome of Domitian. This is a structure which has the appearance of a Roman Circus and whose name means Cirgus in Greek, but is of insufficient size to accommodate chariots. It can be better described as a Greek Stadium, that is, a venue for foot races. However, the exact purpose of this one is disputed. While it is certain that during the Severan period it was used for sporting events, it was most likely originally built as a garden shaped like a stadium. According to guide from the Sopraintendenza Archeologica di Roma, most of the statuary in the nearby Palatine museum comes from the Hippodrome. (Domitian also built a larger stadium that was actually used for foot-racing competitions; it exists today as Piazza Navona, lo stadio di Domiziano.) The Palatine Hill is now a large open-air museum and can be visited during the daytime for a small charge on the same ticket as Colosseum. There are two entrances, one near the Arch of Titus on the Forum Romanum and the other on Via di San Gregorio, the street just beyond the Arch of Constantine, going away from the Colosseum. During Augustus' reign, an area of the Palatine Hill was roped off for a sort of archaeological expedition, which found fragments of Bronze Age pots and tools. He declared this site the \"original town of Rome\". Modern archaeology has identified evidence of Bronze Age settlement in the area which predates Rome's founding. There is a museum on the Palatine in which artifacts dating from before the official foundation of the City are displayed. The museum also contains Roman statuary. An altar to an unknown deity, once thought to be Aius Locutius, was discovered here in 1820. In July 2006, archaeologists announced the discovery of the Palatine House, which they believe to be the birthplace of Rome's first Emperor, Augustus. Head archaeologist Clementina Panella uncovered a section of corridor and other fragments under Rome's Palatine Hill, which she described on July 20 as \"a very ancient aristocratic house.\" The two story house appears to have been built around an atrium, with frescoed walls and mosaic flooring, and is situated on the slope of the Palatine that overlooks the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine. The Republican-era houses on the Palatine were overbuilt by later palaces after the Great Fire of Rome (64), but apparently this one was not; the tempting early inference is that it was preserved for a specific and important reason. On the ground floor, three shops opened onto the Via Sacra. The location of the domus is important because of its potential proximity to the Curiae Veteres, the earliest shrine of the curies of Rome. In January 2007 Italian archeologist Irene Iacopi announced that she probably found the legendary Lupercal cave beneath the remains of Emperor Augustus' palace on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 15-meter-deep cavity while working to restore the decaying palace. The first photos of the cave show a richly decorated vault encrusted with mosaics and seashells. The Lupercal was probably converted to a sanctuary by Romans in later centuries.Community Streets for Residents  01 - Clivus Palatinus\n 02 - Clivus Sacer\n 03 - Clivus Victoriae\n 04 - Nova Via\n 05 - Via Sacra\n 06 - Vicus Apollinis\n 07 - Vicus Bublarius\n 08 - Vicus Curiarium\n 09 - Vicus Huiusce Diei\n 10 - Vicus Fortunae Respicientis\n 11 - Vicus Padi\n 12 - Vicus Salutaris\n 13 - Vicus TuscusSites of Interest Community Administration  Praefectus: vacant The position of Praefectus (Prefect) of this community is currently vacant.

From here you will find several primary sites in the Aventine to visit, as well as the homes of some of our Plebeian cives.Community Streets for Residents  In Roman times there were many types of houses you could live in. The DOMUS, which is one of the largest houses the Romans had in the city, was the only house that one family lived in. Which consisted of two floors. The richest families in the city lived in these homes. An INSULAE, shown in the picture above, was where the \u201cpoor people\u201d resided. It had three or more floors that had little rooms in them where a whole family lived. The rooms got light only by a little window that did not contain any glass. Collapses and fires occurred often in these homes. The ground level consisted of little shops. The last living settlement is the VILLA-COMPLEX. About ninety percent of Romans lived in the country, some lived in poor farmhouses, but the rich lived in a villa-complex. These consisted of three parts: Villa urbana- this was the living quarters of the family; Villa rustica- the was where the staff lived and worked (it was also the stables, a hospital, and a prison); and Storage accommodations - this was where they stored the grain, oil, wine, and other items that were made on the premises. These are the three most common types of housing settlement that the Romans lived in.

Rome conquered it to gain control of and access to the river from both banks, but was not interested in building on that side of the river. In fact, the only connection between Trastevere and the rest of the city was a small wooden bridge called the Pons Sublicius (Latin: \"bridge built on piles\"). By the time of the Republic in 509, the number of sailors and fishermen making a living from the river had increased, and many had taken up residence in Trastevere. Immigrants from the East also settled there, mainly Jews and Syrians. The area began to be considered part of the city under Augustus, who divided Rome into 14 regions (regiones in Latin); modern Trastevere was the XIV and was called Trans Tiberim. The area really became part of the city under Aurelian (270\u2013275), who made larger protecting walls to include Trastevere and the Vatican hill. With the wealth of the Imperial Age, several important figures decided to build their villae in Trastevere, including Clodia, (Catullus' \"friend\") and Julius Caesar (his garden villa, the Horti Caesaris).Community Streets for Residents  Via Aurelia\nVia Portuense\nVicus Brutianus\nVicus Ceios\nVicus Gemini\nVicus Ianuclensis\nVicus Larum Curialium\nVicus Pacrai\nVicus Pauli\nVicus Quadrati\nVicus Raciliani Maioris\nVicus Raciliani Minoris\nVicus Rostratae\nVicus Salutaris\nVicus Saufei\nVicus Sergi\nVicus Statae Siccianae\nVicus TiberiniSites of Interest Community Administration  Praefectus: M.

She was the daughter of Saturn and Ops, the sister of Jupiter, and the mother of Proserpine. Ceres was a kind and benevolent goddess to the Romans and they had a common expression, \"fit for Ceres,\" which meant splendid. She was beloved for her service to mankind in giving them the gift of the harvest, the reward for cultivation of the soil. Also known as the Greek goddess Demeter, Ceres was the goddess of the harvest and was credited with teaching humans how to grow, preserve, and prepare grain and corn. She was thought to be responsible for the fertility of the land. Ceres was the only one of the gods who was involved on a day-to-day basis in the lives of the common folk. While others occasionally \"dabbled\" in human affairs when it suited their personal interests, or came to the aid of \"special\" mortals they favored, the goddess Ceres was truly the nurturer of mankind. Ceres was worshipped at her temple on the Aventine Hill, one of the Seven Hills of ancient Rome. Her festival, the Cerealia, was celebrated on April 19. Another special time for Ceres was Ambarvalia, a Roman agricultural fertility rite held at the end of May. Ceres is portrayed holding a scepter or farming tool in one hand and a basket of flowers, fruits, or grain in the other. She may also be wearing a garland made from ears of corn. The Romans explained the turning of the seasons with the following story: Ceres was the sister of Jupiter, and Proserpine was their daughter. Proserpine was kidnapped by Pluto, god of the underworld, to be his bride. By the time Ceres followed her daughter, she was gone into the earth. Making matters worse, Ceres learned that Pluto had been given Jupiter's approval to be the husband of his daughter. Ceres was so angry that she went to live in the world of men, disguised as an old woman, and stopped all the plants and crops from growing, causing a famine. Jupiter and the other gods tried to get her to change her mind but she was adamant. Jupiter eventually realized that he had to get Proserpine back from the underworld, and sent for her. Unfortunately, Pluto secretly gave her food before she left, and once one had eaten in the underworld one could not forever leave. Proserpine was therefore forced to return to the underworld for four months every year. She comes out in spring and spends the time until autumn with Ceres, but has to go back to the underworld in the winter. Her parting from Ceres every fall is why plants lose their leaves, seeds lie dormant under the ground, and nothing grows until spring when Proserpine is reunited with her mother.Explore the Temple  As you reach the top of the stairs, you see four tall columns in front of you. At either end is the side wall of the temple. You pass through the first four columns and enter into the pronaos. The pronaos is enclosed on three sides, open only at the front to the stairs now at your back. The front part of the pronaos contains two more rows of four columns each. In the middle of the pronaos you see three doors into the three separate cellae of the temple. As you pass through the last row of columns, you see that there is a corridor on either side of the three cellae, one to the east of the cellae, the other to the west.

The Oppian Hill (Latin, Oppius Mons; Italian: Colle Oppio) is the southern spur of the Esquiline Hill (Varro, LL V.50), one of the famous Seven Hills of Rome. It is separated from the Cispius on the north by the valley of the Subura, and from the Caelian Hill on the south by the valley of the Colosseum. The Oppius and the Cispius together form the Esquiline plateau just inside the line of the Servian Wall. In the divisions of the Septimontium (seven hills - Fest. 341, 348) Fagutal appears as an independent locality, from which we can infer that originally \"Oppius\" was strictly applied to this spur except the western end (HJ 254\u2011257; Mon. L. XV.782\u2011785). The northern tip of this western end was also called Carinae, which extended between the Velian Hill and the Clivus Pullius, looked out to the southwest (across the swamps of the Palus Ceroliae towards the Aventine), incorporated the Fagutal and was one of ancient Rome's most exclusive neighborhoods. At least for religious purposes the name Oppius continued in use to the end of the republic (CIL i2.1003 = vi.32455 \u2014 for this inscription, which mentions the Montani montis Oppi, cf. also Pagus Montanus; BC 1887, 156; Mitt. 1889, 278; DE II.2159\u201161); no later instance has been found. According to Varro (Fest. 348) its name derives from Oppius, a citizen of Tusculum who came to the Romans' assistance during Tullus Hostilius's siege of Veii. However the word's true etymology is obscure. It may possibly be that of a clan which lived in this area (Jord. I.1.183\u2011188) - it is noteworthy that it is a gens name of plebeian status. Detlefsen's conjecture (Bull. d. Inst. 1861, 18) that Oppius is derived from Oppidus was revived by Pinza (Mon. L. XV.782), who regards the name as comparatively late. The origin of the name Esquilino is still under much debate. One view is that the Hill was named after the abundance of holm-oaks, exculi, that resided there. Another view is that, during Rome's infancy, the Capitolium, the Palatium, and the northern fringes of the Caelian were the most-populated areas of the city, whose inhabitants were considered inquilini, in-towners; those that inhabited the external regions - Aurelian, Oppius, Cispius, Fagutalis - were considered exquilini, suburbanites. Rising above the valley in which was later built the Colosseum, the Esquiline was a fashionable residential district. At the Oppius, Nero confiscated property to build his extravagant, mile-long Golden House, and later still Trajan constructed his bath complex, both of whose remains are visible today. Farther to the northeast, at the summit of the Cispius, is the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. In 1781, the marble statue of a Discus thrower - the so-called Discobolus of Myron - was discovered.Community Streets for Residents  01 - Clivus Orbius\n 02 - Clivus Pullius\n 03 - Clivus Suburanus\n 04 - Via Labicana\n 05 - Via Praenestina\n 06 - Vicus Africus\n 07 - Vicus Caprarius\n 08 - Vicus Cuprius\n 09 - Vicus Curvus\n 10 - Vicus Iovis Fagutalis\n 11 - Vicus Sabuci\n 12 - Vicus Sandaliarius\n 13 - Vicus Sceleratus\n 14 - Vicus ViridiariiSites of Interest Community Administration  Praefectus: vacant The position of Praefectus (Prefect) of this community is currently vacant.

Respectfully Submitted, Marcus Audens Sodalitas Militarium On the mailing list of the Sodalitas Militarium of the Republic of Nova Roma, members discuss and study aspects of the Roman Military with focus on Infantry, Cavalry, Naval, Engineering and Cartography. Although the Sodalitas Militarium in no way promotes conquest and unnecessary military force, we are intrigued at the efficiency of the Roman Military Vehicle and its positive contributions to the foundation of Ancient and contemporary civilization, as well as its tactical legacy to the military forces of today. Members discuss Ancient Roman military strategies, tactics, battles, and also plan future social events. The Sodalitas is involved in the sponsorship of Roman Reenactment Legions worldwide. All citizens and socii in Nova Roma are invited to join the Sodalitas Militarium.

Lucretius Agricola (Populus)  X Vicus Apollinis Mons PalatiumVestibulum  The illustration is an apotropaic mosaic from the entrance to the Domus di Giove Fulminatore in Ostia. A prevailing theory of vision in antiquity was that the eyes were a source of rays or particles that probed the object of vision. Because of this, unwanted visual contact involved a sort of tactile violation, or even penetration (the \"evil eye\"). Even today we can talk about a \"penetrating stare\". Apotropaic images are an attempt to neutralize unwanted visual attacks by countering visual penetration with an image of equally potent penetration. Mottos such as Hic Habitat Felicitas do not refer to any felicitas derived from sexual intercourse. Instead they should be seen as equivalent to whistling past a graveyard; an attempt to assert felicitas against any possible attack of evil. Claudia Moser (Naked Power: The Phallus as an Apotropaic Symbol in the Images and Texts of Roman Italy, University of Pennsylvania [1]) cites Skinner (Sexuality in Greek and Roman Culture [2] ): \u201claughter is itself apotropaic\u201d and \u201csexual imagery could be a source of mirth, releasing tension and anxiety.\u201dLararium  Take the lararium as emblematic of the profound difference of the cultus deorum from the Abrahamic religions. For cultores, the divine world is not a separate sphere. The gods participate in our community, our citizenship, our homes. We care for them (the meaning of cultor), and they care for us. Their fundamentally benevolent attitude towards us is shown in their gifts: agriculture, music and the arts, community life. The lararium shows the democratic nature of the cultus deorum. Each pater- (or mater-) familias is at the same time the chief priest of the family cultus. The same pattern is seen today in Japan, with the household shrine (kamidana) and their family rituals, for example, on New Year Day. Removal of the lararium separates us from the gods and takes the care of our relationship with them out of our hands.Atrium Peristylum  My biographyYour Name (Populus)  | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | VI | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | {{domus}} | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | '''[[Your Name (Populus)|YOUR \u2022 NAME]]''' | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | '''Description of your DOMUS site goes here''' |- Change the text to read: | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | VI | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | {{domus}} | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | '''[[Gaius Marius (Populus)|GAIVS \u2022 MARIVS]''' | style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\" | '''Welcome to the Domus of Gaius Marius''' |- Next, click the Save page button at the bottom of the page.

Originally it was part of a group of hills that included Collis Latiaris, Mucialis (or Sanqualis), Salutaris. These are now lost due to buildings built in the 16th century and later. According to Roman legend, the Quirinal Hill was the site of a small village of the Sabines, and king Titus Tatius would have lived there after the peace between Romans and Sabines. These Sabines had erected altars in the honour of their god Quirinus (naming the hill by this god). Tombs have been discovered from the 8th century B.C. to the 7th century B.C. that could confirm a likely presence of a Sabine settlement area; on the hill there was the tomb of Quirinus, that Lucius Papirius Cursor transformed into a temple for his triumph after the third Samnite war. Some authors consider it possible that the cult of the Capitoline Triad (Jove, Minerva, Juno) could have been celebrated here well before it became associated with the Capitoline Hill. The sanctuary of Flora, an Osco-sabine goddess, was here too. In 446 BC, a temple was dedicated on the Quirinal in the honour of Semo Sancus Dius Fidius, and it is possible that this temple was erected over the ruins of another temple. Augustus, too, ordered the building of a temple, dedicated to Mars. On a slope of the Quirinal were the extensive gardens of Sallust. On the Quirinal Hill is where Constantine ordered the erection of his baths, the last thermae complex of imperial Rome. These are now lost, having been incorporated into Renaissance Rome, with only some drawings from the 16th century remaining.Current Streets for Residents  01 - Alta Semita\n 02 - Clivus Mamuri\n 03 - Clivus Salutis\n 04 - Vicus Insteius\n 05 - Vicus Longus\n 06 - Vicus Minervi\n 07 - Via Nomentana\n 08 - Vicus Portae Collinae\n 09 - Via SalariaSites of Interest Community Administration  Praefectus: vacant The position of Praefectus (Prefect) of this community is currently vacant.

They can use their specific abilities to do a variety of things.Characters  Character is a general term. It applies to anybody who appeared in the Games or Television ShowJeera  Jeera is the youngest daughter of the Chief, and Tak's friend in Tak and the Power of Juju (Television Series). She is a tomboy, similar to how Fauna was in the games. She is also the younger sister of Zaria, so Zaria is the next in line for the Chief, but Psychic Juju implies that she is not, so it is possible Jeera will be the next Chief. She usually is with Tak and Keeko, and will usually get in trouble with them both. Just like Tak and Keeko, she is still a kid, so she is immature, but appears to be more mature than the other two. She also has a pet Gratch. Jeera is voiced by Kari Whalgren.Appearance  Jeera is slightly smaller than Tak, but taller than Keeko. Jeera has freckles and wears slightly visible orange lipstick. She has messy Magenta hair and a green headband that ties on the side with a small ponytail in back. Jeera's tribe marks are on her right eye, her right arm, and her left leg. She wears a pinky and yellow flower (Possibly a Hibiscus.) in her hair that ties her whole look together. To show she's a free spirit, she wears a Cheetah(?)-printed mid-drift and a short green skirt.Personality  Jeera likes to have fun and be free, so she dreads going to events and festivals with Chief and Zaria. Even though she's powerless, Jeera could hold her own in a fight. Whenever Tak does something or says something stupid, Jeera more often than not punches him in the arm. Some say it's a sign of affection. Jeera is the one who's always by Tak's side, which is odd seeing as how she mostly insults him rather than cheering him on. Jeera has a weakness for cute animals, like Hrumpyfrump Puppykins and Gratches. Jeera also has a habit of naming things, like her J-Runner \"Sprinkle Whistle\" and Navis the Gratch's almost-name, \"Shimmer Lins\".Role in the Television Series  In a nutshell, Jeera plays the role of the Tomboy/Best Female Friend/Possible Love Interest of Tak.Appearances Flora  Flora is Tak's trainer in Tak and the Power of Juju. She's spunky, but helpful. Flora is the daughter of the Moon Juju, and twin sister of Fauna. She is seen as a Juju in training, probably due to her being younger. She is the juju of plants as the word flora means plants in the surrounding area. She has a green skin tone, and she drops leaves while flying. She also flies with a green aura around her. She has a major role in the first game, minor roles in the second, third, and fifth games, and does not appear in the Television Series. She is voiced by Jennifer Hale in all appearances.Tak and the Power of Juju  In the original game, Flora first appears in Lok's Training, to teach Tak the basics. After this, she guides Tak throughout the game, and giving helpful hints to Tak. After \u200b\u200bLower Tree Village, near the rhino in Tak's Village, Flora leaves Tak to fend for himself. She appears at almost every new location however, giving a small bit of information every time. She also appears in the Dark Temple, but has no real information for Tak. Later, Tlaloc turns Flora into an Orangutan, and when Tak turns Tlaloc into a Sheep, Flora launches him away. In the end, Tak and Flora leave, dancing and singing.Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams  Flora has a much reduced role in the game. She only appears twice, both being summoned from a Juju Shrine with Fauna. Both times, they give Tak the option to turn into two different animals.Tak: The Great Juju Challenge  Flora has a bigger role, appearing mainly in the background of scenes. She disqualifies the Grammazons early in the game. She then, with Fauna give more Mana to Tak and Lok twice in the game, both times being ordered to by the Moon Juju.Tak: Mojo Mistake  In the fifth game, Flora is one of the Jujus present at the Bizart. She dosen't have a great role, but she asks Tak for help when her grassy crown got stolen by the mutated helpers.Trivia Appearances External Links Lok  Lok was a character throughout the Tak and the Power of Juju Series. Lok was raised as a warrior to fulfill the Pupanunu People's Prophecy to defeat Tlaloc and return power to the Moon Juju. Afterwards, Lok remained a character, \"aiding\" Tak and Jibolba in their quests. In the Television Series, Lok is more of an anti-hero, but is still called a warrior. In the games, Lok is included for comic relief. Lok is voiced by Patrick Warburton in all games, and the Television Series.Personality  Lok is a very self-centered person. This probably comes from being raised on the belief that he would be a mighty warrior, and save the Village. This could have easily gotten into his head, and formed his personality. Lok is very strong, but is overall dimwitted and many times cannot realize when he is being a pain and should just leave. There are many differences between the video game Lok and the TV version. In the video games Lok is a brave and strong warrior who truly wants to be the hero, as shown when he helps Tak in the Great Juju Challenge, however his pride, arrogance, and somewhat immature behavior often get in his way despite his good intentions. However in the TV show Lok is far more cowardly and self-centered, claiming to be a mighty warrior just for the attention, but always run away from danger.Before the Games  Little is known before the events of the games. He was an apprentice to Jibolba. He was trained in Lok's Training to become a warrior and fulfill the Pupanunu's People's Prophecy. But, just before he could accomplish this, Tlaloc turned the Villagers into Sheep including Lok.Appearance  Lok has had the same appearance throughout the games. He is tall and muscular, and never wears a shirt, like many tribesmen. He has fuchsia face paintings, and also has short purple hair. He also sports a green cape, held on by a rope, and two horns or fangs. In the Television Series, he has a little longer hair, slightly bluer hair and a blue cape. Other than this, his appearance is identical to his game self.Tak and the Power of Juju  Lok first appeared as a sheep in Tak\u00a0and The Power of Juju (Game). This lead to Tak having to take on several missions. After getting the plants, Lok's Sheep is returned and is revealed to be Tobar. After Tak gets the Spirit Rattle Lok was found dead, crushed by Sheep. After Tak found Lok's Spirit Balloon, he took it back to the real world, and ressurected him. When Lok was ready to fight, he suddenly had a strange feeling in his stomach, and got stoned with Resurrection's Revenge, causing him to have diarreah. He rushed to the bathroom, where he had some trouble finishing the job' where he can be heard in the background groaning due to his current position. After Tak gets the 3 Moonstones, the Moon Juju appears and reveals that Lok, although prepared to fight, is not the fulfiller of the prophecy and that Tak is, Jibolba and Lok's disbelief.Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams  In the beginning, Lok and Jibolba ponder how to wake Tak up from a 16 day sleep. Lok thinks he wakes Tak up with his Juju Smelling Salt. Jibolba tells Lok to go get his magic sandals, which do not exist, so Lok will leave. But, Lok comes back while Tak is feeding Belly Juju Juju Candy. After Tak leaves, Lok feeds the Belly Juju, and he chokes and falls over. Lok says, \"I'm, uh, Goin' IN\" Lok somehow catches up with Tak and Jibolba, and Lok appears befor Woodies and blows up their bridge. The Woodies then all attack Lok at once, and Tak saves him. Later, Lok appears after Mind-Reader Juju is summoned, and accidently has his mind read. It is revealed he \"borrowed\" Tak's things. After Tak crosses the gap, Lok attempts to pole-vault across using Tak's old Staff. Lok does not make the gap, and falls. When Tak wakes up in the Gloomleaf Arena, Caged Juju makes Tak guess whats in the box to get the lift key. Lok was in the box. As soon as they make it up the lift, Lok is carried away by the Woodies. He comes back after Tak gets Dead Juju's Tiki from the Woodie King. Tak, Jibolba, Dead Juju, and Lok all walk off. Just before reaching Skyrock Crater, the four are put to sleep. Tak and Jibolba wake up, leaving the two \"babbling blockheads\". When they wake up, the continue together. Later, they are seen climbing a snowy mountain, and find a Juju Shrine. Lok uses a chant to summon a Juju, who reveals to be Dead Juju, much to Lok's disgust. In the end, at the Dream Fortress, Jibolba, Dead Juju, and Lok fight off the Nightmare Creatures, while Tak chases down Tlaloc. In the final battle against Tlaloc, Lok is a playable character. After Tlaloc is defeated, Tak wakes up. Jibolba reveals that it has all been a dream, and Lok wonders about this princess that Tak dreamed about.Tak: The Great Juju Challenge  In this game, Lok is a playable character. He participates in The Great Juju Challenge with Tak as Team Pupanunu. Lok was apparently chosen as, \"He was available\". Throughout the challenge, Lok proves to be powerful, even in the end receiving The Ancient Hammer of Handy Juju. After Team Pupanunu defeats Team Black Mist, Lok and Tak waits for the party to start. In the end, there is no party, and the game ends with Tak and Lok have a big high-five.Tak and the Power of Juju Television Series  In the Series, Lok's the resident \"Mighty Warrior\" of the Pupununu people. He at least thinks he is. In reality, when danger appears, Lok's usually nowhere to be found. But he doesn't let the facts stop him from believing that \"The Lok\" or \"The Lokster\" was responsible for any and all of the tribe's great achievements. When Lok does try to be heroic, it usually results in an enormous catastrophe. Luckily, Tak's around to clean up the mess. Lok often turns out to be an anti-hero, although it often works out for that reason. Lok is constantly getting on Tak's nerves, due to the fact that he always tries to take the credit for Tak's accomplishments.Trivia Appearances Television Series Episodes Moon Juju  The Moon Juju is a powerful Juju and the protector of the Pupanunu Village. She gained her powers through the use of the sacred Moonstones, residing inside the Moon temple. She is widely considered as the physical incarnation of beauty and as the most powerful Juju in the universe. She's seen as a hot beast to many of her fellow Jujus, like the Two-Headed Juju in a holiday commercial. Every 60 years, a single tribe may earn her favor and protection by winning The Great Juju Challenge. But she must do what ever the people of the wining tribe prays her to do. Whether it be benevolent, or malicious ( Like the goals of the Black Mist tribe ). The Moon Juju has two daughters, Flora, and Fauna, who have both helped Tak in his journey. Despite having a major role in the games, the Moon Juju does not appear in the Television Series. She is voiced by Tina Illman in the games.Apperance  The Moon Juju is a fairly tall Juju. She is always seen wearing her light Blue-Violet silk gown with lighter swirls all over it. Her skin is a mix of light pink and pale purple. Moon Juju has short, curly bluish-violet hair most similar to Flora's hair style.Tak and the Power of Juju  In the original game, Tlaloc, Pins & Needles steal the Moonstones, ridding the Moon Juju of her power and allowing Tlaloc to transform the villagers into Sheep, including the warrior Lok. Tak is forced to save the Tribe, and in the end, finds the three moonstones, and Jibolba is able to restore the Moon Juju's power in his hut. With her power restored, the Moon Juju reveals that Tak was the one who filled the prophecy, not Lok, and Tak is sent to the Dark Temple to fight Tlaloc.Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams  The Moon Juju only appears once, at the Moon Juju Interlude. She gives Tak the choice of four Spirit Animals to help in his journey. She quickly disappears without telling Tak what the best animal to choose is.Tak: The Great Juju Challenge  The Moon Juju has a much larger role, as whoever wins The Great Juju Challenge, will win her favor. After the Jibba Jabbas gets eliminated, the Black Mist tell what they plan to do with her power, including the intention of burning the Pupanunu Village. When Tak questions her, Moon Juju answers reluctantly that she must \"support whoever wins\". She then realizes something's odd with Crug and saying that he reminded her of someone familiar. Later, with only the Pupanunu and Black Mist left, the Black Mist cheats in the final Proving Grounds fight, by using Dark Juju's power. But, the Moon Juju stops their cheating, allowing the Pupanunu to win the last round and be declared winners, re-earning the Moon Juju's favor. But, no one is left to celebrate.Trivia Appearances Tak and the Power of Juju (Game)  Tak and the Power of Juju (sometimes refered to as Tak 1, and can be abbreviated as TatPoJ) is the first game of the Tak and the Power of Juju Franchise. The game was developed by Avalanche Software, and released on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and the Game Boy Advance. It was released in North America on October 15, 2003, and in the PAL Region on March 12, 2004.Plot  The game opens with Jibolba, a Shaman, summons the player. He then tells the Pupanunu People's Prophecy, as it has came true. After Jibolba is named the High Shaman of the Pupanunu Village, the other Shaman, Tlaloc grew angry. In his rage, he and his minions, Pins and Needles, all snook into the Moon Temple and stole the sacred Moonstones to rid power from the Moon Juju who protected the village. Tlaloc then took his own power and turned the defenseless villagers into Sheep. Jibolba could only save a few, although in the end the Warrior Lok was also turned into a sheep. Jibolba then tells as Lok was supposed to fulfill the prophecy. To return Lok to his normal form, he sends his other apprentice, Tak to collect nine Magical Nubu Plants. Being guided by a Juju, Flora, Tak goes to the Burial Grounds, Lower Tree Village, and either Chicken Island or Dryrock Canyon. After collecting the nine plants, Jibolba performs a spell on the sheep, and it is revealed that it is not Lok, but his squire, Tobar. While Jibolba sorts everything out, he sends Tak to the Upper Tree Village to get the Spirit Rattle. When Tak arrives, he must fight Pins and Needles to get the rattle. When he returns, Tak learns that the sheep crushed and killed Lok. In a last ditch effort, Jibolba tells Tak to get 100 Yorbels and Lok's Spirit from the Spirit World to resurrect Lok. Tak goes to a variety of locations, and collects all the needed items. When he returns, Jibolba resurrects Lok, but as he is going to set off, something happens. He asks to go to the outhouse, and Jibolba tells Tak that Lok has Resurrection's Revenge. While Lok prepares, Jibolba gives Tak the Amulet of Champions to get access to the area with the Moonstones. Tak goes to Chicken Temple, Sun Temple, and Mountain Top North. There he fights off Pins and Needles to get the Moonstones. When Tak returns, Jibolba restores the Moon Juju's power, where it is revealed that Tak has fulfilled the prophecy, not Lok. She sends Tak to the Dark Temple to fight Tlaloc. Here Tak fights Tlaloc through different platforms, slowly destroying his giant plant that is the source of his power. In the end, Tlaloc turns Flora into an Orangutan. She launches Tak into the plant, and using his Power of Juju, he turns Tlaloc into a sheep. Flora then launches Tlaloc into the exploding plant, which sends Tlaloc to Mountain Top with a group of \"loving\" Rams. Flora and Tak dance off, waiting for their triumphant return to the Village.Levels Characters Jujus Cast Reception  Although Tak and the Power of Juju met with great hype, the final product was abnormaly met average scores.

Play Magazine rated the game 83%, stating \"Tak is one of the most detailed platformers I've ever seen, and possesses a measure of style that sets the universe apart\".

It's just not fun enough.\"Sequels  The Original Series would be made into Tak and the Power of Juju (Television Series). It would release two games during its run:Trivia See Also Fauna  Fauna is a Juju who is Flora's sister and the Moon Juju's second daughter. While Flora is calm and well mannered, Fauna is the wild child of the family. Also, Flora is kind and sweet, while Fauna is mean and agressive. Fauna is the Juju of animals. She is voiced by Candace Bailey.Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams  In Tak 2, Fauna appears with Flora to give Tak the ability to morph into an animal. The two of them argue which animal Tak should be and gave him the power to turn into a Bear or Squirrel. She then appears with Flora in the next level to give Tak the choice of a Frog or Boar.Tak: The Great Juju Challenge  Fauna appears again, mainly in the background of cutscenes of the Proving Grounds fights. But, she does appear to eliminate Team Grammazon from The Great Juju Challenge. She and Flora are also sent by the Moon Juju twice to give Tak and Lok more Mana to help them in the challenge.Trivia Appearances Zaria  Zaria is the older daughter of the Chief and the older sister of Jeera in Tak and the Power of Juju (Television Series). She is the next one to inherit the throne and will never let Jeera forget it, but Psychic Juju implys that she won't, so it is possible Jeera will be the next Chief. She is preppy, girly, spoiled, bossy fashionista. She constantly brags that she is the most beautiful in all the tribe, but Jeera and Tak think she's full of herself and just plain mean.Appearance  Zaria has brown hair with a blonde highlight on the right bang, large green eyes. She wears a green headband with three yellow feathers and two orange feathers, forming a crown similar to her father's. She also wears a golden necklace that holds her dress up. In some episodes, she wears yellow feathers in the back in addition to braclets with yellow feathers on them. There's two gold chains on her right arm, and a purple Zebra-print dress with a green belt with yellow-orange feathers. Clashing slightly with her outfit, Zaria wears a silver anklet with silver balls on it.Personality  Zaria is preppy, girly, spoiled, bossy fashionista, mean and thinks she is the prettiest in the tribe (and in the world), from her face to her feet. When she has power, even for a short while, she makes the most of it by abusing it and making Jeera miserable along the way. Zaria loves to show off her expertise and \"talents\" to everyone. Like Lok, Zaria lives for and loves attention.Role in the Television Series  Zaria plays the role of the spoiled, Vally Girl Princess who dislikes her sister and her friends.Trivia Appearances Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams  Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams\u00a0(sometimes refered to as Tak 2, or even Tak and the Power of Juju 2) was the first sequel to Tak and the Power of Juju (Movie). The game was released in October 2004, and was available on the Playstation 2, Xbox, Gamecube, and Game Boy Advance. The game was released by Avalanche Software for THQ. This game was followed by Tak: The Great Juju ChallengePlot  Following the events of the first game, Tak has now been stuck in a dream for 16 days. Jibolba, and Lok ponder how they can wake him up. In reality, Tak is stuck in the Dream World, and is sent by the Dream Juju to fight the Dream Guardian, take The Staff of Dreams, and save the princess. After Tak refuses, he is told that if he does not do this, he will be stuck in the dream forever. As he fights throught the Dream World, he escapes through a Rift. When going through the rift, Tak wakes up, and Jibolba and Tak go find Jibolba's brother, JB. Lok wants to go, but Jibolba tells Lok to go fetch his magic sandals. Jibolba turns into a Flea for easy hauling, and they set off. When Tak and Jibolba reach a dead end, they summon the Belly Juju to get a raft. Belly Juju uses a barrel that Tak got for him, and throws Tak in it, and throws the barrel down river. Lok is once again left behind, and when Belly Juju chokes, Lok has to save him. As Tak and Jibolba go down the fast current, they fall down a huge waterfall, and Tak is knocked out. He wakes up in the Dream World, once again being led by the Dream Juju. Once he makes it to the end, he again enters the real world through a rift. Once in the real world, Tak and Jibolba set off, again. When they reach a bridge, they have to wait for Woodies to pass, but when they do, Lok blows up the bridge, and the Woodies attack. When Tak saves Lok, he summons Mind-Reader Juju. He tells Tak that with three magic stones, he can make Bolas to get across the gap. When Tak does this, he is knocked out by Woodies, again entering the Dream World. Tak then uses the Bolas to get through the Dream World. For the third time, he gets back to his world using a rift. When he awakes, he is in the holding area in the Gloomleaf Arena, where Woodies train, with Caged Juju. After an arguement, Caged Juju finds Lok, and uses a lift key to get up. When up, Lok is hauled off by Woodies, and Tak fights through waves of Woodies. After six rounds, he uses a Woody Catapult to escape, flying into the Gloomleaf Swamp. When half-way through the swamp, he sees Dead Juju being harrassed by Woodies, who steal his Tiki. Tak follows the Woodies to the rafters of the Arena, where Tak steals the Tiki from the Woodie King. He is then chased down river by Woodies, and when he falls down a waterfall, he grabs to a ledge with Dead Juju. When he returns the Tiki, Lok suddenly falls down the waterfall, and the four head off together. When outside Skyrock Crater, they can see Planetarium. They all got cursed by a spell, which make them all fall asleep. Tak uses a Woody Catapult to cause destruction in the Dream World, finally making it to the Tower where the Dream Guardian is at. But, he goes through a rift, and is told that his next sleep will put him in the tower. He and Jibolba wake up, leaving Lok and Dead Juju. Tak and Jibolba go through the Crater, and make it to the Planetarium. But inside, the area is overrun by Power Parasites, and JB is saved. JB tells them that he has never heard of a Dream Juju. So, JB sends Tak into sleep. Tak then enters the tower, and has a long battle with the Dream Guardian. After the battle, Tak gets The Staff of Dreams. The princess appears, and reveals to be Pins and Needles, and the Dream Juju reveals to be Tlaloc in Sheep form. Pins, Needles, and Tak all struggle for the Staff, and Needles gets The Staff of Nightmares, and Tak gets the Dream Shaker. Pins and Needles escape. Tak and Jibolba start their second half of their quest, which is chasing Pins and Needles. Tak is in the Moon Juju Interlude, and the Moon Juju was before him. She tells him to choose one of four Spirit Animals. Moon Juju inadvertently disappear. Tak chooses one, which enhance his powers. Then, Lok and Dead Juju wake up and start the second half of their quest, which is searching for Tak and Jibolba. Meanwhile, Tak and Jibolba start running away from the powerful rift. During the run, Flora and Fauna give Tak the usage of Animal Totems. Lok and Dead Juju find a shrine and used it to help them find Tak and Jibolba, but reveals to be Dead Juju and Lok loses his hope. Tak then start battling Pins and Needles in Dream Fortress with the taunt of Jibolba, and Pins and Needles is destroyed. Tak then battled Tlaloc for Staff of Dreams. After the battle, Tak apologized to the Dream Guardian and gave the staff back. Tak finally kills Tlaloc. Tak woke up and it was revealed the entire game was in a dream. It has been implied it will happen.Levels Gameplay  Gameplay has changed since the first game. First, the ability to Glide was added to the game. Also, the game did not have a hub, instead after you completed a level you would move right on to the next one. This would cause problems, as when you completed the game, you would start back at your last save point (the last possible one was the Dream Fortress). Things were also dropped. You could no longer pick up items and throw them. Also, riding animals did reappear. There were, however, new animals, such as the Bear, Boar, Frog, Beaver, Skunk, and Squirrel\u00a0. There was also the ability to use Animal Totems. The collecting of Feathers was also dropped, instead replaced with a Mana Bar for magic. Feathers did reappear. There is also a Health Bar instead of a Health Percentage. Tak also earned his powers instead of finding them. Tak can also use Move Combinations instead of just hitting. Tak can use Juju Potions from the pause screen to unlock items. The collecting of Bugs, Crystals, and Fruits have been added. Tak can also find Recipe Cards in the game to unlock items. Lastly, Tak can use a Universal Card in the game to unlock Recipe Cards that don't appear in the world or the game itself.Cast Trivia Aurora Juju  Aurora Juju is the mother of Tak in the Tak Television Series. She is very beautiful and bares a VERY close resemblence to the Moon Juju. Her powers are unknown but possibly vary as widely as Tak's.Appearance  Aurora Juju is a very pretty and mysterious Juju. She has curly blue-purple hair with a tiny bun in the back, aqua skin, and dark green eyes. She wears a Magenta Greek-like dress that curls on the bottem. She seems to be some sort of bug Juju, seeing as how she has a gloworm-like bottem half, glowing pink antennae, and purple dragonfly wings.Past  According to Darkness Juju, he and Aurora Juju were engaged to be married. They were in love with each other, but Aurora fell for a Pupununu man and had Tak in the process. After Darkness learned this, he ordered the other Jujus to never help the tribe, out of anger. Aurora is assumed to have great power because she created Tak's Power of Juju crystal, that Darkness was after throughout the movie and the time he was together with her.Present  Aurora's wheareabouts are unknown to even Darkness Juju. Tak's Father's whereabouts, and real identity, are also unknown to even the Pupununu people. It is theorized that the couple could've met an untimely death, had someone put Tak at the shrine for Jibolba to find, and was never heard from again. However, during the movie, \"Destiny Schmestiny\", it can be theorize that she might still be alive and in hiding as Darkness Juju believed that she had returned to him.Trivia Appearances Tlaloc  Tlaloc is the Main Antagonist of the Tak and the Power of Juju Video Game Series. While he only appears in a single episode of the show, his role in the Games is far greater. He is voiced by Rob Paulsen in the Video games, and Jeff Bennett in the animated series.Before the Games  Prior to the games plotlines, very little is revealed about Tlaloc. He is known to have competed with Jibolba in The Great Juju Challenge 60 years ago. This would imply that he was a Great Shaman, and possibly a Great Warrior, considering most teams in The Great Juju Challenge included a taller, stronger warrior and a shorter, more magical shaman (presumably Jibolba at the time). Jibolba and Tlaloc would win the Challenge, barely beating Team Black Mist. In doing this, Tlaloc and Jibolba win the favor of the Moon Juju. Tlaloc would remain a Shaman in the Pupanunu Village until just before the events of the first game. Just before the events, Jibolba and Tlaloc are up for the Village's Head Shaman. Due to Tlaloc's use of Bad Magic, Jibolba is appointed Head Shaman. In his outrage, Tlaloc steals the Moonstones, with help from his Voodoo doll servants Pins & Needles, thus ridding the Moon Juju of her power. Then, Tlaloc uses the Moonstones to turn the Villagers of the Pupanunu Village, and surrounding villages into Sheep, including (supposedly) the warrior Lok, who was destined to fulfill the prophecy to defeat Tlaloc. Only Jibolba and Tak remain unharmed, and Tak is sent on a quest to defeat Tlaloc.Tak and the Power of Juju  Tlaloc appears for the first time in the Shaman's Tree in Upper Tree Village. He forces Pins and Needles to fight Tak for the Spirit Rattle. Later, he appears in the Spirit World, and he makes the shrubs push large spikes out to pop Lok's Spirit in a balloon. Tlaloc then sends Pins and Needles to stop Tak from acquiring the three moonstones. After Tak gets the three moonstones, the Moon Juju reveals that Tak, not Lok, has fulfiled the Pupanunu People's Prophecy, and he is the Mighty Warrior. The Moon Juju then sends Tak to Tlaloc. Tlaloc appears for the final time, in the Dark Temple to fight Tak. During the fight, Tlaloc uses magic spells and nerbils to fight Tak. But, Tak kills his magical plants to kill the final big plant. During this Tlaloc turns Tak into a variety of animals to defeat him. In the end, Tak uses his Power of Juju to turn Tlaloc into a Sheep. Then, Flora, who was turned into an Orangutan during the battle, send Tlaloc into the big plant. Tlaloc is sent flying onto the Mountain Top, surrounded by \"loving\" Rams. Tak and Flora walk away cheering. Tlaloc is defeated until the next game.Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams  During Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams, Tlaloc is still a Sheep. He sends Tak in the Dream World (disguised as the\u00a0Dream Juju) to defeat the Dream Guardian and get The Staff of Dreams, after Tak does this, Tlaloc reveals himself, and in a struggle between Tak and\u00a0Pins & Needles\u00a0the staff breaks into two pieces. After Tak defeats Pins and Needles, Tlaloc takes their half to plunge the world into the Dream World where Tlaloc would have great influence and power over everything. But, Tak is able to defeat Tlaloc's army of Black Sheep in Tlaloc's Sanctuary, and then knocks Tlaloc off the edge as well. Tlaloc appears as himself in the Dream World, were he returns to his normal form, and abducts Tak through a rift. Then Tak and Tlaloc each transform into Dream Guardian Creatures, and fight. After Tak defeats him, he restores the Staff and returns it to the real Dream Guardian. Then back in the real world, Tak, Jibolba, Lok, and Dead Juju rejoice that Tlaloc is finally defeated. But then, Tlaloc returns and admits that he cannot defeat Tak and that he is the Mighty Warrior of the Pupanunu People. But, he then petrifies Lok, Jibolba, and Dead Juju and attacks them. Tak must constantly switch bodies with them to protect them, as Tlaloc uses Nightmare Creatures to attack them. After Tak finally defeats Tlaloc, Tak wakes up, revealing that Tak has been asleep for 16 days, implying nothing happened. But, before the credits role, Tlaloc's army of Black Sheep are seen running, implying that it did happen, or will happen.Tak: The Great Juju Challenge  In Tak: The Great Juju Challenge, Tlaloc has a small role. His role is reduced to expand from the typical storyline, and so there could be a new antagonist brought in. First he appears to form a truce with Tak and give him a new power. He then pretends to give Lok a power to shut him up. He is shown a little later with Jibolba reminicing about when they both won The Great Juju Challenge over 60 years prior. Tlaloc in his human form implies that the events of the second game didn't happen when Tak thought, or they occured in between the events of both games.Trivia Appearances Jujus  Jujus are magical, mystical creatures that exist within the series. Jujus come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Over the course of the series, there has been numerous Jujus introduced, the majority introduced in the Television Series. Each Juju can perform Magic spells, and many seem to have a certain role. Most Jujus stay in The Juju Realm in their own world.

Before the next match, Tak and Lok see Bartog and Crug talking to an unknown Juju, and planning. After three more challenges, the Proving Grounds match is played, but Team Jibba Jabba is eliminated. After the match Bartog and a different sounding Crug talk about burning down the Pupanunu Village, once they win. This means Tak and Lok must win. Note: The following is a sub-plot. Even though optional, it fits in the story at this point. On a return visit to The Gates of Nocturne, Tak and Lok find Crug, tied up. He reveals that they have been cheating with the Dark Juju, and the Juju and Bartog cut the weakest link, Crug. Crug knows a good way to do better than Team Black Mist.

Now Tak must find the Juju masters of the Big G's and acquire the magic needed to stop the giants before they make a mess that will take Tak an eternity to clean up.Plot  In the beginning, Tak complains about Jibolba making him clean the Spoiled Shrine. Jeera offers to take the J-Runner, and Tak wants to take a shortcut through the jungle. Despite Keeko's warning, Tak goes anyway. After going through a long trail full of Woodie Tribesmen, Tak finally makes it to the shrine. After fighting his way up, Tak gets to the top of the shrine. Tak decides to lift up a giant gem, and stuff everything below it. However, he cannot support the gem with his Magic, and it falls and breaks. Suddenly, the ground shakes, and these long trails of magic fly out. Suddenly, four gigantic Big Gs appear, and start reaking havoc on the world. When Tak goes back to the village, Jibolba tells Tak that whoever did this must see four Jujus known as the Guardians of Gross. First Tak sees Debris Juju, and after winning a mini-game, Tak gets Lumpy Magic. He then sets out for the first G, Trashthulu. After a long trail, he uses a catapult to launch onto Trashthulu. When he lands, he must use Lumpy Magic to make it to the head of the beast. Once inside, he grabs the essence gem of the beast, and he must jab his staff into the eyes to defeat him. When both eyes are handeled, Tak jumps out, and the beast turns to stone and collapses. After, Tak goes to Icky Juju, and he gets Slime Magic. Tak surfs through a river of slime onto Slopviathan. Now, Tak must got through the slop, and make it to the head of the beast. Once here, he pumps the eyes of Slopviathan with Slime, so they explode. He then grabs the essence, and jumps off as he turns to stone. Next, he goes to Melty Juju, who gives Tak Cheesy Magic. He then waits, but is eaten by Gorgonzilla. Now he goes through the body until he is in the lower jaw of the G. He then hits the hurt teeth of the beast, which makes his top jaw fly open while he cries. Tak then starts beating the uvula of the beast. This makes the essence fly off his forhead, and the beast turns to stone and crumbles. Finally, Tak heads to Stinky Juju where he gets Stinky Magic. Now, he heads to Stinkolossus by going through another jungle path. Here he makes it to the beast, and he must fight to the top, while fighting three smaller stink beasts. When he makes it to the top, he is floating on platforms, swirling around the G. He then beats the three smaller beasts again, and then he must shoot the monster's Stink Bombs back at him. This makes him spit out his essence, and Tak escapes. Now, with all essences, Tak restores the gem. When he is about to put the essences back, Stinky Juju returns to see. Tak trips, and the beasts are free again. When Tak thinks all is lost, Stinly Juju tells Tak there is another way. If he can collect slime from all the Gs, and burp, it will defeat the Gs once and for all. And, after a race in the J-Runner, Tak does just this. Tak celebrates, and the game is over.Gameplay  In this game, many things were added and dropped. First, as Tak no longer has his cape, he cannot glide. Tak also no longer has his Throwing ability, but can now run on walls and wall jump.Characters Cast References  In the trailer, the game shows footage from Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams, and Tak: The Great Juju Challenge. It even mentions The Staff of Dreams and The Great Juju Challenge, which would imply that the game and television series took place after the games, but there is also evidence that disproves the theory. thumb|300px|right|The Trailer with referencesReception  According to IGN give Tak and the Guardians of Gross 6.6 out of 10 saying: \"Tak and the Guardians of Gross is a relatively decent action-adventure title that's perfectly tailored for the younger gamer in the house. The humor is spot on and manages to set the game apart from the myriad of similar titles on the market, enough so that you may even forgive some its obvious flaws. It's too bad that Tak's three-year hiatus wasn't enough to fix the shallow combat, wonky camera system and linear story progression, but Tak and the Guardians of Gross still manages to be a worthy \u2013 if somewhat less impressive \u2013 successor to its last-gen predecessors\"Trivia Further Reading Dark Juju  Darkness Juju (real name Travis) is an evil Juju that wants to control the Moon Juju.

IGN says:Trivia ", "The Darkness Wiki": "The Darkness Wiki Main Page Darkness (Games)  The Darkness is an ancient entity dating back to the beginning of time. A demon of death, the Darkness feeds upon the souls of those it consumes. As a spirit of shadows, it requires a human host; traveling in bloodlines, it bestows its power on the firstborn male's 21st birthday.Biography Early Life  The Darkness is the soul of the void of chaos which predates Creation. When God allowed the light into the emptiness, the Darkness was pushed back and forgotten. Driven mad by bitterness, the Darkness took possession of living human vessels; tearing its way through human history.The Darkness  The Darkness resided inside Jackie, waiting until his 21st birthday, when it will be able to awaken once again. As Jackie finally became twenty one during the midnight, the Darkness awakened and proceeded to kill a group of thugs sent by Paulie Franchetti. The Darkness also tells Jackie, that he's nothing more than its puppet. Later, when Jenny is kidnapped by Eddie Shrote and Paulie, Jackie fights through the hordes of goons that Paulie and Shrote throw at him in order to save her. As he reaches her, the Darkness forces Jackie to watch the confrontation between Jenny and the two murderers. Paulie pistol-whips Jenny in the face and belittles her and Jackie for what they have supposedly done. The two notice Jackie is being forced to watch by The Darkness and drag Jenny over to the door. Paulie continues to mock and criticize Jackie for betraying him. He then forces Jenny against the door and shoots her in the head as the Darkness laughs. This act by the Darkness, quickly backfires as Jackie shoots himself in the head. As the Darkness fixes the wound, Jackie's consciousness travels to the Otherworld, a realm created by the entity to trap past hosts or its victims. There, Jackie meets with his great-great-grandfather, Anthony, who decides to help his great-great-grandson in taking control of the Darkness. Anthony directs Jackie to a giant cannon with, which he could blow open an entrance to the castle where the Darkness resides. When Jackie reaches the cannon, the Darkness brings him back to real world, as he fixed his body and to stop his actions. Later the Darkness is enraged, when Jackie detonates a briefcase full of explosives in the Trinity Church, killing both him and Eddie Shrote, who was at that moment, torturing him. Knowing what Jackie is planning to do, the Darkness tries throws numerous obstacles in his path in the form of undead German forces, tanks and even attack planes. When this fails to stop him, the Darkness tries to talk Jackie out of his plan to take control of it. Jackie ignores the entities pleas and threats. After Anthony gets mortally wounded by a giant beast in the Otherworld, he mentions something about \"a light in The Darkness\" to Jackie, but before he can finish, the Darkness breaks the ground under his body, causing him to fall to the abyss. The Darkness then tells Jackie, that only it will prevail. It also mocks him by saying that Jackie will forever be alone. When Jackie arms the cannon and creates an entrance into the castle, where the Darkness resides, it begins to scream threats at him, saying that it will destroy him and that he will lose Jenny forever if he enters the castle. The Darkness also reveals, that it can take Jackie to her. Jackie ignores all of this and proceeds to enter the castle. Inside, he finds the Darkness attached to some short of contraption. As he approaches the extraction machines, the Darkness yells at him, that these devices aren't for him. Jackie yet again ignores it and uses the extraction machines to free the Darkness from controlling him. As Jackie frees the Darkness from the contraption, the entity is enraged by this action. The Darkness then summons Darklings and set them loose on Jackie for insulting its legacy. It then taunts Jackie, telling, that he's efforts are meaningless and it will always win in the end. Through Jenny's guidance, Jackie figures, that fighting the Darkness will only make it stronger. Instead, he decides to accept the Darkness. Much to the Darkness objections, the entity is absorbed by Jackie, taking complete control over it. Although, the Darkness accepts it's defeat, it points out, that with each life Jackie will take, it will come closer to owning his soul. As Jackie killed more and more of Paulie's henchmen, the Darkness urged him to completely let go, knowing that this will let the entity to take back the control over Jackie. By the time, Jackie reaches Paulie's whereabouts, an old lighthouse, the Darkness begins for brief moments, take control of Jackie himself. During these moments, the entity proceeds to gruesomely kill Paulie's henchmen. When he finally faces Paulie, the Darkness tells Jackie, that when Franchetti dies, it will own him. Jackie ignores this warning and kills Paulie. As he does this, the Darkness takes over Jackie, but gives a brief moment to meet Jenny.The Darkness II Vendettas  Although not directly appearing, various artifacts and weapons related to the Darkness appear in the hands of various mercenaries.Personality  The Darkness is a purely malevolent demonic entity of some kind and is clearly a sociopathic creature which only gets pleasure from Jackie's negative emotions, killing any non innocent human being, and the sexual appeal of some human females; As observed by one of its quotes in a rather perverted fashion. Although, Anthony points out, that this behaviour was caused by the human interaction with the Darkness. Having lived through thousands human hosts, each more sadistic and violent than other, caused the Darkness to go completely insane.Powers & Abilities Powers Weaknesses Trivia The Darkness II  The Darkness II is the sequel to 2007's The Darkness. It is developed by Digital Extremes, published by 2K Games and written by Paul Jenkins. It was released February 7, 2012 in North America and February 10, 2012 in Europe for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and is a planned launch title for Nintendo's Wii U console in 2012.Story  The Darkness II takes place two years after the events of the first game. Jackie Estacado, the current wielder of The Darkness has used his powers to become the Don of the Franchetti crime family. He has been unable to shake the thoughts of his dead girlfriend Jenny Romano and has since, with the help of estranged occultist Johnny Powell and his study into dark essence, contained his supernatural powers, and now The Darkness \"wants out in the worst way\". Just as Jackie lives the nice mafia life, he is hunted by the mysterious Victor Valente and The Brotherhood who want The Darkness for themselves. Jackie is challenged to stop Valente and The Brotherhood who have also captured his Aunt Sarah. In the way is the uncontrollable power of The Darkness and the haunting vision of Jenny who begins to stalk and beckon to Jackie. The game starts with Jackie talking to the player about his life and about The Darkness while sitting alone in a chair in a dark, seemingly endless room. Jackie pulls out a pendant with a small picture of his dead girlfriend Jenny and the scene shifts to Jackie getting out of a car and entering a luxurious restaurant. Jackie sits with two blonde twins until one is shot in the eye and a van crashes through the window, killing the other twin and heralding the start of a full-scale mob war, which has clearly been orchestrated by some outside force. Jackie's leg is wounded and Vinnie, one of Jackie's mob associates, gives Jackie a gun to fend off the attackers while Vinnie grabs Jackie and drags him through the restaurant and into the kitchen. Jackie smells gas leaking from the propane tanks as Vinnie tries to pry open the door, just in time for one of the attackers to throw a flaming bottle into the kitchen and igniting the gas into a violent explosion which knocks Jackie back and sends Vinnie through the wall, though they both survive. On the verge of death, Jackie sees Victor, who comments that Jackie is \"stronger than his father\", Victor then tells one of his henchmen to keep pushing Jackie and then disappears. As Jackie crawls toward the hole in the wall created by the explosion, The Darkness encourages Jackie to \"embrace The Darkness\", Jackie then releases The Darkness, who then proceeds to slaughter the remaining goons. While making his way through the streets and into the subway, Jackie begins seeing strange haunting visions of Jenny which beckon him to come to her. In the subway, Jackie avoids being hit by a train and makes his way onto the demolished tracks. He then sees another apparition of Jenny who tells him to dance with her. She then disappears as an oncoming train hits Jackie. The Darkness proclaims that Jackie will not die as Jackie wakes up in a strange dream-like world which seems to be some kind of heavenly hospital. There he sees Johnny Powell and his mob friend Tony, both of whom act strange. Jackie then wakes from the dream and realizes that The Darkness had taken possession of his body and slaughtered the remaining henchmen. He meets up with Fat Tony and makes his way back to his mansion. At Jackie's mansion, he talks with his Aunt Sara about Jenny and Sara comments on how Jackie is becoming obsessive like his father, which Jackie denies. Through many quests, hunting down everyone involved in the Brotherhood, This quest eventually brings Jackie to an abandoned carnival and into a confrontation with Victor Valente, a mysterious figure who knows what The Darkness is and wants his power for himself. Victor is the head of an ancient secret society known as The Brotherhood, formed thousands of years ago by a saint for the sole purpose of protecting the world from The Darkness. However the saint became corrupted and now The Brotherhood wants The Darkness for themselves, once Jackie finally catches up with Victor through his quest, which includes being pinned in an Iron Maiden and had the Darkness siphoned out of him, he fights a Darkness Empowered Mr. Peevish, which after you beat him, allows you to collect enough Dark Essence to make a shell of your previous powers, but is not sentient and dead, because there is no Darkness to power it, once you continue onwards, you confront Victor in your old house and a battle rages between Victor and Jackie. After beating Victor, Jackie takes the Siphon of the Angelus from Victor and beats him to death with it, and afterwards tries to stab himself with it, because the Siphon is the only way for the Darkness to truly die. Victor warned him that it will kill him and send him to Hell, but Jackie wants to die so he can be with Jenny, and so he takes the Siphon and impales himself. Jackie Estacado then wakes up in the mental asylum that the Darkness uses to trap Jackie while his body is being repaired, after realizing that he is in the Asylum and not in Hell, Jackie panics, and runs down the hall. Jackie, then asks to see Jenny in the Asylum, but on the way there, the Darkling appears and gives him access to the Rooftop, but as the two rush to the top of the building, the Darkling opens the roof door, Light then pours in and shoots the Darkling down the steps, as the Darkling's body begins to fry in the light. Because it died within the Darkness and not in the Human world, the Darkling cannot return. It gives Jackie it's goodbyes and wishes him good luck. Jackie then runs to the edge of the roof and is trying to jump off when Doctor Victor and Jenny come saying to stop. Jackie must choose to stay with the fake Jenny in the Asylum or jump and send himself to Hell to free the Real Jenny. Jackie persues his goal of getting to Jenny trapped by the Darkness, he goes down to Hell and tries to save the real Jenny. As he continue through this hellish maze, killing strange monstrosities and collecting flesh versions of normal guns, he eventually save her, which leads to an emotional moment of the couple hugging and kissing, with her thanking Jackie, but then suddenly apologizing. Jackie is confused as she suddenly flies out of his arms and Jenny transform into the Angelus, a creature that is the polar opposite of the Darkness. She tells him that because of all the suffering he has made with the Darkness, he must stay in the abyss within the Darkness forever. She then flies away and traps Jackie and the Darkness in the inner abyss. The game ends with Jackie screaming upwards in anger and the Darkness closes up, leaving Jackie presumably trapped within the void of Hell.Gameplay  In the first game, the Darkness powers were limited and players had little control over when they were activated. In The Darkness II, Digital Extremes are taking the powers more seriously than the weapons in this game. Digital Extremes have changed the function of the demon arms, allowing the right tentacle to be used to kill enemies by flicking the analogue stick to aim and attack with the right bumper/R2 button. The left tentacle will be used for picking up things to either use as weapons or remove them from your path. It's controls will be assigned to the left bumper. The Darkness II also introduces new moves, such as the anaconda, which allows players to impale their enemies with the Darkness. Gameplay will be improved, with the introduction of Quad wielding, where players can use duel wielding weapons and demon arms simultaneously for powerful combos and satisfying effects.Vendettas  \"Vendettas\" is a mode where the player plays as one of four hitmen who each have specific Darkness powers and go on missions for Jackie. The Vendettas campaign happens at the same time as the game's main campaign and focuses on securing artifacts from Brotherhood agents. The campaign has both single player and online co-operative play options. There is also a \"Hit List\" option where players can replay specific missions from the Vendettas campaign as well as new ones specific to the Hit List mode. Each character has two unique upgrade trees corresponding to their unique weapon and Darkness power, and a third tree improves the characters skill with guns. The players are tasked to assault settlements belonging to the Brotherhood to gain information, eliminate a target, or obtain an artifact. The campaign requires you to find and bring Johnny Powell to the Mansion and look for the Spear of Destiny at a heavily armed business facility owned by a millionaire named David Graves. Once David has been found, David plunges the Spear of Destiny, (which was used to contain a fragment of the Darkness following Jackie's capture), into his chest, transforming himself into a flying dragon-like Hell Beast. Once David is defeated, the four characters return to the mission table and are congratulated upon their success. The campaign ends with the mob leaving the four to carry on with their own motives, but being told not to leave the city as the mob will likely require their help again in the near future.Demo  A demo of the game was released on January 17th for Xbox 360, and January 24th for PC and PS3. It contains the beginning of the game, and the scene when Jackie is captured by the Victor Valente in the brothel.Reception  Reviews for The Darkness II are generally positive. PSM3 and Xbox World magazines awarded the game 8.1 out of 10 and said that the game is \"Not perfect, but deeply satisfying to blast through.\" Both Official Xbox Magazine US and Official Xbox Magazine UK awarded the game a 9 out of 10, with the US edition praising the dark story, \"excellent\" combination of Darkness powers and gunplay, brutal finishing moves, and fun cooperative multiplayer, while criticizing the campaign's relatively short length and problems reviving allies in multiplayer and the UK edition citing \"It's one of the best shooter-stories we've seen in years - justifying its own ludicrous nature in interesting and unexpected ways. If the ending didn't feel like such a cop-out, The Darkness II could have been on par with BioShock. As it is, the gripping narrative and wonderfully empowering combat mean you'll be talking about it for months after completing it.\" Playstation Official Magazine also gave the game 9 out of 10, stating \"no graphic novel has been bought to life in such a deliciously gory manner, with offing goons turned an art form.\" Gameshark gave the game 9.1 out of 10, praising the heavy focus on storyline and the action packed gameplay. IGN gave the game an 8 out of 10, praising the visuals and gameplay, but suggested the game lacks polish and the story, while enjoyable, isn't as strong as the original. GameSpot gave it a 7 out of 10, which is currently the lowest rating given to the game, but GameSpot still praised the gameplay, story, skill tree, and sound. The negative aspects of the game, in their view, include the short campaign, predictable enemy A.I, unsatisfactory multiplayer and linear level design.Gametrailers gave it a 7.4 out of 10.Trivia Screenshots  \ufeff\ufeffVideos Jackie Estacado (Games)  Jackie Estacado is the current human host of the Darkness, which awakened within him on the night of his 21st birthday. Jackie is an Italian-American ex-contract killer of the Franchetti crime family led by his \"uncle\" Paulie Franchetti. After killing both Paulie and Eddie Shrote in revenge for the murder of his girlfriend,\u00a0Jenny Romano, Jackie became the don of the Franchetti family after he was offered the position by Jimmy \"The Grape\". Jackie spent the next two years learning about The Darkness, as well as how to contain him. With the help of Johnny Powell, Jackie was finally able to contain the Darkness.Biography Early Life  After the death of his parents at a very young age, Jackie was enrolled at St. Mary's Orphanage where he spent the majority of his childhood. This is where he met his future girlfriend,\u00a0Jenny Romano. During his time at the orphanage, he nailed a frog to the front door. He was adopted by Paulie Franchetti of the Franchetti crime family when he was 12. Paulie only took in Jackie due to his need for another hit man and spent the majority of the time they spent together teaching him the inner workings of the family; however, Jackie reminisces on one time when Paulie took him to the subway to count the trains for vacation. Jackie calls it \"the best two days they ever spent together.\" He had his first kiss with a hooker named Candy down in the train station, and he knew a guy named Mickey Fat Lips who would feed subway tokens to his cat.The Darkness  The player takes the role of Jackie Estacado, with the story presented as a future-narrative on the present events observed by the player. On the eve of his 21st birthday, Jackie was targeted for assassination by the don of the New York mafia, \"Uncle\" Paulie Franchetti following a failed task to retrieve money for the latter. While hiding in a cemetery bathroom, the Darkness, an ancient force that has inhabited his family for several generations, awakens within Jackie and slaughters the remaining mobsters, with the benefit of Jackie becoming the possessor of seemingly unholy demonic abilities that feed off the dark. Using these powers, Jackie is able to survive further assassination attempts and track down Paulie, but not before Paulie and the corrupt police chief, Eddie Shrote, kidnap Jackie's girlfriend, Jenny Romano. They took her to the orphanage where Jackie and Jenny grew up, and murdered her in front of a powerless Jackie, unable to save Jenny due to the Darkness deliberately restraining him. He commits suicide out of sheer emotional stress, finding himself in the Otherworld, the realm of The Darkness with patchwork undead beings in World War I outfits fighting each other, and physical manifestations of The Four Horsemen. He meets his great-great-grandfather Anthony Estacado, who admits that it was he that brought the Darkness into the family, and tells Jackie how to free himself of The Darkness by invading the castle in the Otherworld and facing The Darkness there. Jackie is interrupted in his journey through the Otherworld and brought back to the living. Once he recovers, he determines that he must dispose of Chief Shrote before he can face Paulie. Chasing Shrote to his apartment and then confiscating a briefcase containing illicit goods in Shrote's ownership and rigging it with an explosive, Jackie is able to lure Shrote out of hiding, but he is later shortly captured. After overhearing about a shipment of drugs that a Chicago mob is entrusting Paulie to handle, Jackie triggers the explosive, killing Shrote and his men along with himself. Jackie re-awakes in the Otherworld, and lays siege to the Darkness' castle with Anthony's help. Anthony is mortally wounded in the attack, but before he can tell Jackie the last steps needed to free himself from the Darkness, the spirit pulls him away. Jackie faces the Darkness and surprises him by willingly being taken by the Darkness' power, allowing him to fully control the spirit back in the real world, however the Darkness tells him that while he has control now, each time Jackie takes a life, he will become more consumed by the Darkness. He lays an assault on the drug shipment, causing Paulie to flee to the safety of a lighthouse mansion for fear of retribution from the Chicago mob. Jackie takes advantage of a solar eclipse to raid the mansion and finally kill Paulie. The Darkness revels in Jackie's murderous spree, and fully envelops Jackie. In the epilogue, Jackie finds himself in a dream in a park, lying on a bench in Jenny's arms. Jenny explains that they are only allowed a few minutes to be together one last time to say goodbye. Jackie tries to ask how, but Jenny just quiets him, allowing them to enjoy the last moments together before Jackie wakes up with the screen fading to black.The Darkness II  Two years since the events of the first game, Jackie Estacado has become the don of the Franchetti crime family. Though he still wields the Darkness, a malevolent force that has given him supernatural powers, Jackie has suppressed the entity, thanks to guidance from estranged occultist Johnny Powell. Jackie still struggles with the death of his girlfriend, Jenny Romano, which the Darkness had prevented him from stopping. Jackie and his gang are attacked by a rival mob at a restaurant. After being rescued from the building, a mysterious figure appears and tells henchmen working for him to continue pressing the attack. While under attack, the Darkness calls to Jackie, demanding him to embrace the spirit. Jackie relinquishes, and with the Darkness' regenerative powers, stops the attacks and pursues the attackers into the subway. There, he reunites with the Darkling, part of his sub-consciousness created by the Darkness. He observes a vision of Jenny nearby, and ends up being run over by a passing train. As before, the Darkness refuses to allow Jackie to die. Jackie wakes up in what appears to be a psychiatric ward, where Jenny and members of his mob appear as doctors, nurses, and fellow patients, telling him that his mob stories are simply hallucinations inspired by mafia fiction. One of the patients appears to be Johnny, who tells Jackie to find him. Jackie wakes up in the subway, regroups with his men, and uses them to find and bring Johnny to his penthouse suite. Johnny explains that Jackie is being pursued by an organization called the Brotherhood who seek the Darkness' powers for themselves, using the Siphon, an object created by an entity called the Angelus to contain the Darkness. Johnny provides a lead to the Brotherhood's location at a nearby brothel. Jackie gains entry through help of a prostitute, Venus, and finds that the Brotherhood has been tracking him, his gang, and his family for many years, before he is captured by their leader, Victor Valente. Victor orders Jackie to be crucified, and demands Jackie to release the Darkness to him, revealing that they have taken over his suite. Jackie refuses and falls unconscious from blood loss, but after another brief vision of the psychiatric ward, the Darkness heals Jackie and awakens him. Jackie escapes the brothel, set aflame by the Brotherhood, and races for his suite, mounting an attack with his men against the Brotherhood. Jackie's Aunt Sara dies in the attack as they reclaimed the suite. At Sara's funeral, Victor launches another attack against Jackie. In battle with Bragg, one of Victor's henchmen, Bragg reveals that Victor is operating out of an abandoned theme park. Jackie kills Bragg, and then orders his men to stay low while he alone travels to the park, where more visions of Jenny appear. He is soon captured by Victor in an iron maiden, and loses consciousness from blood loss. Again, he wakes in the ward, but the janitor - acting as his Darkling - warns him that this ward is a trap for Jackie to keep him alive and away from Jenny who is still alive but in Hell. Jackie eventually wakens in the real world, The Darkness drained by Victor. The Darkling helps Jackie to escape and defeat Mr. Peevish, another henchmen of Victor given some of the Darkness' powers. Though Jackie recovers these for himself, they are but a shell of the full power of The Darkness, and pursues Victor, discovering they have taken him to his father's mansion. Engaging Victor in a battle to recover The Darkness, Victor reveals that Jackie's father had promised the Brotherhood the Darkness but failed to heed this. Eventually, Jackie defeats Victor and recovers the Siphon. Jackie stabs himself with it, retaking The Darkness but forcing him back to the ward dream. Now aware that the ward is a dream, Jackie attempts to kill himself within it, the Darkling sacrificing itself to aid in this effort. Here, the player can decide to stay with Jenny on the belief this is reality, upon which Jackie and Jenny slowly dance to \"I Only Have Eyes for You\". Instead, the player can opt to throw Jackie over the edge of the building, sending Jackie into The Darkness' realm. Jackie fights the Darkness' forces to release Jenny, who at first thanks Jackie for his help, but soon is transformed into the Angelus. Though Jenny is still alive within her and loves Jackie, the Angelus has seen the destruction that Jackie and the Darkness have caused, and leaves them trapped in Hell as she leaves.Personality  Jackie Estecado is a mobster with a twist, able to kill with little, if any, remorse, while still possessing compassion and selflessness for his friends and \"family\". He believed in the original reasons of a crime family, in which all members are considered part of a big family that takes care of itself. He enjoys the freedoms and vices of the job, and is willing to follow orders, but he wasn't blindly loyal to Paulie, and could tell something was wrong with him from the beginning. As the new Don, Jackie was more \"hands-on\" than Paulie, as well as being more forgiving, but was still ruthless and dangerous when enraged.Powers & Abilities Current Powers Former Powers Abilities Trivia Jenny Romano (Games)  Jenny Romano was the long time girlfriend of Jackie Estacado. They had a strong relationship based on Jackie's dishonesty about what he does for a living. He explains that he is a contract killer for Uncle Paulie, but she just laughs it off. She was kidnapped and killed by Paulie Franchetti.Biography Early Life  Not much is known about her childhood, only that she was living in the St. Mary's Orphanage where she met Jackie Estacado. She was very nice to Jackie and even defended him from a bully. Later she\u00a0realized she was\u00a0in love with him and from then on was Jackie's girlfriend.Death  Jenny is kidnapped by Uncle Paulie and Eddie Shrote and taken to St. Mary's Orphanage, where she and Jackie grew up. After Jackie fights through the hordes of goons that Uncle Paulie and Shrote throw at him, the Darkness forces Jackie to watch the confrontation between Jenny and the two murderers. Paulie pistol-whips Jenny in the face and belittles her and Jackie for what they have supposedly done. The two notice Jackie is being forced to watch by The Darkness and drag Jenny over to the door. Paulie continues to mock and criticize Jackie for betraying him. He then forces Jenny against the door and shoots her in the head.Later Appearances  Jenny is mentioned and seen after her death in the game. The Darkness uses Jenny as a way to torment Jackie and force him into choosing his way. She is seen the second time Jackie visits The Otherworld in order to gain control of The Darkness. She can briefly be heard advising Jackie during his battle with The Darkness and she can be seen in the light hidden behind The Darkness during the fight. Her final appearance in The Darkness is at the end of the game. Jackie awakes in a dream-like place and finds himself laying in Jenny's arms. She explains that they are given one last moment together to say goodbye and that \"that's all they can allow\". Jackie asks who but Jenny silences him and tells him he has to wake up. The game ends with the camera panning up into the sky.The Darkness II  Jenny returns in The Darkness II , once again as an illusion used to torment Jackie. She also appears as a nurse in a mental hospital in Jackie's Institution, (a place where he is sent while the Darkness repairs him from fatal injuries). In this world, Jackie is clinically insane and only thinks he is a mob boss, and is infatuated with Nurse Jenny, who does not feel the same. The actual Jenny reappears later as The Darkness reveals he is holding her soul hostage and uses this as leverage to force Jackie to cooperate throughout the game, near the end of the game she is freed, and depending on what choices you make. You can stay with fake Jenny in the otherworld Institution, and dance with her until the game ends or you can travel to within The Darkness to save her. If you save her, after kissing and hugging, it is eventually revealed she is the new host of the Angelus explaining why The Darkness contained her there. After the Angelus emerges, it yells at Jackie for being \"too powerful of a host\" and flies off, leaving Jackie and the Darkness in the Abyss within Hell.Jackie Estacado (Comics)  A former hit-man for the Franchetti Mafia, Jackie Estacado is the current wielder of the Darkness. Charismatic and strong-willed, Jackie is often described as among the most powerful and the most enduring hosts in the curse's long history; having held fast against its influences. He retired from Frankie's service after his encounter with Batman, which encouraged him to turn Frankie over to the authorities and retire from the mob, but at the cost of his girlfriend Jenny Romano, whom Frankie murdered in retaliation. Torn with grief, Jackie led Frankie to an abandoned warehouse soaked in gasoline and burned both himself and Frankie to death. He spent some time in Hell until The Darkness brought him back to life. He was blackmailed into working for Frankie's cousin Paulie Franchetti for some time, until he killed him as well and took control of The Franchetti Mafia. While possessed by The Darkness, he had sex with and impregnated a comatose Sara Pezzini, making him the father of Hope Pezzini. He was a drug lord in Sierra Munoz along with Professor Kirchner until he was betrayed and nearly killed by The Darkness himself, casting his soul into Hell. Jackie also helped to destroy The Sovereign, but at the cost of Leonard Kim's life.Biography Early Life  Jackie was born October 29, 1981\u00a0somewhere in New York City, New York. His mother died shortly after giving birth to him and his sister Capris. He was enrolled at Saint Garards orphanage at the same time as Jenny Romano. Jackie developed a close relationship with Jenny and would look after her while they were on the streets together. Whenever anyone hurt or abused Jenny, even orphanage officials, Jackie would become violent towards her abusers and would not rest until he put them in the hospital.Mafia Life  He joined the Mafia at the very early age of 6, after being recruited by a mafia don named Frankie \"Kill-the-children-too\" Franchetti. He was picked up at the orphanage after Frankie was prompted by a mysterious stranger named Sonatine, who told Frankie that having Jackie around would bring him tremendous power. Jackie was exposed to the life of very negative and violent forces as he grew up. However, he was also installed with good morals and was taught the value of loyalty by people such as Butcher Joyce. Jackie came to the mafia life easily, losing his virginity to a female officer during interrogation at age 14 and making his first hit at 16. He grew up, or more accurately matured, very quickly, and soon enjoyed the life of sex and violence. His actions within the mob caused Franchetti to become the most powerful don in the city, fulfilling Sonatine's prophecy. All during this time, The Angelus kept watch of Jackie with a mystical mirror within the top of The Empire State Building.The Darkness Awakens  On the eve of his 21st birthday, Jackie was in his apartment when the clock struck 12:00 A.M. Jackie heard The Darkness speaking to him with telepathy, telling him that he could have anything he wanted and that all he had to do was let The Darkness out. The Darkness awakened within him and he learned of his birthright as host of The Darkness. At first, this power was a blessing, allowing his job as a professional hitman to run more smoothly and work in more novel ways. However, with this power came many enemies. Early on, Jackie spent much of his time escaping from or fighting The Angelus (who wants to kill him), and Sonatine and his Brotherhood of The Darkness (who wish to capture him and either control him or steal his powers for their own agendas).Rebellion  Eventually, Jackie realized that he could use his powers for more noble ends and chose to quit the mob, but found it easier said than done. Jackie had turned on his adoptive uncle, Don Frankie Franchetti, to get a clean slate and exit from his life of crime after a meeting with Batman. However, after Frankie kidnapped Jenny, a childhood friend of Jackie's, Frankie killed her and sent a videotape to Jackie in revenge. Jackie could not take this and called out Franchetti's mob, leading them to an abandoned warehouse covered in gasoline. When the crew arrived to kill Estacado, Jackie and the Darklings threw down their lighters and blew the place, and all its occupants, to bits, killing Frankie and burning Jackie alive.Ressurection  Jackie spent two days (or 'what seemed to him like a million years') afterward wandering around Hell, searching for Jenny, until Tom Judge came and gave him hope, a gift that allows men to exit Hell. Jackie's body was then reconstructed by The Darkness from only his lower jaw. Jackie returned to find the Franchetti mob taken over by Frankie's amateur cousin, Paulie. Paulie was able to discover Jackie's secret as well as a long-lost sister of Jenny's. Using this information, Paulie blackmailed Jackie into doing hits for him. Along the way, Jackie learned how to construct a gun out of The Darkness. Later, Jackie discovered the identity of the hitman following Jenny's sister, killed him, and took his revenge on Paulie as well. This led to Jackie taking control of the Franchetti family. With control of the Franchetti family, Jackie vastly expanded his mafia, taken on the Triads, and fought the Russian Mafia in Atlantic City.Mafia Don  Being the Don of the Italian Mafia in New York did not last long however. In search for revenge the new Angelus once again confronts Jackie and with the help of Patience The Magdalena and Witchblade wielder Danielle Baptiste, Estacado managed to crush her, losing everything he had gained. He flees to Sierra Mu\u00f1oz in hope of establishing a new empire there. Jackie Estacado is also the biological father of Hope Pezzini, Sara Pezzini's mystical child. He himself could not explain it properly apart from saying that it had to with 'Darkness wanting to tip the balance'. The Darkness himself confirms this to Patience by saying that he used Jackie as raw material to settle the matter with The Angelus once and for all.Sierra Munoz  Recently, Jackie has established a drug cartel in Sierra Mu\u00f1oz with a narcotic made from his own bodily fluids thanks to the help of a demented, but brilliant scientist named Professor Kirchner. With the Darkness, Jackie is able to take control of the small tropical republic, build himself an impenetrable fortress, an army and eventually, even a lover he calls 'Elle'. Most of this came at a price since the residents of Sierra Mu\u00f1oz did not take very kindly to him. To express their distaste, they perform various acts of guerrilla warfare and suicide bombing in their struggle for liberation. They manage to find themselves a sponsor in their struggle- The United States military, who wish to capture Jackie for both trails and to learn about his armor. Jackie went to fight the army head on and using The Darkness he was able to take out their entire fleet. Returning his fortress he is betrayed by Kirchner and loses control of his power with his darklings turning on him. Jackie was left for dead after being shot in the neck and falling down a waterfall. Upon his capture he made a deal with the local rebels agreeing to rid the island of the drug. In doing so he crossed paths with Elle and she showed Jackie that she is pregnant with his baby. The child however killed Elle upon birth, grew to full maturity and killed Professor Kirchner. A fight between father and son ended when Jackie left the creature in the upper atmosphere just as dawn was breaking. The creature was then destroyed by the suns rays as he was The Darkness himself.The Sovereign  After crashing to Earth following this battle, Jackie was 'broken'. He was only able to draw just enough strength to keep himself alive through a number of fights while trying to stay alive, including Mexican witches, wannabe gangsters, and even Aphrodite IV. During one such fight, he was knocked out and taken to a Demon known as The Sovereign, who was a being capable of inhabiting any statue bearing his likeness, who told Jackie he died for an instant after fighting his child. This separated The Darkness from his body and mind, leaving him in his broken state on Earth. In return for a number of assassinations, The Sovereign would reunite Jackie with The Darkness. The assassinations Jackie was sent on were meant to return to Hell evil souls, who had previously made a deal with The Sovereign to either take over Human bodies or to achieve immortality. After one such mission in Africa, Jackie was enticed by a beautiful woman with a red scarf, who motioned for him to follow. As he was about to follow her into a house, he was stopped by a man who claimed to have once hosted The Darkness, but had completely discarded him without dying. He warned Jackie of the trap laid hundreds of years earlier, which Jackie ignored. Inside the building the woman waited, along with a Djinn which was created to find and kill The Darkness. Eventually, Jackie understood that both the woman and the Djinn were cursed themselves, to live only to hunt The Darkness. By strangling the woman, both were released. Outside, Jackie was once more confronted by the old Darkness host, who explained that Jackie still held the power completely within him, only held back by his own wish to be without The Darkness. Through a series of insults and physical attacks, Jackie once more called The Darkness back into his body. Whole again, Jackie fought the old Darkness wielder, claiming to be sick of people who tried to mess with his head. The man disapeared in the confusion and together with the always talkative Darklings, he stated his desire to return home. Attacking the building where The Sovereign held his base, Jackie found himself caught in a room flooded with artificial sunlight and a score of bodies controlled by The Sovereign. With the help of the Darklings biting the power lines outside, Jackie destroyed all the bodies, leaving only one man behind. Jackie, impressed with the ability of this man to stay calm where all the other mercenaries had panicked, offered him a job. Jackie quickly brought together a group of people with distinct skills for a single purpose: to destroy each and every statue that might be used by The Sovereign, effectively removing his presence from Earth. During this time, Jackie was called by Sara who suspected him of robbing a number of New York banks. During a meeting in broad daylight Sara warned Jackie to stay away from the city, not wanting to tell her daughter Hope that 'mommy had killed daddy.' Jackie agreed and instructed his new employees that under no circumstance were they to enter the city of New York. Jackie and his team then go on a world tour finding and destroying stone bodies that The Sovereign could use as hosts. One of these trips takes him to Fort Knox where a host statue is held. During the raid Jackie discovers that The Sovereign has already taken over the statue as it is radiating light. Jackie is forced to take the Sovereign-possessed statue with them he orders his team to detonate the explosives they had set earlier. Unfortunately for Jackie, he falls from the van and is left helpless as tanks and marines surround him on orders by Major White, who survived the explosion back in Sierra Munoz. Jackie holds his own against the marines but is shot down and captured. Linked to an electronic shock disc, Major White Informs Jackie that members of Hunter Killer are coming to take him and study his powers. Meanwhile, The Sovereign tries to bargain with Jackie's team, however out of loyalty to Jackie, they refuse and The Sovereign attacks them. The team manage to destroy The Sovereign by hitting the breaks on the van, tossing The Sovereign through the windshield and detonating the C4 explosives on his back. White informs Jackie that Jackie's power must not be used by anybody but him (Jackie). White shuts down the power in the base and willingly lets Jackie break his jaw and escape. Jackie makes his way to a parking lot building where the squad of Hunter-Killers are after him. After a visit from the old Darkness host, Jackie manages to evade the squad by making copies of himself and fooling the team into thinking they had caught him, while Jackie hides and escapes by using The Darkness to shapeshift into an old lady.The Alkonost  While on a plane headed for New Jersey to retrieve another Sovereign statue, Jackie begins having strange dreams of his teenage self wearing a costume-like Darkness armor and chasing Capris through the orphanage he grew up in. He then wakes up and dismisses the thought from his mind. He and Tyne begin discussing the basics of their new venture, a Sovereign statue that was bought by Vasily Martynov, a retired Russian mobster turned art collector who built an empire through Human trafficking with whom Dev Ravada has done business. While on a van to Martynov's mansion, Jackie sees a boy and a girl in an alley, thinking they are part of Martynov's trafficking he chases them into the alley until they disappear. At the Vasily's mansion, the art collector greets them and has a dinner with the team. Jackie dislikes Vasily, but is more interest in his bodyguard Arvo. Martynov calms Jackie down by saying that Argo is deaf and only focuses on the biggest threats he sees. Argo is then sent to prepare the Sovereign's statue. Meanwhile, Jackie goes to a restroom. On his way he sees young children working in the kitchen. Suddenly, Argo appears carrying the container with Sovereign's statue, which startles Jackie. As the team leaves, Jackie decides to comeback to the mansion and free the children, that Vasily keeps. Dev explains that they're all criminals and its Vasily's business what he does, not theirs. Jackie still decides to go through with his plan and leaves. There he kills two bodyguards. Suddenly, he sees Capris again and chases after her, fully understanding that this is a trap. When he finally catches up to Capris, he finds her in the company of the Sovereign and Sonatine. Jackie proceeds to attack The Sovereign, Sonatine and their army, but every time he kills them, they stand up to fight again. Suddenly, he sees a knight who tells Jackie to do not resist and rest his mind. Then Jackie is overwhelmed by the attackers. Jackie wakes up tied to an underground machine along the knight he saw earlier. In the middle of the room, he sees an angel laying on a pedestal with a spear sticking out of her body. The knight explains that this machine siphons their energy, the more they resist. Jackie's fight with his enemies and seeing his sister Capris was all just an illusion created by The Alkonost. The Alkonost voice purifies the soul of the wicked and at it's full strength, can erase memory. Perverted by Arvo's machine, the Alkonost's song drives one to fight for what they love the most, unaware they are merely trapped in an illusion and feeding the engine of their imprisonment. Unless they somehow block her voice, they will always fall to the Alkonost's spell. The knight reveals that he was raised to defend the Alkonost from birth. As champion of the Holy Order of the Holy Voice it was he's task to follow and guard the Alkonost as she wandered the Earth. But as the knight grew old and an apprentice was brought to him, Arvo. Arvo was very devoted to the cause, but eventually decided to have the Alkonost for himself only. He defeated the knight and then drove his lance into the Alkonost. Since then Arvo and Martynov lures supernatural beings to this place and sucks their mystical dry as the Alkonost voice is particularly strong against beings of magic. Arvo then comes and begins to rape the Alkonost. Meanwhile, Jackie tries to shield his ears with the help of the Darkness. Unfortunately, he falls under the Alkonost spell again, just like the knight himself. Eventually, Jackie manages to break free from Alkonost's influences and frees the knight, but is attacked by enraged Arvo. Arvo begins to strangle Jackie, but the knight droves the lance he pulled from the Alkonost into him. In rage, Arvo knocks away the knight into the Alkonost pedestal. Freed Jackie quickly recreates eardrums inside Arvo's ears. As Arvo hears the Alkonost song again, he's memory is completely erased. Because of the severe head trauma he received from Arvo, the knight dies in the hands of the Alkonost, claiming that dying in her presence is his greatest honour. Moved by Jackie's mercy shown to her, the Alkonost begins to cry. A tear then drops onto Jackie's arm, crystallizing it. She then flies through Vasily's house and leaves. After the Alkonost leaves, Jackie cuts Arvo in half.The Apostate  One day as Jackie was sleeping, Regis Tyne comes to kill him with Sun Dagger. At the last moment Tyne decides that Jackie's body is the best prison for the Darkness, Angelus could ever hope for. As he puts away the dagger, Jackie suddenly awakes and cuts off Tyne's head. The Sun Dagger falls out of Tyne's hand and cuts off Jackie's toe. After Jackie kills Tyne, he reconstructs his former teammate using the Darkness. Although Tyne was dead, the new Darkling retained all the knowledge and memories of the mob accountant. The Darkling then told the entire Tyne's back story and revealing that he was a member of the School of Angelus, and was sent by them to kill Jackie. Estacado orders the reanimated Tyne to play along that nothing happened to him and orders to help the crew to gear up as they will be traveling to Egypt to destroy the last the Sovereign statue in the morning. As the new Tyne proceeds to walk away, Jackie tells him to stay out of the light.The Last Statue of The Sovereign  Weeks later, Jackie and his team travel to Egypt to find the last Sovereign's statues. Leonard Kim, Vike and Kash O'Neal take out the small militia defending the Sovereign's temple. Then they are attacked by an army of The Sovereign stone statues. The team is overwhelmed, but Jackie quickly destroys the army by using his Darkness powers. As the team inhale dust from the destroyed statues they lose consciousness and get trapped in a illusion. Understanding that the Sovereign wants to fight only him, Jackie sends his Darklings to take the team to safety. He then goes into the temple and searches for the last statue. Jackie finds the temple empty when suddenly a giant Sovereign statue emerges from below the temple. Jackie and the Sovereign battle each other. After a tough fight, Jackie shatters the statue. From the remains another Sovereign's statue emerges. Made from a meteorite, the statue radiated both light and deadly amounts of radiation. This quickly incapacitates Jackie and begins to slowly burn his flesh. Eventually Kim snaps out from the illusion and jumps to help Jackie to defeat the meteorite statue of the Sovereign. The Sovereign is confused as to how Kim managed to wake up from his illusion. Kim explains in the illusion, there was no one to share with his fortune. He then proceeds to shatter the statue and succumbs to the radiation poisoning. Jackie tries to help him, but Kim refuses saying that he doesn't want the Darkness inside of him. With the last breath he asks Jackie to send his payment to his family. When Vike and O'Neal regain their conscious, they find Kim dead, laying in Jackie's arms. Tyne urges them to stay back for their own safety.Outer Darkness  Jackie and Tyne then attended Kim's funeral, where the Darkling pondered what is like to have funeral. After the ceremony is over, Vike and Kash say their farewells go separate ways. Tyne then took Jackie to his home. Jackie then decides to take a walk. Darklings are bored and urge Jackie to give them something to do. Instead of listening to them, Jackie kills one of them and leaves. As he walks down the street, Jackie is stopped by Aram. He warns Jackie, that the Darkness is preparing to deal with him and find a new host. Jackie disregards his warnings and walks away.\u00a0He then goes to a park and watches parents with their children play, which reminds him of Hope. Suddenly an officer approaches him and says that he's spooking some of the parents. As Jackie tries to leave the cop stops him and points a gun at him. Then the shooter falls from the skyscraper, landing in front of Jackie. Then out of nowhere Butcher Joyce appears and points a shotgun at Jackie, ordering him to stay still. Butcher then shoots the officer in the head and the two proceed to run away. Butcher reveals that the cop was actually a hitman sent after Jackie. They then decide to get off the street and hide in the sewers.Two mercenaries follow them into the sewers were they're killed by Jackie. After explaining why he does hits now, Butcher reveals that someone ordered a hit on Jackie. They then go to Jackie's home. Jackie finds it suspicious that all the Darklings are missing. Tyne reveals that the Darklings upon ordered by the Darkness left. Suddenly, Tyne is possessed by the Darkness and turns into a giant lion. The Darkness says that it has been looking for new hosts for itself and are planning to kill Jackie in order to be free of him. It then attacks him, but Jackie manages to bring Tyne back from the Darkness possession. Jackie then decides to let go Tyne and give him free will to do what he wants. Tyne then proceeds to walk outside and commits suicide by coming into the direct sunlight much to Jackie's astonishment. In order to find out who ordered the hit, Butcher pretended to have killed Jackie and met with Rashad Arrington and his two henchmen who worked for the mysterious man who put the hit, sixty miles west of Chicago. As he brings the corpse, Joey, one of the henchmen, says that he thought that Jackie was taller. Butcher explains that the body always shrinks up after death. Joey then proceeds on checking the bullet wounds, expressing how thorough as he can fit his whole fist in the exit wounds. As he puts his finger into one of the bullet holes, it closes up, cutting his finger off. Suddenly, Jackie wakes up and rips apart Joey and his colleague. Rashad opens fire on him, but Jackie mocks him for using a gun when he has the power of the Darkness at his fingertips. After hearing this, Rashad proceeds to summon an army of Darklings. Jackie is quickly overwhelmed by the Darklings, but Butcher shoots phosphorous flare, which kills them. Rashad then himself attacks Jackie. The two fight and Jackie manages to kill Rashad by driving his arm through his chest and pulling out Arrington's heart. Jackie then proceeds to rip open Rashad's corpse and looks for clues where his employers could be. He finds out that Rashad came from Omaha and that's where they decide to go As Butcher goes to have a little bit of sleep, Jackie decides to not put Butcher in bigger danger then he's already is and leaves him behind with a bag full of money.Omaha  Jackie then booked a flight to Omaha. As the plane takes off, Clark McKendricks, sent by the same people who want Jackie dead, envelops in his Darkness armour and attacks Jackie. Estacado tells passengers to lay low, but McKendricks uses them to get a hit on him. Jackie then punches him through his throat. Heavily bleeding from his throat, McKendricks rips open the planes doors. This causes the plane to explode in mid-air. After the plane explodes, Jackie sees a girl falling. As Jackie catches up to her, the girl reveals her true Darkling form and attacks him. This makes Jackie to quickly fall to the ground. The Darkling reveals that Jackie's can't make him disappear as he was sent by the Darkness itself. Seconds before hitting the ground, Jackie manages to crush the Darklings head, thus killing him. Moments before hitting the ground, Jackie manages to stop his fall, but hits a tree and losses his conscious. In the morning next day, two members of the national guard in an hazmat suits find unconscious Jackie. As they debate what should they do with him, Jackie wakes up and they explain that a zombie like plague has fallen onto Omaha over the night, much to his surprise. Believing Jackie to be infected they take him to the pig farm.As the night fall, Jackie is brought to the containment. As he looks at the infected, Jackie realises that they're being controlled by the Darkness. The infected then proceed to attack Jackie. As he's being overwhelmed, Donnie and his partner open fire on them. Jackie then reaches to the gun and uses it to destroy the lights. He then confronts the infected in his Darkness armor and urges the two men to run away. Donnie and his partner comply, they get into a car and drive away. Meanwhile, Jackie gets outside and is overwhelmed by the infected who start to drown him. Suddenly he's pulled out by Elle, who then defends Jackie from the infected. She unleashes packs of Darkling-like creatures whom she revealed to be her and Jackie's offspring, created from Jackie's seed that she had kept and fertilized within her from their many sexual encounters. Elle says that after Sierra Mu\u00f1oz hid in the shadow until she recovered from her wounds. Then she left the city in search of Jackie as military was looking for her. By hiding in train cars Elle finally reached the states. After she felt such an upheaval in the Darkness, Elle manages to track down Jackie. Jackie then tries to create an antidote for the virus, but fails as the infected are full of mutating Darkness bugs. He decides that he needs to find and destroy the source of this and Elle promises to help him. When they reach Omaha, Jackie and Elle hide in an empty apartment . Jackie listens to the radio trying to understand the magnitude of the infections. He is puzzled as to why the Darkness do such thing. Elle explains that the Darkness is just evil and always yearns for destruction. They're interrupted by Aram who comes to give Jackie his crystallized arm that he left behind after the encounter with Alkonost. He warns Jackie to use this weapon only as his last resort. Suddenly, Jackie's clone finds them and Jackie with Elle attacks it. Meanwhile a helicopter watches them fight. Although Elle's Darklings kill the infected, the clone revives them and then proceed to incapacitate Jackie. While the clone is focused on him, Jackie crashes the helicopter on top of them. As the clone dies in the fire, Jackie stumbles out of the fire and lays in Elle's arms. Out of no where, Elle is cut in half by Capris Castiglione who then attacks Jackie much to his shock. Jackie questions her why did she do all of this. Capris answers that after Jackie became a weak host, the Darkness sought her. Seduced by its powers, Capris went on to wage war against her brother. She then summons an army of Darklings and sends them against Jackie. The Darklings notice Aram, but ignore him. Aram urges Jackie to not use the crystallized arm yet and wait for the right moment to strike. After being convinced by Elle to cancel out the Darkness, Aram does this, leaving both Capris and Jackie powerless. Using this chance, Jackie proceeds to drive his crystallized arm through her sister's chest, instantly killing her. Aram then gives Jackie the Sun Dagger and reveals that if he wants to completely destroy the Darkness, he needs to kill himself and go to its realm to confront it. Jackie can't bring himself to take his own life and Aram leaves, saying that eventually he will do it. Some time later, Jackie has moves in with Sara. One morning he's woken up by the Darkness. The Darkness mocks him and threatens to take Hope as its new host. Finally, Jackie decides to go and confront the Darkness. He takes the Sun Dagger and stabs himself into his chest.Realm of the Darkness  After taking his life, Jackie is transferred to the Realm of the Darkness. The realm manifests as a vast jungle with a huge mountain in the middle of it. As he enters the jungle, Jackie comes across a group of tribal people eating small roots. He cuts one of the bigger fruits growing on the roots and show to them that they're edible. The tribal people begin to follow Jackie and they decide to cross the river. Suddenly, a rival hostile tribe runs out from the other side of the river and attacks them. Jackie defends his people and kills the hostile tribe. Out of gratitude, the tribe people mark Jackie and themselves with their blood. They eventually reach the mountain, but seeing it to steep to climb, Jackie turns around back into the jungle. In the jungle, Jackie and the tribal people come across tied up and tortured people. They continue to travel and Jackie comes across a beautiful tribal woman bathing in the river. As Jackie approaches her, the Jungle King sees this and immediately attacks him, while riding his giant Darkness insect. Seeing that he can't overpower the Jungle King with seer force, Jackie creates a gun out of Darkness and shoots him in the head, instantly killing him. For killing him, the tribal woman puts his crown onto Jackie's head, declaring him the new king of the jungle, but Estacado rejects the crown and instead creates his own. The tribal woman marks herself with the blood becoming part of Jackie's tribe. The tribal woman then became Jackie's lover and even conceives a child with him. Eventually, Jackie decides to leave her behind in order to continue his guest to find and kill the Darkness. He breaks his crown and proceeds to climb the mountain. As he reaches the top, Sonatine is already waiting for Jackie and gives him his hand.Black Guidon  Sonatine calms Jackie, saying that he means no harm to him. He says that he always wanted to become one with the Darkness, but now his wish brought his ultimate torment. Below a war wages between a Darkness wielder and an army of Darklings. Sonatine explains that the dead souls of past Darkness wielders are brought here to forever perpetually fight each other. Jackie questions Sonatine as to how he came here as he isn't a Darkness wielder and he's was last seen possessing Wenders body. Sonatine answers that Jackie gives him too much credit and telling that more likely Wenders was just crazy. Suddenly they're confronted by an army of Darklings belonging to the Green Pennant faction. Jackie attacks them and quickly kills all of them. He's then confronted by a past Darkness wielder, Lulkam-Sin the leader of Black Guidon faction riding a giant Darkness serpent. As Lulkam-Sin's serpent is hungry, he orders Sonatine to feed it by cutting his arm throwing to the serpent as food. Sonatine is then ordered to leave. Lulkam-Sin proceeds to tell him that Jackie now will ride with him as killing those Darklings was a declaration of war to the Green Pennant. They're then attacked by the Darklings and the two of them fight them off. After the battle, Lulkam-Sin takes Jackie with himself as a giant maw opens up to swallow the dead. Lulkam-Sin explains that the maw swallows the corpses of the dead, but the Darkness wielders are brought back to fight more. Jackie is then brought to Lulkam-Sin's main camp. He notices Sonatine leaving and Jackie decides to follow him. Jackie asks him from were did the slaves in the camp, came as they're not Darkness wielders. Sonatine explains that everyone killed by the Darkness wielders, if they deserve, come to this realm to be forever bound in it. He continues by saying that he knows Jackie wants to kills the Darkness and Sonatine decides to help him to accomplish. Sonatine reveals that if Jackie wants to reach the very heart of the Darkness, he must go through the maw as it consumes the dead. After they rest, Lulkam-Sin and Jackie continue to fight the Green Pennant. Jackie then convinces Lulkam-Sin to push the Green Pennant to the maw and thus take over all their territory. Together they push the Darklings to the centre of the maw. As the maw opens up, Jackie decides to stay, but Lulkam-Sin refuses to let him go. He grabs Jackie and tries to drag him away. Jackie struggles free and stabs Lulkam-Sin in the chest. The two then proceed to fall into the maw were Lulkam-Sin is digested.The Family Business  In the maw, Jackie encounters Capris slowly being dissolved. She doesn't remember who she is, but seem to recognize Jackie. Jackie explains that her name is Capris and he is her brother. Capris is then completely dissolved to be re-purposed by the Darkness. Jackie then begins to navigate the guts of the maw. As he goes deeper, he begins to sees people that have done terrible things. Eventually, Jackie drops out from a sewer into a Darkness version of New Jersey. Jackie asks a homeless man where he is. The latter answers that Jackie is in New Jersey and then gives him a dose of Nightfall. Before he can find out where did the homeless man got the drug from, he's killed by Paulie Franchetti and his henchmen. Seeing that Jackie has survived the attacks, Paulie turns around the car and attacks him again. Jackie then lifts part of the road causing the car to fly into a building and explode. Impressed by his actions a man approaches Jackie who turns out to be Danny Estacado himself.\u00a0 In order to bond with him, Danny buys Jackie a new suit. As Carlo the owner of the shop leaves, they're attacked by a Cuban gang. Jackie quickly creates a grenade and throws it at the gang, killing them. Danny then confronts Carlo for setting them up. After threatening Carlo, Danny decides to leave him be as he would be resurrected anyway if killed. Danny then takes Jackie to his main base of operations. On their way, Danny expresses that he enjoys his time with his son, Jackie. Jackie then explains that he wasn't killed and came here, because he's on a mission.\u00a0 As they reach Danny's main base of operation, Jackie is shocked to see Kirchner working for him. Danny explains that Kirchner has been developing Nightfall for him to distribute around the city. Jackie isn't happy to see him and warns Kirchner to not say any word to him. The two then leave. Danny takes Jackie to local prostitutes, but are stopped by a roadblock made by an armed gang. As Jackie and Danny prepare to confront them, the gang is crushed by the Darkness exoskeleton now possessing Kirchner. Jackie then attacks it and the two begin to fight. Estacado creates a whip, latches it unto the Darkness exoskeleton and sends a bio-electricity current through it. The Darkness is impressed, but quickly recovers and proceeds to use the amplified version of this technique on Jackie himself. Incapacitated Jackie is then grabbed by the Darkness exoskeleton, which begins to crush him. Before it can kill Jackie, Danny shoots Kirchner in the eye, killing him. Out of retaliation, the Darkness cuts Danny in half and releases the dead body of Kirchner. With his dying breath, Danny urges Jackie to kill the Darkness once and for all. Jackie then pulls out the Sun Dagger from his chest and confronts the Darkness exoskeleton. He manages to defeat the creature and then steps through the portal leading to the Heart of Darkness.Heart of Darkness  Inside of it, heavily deformed man representing the Darkness heart waits for him. Jackie then proceeds to attack it with the Sun Dagger. Furious, the heart says that without it, Jackie is just a common thug. Jackie then reveals that he plans not to destroy the Darkness, but take it from the Heart of Darkness. With him being dead, Jackie then will become the Darkness himself. As Jackie stabs the Heart of Darkness, the Heart reveals that he too was long ago a wielder of the Darkness. He rebelled against the Darkness and sought to end it's reign once and for all. The Heart took away its power and hid it inside of himself. But a portion of the Darkness escaped, surrounded the Heart and imprisoned in the deepest emptiness of it. The Heart then gets on top of Jackie and tries to crush his head with his hands. He screams at him, that Jackie can't be certain he won't become just like the Heart. Jackie answers that he can't be certain, but he can hope. Filled with the memory of Jackie's daughter Hope, the Sun Dagger destroys the Heart.\u00a0 Back at home, Sara with Hope in her hands comes to check on Jackie, notices something else in the dark. Jackie calms her down, saying that it's just him and hugs them.\u00a0The New Reality  Jackie tells the events of Artifacts to a thug he captured. There exists\u00a0Thirteen Artifacts, which control the fate of the world. If they're brought together, they can destroy the world. Together they tried to stop a man that wanted to just that, but ultimately they fail. After finding out that his and Sara Pezzini's daughter Hope has the key to the universe, they killed her. With Hope's death Jackie created a nearly exact copy of the universe, but this time he had a family with Jenny Romano. The thug thinks Jackie is on drugs and asks him why is he telling him these things. Jackie answers that he had to tell someone the truth and the thug won't live long enough to tell anyone about this. He then proceeds to kill the thug. In the present, Jackie is now the leader of the Franchetti mafia. He now lives with Jenny Romano and their daughter Hope. As Jackie goes to check on Jenny, she is furious at him. Jenny reveals that she knows that Jackie killed two people last night. Jackie explains that they were Bulgarians, part of a mob in Easter Europe and managed to get their weapons through the security. He was unarmed and thus had no choice, but to kill them by using the Darkness. Jenny doesn't care and gives him an ultimatum. Either Jackie gets rid of the Darkness or she will take Hope and leave him. After hearing this, Jackie clenches his fists. When Jenny asks him if he's going to hit her now, Jackie in shock realizes that he was about to hit her. Jackie then meets with Aram and expresses his wish to get rid of the Darkness. Aram accepts to help him, but warns Jackie that it will be a difficult task. They meet at Jackie's personal panic room. Jackie then tries to summon the Darkness, but fails to do it. Even after receiving beating from Aram, the Darkness doesn't emerge. Aram then reminds Jackie that after he dies, the Darkness will go to Hope. This angers Jackie and he manages to finally summon the Darkness. He then proceeds to spit out the Darkness out of his body. Aram then grabs Jackie and forces out the last bit of the Darkness. This cause both Jackie and Aram to lose consciousness.The Doppelganger  As Jackie wakes up he sees a Darkness copy of himself, who names himself the Doppelganger before him, stopped by Aram. Aram has put a binding spell on the bunker causing the Doppelganger to be trapped in it during the day. The Doppelganger calms down Jackie, saying that he will cooperate with him and he likes their family therefore he won't screw it up. As for Aram he warns that one day the Darkness will devour his soul. Before leaving, Aram warns Jackie to be care full of the Doppelganger as he probably created a perfect host for the Darkness. Jackie then goes to meet Jenny in the garden. He says that he no longer has the Darkness in him, but Jenny doesn't believe him and asks Jackie to give her time to think. She then asks Jackie to go look for Hope as she's been looking for her cat Bastet. Hope eventually finds her cat, but as she reaches out to touch Bastet, he claws her. As Jackie comes to check on her, Hope expresses her anger of not seeing for four days. Jackie tries to explain, but Hope doesn't believe in his explanation and runs away. Jackie then goes to have a shower. Suddenly he gets a call from his right-hand man Wilson, which informs him that he's office has been destroyed by the Bulgarians. Jackie gets to the scene where he finds his team already waiting for him - Dean, the accountant; Athena, the enforcer; Paris, Athena's partner and Wilson, his right hand man. They're also met by Carlos Toledo, a corrupt cop that Jackie pays to work for him. The team explains that Bulgarian's have announced a war against Jackie. Jackie then comes home and meets with the Doppelganger. He asks him to take out the Bulgarians and the Doppelganger complies. As Jenny doesn't want to sleep with Jackie, he's forced to go the guest room. Before leaving, she asks Jackie to read a bedtime story for Hope. He goes to read the the bedtime story to Hope, but his daughter believes that all the story's been altered hide the true horrors that happen. Jackie decides to leave, but before he goes through the door, Hope asks him how does she know that she's real. In the morning, Jackie confronts the Doppelganger for killing the seven prostitutes. The Doppelganger doesn't see any problem with what he has done, but decides to change his face the next time he leaves the bunker in order to calm Jackie down. Suddenly, Jenny screams and Jackie runs to check on her. Under Hope's bed he finds three Darkling kittens. Much to Jenny's objections, Hope decides to keep them. Jackie also doesn't believe what Jenny saw, regarding the dismembered Bastet, thinking that she just imagined it. Later, Jackie meets with his team. Wilson expresses concerns as to what he has done to the mobsters. Jackie explains that it wasn't him that done it, but the Darkness who know operates as an independent entity. Wilson then interrupts them saying that the head of the third biggest mafia clan in Bulgaria, Valko Balakov has just landed. Balakov contacts Jackie and expresses his wish to meet him. Jackie and Balakov, accompanied by Athena, Paris and two Bulgarian henchmen respectively, meet in the Central Park during day. Estacado says that he wants Balakov out of his city. Balakov denies to leave and then insults him. As a counter attack, Paris calls Balakov an impotent and having sex with his sister. After hearing this, Balakov decides to leave.War with Valko Balakov  After Hope's nanny Charlotte fails the kidnap of both Hope and Jenny, Jackie comes to the scene. Furious he nearly beats up to death one of the mobsters. He's stop by Wilson who insists that alive the mobster will be much more valuable. Meanwhile, Dean checks on Jenny and asks if she is okay. Jackie then approaches his family, but is stopped by Hope who says that he will get blood on Jenny. Later, Jackie finds out that Jenny has been secretly talking to Dean. After coming back from bar, he finds Jenny having sex with the Doppelganger. In the morning, Jackie is still disturbed of what he saw. He asks Jenny are they're going to be okay after the last night. Jenny answers that she hopes so, but he needs to give her more time to think. Before leaving she asks Jackie to check out the wall that started to rot in their bedroom. As he breaks the wall, he finds bugs coming out of it and the Darkness slowly rotting it. Jackie decides to visit Aram and ask him in helping returning the Darkness back into his body. He finds Aram to be not at his house, but manages to contact him through a pool of blood. Aram refuses to help Jackie and says that he's on his own. Jackie then decides to interrogate the Balakov's mobsters he captured. One of the mobsters refuses to reveal Balakov's location, saying that his boss isn't human any more. Estacado then shoots him in the head. After seeing this, Dean decides to leave believing that Jackie has lost it. The second mobster then decides to reveal Balakov's location believing that Jackie is dead either way. Jackie then comes to the bunker and orders the Doppelganger to kill Balakov. As Jackie returns to his bedroom, he's visited by Jenny who takes her clothes off. They then proceed to have sexual intercourse. As Jackie goes to sleep, Jenny leaves their bedroom revealing to have actually been the Doppelganger. In the morning, Jenny hallucinates being overrun by bugs. Jackie calms her down and Jenny decides to have a rain shower. He then goes over her things and finds their family picture with Jenny's face erased. He also finds a picture of wounded Bastet. One of the Darkling kittens then hiss on Jackie. He then goes to check the bunker and finds it full of insects and strange fungal infection. He then calls Wilson saying that the team needs to meet as the Darkness went rogue. When the team meets they decide to go to Balakov and find out what happened to the Doppelganger. On their way to the cars, Jackie attacks Dean for having a relationship with Jenny. He then decides to leave him behind and take the rest of the team with himself. When they reach Balakov's house, they see a man running out of it and then killed by a tentacle that comes out the doorway. Jackie decides to go in the house alone and tells the team to make sure his family is safe if he doesn't return. As Jackie comes inside the house, he finds corpses scattered all around. A security guard points a gun on Jackie, telling him that Balakov didn't wanted anyone to leave. He then shoots himself in the head. Jackie comes closer to check him and finds the guard missing legs. He then is met by Aram. He reveals that Balakov is possessed by an ancient being that pre-dates the Darkness itself known as the Ancient One. At the moment he's fighting with the Doppelganger. Aram then asks Jackie what did he do to bring the Ancient Ones back as they were banished long ago. Suddenly, the Doppelganger and Balakov fall through ceiling. Jackie then shoots Balakov in the head, knocking him out. Aram then forces the Doppelganger to leave. Jackie tells Aram that they will need to talk about this and leaves. At home Jackie ponders what Aram has told him and expresses his frustration over the Doppelganger. He then gets a call from Sara Pezzini. She says weird stuff are happening in Chicago and something isn't right. She also asks if Hope is okay and Jackie answers that she's fine. Jackie is then suddenly interrupted by the noise in the hall. As he checks what's happening, he finds Jenny in the middle of mental breakdown, breaking things and saying that she isn't Estacado, but Romano. Jackie then decides to call their doctor, Rosemary Wallace to their home. After arriving, the doctor takes a blood sample from Hope and checks the mental health of Jenny. The doctor reveals to Jackie that Jenny seems to be suffering from some short of dementia. Later, Jackie dreams of rotting corpse of Jenny coming to him and asking Estacado why didn't he left her in peace. The next day, Jackie gets a call from the doctor. The doctor reveals that Hope is infected with a fatal disease, but Jackie doesn't believe her and ends the call. He then goes to check on Jenny, but finds her in the garden with the Doppelganger. Hope comes to him and tells him to don't worry as everything will be over soon. She then walks away and glances at Jackie, revealing a Darkness like form. Terrified, Jackie realizes that Hope is infected by the Darkness. Having no where to turn to, he call Sara, but she doesn't answer. During the night, Valko Balakov visits sleeping Jenny, but is quickly attacked by Hope. Balakov eventually manages to subdue her, but Jackie and Aram come to help her. He expresses that one day, Hope will be far greater than Jackie ever was. The Doppelganger then comes through a portal and then confronts Balakov. Suddenly, Jenny awakes and is terrified by the people in the room. Aram calms her down by using hypnosis on her, causing her to relive the best moment in her life. As Jackie is in no fit to fight, Aram orders him to take care of Jenny. They leave the bedroom. Aram then appears behind Jackie and confronts him for what he did to the universe. He reveals that because Jenny is a construct, Hope is now pure Darkness. They're then attacked by Balakov and the Doppelganger. Balakov quickly incapacitates Aram, but the latter manages to teleport away. As they have made alliance, Balakov leaves the Doppelganger to clean up the house and decide what to do with Jackie. The Doppelganger decides to imprison Jackie inside his bunker. Upon his order, the Darklings proceed to drag screaming Jackie, through a portal into the bunker. There, he's surrounded by Darklings and strip of all clothes.Imprisonment  Some time later, Jackie hears a commotion above him. Unable to leave the bunker, he convinces Cathead to check if everything is okay to Hope. One day, Jackie recalls how he saved Jenny from Frankie Franchetti. As he saves her, he realises that she's pregnant. A Darkling appears and reveals to have had sex with her. In anger, Jackie grabs the Darkling by the throat. The Darkling then turns out to be the Cathead and the latter explains, that this was just a dream. Tired of being kept in the bunker, Jackie punches the Cathead and tries to leave. The Cathead then orders the Darkness to stop him and it incapacitates Jackie. Out of nowhere, Aram appears and frees Jackie. He says that he came to help Jackie to take the Darkness back. As Aram returns to Erewhon, he's confronted by the Doppelganger. Aram reveals, that he have obtained the Mask of Mana from a Tohunga exorcist in New Zealand. While wearing the mask, the exorcist can contain the demon without being possessed by it and then transfer to a new host. Although the Doppelganger and the Cathead are sceptical, Aram puts on the mask and then terminates his protection against the Darkness. He then invites the Darkness into himself, much to the Doppelgangers objections. As the Darkness takes over Aram, he announces it now belongs to him. With the Darkness in his possession, Aram summons his Darklings. The Darklings surround Jackie and the Doppelganger and prepare to kill them. Aram calls Jackie weak and unworthy of this power. When one of the Darklings tries to lick the Doppelganger, he cuts his tongue off. Realising that without the Doppelganger he's incomplete, Aram tries to absorb him. The Doppelganger pleads Jackie to do something and Jackie tries to convince Aram to let go of the Darkness. He says that the Estacado bloodline is the perfect host for the Darkness as a corrupt man cannot be corrupted. Jackie then swears that if Aram gives back to him the Darkness, he will stop the Ancient Ones and restore the balance between Darkness and light. Aram's Darklings then try to convince him into keeping the Darkness for himself and take over the world. Remembering how much pain and destruction he brought to the world as the Darkness host, Aram gives it to Jackie. The Doppelganger then assumes his true form as small Darkling and merges with Jackie. With the Darkness back in his possession, Jackie destroys the Mask of Mana and tells Aram to get out of his sight. Before leaving, Aram warns Jackie to not trust the Ancient Ones.Taking Back The Darkness  With the Darkness back in his possession, Jackie goes to check on Hope and Jenny. Hope apologises for choosing the Doppelganger over Jackie and the latter forgives her. When he goes to check on Jenny, she recognises Jackie and hugs him. Meanwhile, as infected surround Wilson and Charlotte, Jackie telepatically orders the infected to release them and walk away. Jackie then continues by saying that he doesn't want to see them ever again. Back home, Jackie reveals to Hope that he can see, hear and control the infected. Hope says that its good, because everyone wants to kill them, except for Ancient Ones. Jackie then asks her what did happen to her while she was underground and Hope lies that she doesn't remember except that they were nice to her. Later, Wilson visits Erewhon. Jackie is surprised to see him and invites Wilson into the house to talk. Wilson refuses, having seen what Jackie can do in the dark and instead tries to lure him out into open. Although sensing that something isn't right, Jackie complies and walks out of the house. He asks where is Charlotte and Wilson answers that she's okay. Meanwhile, Charlotte aims for Jackie's head and is about to press the trigger when suddenly Hope appears behind her. Jackie and Wilson hear a gun go off in the house and the two rush to see what happened. They find Charlotte killed by Hope. Jackie then sends Hope down the stairs and asks Wilson to explain himself. Wilson answers that Jackie is too dangerous for this world and then puts his gun on the ground. He then walks away, saying that if Jackie kills him, Jenny will find out about everything that he done and he will lose her again. As Wilson reaches the stairs, Jackie turns around and kills him with his Darkness tendrils. Hope then tells Jackie that by killing Charlotte she invited the Ancient Ones into their world. Elsewhere, a tunnel opens in the forest and the Ancient Ones begin to rise from it.Personality  Even from his early childhood, Jackie was very violent, ruthless, intelligent, and brave. Despite this, he has a strict set of noble (even heroic) morals and a fierce loyalty to those that earn it. He has matured somewhat over the span of his adult life and his experiences with The Darkness, though his core personality still remains the same. He truly loved Jenny and was very caring and protective of her, often jumping onto and badlly hurting anyone who abused her at the orphanage, no matter how long it took him. After he was recruited into the mob, he was able to nourish his dark side; developing a taste for fast Italian cars, money, nice white business suits, Italian food and culture, as well as killing. He was also very prideful, sociopathic, sadistic, and insecure; willing to kill people simply for insulting him or making comments that revealed his true nature to him. Overall, Jackie Estacado is thought to be a murderous bastard to the eyes of his enemies, but the most loyal, caring, and defending man to the ones that earn his full trust. If it is one thing Jackie does not tolerate, it is his loved ones being harmed.Enemies & Allies The Angelus  The Angelus is the eternal enemy of The Darkness. The Angelus retains the memories of all of her previous host's lives and has led many crusades against Jackie in seeking to rid the world of The Darkness. The powers of the Angelus are similar, yet opposite, to the powers of The Darkness as both have the ability to create sentient beings, both commands a host of minions to do their bidding, she is immortal and has the power of flight, possesses superhuman strength, invulnerable to mortal weapons, can conjure weapons at will, breath fire, and fire bolts of light and teleport herself and other beings. Like The Darkness The Angelus' power does have its limits too. While The Darkness cannot function at all in the light The Angelus can function in the dark but only for short periods of time as it completely drains her power while the power of The Darkness becomes superior. The first modern host was the catatonic wife of Uncle Frankie, Lauren Franchetti. After she is killed the power initially possesses Velocity of Cyberforce but it is immediately driven from her body by Cyberforce. She then finds a new host in Celestine Wright until she herself is killed during the events of Broken Trinity. The current Angelus is the former Witchblade host Danielle Baptiste.Appolonia Franchetti  The daughter of Don Frankie, and the vengeful child of the catatonic Lauren Franchetti, who watched as her father murdered her mother's lover, which caused her mother to go into a coma. Responsible for The Angelus' return, and unsuccessfully trying to overthrow the Franchetti family, Appolonia was left in a coma. But she is brought out of this state with a fragment from The Spear of Destiny, The Magdalena's weapon. She mysteriously reappears on the anniversary of her parents' marriage. She is generally happy to see Jackie and is terrified of her mother (as she feels there is nothing remaining of her). Appolonia appears to be in league with The Angelus, setting up Jackie, but in reality betrays The Angelus when she is about to kill Magdalena and Jackie. Appolonia kills her mother with The Spear of Destiny, ending her mother's suffering. Lauren dies with tears of joy and is happy to see both Jackie and her daughter. Appolonia's current whereabouts are unknown.The Witchblade  Each generation one random woman is chosen to wield The Witchblade, a mystical gauntlet of great power. This generation's wielder is Sara Pezzini, a New York City detective. Sara teamed up with Jackie to fight Sonatine and Ian Nottingham and again later to fight The Necrobi. Jackie is the father of Sara's daughter Hope.The Magdalena  The Magdalena are descended from Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ, the first Magdalena that Jackie encountered was Sister Mariella, the daughter of Sister Rosalia. Mariella was prematurely sent to battle and kill Jackie on the church's orders, and since she was brought up in a crooked sect of the church, was a wild Christian fanatic who did not know right from wrong. She was left for dead when Jackie crucified her as a warning to her superiors. Mariella has not been seen since. Afterwards, Patience, the current Magdalena, is sent out to attack The Darkness, and Jackie mistakes her for Mariella, as does The Angelus. After explaining the situation to him, they end up teaming up against The Angelus, and Patience is possessed by her. Jackie saves her, and The Angelus flees. Patience and Jackie remain mutual allies.Capris Castiglione  Jackie has a twin sister named Capris Castiglione. The two were separated when they were just babies. Worried about Darkness' power and influence on her other child, their mother entrust Capris to Father Brendan. He raised her in an orphanage as if she is his own daughter. Capris' destiny gets twisted when she finds her best friend Blair murdered. She discovered that Blair was used in illegal porno movies. When Father Brendan was dying, he revealed Capris's past and twin brother to her. She meets a Native American by the name of Robert Bearclaw (Ripclaw of Cyberforce) who teaches her how to use the limited Darkness powers that she inherited from her father. Five years later, full of hatred, Capris sought out the men responsible for her friend's death. She pretended to be stripper named Tiffany and waited for a right moment to kill them. Ripclaw followed her on the revenge trip and offered to resume training her in the use of the Darkness. When she meets her brother, Jackie Estacado, for the first time, she tells him where the Angelus is holding Frankie, and then disappears. When Jackie needed to fight Cherubs, and Ripclaw took him to the spirit world, Capris looked after their earthly bodies and kept Jenny company. After The Darkness began to arise within Jackie, Capris became possessed by The Darkness, sliced Elle in half, and began to attack Jackie with the intent to kill him and take The Darkness for herself. Jackie was forced to kill her, stabbing her with his crystallized glove.Powers & Abilities  Jackie possesses the limitless power of The Darkness, a cursed elemental force of Chaos and Creation that allows him access to an otherworldly dimension and control over the veritable legion of Darklings who dwell there. He can stand against and even overpower other supernatural beings. He can destroy tanks and attack helicopters, slaughter vampires and werewolves, and easily butcher ordinary humans. Even the most powerful beings, such as Superman or the Witchblade, must check their strength before confronting Jackie.Abilities Trivia Gallery  Jackie Estacado (Comic)/GalleryCharacters  Characters you meet in The Darkness universe.Angelus (Comics)  The Angelus is one of the two primal forces of the universe and is the embodiment and ruler of the Light. She has been at war with her equal and opposite,\u00a0The Darkness, since the Creation. At some point she and The Darkness forged a truce to avert mutual destruction and in doing so conceived\u00a0The Witchblade. Each generation, The Angelus takes a human host, though such hosts have always been little more than puppets to the will of The Angelus.Biography Early Life  Since the beginning of the universe, The Angelus has been at war with The Darkness. In order to avert mutual destruction, a truce was struck. A peace was given from in the offspring of The Darkness, The Witchblade. During her many lifetimes on Earth she has been called many names. In the East, she is the Japanese Sun goddess Amaterasu-O-Mi-Kami. She is a part of the Japanese myth cycle and also a major deity of the Shinto religion. She is the goddess of the Sun, but also of the universe. The name Amaterasu derived from Amateru, meaning \"Shining in Heaven\". The meaning of her whole name, Amaterasu-O-Mi-Kami, is \"the great August Kami (God) who shines in the Heaven\". The Emperor of Japan is said to be her direct descendant. In The West, she is called Angelus, Queen of the Light. In the heart of the Amazon Rain forest, she is Illa, Bride of Inti, god of the Sun. Throughout her time on Earth, The Angelus has been responsible for many historic an even Biblical events and disasters, all in her struggles with The Darkness down through the centuries:The Modern Day  Like the Darkness, the Angelus replaces the soul of a host (which can only be a female) in order to carry out her life's mission on Earth. However, unlike The Darkness who is passed down generation to generation, The Angelus searches for the next host after they die. Her main goal is to rid the world of evil and the Darkness regardless of mortal rule or law. This has put her at odds with the current Darkness host, Jackie Estacado. Eventually the Angelus was defeated by Jackie, and was hostless for some time until Sonatine summoned her and tried to convince the entity to join with Appolonia Franchetti. Because Appolonia desired the entity too much, the Angelus chose her catatonic mother, Lauren Franchetti, instead. Soon after, the newly reborn Angelus was fooled into thinking she had finally killed the Darkness after Jackie made a copy of himself. She soon fled with Appolonia to an ancient temple in the Amazon rainforest, where Lauren gave herself completely to the Angelus entity. The Angelus came in contact with the Magdalena, Sister Mariella. The Magdalena was seeking to reforge the Spear of Destiny, which had been shattered during her first encounter with the Darkness. The fight ended with no clear winner, but the Angelus ordered Appolonia to leave because she was touched too deeply by the Darkness and that should they meet again, she would kill her. The Angelus would once again attempt to kill the Darkness and would also come into conflict with the new Magdalena, Patience. During the fight, Appolonia ran the Angelus through with the Spear of Destiny. The Angelus temporarily takes possession of Patience, but the spirit is forced out of Patience's body by her strong will and benevolence.First Born  During the time the Angelus was without a host, her followers sensed that the balance between the light and the dark has been tipped in favor of Jackie Estacado, and had begun preparing for war while the Angelus searched for a new host. She first takes possession of Velocity but is forced out by members of Cyberforce. She then takes possession of convicted murderer Celestine. Shortly after the birth of Hope Pezzini (daughter to Sara Pezzini and Jackie), the Angelus claims her only to have a mystical explosion occur. After the event, only the Angelus and her foes remain. Celestine and the Angelus co-existed as separate entities, with Celestine able to become the Angelus as needed but retaining her own free will. Celestine, however, knew that the Angelus did have the ability to subsume her will at any point, but the Angelus chose not to after her encounter with Sara Pezzini's daughter.Broken Trinity  Celestine later returned to fight Jackie Estacado. While caught in the middle of a fight between the hosts of the Glacier Stone and Ember Stone, Celestine is decapitated with the Blood Sword wielded by Jackie Estacado. The Angelus was once again without a bearer until she came across Finch, friend of Danielle Baptiste, and possesses her. During a fight with Sara Pezzini (currently hosting the Darkness portion of the Witchblade and corrupted by it), she attempts to kill the bearer of the Angelus portion of The Witchblade, Dani. After emerging victorious (or so she believed), she absorbed the remaining half of the Witchblade into her being while still being corrupted. Sara was on the brink of killing Dani when an Angelus-infested Finch swoops in to save Dani from death, and the Angelus transfers hosts from Finch to Dani. Strangely, however, Dani is able to resist the Angelus' possessive personality, and instead of killing Sara, she is able to use the powers of the Angelus to purify Sara of the corrupting forces of Darkness. The fact that the Angelus would allow Dani to retain her free will caused come unrest among her followers, particularly her lieutenant, Sabine, who desired for the Angelus to choose her as host. Sabine later attempted a coup to overthrow Dani and become the new Angelus host. After acquiring the Wheel of Shadows, one of the other 13 Artifacts, Sabine battled Dani, but was defeated. Later, Dani united with other Artifact bearers to combat the Survivor to prevent him from gathering the 13 Artifacts and ending the universe. They failed, but Jackie Estacado gained the ability to restart the universe and took the opportunity to make a few changes.Rebirth  Following the reboot, Dani was no longer the Angelus. Instead, the Angelus force had been divided and possessed the various Angelus Warriors, creating a hive mind. The Angelus soon regained its faculties, choosing a new host in Finch, and starting the war with the Darkness anew. While the Angelus takes full control of Finch during battles, it seems to allow her some independence.Personality  Angelus is a malevolent being that's sole purpose is to kill The Darkness by any means. After fulfilling this purpose, Angelus wants to rule the world and enforce a totalitarian order. She doesn't feel empathy for any life except for her Familiars. Angelus fears being controlled, which is hinted to be the reason for her hate towards the Darkness. When Angelus felt Patience fighting back and taking control of her, she left Magdalena's body, shouting that nobody will control her. She often creates human female constructs to have pleasure with them.Powers & Abilities  The Angelus is the embodiment of light and totalitarian order. As such, she possesses many supernatural godlike powers even under dark conditions. The exact ferocity of her power and beauty remains unknown, though she has been described as being as beautiful as The Morningstar and more violent and bloodthirsty than Kali.Weaknesses & Limitations  Despite her divine powers, The Angelus does have weaknesses.Darkness (Comics)  The Darkness is an ancient entity which passes from one Human male host to another each generation. He is one of the two primal forces of The Universe as well as the original void before the coming of light and Angelus which resulted in the creation of the universe. He is the embodiment of chaos, evil, disorder and darkness. The Darkness resented God and became an enemy of Heaven itself and later The Vatican, who have plotted against and sent The Magdalena to assassinate The Darkness on many occasions since the death of Jesus Christ. Despite this; The Darkness is the one who gave Humans their souls. The Darkness has made his way through history well over the span of 10,000 years using Human males as hosts and is passed on via sexual intercourse with Human women, leaving his old host to die as he takes his newly conceived vessel and remaining dormant within the new living vessel until awakening on the eve of his 21st birthday. Jackie Estacado is the current host of The Darkness and has used his powers in ways that no other vessel ever has, making him his greatest and most powerful vessel to date.Biography Early Life  Ten thousands years ago, after Ancient Ones were imprisoned in their own universe, a residue of their energy was left behind. Out of this energy, Darkness and its rival Angelus were born. Since then, the Darkness and the Angelus waged an eternal war as stars and planets took form around them. These two primordial beings, being equal in power and status, were unable to destroy each other without causing significant change to the universe or even destroying it altogether. To avert mutual destruction, a truce was struck. The Angelus and the Darkness consummated and in so doing conceived the Witchblade, creating peace and balance between them. Despite the birth of the Witchblade, the gnawing anger of the Darkness found no expression for age upon age, festering, putrefying, distilling to seething perfection, until a vessel for his boundless hate was found: mankind, God's most favored creation. The Darkness seeped into the genes of a particularly fertile bloodline and used them as his medium to manifest his fury on Earth. Each generation was set loose with nearly limitless powers and only one calling: to spill Chaos over the world of light. The Darkness chose hosts from the ranks of murderers, thieves, rapists and warlords, steering them to ruin in the process. Christian Estacado\u00a0was the earliest known host in the Estacado bloodline. He was a dark prince of the\u00a0House of Estacado\u00a0who reigned cruelly over a darkened world. He was tricked into mating with an an Angelus host and his child inherited the Darkness power. Centuries later in 15th century Spain, Michelangelo Estacado was raised by gypsies after his mother was burned as a witch by the Inquisition. On his 21st birthday, while witnessing the execution of innocents by Inquisitors, his powers manifested and he slaughtered the Inquisitors. The Darkness manifested in Jackie as his apartment was rampaged by Brotherhood soldiers, who were subsequently slain by Angelus Warriors sent to kill Estacado as he manifested the Darkness. Jackie manifested his armor and slew the warriors before slaying the head of the Marchianni family. He subsequently used the power to destroy the Angelus host and free himself from the Brotherhood.Personality  The Darkness is a formless force, described more as a power than a being. It is at best an unfocused mind in need of a host to shape its personality. The Heart of Darkness claimed that the entity sees itself as benign, as humans feed it with their evil and drive it to seek chaos. From what has been described of the Darkness's background in the Bible, the entity grew bitter after God exiled it into the bowels of the cosmos, but also that it became perfected from its seething hatred - emerging with nearly limitless power and the singular desire to spread chaos on Earth. Despite its great wrath, the Darkness had the foresight to put aside its spite for the light and embrace the Angelus's companionship for a time in the interests of mutual survival. From what has been depicted of their union, the Darkness was ironically a playful and gentle lover.Hosts of The Darkness  The Darkness has used host as vessels well over the span of 10,000 years, passing from one vessel to another each generation. When host of The Darkness die, their souls enter The Realm of The Darkness where they remain forever.Powers & Abilities  The Darkness is an elemental force of Chaos and Creation that bestows his hosts with nearly limitless Demonic power as well as allows them access to an otherworldly dimension and control over the veritable legion of Darklings who dwell there.Darklings  Darklings are the impish, deviant, base and foul-mouthed servants of the Darkness. Created from necroplasmic materials and animated by the spirit of the Darkness, the Darklings are the foot-soldiers of the Darkness host; serving and obeying his every whim, protecting him from harm, and tending to his needs. The hosts communicate with the Darklings through telepathy, able to give them commands and receive messages from across long distances as well as see and hear through their eyes.Darkness Armor  The signature ability of the Darkness is the creation of an invulnerable mystical armor about the host. This armor significantly augments the host's strength, speed and endurance, making him a powerhouse and a challenge to even the most physically powerful of super-humans. The appearance and design of the armor is a reflection of the host's character.Armor Abilities\u00a0 Darkness Extensions Mystical Abilities  The Darkness allows the host other, more arcane abilities that defy the laws of physics.Weaknesses & Limitations  The Darkness is shown to have only a few Weaknesses & LimitationsTrivia Victor Valente  Victor Valente is the head of a mysterious organization known as The Brotherhood, an ancient order formed hundreds of years ago for the sole purpose of destroying, and eventually controlling The Darkness once and for all. He serves as the main antagonist of The Darkness II.Biography Before The Darkness II  Valente being head of The Brotherhood hunted The Darkness down all across the globe in the hopes of controlling it. He has also aquired an ancient bronze staff, called the Siphon, created by The Angelus, to contain and control the Darkness. After possessing the Siphon, he finally locates The Darkness in New York City as well as the host it has recently selected: Jackie Estacado. Valente and The Brotherhood then set up a brothel, using criminal activities as their front, in order to keep an eye on Jackie as well as carrying a hit out on him using a rival gangster named Swifty.The Darkness II  However this attempt on Jackie's life is only to force Jackie to use the now dormant Darkness that Valente desires to possess, this plan is a success and with Jackie using The Darkness all of the would be hitmen are slaughtered. Later, after interrogating and killing Swifty, Jackie infiltrates The Brotherhoods brothel, and kills many of the thugs guarding it with the help of a prostitute named Venus. After killing many hired thugs and Brotherhood members he is finally captured by Valente and his second in command Mr. Peevish and subseqently crucified. Valente begins to use the Siphon to forcefully drain The Darkness from Jackie, he then informs Jackie of an attack he ordered on his penthouse even trying to make Jackie choose which of his captured to execute. After witnessing this and having some of The Darkness drained from him, he escapes from the cross he was nailed to and heads back to his home. In the ensuing battle at Jackie's, Aunt Sarah is murdered by psychotic Brotherhood member, Bragg with Jackie being forced to watch as well as being killed himself, and sent to The Otherworld. Valente then devises an attack on Aunt Sarah's funeral led by her and Jackie's murderer Bragg. After Jackie is fully healed, he attends Aunt Sarah's funeral and battles The Brotherhood attackers, Bragg and all his men are killed by Jackie in the attack. Even though all his men were killed in the funeral attack, Valente's plan was still a success as before Bragg died he revealed Valente's location to Jackie thus setting the perfect trap. After Jackie comes after The Brotherhood he is once again captured this time in an iron maiden, and then brought to his family's old abadoned manision. Once there Valente drains all of the Darkness from Jackie and orders him burned alive, however he escapes death once again with the aid of his Darkling. Jackie then battles many of Valente's men, including a Darkness empowered Peevish, who is killed and stripped of the Darkness by Jackie. After all of his men are killed Valente runs to the attic of the mansion with the Siphon and confronts Jackie there.Fate  The two battle with Victor using the Siphon's powers in an attempt to kill Jackie, however Jackie's powers with the Darkness are too powerful and Valente is wounded and defeated. Valente then watches as Jackie picks up the siphon and in a final attempt to stop Jackie he tries to grab it away from him, and after a brief struggle, Valente is knocked to the floor and brutally beaten to death with the siphon by an enraged Jackie.Personality  In many dangerous situations to capture the host, he is usually calm, patient, and serious. Victor taunts Jackie about his role as the Darkness Host and also his father. His counterpart in the mental hospital reality (Dr. Vick) however, is less sadistic and more kind than his real world counterpart, but still retains his strict, cold personality.Powers & Abilities Powers Abilities Equipment Trivia Darkling  In The Darkness II there is one Darkling that serves as a partner that is also interactive to a degree.Biography The Darkness II  After Jackie is knocked to the nearby building by the second explosion from the restaurant, the Darkling is seen hiding in the ceiling panels. When a Brotherhood member finds Jackie and prepares to execute him, the Darkling jumps on the attacker and kills him by repeatedly headbutting him. The Darkling then greets Jackie, saying it's been too long and asks to give them a hug. Jackie passes this offer, but thanks for saving him. The creature then proceeds to fart, making Jackie to ask as to what is that smell. The Darkling answers, that he should tell him, as the creature came from Jackie's mind. The Darkling then helps Jackie to navigate the streets and reach Canal St. subway station. He later accompanies Jackie when he attacks Swifty. During Swifty's crane battle, the Darkling gives Jackie propane tanks to throw at the crane cabin. Later when Jackie attacks Brotherhood headquarters at the Brimstone Club, the Darkling helps him by getting into a vent and turning off the lights, preventing him from moving forward. While doing this, the Darkling shows Jackie, that he can see everything the creature sees. During their journey through the vents, the Darkling overhears the Brotherhood talking about the Darkness essence, the source of their power. He also hears about their plans to trap the Darkness in a strange artifact. After Jackie frees himself from the Brotherhood captivity and escapes the burning Brimstone Club, the Darkling helps him to find a path from the rooftops to the street level. Later the Darkling helps during the ambush at Aunt Sarah's funeral. When Jackie defeats Bragg and begins to interrogate him, the Darkling is proceeds to slap, punch and push around their captive. The Darkling then holds Bragg as Jackie rips out his heart from his chest. Later the Darkling helps Jackie during his journey to Hellgate Field where he confronts the Brotherhood. When Victor closes the door leading to his whereabouts, the Darkling drives a fuel tanker through them and opens up an entrance to Jackie. Unfortunately, Jackie gets captured by the Brotherhood and imprisoned in the Bed of Thorns. The Darkling then mounts a rescue operation, infiltrating the cellars where Jackie is being kept and saves his master from death. Although the Darkling suggests Jackie to leave the Darkness behind and enjoy their new found freedom in Vegas, Estacado can't leave Jenny trapped in Hell and the two chase after Victor.Institution  In the mental institution (where the Darkness keeps Jackie), the Darkling comes to help him and apart from Johnny Powell seems to be the only one there that knows the place isn't entirely real. The Darkling disguises himself as a hunched back Janitor who makes his identity known by referring to Jackie as 'Monkey' which is his personal label for Jackie.Death  The Darkling dies when it attempts to help Jackie reach the institutions roof. When he opens the door, the light comes blinding in and knocks the Darkling down the stairs where he seems to leak/steam dark energy as he slowly perishes. This shows valour and a sense of friendship as well as he comments on how he 'had a good run' and tells Jackie not to 'fuck it up, eh' meaning that he accepts his fate and that he wishes Jackie well in his own way.Personality  The Darkling appears to be English in not only his clothing but his colloquial way of speaking as well as he seems to use the word 'fuck' a lot, as well as 'bollocks' giving him a more relatable, down-to-earth personality. He shows himself to be more of a cheeky and mischievous personality than evil and can sometimes be spotted urinating or farting on the dead bodies of recent victims. The Darkling exhibits a strange amount of loyalty to Jackie, even going as far as to help him escape the illusionary 'Asylum' that The Darkness places Jackie in during key moments of the story.\u00a0Powers & Abilities Powers Weaknesses Design  The Darkling's physical appearence differs from the enemy ones encountered near the end of the game. He has a gloss black shine to his skin whereas the enemy variants are covered in an orange glow in a web like pattern. He is more hunched over and tends to 'waddle' on his short hind legs whilst raising his arms out to the side in a comical fashion as opposed to the quadrapedial crawling of the enemy variants. The Darkling's right arm is normally coloured whereas his left arm seems to have flesh stripped from it around the fingers giving it a bloody look. He also wears what appears to be a large, baggy jersey with a union jack design. His headpiece is made of the carcass of a dead cat and he wears a spiked metal collar with a few links of chain still attached.Trivia Paulie Franchetti (Game)  Paulie Franchetti was the Don of the Franchetti crime family and the main antagonist of The Darkness. He was in a major conflict with Jackie Estacado, believing he is trying to rise to be the Don of the Franchetti Family.Biography The Darkness  Paulie was the one who brought Jackie out of the orphanage at a young age. Paulie used Jackie for certain jobs that needed to be done. Paulie has a large portion of cops under his influence and few people will dare cross him. In Grinders Lane he has a slaughter house which he also uses to store his money. At the start of the game Jackie wakes up and finds out that Paulie is after him and his friends. Paulie's men chase through to the cemetery where Jackie is believed to be killed. Instead though this awakens the Darkness in him. Jackie proceeds to destroy all of Paulie's illegal operations, this cuts off all of his money preventing him from earning for the more powerful Chicago crime families, including his operations at Grinders lane. Paulie and his main enforcer, police captain Eddie Shrote, then blow up Jackie's childhood home St. Mary's orphanage, and capture the love of Jackie's life Jenny Romano and hold her in the burned down orphanage in retaliation for Jackie ruining his operations. Once Jackie arrives to rescue Jenny, Paulie murders her in front of him with cruel delight, after The Darkness stops Jackie from intervening in her death. After this, Jackie, enraged at losing Jenny, kills Eddie Shrote and many of his corrupt police officers, as well as ruining a shipment of drugs Paulie had coming in by killing the ship's captain. Paulie once again retaliates by sending hitmen to kill Jackie's Aunt Sarah and his old friend Jimmy \"The Grape\", however his plan is foiled by Jackie who arrives during the shootout at Aunt Sarah's house and kills all of Paulie's men. Jimmy, angered by Paulie's assassination attempt, gets the okay from the Chicago families to have Jackie kill Paulie and take his place as Don of the Franchetti crime family. Paulie learns of this displeasure from Chicago and goes into hiding at a lighthouse he owns. With assistance from Butcher Joyce, Jackie finds Paulie and, using The Darkness, slaughters all of the gangsters that are guarding him. After all of his men are dead Paulie flees to the top of the lighthouse where he is found and wounded by Jackie. The injured Paulie then begs Jackie not to kill him, promising to give him whatever he wants, Jackie however can only think of what Paulie did to Jenny and in revenge for her murder, shoots the pleading mob boss. Paulie now mortally wounded, curses Jackie with his dying breath and, with the murder of his Uncle Paulie, Jackie is fully consumed by The Darkness.Personality  Paulie was once an soft and light-hearted man who enjoyed spending time with his nephew and held a firm but respectful role as the don of the Franchetti crime family who did his best to ensure peace and respect among the family and people who worked for him. However that soon changed, as Paulie became more paranoid and fearful towards Jackie's independence, this eventually turned him into a psychopathic and power hungry madman who would act unstable and utterly dangerous. Besides that, he is also a great coward and would run away from his enemies and his men to deal with his problems which would lead to his downfall. He is also very ruthless and unremorseful and enjoys hurting his enemies and making their loved ones suffer as much as possible before he kills them. In reality, Paulie is corrupted and has a deluded sense of morals that he thinks if any opposes or defies him, they should die immediately, thus making him an evil, arrogant, obese, and sadistic villain that only deserves a bullet in his head.Trivia Brotherhood  The Brotherhood is an ancient and powerful secret society led by Victor Valente that appears in The Darkness II and are main antagonists of the game.Overview  The Brotherhood was formed hundreds of years ago by a saint for the sole purpose of protecting the world from The Darkness. But they eventually became corrupted and now want to control The Darkness so they can rule the world and have the human race bow before them as their True God. They seem to be highly organized and well funded since most high ranking members are powerful people even outside the Brotherhood. They know a lot about Jackie Estacado and The Darkness, like his weakness to light. They are all equipped with various tools that use light as a weapon, such as flashbang grenades or flash cannons. The Brotherhood is also involved in human trafficking and other forms of organized crime. They also have gathered what appears to be pieces of Darkness energy and have implemented them into weapons and equipment.Brotherhood Members High Ranking Members  Victor Valente- Leader of The Brotherhood and has become obsessed with using the Siphon of the Angelus to steal The Darkness from Jackie. Mister Peevish- Peevish seems to be the right hand to Victor Valente and appears to have been completely corrupted by and addicted to dark essence. By the time Jackie confronts Peevish, Peevish has gained Darkness powers that Jackie reclaims after killing Mister Peevish. Mister Bragg- A high level enforcer within the Brotherhood who seems to possess some Darkness powers. He murders Aunt Sarah right in front of Jackie before shooting Jackie in the face. He is later killed by Jackie during Aunt Sarah's funeral. David Graves - Graves serves as the main antagonist during the Vendettas Campaign. He owns the Manhattan Trust bank and his primary job is to recover the Spear of Destiny for the Brotherhood. At the end of the campaign, Graves impales himself with the Spear and transforms into a Hell Beast.

It was released on June 25, 2007 in North America and on June 20, 2007 in Europe. The video game is based on the comic book of the same title. A sequel, titled The Darkness II was announced and released on February 7, 2012.Gameplay  The Darkness features an Italian-American hitman for the mafia named Jackie Estacado as the protagonist. The game includes a range of modern-day weapons that become available over the course of the game. However, as a result of Estacado turning 21 at the start of the game, the powers of The Darkness are available to the player, with some powers not being unlocked until later in the game. The Darkness powers include summoning different types of imp-like \"darklings\" that can attack foes, using \"dark tentacles\" to impale foes or break down walls, using \"creeping dark\" tendrils that sneak along floors, walls, and ceilings to take out foes from a distance, and creating a black hole that sucks anything nearby into it. Over the course of the game, Estacado also comes into possession of the \"darkness guns\" that are more powerful than many conventional weapons but consume some amount of darkness energy in order to fire. The darkness guns are held one in each hand, the one on the right being a small minigun, and the other is a sort \"one hand cannon\" that fires immensely powerful rounds. These Darkness powers cannot be used when Estacado is in a well-lit area but become more powerful in darker conditions; the player is able to shoot out lights to help increase the amount of dark energy available for their attacks. Additionally, by ordering the Darkness to consume the hearts of the victims of the attacks, the player can further increase the effects of the Darkness powers. The game has several levels based on New York City locales that players visit multiple times. A subway system allows the player to move between areas. While the main plot is primarily linear, requiring the player to visit each area in a certain order, the player can undertake side missions by speaking with non-player characters that wander the subway stations. Completing sub-missions earns the player a \"collectible\" phone number which can then be used at any phone to unlock additional game media; collectibles can also be found scattered throughout the level. The Otherworld levels feature collectibles in the form of unposted postal mail that the player can deliver when back in New York City in order to unlock the content. In the game the full movie To Kill a Mockingbird is shown if you choose to sit down with Jenny to watch TV during the single player story. MaximumPC called the scene \"the most authentic instance of romance ever conveyed in a videogame\". Also included is the full movie The Man with the Golden Arm in the Grinder's Lane level. So is a full episode of Flash Gordon. The movie The Street Fighter with Sonny Chiba is viewable, as well as cartoon shorts of Popeye and Gabby. This was possible because these movies are in the public domain.Plot  The player takes the role of Jackie Estacado (voiced by Kirk Acevedo), with the story presented as a future-narrative on the present events observed by the player. On the eve of his 21st birthday, Jackie was targeted for assassination by the don of the New York mafia, \"Uncle\" Paulie. He finds his body possessed by \"the Darkness\" (voiced by Mike Patton), a malevolent spirit that has inhabited his family for several generations, with the benefit of Jackie gaining supernatural powers that feeds off the dark. Using these dark powers, Jackie is able to survive further assassination attempts and track down Paulie, but not before Paulie and the corrupt police chief, Eddie Shrote, kidnap Jackie's girlfriend, Jenny. They took her to the orphanage where Jackie and Jenny grew up, and then they murder her and escape. Unable to stop them due to the Darkness deliberately restraining him and forcing him to watch her die, he commits suicide out of sheer emotional stress. He finds himself in the Otherworld , the realm of the Darkness with patchwork undead beings in World War I outfits fighting each other, and physical manifestations of the Four Horsemen. He meets his great-great-grandfather Anthony Estacado , who admits that it was he that brought the Darkness into the family, and tells Jackie how to free himself of the Darkness by invading the castle in the Otherworld and facing the Darkness there. Jackie is interrupted in his journey through the Otherworld and brought back to the living. Once he recovers, he determines that he must dispose of Chief Shrote before he can face Paulie. Chasing Shrote to his apartment and then confiscating a briefcase containing illicit goods in Shrote's ownership and rigging it with an explosive, Jackie is able to lure Shrote out of hiding, but he is shortly captured. After overhearing about a shipment of drugs that a Chicago mob is entrusting to Paulie to handle, Jackie triggers the explosive, killing Shrote and his men along with himself. Jackie re-awakes in the Otherworld, and lays siege to the Darkness's castle with Anthony's help. Anthony is mortally wounded in the attack, but before he can tell Jackie the last steps needed to free himself from the Darkness, the spirit pulls him away. Jackie faces the Darkness and surprises it by willingly being taken by the Darkness's power, allowing him to fully control the spirit back in the real world, however the Darkness tells him that while he has control now, each time Jackie takes a life, he will become more consumed by the Darkness. He lays an assault on the drug shipment, causing Paulie to flee to the safety of a lighthouse mansion for fear of retribution from the Chicago mob. Jackie takes advantage of a solar eclipse to raid the mansion and finally kill Paulie. The Darkness revels in Jackie's murderous spree, and fully envelops Jackie. In the epilogue, Jackie finds himself in a dream in a park, lying on a bench in Jenny's arms. Jenny explains that they are only allowed a few minutes to be together one last time to say goodbye. Jackie tries to ask how, but Jenny just quiets him, allowing them to enjoy the last moments together before Jackie wakes back up with the screen fading to black.Reception  The Darkness received favorable reviews from critics, with a score of 82 on Metacritic. Most praised the single player campaign, the story, and the game's graphics across both platforms, but warned readers about unreasonably bad lag in multiplayer sessions and advised to ignore multiplayer altogether until a patch is released. The Darkness received the \"Game of the Month\" award in the August issue of Game Informer. Hyper's Daniel Wilks commends the game for its \"brilliant storytelling, looking great and excellent level design\". However, he criticises for its \"weak physics engine and some AI problems\".  As of June 24, 2009, the Game Rankings score for The Darkness is 83.31 (Xbox 360) / 81.36 (PS3). The Metacritic score was 82 (Xbox 360) / 80 (PS3).Ban in Singapore  The censorship board in Singapore banned the game for excessive violence and religiously offensive expletives. The game had been scheduled for a July release before the ban. The game was later released in Singapore under an M18 rating in 2009.Sequel  On September 16, 2008, the admin for the Starbreeze Studios forums stated that the Darkness 2 is not in production, and probably will not be made by Starbreeze Studios. In an e-mail from Top Cow, it is stated that should a Darkness sequel be made, the decision to create one with whoever 2K Games chooses. In July of 2009 it was confirmed that The Darkness 2 is in production. The game will not be developed by Starbreeze, but instead by Digital Extremes, which was unnamed at the time. In July 2010, a resume for Emmanuel Papas, an artist at Digital Extremes, included experience working on a game titled Darkness 2, suggesting that Digital Extremes was developing or co-developing the title. It is now confirmed that Digital Extremes is publishing The Darkness II. On October 8, 2010, Top Cow marketing director Freeman said: \"There are certain rights issues that we needed to clear up in order to move ahead with The Darkness 2. Those are getting cleared up. While there are no specific plans, it is definitely that is still on all of our minds. We loved the game. The fans loved the game. There\u2019s no reason to not do another one. Just making sure that all of our ducks are in a row so that we can begin that process.\" On February 8, 2011, the sequel was confirmed for release in late 2011 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. Later that month, record label Ipecac Recordings confirmed that Mike Patton will be returning as the voice of the Darkness. On June 6, 2011, the sequel was given a release date of October 4, 2011.Videos Anthony Estacado  Anthony Estacado is the first known member of the Estacado bloodline to host The Darkness. He was the great-great-grandfather of Jackie Estacado. He served in World War I, and was an American soldier. He claims he is responsible for bringing the darkness into the Estacado family. He now lives in an never ending nightmare in the Otherworld.Biography Before The Darkness  Not much is known about Anthony before he became the Darkness host. According to his claims, Anthony was the one that brought the Darkness in Estacado family line. It's not revealed how or when this happened during his life. At some point he served as an American soldier in World War I. During the war he died and was trapped in Otherworld.The Darkness  When Jackie dies for the first time he is transported to the Otherworld where he meets Anthony. Upon meeting him, Anthony demands Jackie to head up to the hills above the village for the two meet in. Upon going there, Jackie finds Death (One of the Four Horsemen) and receives The Darkness Guns from him. Acquiring the guns according to Anthony, will let Jackie have better control over The Darkness. Jackie is sent underground to find a cannon in hopes of entering the castle which is the heart of The Darkness. Later, when Jackie sets up a plan to kill\u00a0Eddie Shrote, Anthony calls to Jackie, telling him he needs to find a way back to No Mans Land. After commiting sucide a second time, Jackie is sent back and finds himself inside the train. Jackie tries to fire a shell at the castle but there are no shells in the cannon at all. Jackie heads back to the village and meets Anthony in a tank. The two storm into a German bunker in hopes of finding a shell. The tank crashes and Anthony is injured by a large creature. Jackie guns down the beast and hears Anthony's last words. Anthony mentions something about \"a light in The Darkness\" but he is pulled away by The Darkness and dies.\u00a0Johnny Powell  Johnny Powell is a brilliant yet estranged occultist who acts like an adviser to Jackie Estacado and will give information about the supernatural world.Biography Early History  As a graduate student, Johnny Powell became an unparalleled expert on the world of mystical power and magic. He kept himself busy studying ancient relics that were shrouded in dark (and even fantastical) histories, and which were purportedly connected to some of the most infamous figures from antiquity. However, he ended up discovering that the mythology surrounding these artifacts was all true, and that they all pointed to The Darkness. The objects Johnny researched were tinged with Dark Essence, a substance that clings to objects and people who have come into contact with The Darkness. The Essence that was left behind on the relics Johnny was studying proved to be something of a narcotic for him, and he quickly found himself addicted to it. From there, his lifestyle degenerated from that of a promising (if obsessive) student to one of a muttering, semi-coherent junkie. During a period when he was still somewhat functional, Jackie Estacado sought Powell's assistance in dealing with his internal battle with The Darkness. Johnny explained the role of Dark Essence, and how it could be harnessed from the relics. Eventually, with Powell's help, Jackie was able the bottle up The Darkness, more or less. However, spending all this quality time with a bearer of The Darkness only worsened Johnny's affliction. Realizing this, he fled without Estacado's knowledge, and has been essentially homeless ever since.The Darkness II  Eventually Jackie uses his men to find and bring Johnny to his penthouse suite. Johnny explains that Jackie is being pursued by a\u00a0secret society called the Brotherhood who seek the Darkness' powers for themselves using the Siphon, an object created to contain the Darkness by an entity known as\u00a0the Angelus, which is the Darkness' female counterpart. After discovering who set up the attack at the restaurant, Johnny then provides a lead to the Brotherhood's location at a nearby brothel.\u00a0After Jackie heals his fatal wounds sustained from the Brotherhood attacking his home, he wakes back in the library of his home with Johnny explaining that he had been unconscious for four days, and that the Franchetti enforcers drove the Brotherhood off before they could make off with Jackie's body. He's the first to tell Jackie his Aunt Sarah is dead. Throughout the course of the game, Johnny will also provide exposition on the various Darkness relics Jackie finds. He takes particular interest in The Abysmal Maw, a darkness cannon which he admits could send even Mother Teresa straight to Hell. He also expresses particular concern over the last relic he finds, the Prism of the Brothers, which he is still somehow able to narrate despite Jackie being trapped in Hell when he found it. He explains it was made by the Brotherhood to contain the Angelus as the Siphon could contain the Darkness, and was previously thought to be responsible for her disappearance during WWII. But what worries him is that he could tell just by looking at the Prism that the Angelus never even touched it, which begged the question, \"Where the fuck is she?\" After Jackie returns from the Brotherhood's attack on her funeral, he tells Johnny he's going to a place called Hellgate Field at the old Boardwalk in Astoria to stop the Brotherhood for good, despite agreeing with Johnny that it was a trap. Johnny tells Jackie he can't let the Darkness nor the Brotherhood have the Siphon, or else \"we are all fucked.\" The player also has the option of questioning Johnny further about the Siphon and Angelus, in which Jackie will come to understand that the Siphon could truly kill him and send him straight to Hell, and that \"one day this broad\u2019s gonna show up wantin' to kill him\". Unbeknownst to Johnny, Jackie would confirm both warnings firsthand by the end of the game.Vendettas  During the Vendettas campaign, Jackie hires the Darkness mercenaries to save Johnny from a group of thugs and bring him to the mansion. There, Johnny deciphers the various clues they find and guides them remotely on their assaults on the Brotherhood and their underlings. Ultimately, he uncovers and explains the Brotherhood's mission, to retrieve the Spear of Destiny and use it to kill Jackie and become all-powerful. He impresses upon the mercenaries the importance of stopping them and their leader, millionaire David Graves, which they do.Personality  Although seen by most as totally crazy, Johnny is extremely intelligent and has vast knowledge about everything related to the Darkness. He also shows empathy and care to Jackie for bearing the Darkness.Trivia Sara Pezzini  Sara Pezzini is a fictional comic book superheroine starring in the series Witchblade and also appearing in The Darkness series. She is an NYPD homicide detective whose life changed when she came into contact with a powerful ancient weapon known as the Witchblade, which bestows its wielder with supernatural powers.Biography Early Life  Sara Pezzini was born November 18, 1970, and is of Italian descent. Her major enemies are Kenneth Irons (whom she briefly dated before discovering his evil nature) and Ian Nottingham (sometime love-interest and ally). Sara first appeared in Cyblade/Shi #1: The Battle For Independents in 1995. She had wanted nothing more in her life than to be a good cop. As a homicide detective in New York City, life was challenging enough, but for Sara, those were simpler times. While on an undercover case at the Rialto Theater, both she and her partner, Michael Yee (named Danny Woo in the TV series), were mortally wounded. At this same theater was a man named Kenneth Irons, who had brought a gauntlet known as The Witchblade. Irons was in search of the secrets to unlocking his full power and ability.Getting Witchblade  While Sara lay dying, The Witchblade made his choice to include her in the long line of women that he has shared his power with. The entity healed Sara's wounds and allowed her to survive the resulting confrontation. Since then, she has seen many things she never knew existed, fought creatures that have no place on Earth, and longed for the days of a typical NYPD detective. But she continues her struggle with The Witchblade, believing that she can do more good with the entity than without. So the battle for control continues, as Sara learns more about this entity and struggles to stem his violent nature. Some of Sara's allies include The Magdalena, Lara Croft, and Jackie Estacado. One crossover pitted her against Wolverine. In the comics recently, Sara has been through a grueling ordeal fighting off a giant demon (a false \"god\" summoned by a group of priests), in the midst of which her partner, Jake McCarthy, was left wounded. Before losing consciousness, Jake professed his love for Sara and told her that he always knew about her double life. He now remains in a coma, and Sara has had to deal with a nosy new partner, Patrick Gleason, who has already discovered many of her secrets. Gleason saved her life and it had begun to look like they may become more than just partners, but their sexual date was interrupted when Ian Nottingham abruptly returned to Sara's life.Pregnancy  After a minor crisis that led to the death of Sara's good friend and loyal partner; Jake, Sara discovered she was pregnant. Sara was completely confounded at how this occurred \u2013 due primarily to the fact she has not had sex in over a year. Sara, initially feeling she was not ready to be a mother, nevertheless decided to keep the baby, but decided as a result she could not keep the Witchblade as well. Sara relinquished it on to Danielle Baptiste, a young woman she had recently met who was its next chosen bearer. When she was due to give birth, the father of her child was revealed \u2013 it was Jackie Estacado, who, \"possessed\" by The Darkness itself, was driven to seek out and have sex with Sara's comatose body, and, with Jackie's body used for the necessary biology, leading to the conception of their baby \u2013 a child to upset the balance between the dark and light. Sara gives birth to a baby girl, but is on the verge of death. Danielle then ends up sharing part of the Witchblade with Sara, which saves Sara's life. Hope, Sara and Jackie's daughter, drives off The Angelus and in the end Sara, now wielding half The Witchblade, and her friends return to their lives. This pregnancy has caused an attraction between Jackie and Sara that has manifested itself as romantic and even sexual.War of the Witchblades  Later, a major conflict erupts between Sara and Danielle, with Sara under the control of The Darkness portion of the Witchblade. During this time Sara became increasingly irrational, angry and would often mistreat the people around her, however she did display more increased control over the entity demonstrating abilities usually associated with The Darkness (summoning dark-based objects, creating Darklings etc.). Manipulated by an old enemy of The Curator, Sara re-took all of The Witchblade in a battle with Danielle. However Sara was saved when Danielle was chosen as the next Angelus host and cleansed her of The Darkness' influence, restoring Sara to her former self. While Sara attempts to redeem herself for her crimes under the Darkness-half of the Witchblade, an Internal Affairs agent named Phipps discovered the truth about the Witchblade through Jake McCarthy's diary. He confronted Sara, demanding that she either resign as a detective or give up the Witchblade if she doesn't want to be exposed. Sara chose the former. She then moves to Chicago, working as a private investigator.Personality  Sara is a strong, determined, and mature woman. One of her defining characteristics is her black-and-white view of the world and of people, something that many characters in the series have called her out on.Powers & Abilities  Sara has above average intelligence, and is very athletic. She has police training in hand-to-hand combat, weapons, tactics and criminal investigation.Elle  The concubine Elle was an artificial woman created by the combined efforts of Jackie and Professor Kirchner in their respective attempts to both create a companion for Jackie as well as a perfect means for Kirchner to ensure that a completed vessel for the Darkness would be born. Fashioned from the Darkness using genetic material and anatomical data provided by both Jackie and Kirchner, Elle was - for all intents and purposes - fully human, with the only major difference being that she shared the same biological makeup and dark predilections as Darklings. Elle fulfilled both of her purposes; copulating with Jackie and thus conceiving Jackie's Offspring. However, Kirchner's plans were foiled and Elle survived the birth only to later be absorbed by Aram; willingly sacrificing herself to save Jackie from his power-mad sister, Capris.Biography Birth  Jackie and Kirchneer allowed organic material from The Darkness to seep into their bodies and recast its characteristics into that of their own, using Jackie and Kirchner's biologies as a blueprint for Elle's. Upon leaving their bodies, this fertilized organic material matured into Elle.Sierra Mu\u00f1oz  Elle lived with Jackie and Kirchner in their church/labyrinth in Sierra Mu\u00f1oz. Kirchmer would monitor her vital signs each time she and Jackie would have sex and also taught her how to perfect and use her powers. When she tried to resist one of these tests, Kirchner would activate Fail-Safe Code: Medusa to relax her. After she became pregnant, Kirchner instructed her to use her powers to manipulate the Darklings in the room to dispose of Jackie, to which she reluctantly replied. Kirchner also discovered a means to accelerate her pregnancy. While Jackie was leading a team of American and Sierra Munoz marines through the labyrinth, Elle snuck away from Kirchner and met with Jackie to show him their baby. She saw the marines and became hostile. Jackie tried to calm her down but she proceeded to slaughter most of them until she found Marisol Yanez, whom Jackie had modelled Elle after. This gave enough time for Major White to shoot Elle and allow them to escape down the tunnel. She followed Jackie down, but was stopped when marine jeeps shined a spotlight on her. Kirchner found and took her to the lab to begin her labour. The Darkness began eating away inside her, much to Kirchner's shock. Kirchner tried to perform an Cesarian section, but stopped when he realized its futility. Elle apologized to Jackie before The Darkness, already an adult, burst free out of Elle, seemingly killing her.Elle's Return  Elle however survived The Darkness's birth and hid away from the authorities in the shadows of the labyrinth for months. She found both native and American soldiers, but she manged to stay away from them. She fled Sierra Munoz by stowing away on trains, going from one place to another and always finding shelter from the sun. After making her way to New York, she'd listen to rumors and leads toward Jackie's location. When she felt an upheaval in The Darkness, she sensed Jackie's presence and followed it. She found and saved Jackie from a horde of zombies created by The Darkness, unleashing packs of Darkling-like creatures whom she revealed to be her and Jackie's offspring, created from Jackie's seed that she had kept and fertilized within her from their many sexual encounters.Death  As Jackie and Elle made their way through the city, they were found by Aram, who gave Jackie the piece of hand armor that was crystallized by the Alkonost's tear. The building was then attacked by Jackie's clone and he and Elle jumped out as Elle summoned all her and Jackie's offspring. Jackie's clone killed all the offspring and set his sights on Jackie. After a marine helicopter is crashed on top of the clone and Jackie himself, Elle comforted and tended to Jackie as he walked out of the flames. Elle was swiftly sliced in half by Jackie's sister, Capris. As she died, she urged Aram to use her last bit of The Darkness's strength to help Jackie. He did as he was told and touched Elle's hand, disintegrating her to dust.Personality  Elle was created to serve a singular purpose; to fulfill Jackie's sexual desire. As such, she was devoted to him; imprinted unto him as his companion. Her only weakness being her naivety; particular her susceptibility to Kirchner's painful experiments on her to ensure conception.Powers & Abilities Powers Trivia Game Characters  All characters from The Darkness games.Darkness Guns  The Darkness Guns is a power featured in The Darkness.Overview The Darkness  The third power you gain in The Darkness is a set of Guns created to help the wielder control the Darkness. The Darkness guns act as something like infinite-ammo weapons that draw upon your Darkness Energy instead of physical ammo. There are two of them, both shaped like pistols: the one on the right will fire small bolts of darkness, and acts like an SMG, while the one on the left will fire something similar to a sonic boom and kill most enemies on impact and damaging everything in a small area. The Darkness Guns are notable for being capable of permanently killing the undead enemies in the World War I sequences in the game; killing them with other weapons will allow them to eventually come back to life until Jackie devours their heart. While using this power, the Demon Heads glow green. The guns are obtained from the Crucified in the Otherworld Hills.The Darkness II  The Darkness Guns don't return in the The Darkness II. Instead they're replaced by a new ability called Gun Channelling.Aunt Sarah  Aunt Sarah is a relative of Jackie Estacado and a side character in both The Darkness and The Darkness II.Biography The Darkness  Aunt Sarah's house was used in the game for a shoot out scene. She calls Jackie up after being attacked by Paulie's men. Jackie goes to her house and finds her, Butcher Joyce, Jimmy \"The Grape\" and some war survivors. Jackie and the group eliminate all of Paulie's men. None of them were hurt. Aunt Sarah then thanks Jackie for his help. Just before Jackie leaves, Sarah and Jimmy \ufeffoffer Jackie the position of don of the Franchetti Crime Family with the backing of the Chicago crime families, which Jackie accepts. Butcher then gives him information about where Paulie is staying, which results in the death of Paulie and all his followers. Jackie then assumes the role of Don with Aunt Sarah acting as his counsel.The Darkness II  Since Jackie became don of the Franchetti family, Aunt Sarah watched Jackie rise to the top of the Mafia ladder. However, she also watched him become depressed over the loss of Jenny and obsessive over her memory. This worried her greatly. When The Brotherhood took over the mansion, Victor Valente threatened to kill her if Jackie didn't willingly reliquish The Darkness. When Jackie is trying to to take the mansion back, a Brotherhood soldier shoots Jackie and Aunt Sarah was devastated. She promises Jackie that he will come back and take his revenge, until Bragg grabs her and brutally stabs her to death as Jackie watches in anger and sadness. At her funeral, Jackie is attacked by The Brotherhood and Bragg. After the firefight in the funeral, the enraged Jackie avenges his beloved Aunt Sarah by using his Darkness heads to rip open Bragg's chest and ripping his heart out with his bare hand with no remorse.Personality  At her youth Aunt Sarah was a beautiful young socialite who happened to fall in love with Jimmy Franchetti, the first big daddy of the Franchetti Crime Family. Sarah was a true Southern Belle, as honest and proper in her ways as the day is long. She would pretend to ignore Jimmy's racket as he would pretend to be a legitimate businessman. Jimmy died over thirty years ago and she was heartbroken. Aunt Sarah provides safe haven for Jackie when he is in trouble. Jackie really loves Aunt Sarah and she deserves a lot of respect because when things were run right, she was there at Jimmy's side. She wants everyone to just get along so Jackie doesn't tell her everything.Trivia Demon Arm  Demon Arm is a power of The Darkness. This power spawns a tentacle from Jackie to impale and lift targets. It can be used to remove, lift, interact with, and toss things such as debris, furniture, and vehicles, as well as break street lamps to create Darkness.Overview The Darkness  Jackie Estacado obtains this power after consuming the heart of one of the german undead soldiers in The Otherworld. It is a very efficient ability, being able to kill enemies instantly, remove any movable objects (this may include cars at higher levels) and destroying light sources, while costing almost no Dark Energy. The Demon Arm has a certain level of auto-aim, automatically impaling the nearest thing to the crosshairs available at that moment. While using this ability, Demon Heads will have a red glow.The Darkness II  The Demon Arm did not make a return in The Darkness II, now being replaced by the right serpent head being used in slashing motions, though lacking the insta-kill capacity, it now stuns enemies and can be used with more flexibility.Darkling (Comics)  A Darkling is a creature which serves as an agent of the Darkness and servant of its vessel. Created as lesser beings in the likeness of their makers, Darklings possess their own collective consciousness; beholden to the will of their wielder but ultimately sworn to the Darkness. Created to be the antithesis of the ordered Angelus Warriors, Darklings come in many shapes and sizes with varying degrees of strength and intelligence; the two most common forms being that of an imp-like demon creature as well as fanged tendrils with various serpentine features. Despite their allegiance to their wielder, Darklings do possess a will of their own; driven by the innermost desire of the Darkness itself to be free of any human vessel. To this end, Darklings have defied their hosts in the past; usually only to be brought to heel later in time.History First Generation  Fashioned into being some time after the Big Bang, the first generation of Darklings served as soldiers for the Darkness - fighting on the front lines against the winged legions of the Angelus's first host of Warriors as the whole of the universe took form around their conflicts.Characteristics  The Darklings as a whole serve as emissaries of the vessel of the Darkness. It is their instinctive imperative to tutor and guard the wielder in how to use their abilities as well as to direct them in serving the ultimate will of the Darkness itself - to spread chaos in Creation.Evolution  Darklings are a reflection of the mental strength of their master as well as their energies. Wielders with a strong will manifest potent Darklings, while those of weak will manifest Darklings either too weak to be of use or the wielder is overwhelmed by the power of the Darkness. As the wielder becomes more experienced with the Darkness and the summoning of Darklings, the Darklings themselves become more accustomed and familiar with their wielder. As the wielder invests more energy and time into mastering the Darklings, they begin to evolve in appearance. In addition to their change in appearance and musclemass, evolved Darklings become overall faster, stronger, more efficient predators. The more goblin-like Darklings manifest as bipedal humanoids with human-like torsos and heads while retaining their fangs and talons for hunting. In contrast to their smaller brethren, the more serpentine or hydra-like Darklings will evolve into massive, draconian beasts with human-sized mouths and several tendrils surrounding their bodies.

Known as the Daughter of Dracula to those who know her origin, Eva Tepes is the only child of Vlad the Impaler and his wife; born after her mother committed suicide and kept alive by her father and the demon Belial. Having been born of death and with the blood of Dracula strong within her veins, Eva is a dhampir; exhibiting the strength and immortality of a vampire, but with no bloodlust\u00a0 - save for her sensitivity to corrupt influences and the ominous presence of both her father and Belial.Biography Daughter of Dracula  Eva saved a girl on a subway train from being assaulted by a Werewolf. Before she could kill the Werewolf, he offered her information about a ritual that he had heard about in exchange for his life. this information led her to a warehouse where The Brotherhood of Darkness was based. There she encountered Count Von Orlok who tried to use a Latin occult ritual to summon The Darkness from Jackie Estacado and kill Eva. Eva however shot and killed Orlok through the heart with a wooden crossbow bolt before the ritual could be complete. After learning about The Darkness and Jackie from a surviving Brotherhood monk, Orlok's texts, and a newspapers and police files, she made her way out to find and kill him.  She first met Jackie at a bar full of Vampires and Werewolves, whom she proceeded to slaughter with ease after allowing Jackie to go. After she was done and before she staked him, Jimmy asked about Jackie and Eva realized who he was talking about. She tracked Jackie to his apartment and prepared to attack with intent to kill him. She overpowered him with ease and Jackie was forced to close the windows and unleash The Darkness. However because of Orlok's incomplete ritual, Jackie was unable to control The Darkness and Orlok's presence manifested instead and tried to kill Eva again as Jackie was losing strength.

She found herself in Judecca, the ninth circle of Hell. She was taunted by a Demon who told her that she worked for him all along. She dismissed his boasts and managed to bring herself back to life.Personality  Raised by monks to be an instrument of light, Eva was indoctrinated with a seething hatred of all things evil. Vampires, werewolves, witches, and demons are all but agents of the Devil, while the humans who serve them are merely misguided fools destined to burn in Hell with them. Living a secluded life, Eva knows little of the full nature of the world beyond the belief that all things are under God's domain and thus all evil is doomed to fail. This indignation is rooted in her hatred of her father as well as her own dark nature and the loss of her mother.Powers & Abilities Powers Abilities Weaknesses Jimmy the Grape (Games)  Jimmy \"The Grape\" is a close business friend of Jackie Estacado and an old school associate of the Franchetti crime family.Biography The Darkness  He stays at the subway station most of the time in The Darkness.

This is in no shape or form a pop album. This album is not something you can really get into, but more like really get out of. I say that with confidence. It\u2019s not for the fact that I\u2019m becoming anti-pop or that that I\u2019m now trying to not have a commercial album. It\u2019s simply just not a pop album. The idea at first was to create a dance album, but I scrapped it, simply because I changed my mind. I felt that this album is much more than some dance album. It goes way beyond that. I'm not indicating that it's still a dance album. You can dance to a beat, but you cannot dance to this. You have to sit down and think it through The biggest challenge in this album was going inside my head, and portraying exactly what I was thinking. I think that\u2019s the challenge that everyone experiences, period. But this piece of art is complex, because it\u2019s not delusional and you quickly become disgusted by it. So basically my mind is placed under a microscope. My thoughts\u2026.. I don\u2019t expect anyone to relate to it. It\u2019s almost like a trip through yourself, through myself.\" \"Dying in the Airwaves\", the album's lead single, went #1 on both the Digital Songs/Airplay Charts.

It's all in her voice\u2014a superhuman instrument capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.

Hope this helps. Bye. I've tried to enter the forum and the official site today and yesterday and nothing. I'm not sure is everything gonna return to normal...cause Carl has even deleted his myspace. - Incvisition Seems like I have to return to \"Rockstar ate my hamster\" (or was it \"hedgehog\"?) - DerKork 13:15, 16 November 2008 (UTC) I feel Carl should of warned us and asked if anyone could take it over. Hell, I would of convinced my parents to buy it over...but hey, I got this one game that just started and I been playing on it. The owner there actually listens to you and does what you ask. (most of the time). Anyone want the link?ER123 This sucks yall. i wish we could create our own music RPG Daphneaguilera 19:11, 16 November 2008 (UTC) I hacked the game and did this! Newguy does not equal Nimrod because this is Nimrod, well in this case Newguy does equal me, but I'd never say something that stupid, anyway I don't have a wiki because I didn't feel like making one, and my bro saved his password on our computer so I came on to say hi couldn't hack the game. Whatever. what a liar. hey fuck you alright, see I made a page, if you were smart you'd notice my brother and I don't even act the same. And everyone else knows I'm not lying so I really don't give a shit what you say. Anyway it sucks the game is down, but a roleplay board isn't too hard to make is it? We could make our own. Also, I have some time and want to make a wiki so anyone got the formula thingies? No, fuck you asshole. Fuck you, who are you even? You guys are real mature. i pray the game comes back!!! This is crazy. Is it ever going to come back?\u00a0:( 04:34, 19 November 2008 (UTC) Maybe Carl did it and got sick of managing Carl could have sold that domain, but according to my information (aka Whois) Carl still owns the domain until Feb. -DerKork 10:36, 20 November 2008 (UTC) Come play my game, I need more users. It will be quite fun when it gets going. I also hope the game (as in, real TRSG) gets working soon! I think the zigire.net servers are just down .... Bikz 21:17, 23 November 2008 (UTC) So zigire.net is the server for The Rockstar Game? is it Carl's personal server or a hosting service? Daphneaguilera 03:30, 25 November 2008 (UTC) All of Carl's sites are down, not just TRSG. Which means that it's probably Carl's server (zigire.net). Bikz 11:37, 25 November 2008 (UTC) I've already given up faith. I don't think it's coming back. Oh, I think it will. I don't think this is v4, it's some servers down, simple as that, but it'll probably come back. It's been going away and coming back for years now. -Bikz 18:57, 26 November 2008 (UTC) (that's no reason not to give TBSG a go though!) I hope it comes back. This are most suckiest\u00a0:'( Laurelles It's OK. I'm sure the game will come back up soon! It's sad that it's been down for this long, and I wish Carl would take this a little seriously. I'm disappointed that he's not as passionate about his creation as the rest of us are. Either way, when I come back, I'll bring Yumi back with me. I've got a whole story on it ready to go. And to those of who you competed in NaNoWriMo this year and won, I hope to see your books right alongside mine on shelves and in print this coming summer! I'm hoping we'll be back up soon... I have big changes for Yumi. Her new album needs to get released, and the songs need to keep going! Jdpeterson 21:01, 12 December 2008 (UTC) Omg!Its Tisha, I can't believe this. I hope it comes back. I wish I had enough money to help or create a site. But how can Zigre's server get back up! I hope it will come back on! I have an idea. Maybe we should continue our \"careers\" on the wiki, WITHOUT the game. I just thinking...maybe that way there will still be roleplaying involved. Just saying. Just a thought. I hate Carl for doing this! -- _Python_/David/ER123 I was just looking to make my comeback and now this happens- SKELEToN MaN SKELEToN MaN, when you said you were leaving, you said you weren't going to return.\u00a0:D Everyone should join Bikki's site.. -- _Python_/David/ER123 domain name was renewed a few days ago - according to www.iwhois.comRockstar Game Will Return...  Check the web site; it says that RSG will return!! I had sent an e-mail to Carl not too long ago asking him to bring it back up because the game gave so many of us a home and helped some of us cope with our own personal situations. We had a bright community and a lot of die-hard fans and people we all became close friends with through our role-playing and the like. What bringing it down ultimately proved was that even enemies on RSG came together and were upset over losing it. Some of us got mad at the people who didn't come together with the rest of us. We all had one thing in common: we love RSG. When RSG will return is up to our friend and creator, but the fact that the show is not over can give us all some hope that tomorrow we'll start up our computers and have to create new artwork for a single or album. It gives us hope that Aerospliff will remain one of the greatest rock bands, Yumi will continue to reign as the Queen of J-Pop, Averex will keep churning out chart-topping hits, GirlSpice will blow away their competition as the Queens of Pop, Fathom will continue to rock our hearts out and tear up our eyes, and last, but not least, Emma Brighton will be crowned the Queen of the Ballad and release the follow-up to her critically praised Child Running Through The Storm. Much love to all of you, and I'll see you on the other side soon, Jdpeterson 23:15, 9 February 2009 (UTC) (Creator of Yumi, Emma Brighton, & Dojo)ITS BACK!

She debuted onto the music scene with her Debut Naughty Baby Did A No-No and has since become one of the most successful pop acts in the music industry today.History  Daphne is the proud daughter of Janet and Mike Aguilera. Janet is the older sister of Cristina's mother Erin. After being born, Daphne's parents were vicious stage parents, forcing Daphne to sing up to 4 hours a day under harsh conditions. They had dreams of Daphne becoming a star and would stop at nothing to have this dream realized. At the age of 7 months, Daphne was already appearing in commercials and modeling for baby clothes. As she grew older, the treatment that she got from her parents grew harsher. They forced her to live in a basement to prep her for world domination, making her watch MTV 8 hours a day, undergo physical reconstruction, as well as follow a strict diet regimen provided by the family's nutrition expert. All of this took a toll on Daphne, making her unable to bear child, which both Janet and Mike conspired to have her do for a publicity stunt when Christina was entering the foray of music. Once Daphne became a lethal force in the industry, she cut ties with her parents, effectively becoming a free girl at age 16. As of now, her parents have moved on to other things. Her father Mike is currently institutionalized at a mental asylum and mother Janet is a prostitute on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Daphne has no siblings, although considers Christina to be her sister. A rumor surfaced in late 2008 that Daphne indeed has another cousin named Frutina Aguilera, but these rumors we're quickly denied by Daphne's camp.Music Career  Daphne began her music career in mid-2006, shortly after her 16th birthday. With blessings from her cousin Christina Aguilera, Daphne recorded some demo tracks in Los Angeles, California, 3 of which were included on her album Spank For The Mammaries. After recording the demos, Daphne went in search for record labels to sign with. After being turned down from RCA Records, Christina's current label, Daphne quit searching and went into a deep state of depression for 3 days. After receiving some counseling, she set out again in search for a record company to release her material on. She decided to post a racy ad on the internet and was shortly contacted by Dolores Hamilton Records to sign with their company. A one-album deal was quickly struck between the two and Daphne released her debut, Naughty Baby Did A No-No to the masses. The single was considered a flop with a dismal 53,000 copies sold. Daphne yet again retreated into herself, cutting off contact with the world. Delores Hamilton, along with a few of her artists nurtured Daphne out of the shadows and convinced her to release a 2nd single. The song Don't Hate Me Because I'm Beautiful (Bitch) was thus born. The title for the song came from DH herself, after hearing Daphne use the phrase while lashing out at her Undercover Haters. This single did a bit better, selling around 130,000+ copies and gave her her 1st chart position on the U.S. Singles chart. She soon released her debut album and thus the Daphne brand was born. 2 more singles was released from the album, which sold more than her previous singles. Daphne paired up with music veteran Zulema to go on tour with her in the U.S. and UK. The tour 2 Hot Girls On A Hot Summer Night World Tour was a huge success, becoming Daphne's 1st sold-out tour. Each girls performed a short setlist as well as sung 2 songs together.The Diamond Era  Shortly after releasing her debut album, Daphne quickly began working on her 2nd album Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend. She wanted to depart from her teen pop image and go with a more racy, mature theme for the record. Delores Hamilton wasn't very happy with the change so soon and wanted Daphne to milk the hell out of her teen crowd, but Daphne insisted on the change of image. Their differences soon escalated and thus Daphne decided she couldn't take Delores's controlling ways anymore as they reminded her of her parents. Daphne decided to leave DH Records and start her own label.Skank-A-Licious Records  In Septmeber of 2006, Daphne decided to break ties with DH Records and set out to start her own label. With the help of June Mushroom, she began Skank-A-Licious Records. The label was founded upon the promise that it would give all its artists equal attention and do what it took to make them a success. Soon after SAL Records was formed, artists of all kinds flocked over to join its roster, including Jack Tripper's Wardrobe, The Kid, Paris Zanderlight, Jessica, and Lizzie Crunch. Skank-A-Licious records is also most know for its highly successful compilations Skanky Love! Vol.1 & Skanky Love! Vol.2. The albums featured songs from all of the SAL artist roster and has generated tons of revenue for the label. As time progressed, Skank-A-Licous records lost contacted with its artists and Daphne soon decided that the label will be exclusive for her only and that no other artists will be signed at this time. As of September, 2008 the ban still remains.June Mushroom  June Rose Portabello Mushroom was Daphne's publicist for a brief period in 2006. She handled much of Daphne's public affairs as well as provided much needed friendship for Daphne. While she was excellent at her job, June proved to be problematic for Miss. Aguilera. June was secretly harboring sexual feeling for Daphne and in September of '06, those feels erupted. Daphne started receiving unmarked notes from Mushroom claiming that they were meant for each other. Daphne wasn't aware these notes were from Mushroom at the time, but thought they were from an obsessed fan she had an encounter with earlier in July. Aguilera sent her body guards to \"Deal\" with him. A short while later, the man was in a coma. Days later the letters started to pour in and Daphne soon learned that the letters were from Mushroom herself. Days after Daphne discovered June was behind the letters, Mushroom decided she had to kill Daphne. June setup a hit at Madison Square Gardens in New York where Daphne was to be during that time, but instead Paris Zanderlight was killed. June was seen fleeing from the scene and was shortly arrested after. She has been sentenced to life in prison without parole and is current serving out her sentence at a maximum security prison in California.Surgery  After receiving comments about her image and how she wasn't \"Top quality material\", Daphne decided to go under the knife and get a Full-Body Makeover, which included altering Daphne's entire body structure, head to toe. Daphne was of course strongly against this, however a few people in her inner-circle convinced her it was best for her career. Daphne enlisted the help of Dr. Konckemup, a top plastic surgeon, to do the procedure. Daphne spent a total of 33 hours in the operation room over a span of 5 days. The Operation is reported to have cost Daphne over $50,000,000, which was paid off from various sources, including donations from fans, her cousin Christina, and funds from her label as well as from fellow artists. After maintaining her new appearance for roughly 2 years, Daphne decided to go under the knife once again to do yet another full-body makeover too look Asian. The model for which she wanted to look was based on J-Pop star NaNa Ammuro. She was quoted saying she got bored and tired of her new look and wanted a change. After doing a 2nd full-body procedure, She received negative feedback from all angles, including loyal fans, who were very upset at her new appearance. In responce to this, Daphne decided to go back to her original appearance before the 2nd surgery. The stress to her body during these surgeries was minimal due to improvements in the science of how the operation is performed. She was able to return to full capacity with 2 days after both operations.Trivia Discography Albums Tours DVDs  2 Hot Girls On A Hot Summer Night World Tour Live\nThe SEX Tour - Live At The Tokyo Dome\nDaphne's European Club TourYumi Takahashi discography  This is the discography of Japanese pop singer, Yumi Takahashi.Discography Singles  two weeks at number one.Hollywood Zombie Hollywood Zombie  Hollywood Zombie started out as Bang!

At first it was just him with protools jotting down ideas then came time to hire some members. Katie Johnson A.K.A. Katie Zombie through a local musicians ad. She was in a local band called \"Suicide Angels\" As soon as she came and tried out it was an instant match. Soon after dating for a year they got married which that only lasted 6 months. Since then Katie moved on with other bands And Bobby kept going with Hollywood Zombie. But it wasn't the same without Katie. After a two year away they got back together and started dating and making music again. She also switches back from band to band (Suicide Party, POPSTAR!) Shanessa & Paris Zombie- Well besides Bobby These two are the second longest members, They have been on many albums and side project of Bobby's. They hail from the now disbanded all girl group GirlSpice When they were kicked out, Bobby headed to meet with them, They learned fast from switching from pop - Metal. Now it seems like they will never quit. Murder Vengeance AKA Murder Suicide - Is the newest member. He was hired by Suicide Party to be the vocalist. And when Suicide Party wasn't doing anything Bobby offered him a chance to be the guitar/vocalist. he also switches back and forth from band to band (Suicide Party,POPSTAR!) Bobby And Him Have Been Friends for a long time.Declining  It seemed like Hollywood Zombie went through member after member, only Bobby & Katie remained as the only stable members. Each album Featured new members. They kept changing sounds also for each album, going from Metal - POP. It was a disaster. People got bored and the band went downhill. In 2007 in an interview with Rolling Stone bobby said this \" We change our sounds so we don't get bored, But we changed them so much that this band isn't even fun anymore\" as 2008 approached they released a couple more albums which seemed to take them longer each time to record. Fights and break ups were often and An ex band member said this \" It was a fucked band, bobby zombie pissed everyone off\" They bounced from record label to record label. If you ask anyone who was in this band with Bobby Zombie how he was, they would tell you the same\" He was a fucking douche who wanted everything his way\". By the summer of 2008 the band was at it's worst. Signed to a shitty record label with no backing and albums thrown together. They went their separate ways and Hollywood Zombie was dead.Life After Hollywood Zombie...Toyko POPSTAR!  After Katie left for good, Bobby started working on a side project known as \"Tokyo POPSTAR!\" it was an attempt at the POP genre. He had a lot of famous Pop stars help him out but nothing came of the project. It only featured him on the \"Confessions Of A Love Junkie\" Album. and for the second and finalTokyo POPSTAR! album he enlisted the help of ex Girlspice members Shanessa And Paris and they created \"Fuck The American Dream\" it was the heaviest album that they ever did, it was pulled off the shelves just after 2 days. That led to the breakup of the band, The label fucked them over so that was the end for them. But In 2009 Bobby Got Tokyo POPSTAR! back together and changed the name to POPSTAR!Suicide Party  One day Bobby got an email from someone named Murder Vengeance. He was the lead singer of a grindcore band called Suicide Party. He had tried everyone and decided to try Bobby since he was a legend. Bobby took a liking to the band and help them record a second record when all the other members left. Paris and Shanessa also joined liking the styles of the band, they released 2 more album before deciding to call it a day. They released \"Free Abortions And Sex Changes From Ray Charles\" And \"Is Dead.... November 12th they announced a new album would be released December 1st. It will be called \"Her Fist Felt Like A Kiss\" it will be their last album for awhile.

New album to be announced. ..Yumi  Yumi Hana (\u30cf\u30ca\u30e6\u30df) is a Japanese & English pop singer from Kyoto, Japan; and originally of Korean descent. She debuted in early 2007 with her first single C.O.L.O.R.S. and has since gone on to become the best-selling J-Pop singer of all time. She has recorded and released over 40 singles and 13 original albums; and recorded songs in Japanese, English, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, French, and Latin.\n\nOn March 1st, 2008, with the debut of HEART STATION on the World Chart, it was announced that Yumi had officially sold over 100 million records.Birth & Growing Up  Yumi was born to Yoko Hana and Kazu Hana on January 30th, 1987. Her family migrated to Japan in 1986 after Yoko discovered she was with child and Kazu, terrified that the Korean government would abort the pregnancy due to the population control crunch of the mid-80's, made immediate plans to bypass Yumi's life being taken. Once arriving in Japan, the family settled in a busy district of Kyoto, changed their names to mimic a more Japanese-rooted background, and soon gave birth to Yumi. Unlike most musicians, Yumi did not participate in school music classes. While growing up, she lived a very normal life, and had no interests in pursuing music as a career. When Yumi turned 16, she began experimenting with various sounds on her computer at home. Those sounds would lead her to release music independently until she was finally signed to Eventual Records in 2007.Independent Era Love & Honesty  In early 2007, Yumi released her Gold-selling debut album, Love & Honesty. The album yielded the three singles, C.O.L.O.R.S., BE ~eternity with you~, and her breakout single ~(W)~. The album would go on to sell 515,370 copies worldwide before exiting the charts. The album was heavily inspired by Yumi's past relationships. \"I've had plenty of rough times in and out of love,\" the singer stated in a press release. \"Love & Honesty showcases those emotions the best way I know how to express them.\"Bloom  Following the success of Love & Honesty, Yumi sought out a different direction for her first English album, and second original recording. Bloom, a Celtic and New Age-inspired album, became Yumi's first success as an English singer. The album would yield three singles: a cover of Tori Amos's Dragon, the World-drum infused Worldly, and Solace. The album would peak at #470 in the World Chart and go on to sell 1.4 million copies before exiting the charts.ULTRA  Yumi's return to J-Pop was sharp with her second J-Pop album, and third original recording. ULTRA was heavily directed by a change from the bubblegum-pop of Love & Honesty to a more adult-sounding structure. The album would yield only one single, the title track, but would go on to sell over 1.7 million copies before exiting the charts.Secret  In the summer of 2007, Yumi released her third J-Pop album, and fourth original recording. Secret would become Yumi's best-selling album at the time, shipping over 2 million units during its stay on the World Chart. The album only gave way to two singles: the Hikaru Utada cover of Kiss & Cry, Yumi's first million-selling single; and home to you ~+.Passion  Quickly following Secret, Yumi would release her last independent album before signing to Eventual Records. Passion became Yumi's most highly anticipated release of her early career. The album garnered critical praise from other musicians, and editor's gave the album a 92/100 rating (the highest of her career at that point). Passion yielded three very successful singles: Timespace, Passion, and BREEZE; all of which would sell over 1 million copies each. Passion, coupled with it's three singles would go on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide; and peak at #53 on the World Chart, becoming Yumi's first Top 100 album.Diva: A Classic  In late Summer 2007, rumors began swirling that Yumi would release her second English album. After two weeks of circulation, the rumors were confirmed by Yumi's management in a press release. Yumi's private recording label confirmed the release of an English recording the following week. Diva: A Classic was first rumored to be carrying the title of \"Diva: The Classics\", as announced by Yumi's management. Just weeks before the album was to be released, Eventual Records confirmed the official title to be \"Diva: A Classic\". The following week, Yumi announced the official release of Diva. Yumi's fans voted for the first official single from the album via a public Poll. An overwhelming majority supported the release of Oceans as the first single. Oceans would peak at #60 on the World Chart. A number of weeks later, following the release of Diva, fans were drawn in masses to record stores for Yumi's most successful single of her career to this point, Tu Quieres Volver. The single would be an international smash-hit and peak in the Top 30 on the World Chart.Diva: A Classic Silenced  While Yumi sailed on with the success of Diva: A Classic, her independent label pulled the plug on further promotion and single releases from the album. This greatly affected Yumi's respect for the recording label she founded, and the company went bankrupt shortly after Yumi filed suit to void her recording contract. Shortly after her split from the private label, the sales figures for Diva were announced at almost 3.9 million in sales, not including the sales of her 15th and 16th singles.Eventual Records & Talent Radar Era Pristine  Following Yumi's split from her private label, the singer released an announcement that she was seeking a new label to distribute her albums. Eventual Records picked up the artist in late Summer 2007. Within a few weeks, Yumi released her first B-Side's collection, Pristine. The album yielded no singles, but would go on to sell over 2.9 million copies worldwide.DELIGHTFUL  Following the success of Pristine, and a short hiatus from the music scene, Yumi made her most memorable comeback to the J-Pop music scene with DELIGHTFUL. The album would yield three successful singles for the singer, and solidify her as one of the biggest acts in modern Japanese Pop music. DELIGHTFUL peaked at #11 on the World Chart, and in the Top 10 in the UK, USA, Canada, Asia, and Europe. The album would go on to sell approximately 4,040,191 copies before exiting the charts. Preceding the release of DELIGHTFUL, Yumi released three singles: DELIGHTFUL, SORRY, and COLOUR; the latter being a Techno remake of her first single, C.O.L.O.R.S.. All three singles would sell over 1.5 million copies each before exiting the charts. With all figures combined, DELIGHTFUL would go on to sell over 9 million discs.Love Pieces & Love Stars  Following the massive success of DELIGHTFUL, Yumi felt the need to try things differently. With major success as a J-Pop singer supporting her next move, she ventured out into unknown territory as an artist. This would ultimately prove to be one of the most tumultuous periods of Yumi's career.  Love Pieces came as a shock, not only to her fans, but to her recording label, Eventual Records. The album quickly received support from LINO and the entire staff at the label, but they had yet to hear the album before it was released. A few singles were released from the album before it was sent to stores, but none caught on with listeners or at radio stations. According to statements from former employees, Yumi and Lino would argue constantly over the release dates and lack of communication between parties before decisions were finalized. Love Pieces would turn out to be a flop, peaking at #24 on the World Chart. It would sell strongly though, closing sales at almost 4 million. Unfortunately, the album exited the charts before crossing the famed \"4 Million Mark\" in shipments.  Not too long after the release of Love Pieces, Love Stars would be announced via press release. Once again, rumors circulated that Lino was extremely dissatisfied with the album, but would support the release whether it sold worse or better than Love Pieces. While the new album was a change of pace for Yumi, it contained the same flaws that had plagued her previous effort. With no real effective direction to the music, Yumi's Love Stars would flop worse than critics had expected. The album would sell 3.5 million copies; but peak at #87, barely within the Top 100 on the World Chart. Following Love Stars, it was announced that Yumi would take an indefinite break from the industry. While Lino and Eventual Records supported her decision fully, the label pushed for her comeback to be relentless. The pressure stressed Yumi, and she would announce her retirement one week later.Retirement & \"Headlines\"  Yumi announced her retirement from the music industry after resting for only two weeks. It was also announced that she would release one final single, Headlines, which she collaborated on with GirlSpice and Herr Fische, shortly. The single would prove to be a major success for Yumi, peaking at #31 on the World Chart, and going on to sell 1.7 million copies. The success of the single would provide the drive for Yumi to return from retirement several weeks later with her third English release.Songs From The West Coast  Following Yumi's first successful single in months, Headlines, the singer was inspired to reenter the studio and record her third English album, and tenth original recording. During this period of time, Yumi became re-infatuated with Elton John's Songs From The West Coast. Many tracks including Candle In The Wind and Dark Diamond were covered by Yumi for the release.  \"When I went back into the studio to record Songs From The West Coast, I had been listening to Elton John often. That sound and vibe ruled the majority of the album,\" the singer stated. \"It was what brought me back to my senses in music.\" The album was titled Songs From The West Coast as a homage to the influence of Elton's music on Yumi's lifestyle. She's stated in numerous interviews since the release that his music has, \"saved my life\". Mansfield was released on the same day as the album. The single propelled the album to #6 on the World Chart, becoming Yumi's first Top 10 album. Mansfield would also prove to be a successful release, peaking at #16 on the World Chart. As sales for the album came to a slow, Yumi quickly released the third single, and quoted as the \"most important single to be released\" in her career, Original Sin. Original Sin would not match the success of Headlines or Mansfield, but peak within the Top 40 on the World Chart. With the album and its singles selling over 9.3 million copies, Eventual Records' representatives released a statement that the singer had \"bounced back\", and that relations between Lino and Yumi had improved \"to an enormous extent\".Vespers & Ethnicity  Confusion arose over Yumi's next release, as many press releases were made announcing the album was a move towards an Experimental form of music; and that the record would be her fourth English album. Both would be dispelled weeks later. After Yumi's successful comeback in the English Pop market, and against announcements she made during the weeks before, she felt ready to tackle a comeback to Japanese Pop. Her eleventh original recording would prove to be one more flop for the singer. Vespers & Ethnicity was considered to be another setback for the singer who was struggling to recoup her holdings with Japanese fans worldwide. While the album would sell 6,000 more copies than her highly successful DELIGHTFUL, it was largely made up of several experimental songs and lyrics in many languages. The album did gain heavy ground for the singer in Arabic communities as it contained Bieinak (Never), her first Arabic recording. The singles Calligraph and Love Whispers proved to be failures for the singer, peaking at #59 and #51 on the World Chart respectively. Lino considered the album to be a one-off for the singer, stating that \"Yumi has grown so much since her last flops that it's difficult for us to view this as anything but a successful concept album. It's important to note that songs in the Experimental genre have never charted higher than Yumi's own releases. Either way, we at Eventual view it as an achievement.\"TRANSPARENCY  Following the flop of Vespers & Ethnicity, Yumi went on her longest hiatus since the beginning of her career. While many fellow artists were aware of her day-to-day activities, many fans were left without any information on her next release. This would prove to be a major advantage of Yumi's during the work on TRANSPARENCY. Yumi's first single from TRANSPARENCY was released to mediocre reviews. \u221e (infinity) would peak at #58 on the World Chart; and while largely considered a flop, it would pave the way for the four most successful singles of her career up to that point.  Following her mediocre reviews of \u221e (infinity), Yumi continued her ascent into Lo-Fi drums and special effects. As her songs became more complex recordings and productions, several demos were leaked to the internet for responses. Fans were incredibly shocked at Yumi's abilities as a producer and composer, and her first Symphonic Metal song, DECISION would garner critical praise for its production qualities. DECISION would peak at #19 on the World Chart and at #5 in the USA and South America, becoming a major success overnight. The single would go on to become her highest selling single up to that point with 1,778,495 copies sold before exiting the charts. On the heels of the peak of her career, Yumi followed up DECISION with another success: talkin' 2 yourself, another Symphonic Metal track about solitude. talkin' 2 yourself would peak at #31, failing to match the success of DECISION, but the chart peaks were heavily affected by the 5 week difference in releases from DECISION and talkin' 2 yourself. Eventual Records considered the single a massive success, and later stated that Yumi was \"our second-best artist on the label\". After the success of talkin 2 yourself, Yumi would wait 6 weeks before releasing the third single, and third massively successful single from the upcoming album: what would become the title track, TRANSPARENCY. TRANSPARENCY would peak at #24, only five positions lower than DECISION, and go on to sell 1,719,991 copies before exiting the charts.  Just a few weeks later, Yumi announced in a press release the track listing, and title of her upcoming album as TRANSPARENCY. On the official release evening, Yumi released the fifth single from TRANSPARENCY, HERO. HERO would become Yumi's most recognized song of her career, peaking at #3 on the World Chart, in the Top 5 in five of the major continents, and at #9 in Asia. HERO, without question, marked the debut of the Queen of J-Pop as a solidified Diva in music. TRANSPARENCY itself would prove to be Yumi's most successful album up to that point in her career. The album peaked at #5 on the World Chart, #6 in Australia & New Zealand, #7 in Canada, #10 in the UK and USA, and #12 in Asia. The album would eventually go on to sell over 4.28 million copies before exiting the charts. TRANSPARENCY and its singles would become Yumi's highest selling effort since the inception of her career. Together, the total sales figures were over 12.9 million discs. Soon after the release of TRANSPARENCY, it was announced by Eventual Records that the label would be closing. This greatly upset Yumi, and she vowed to continue using the label's logo on every album regardless of it closing. Eventually, Lino and Yumi agreed to sign a new recording contract with Lino's new label Talent Radar Entertainment. The move would prove to be a big step for Yumi, as Talent Radar catered only to best-selling artists worldwide. Following the news of fellow Japanese singer, Yumi Takahashi's move from Eventual Records to Alpha Omega Records, Yumi released a statement that she was, \"seriously upset. This is a close friend of mine, and working with her now has become more difficult. If I knew she either did not qualify for Talent Radar's roster, was not invited to join, or refused to sign, I probably would have left the label, too.\"DISTANCE  On January 12th, 2008 a newspaper article appeared in which it was stated that an anonymous source close to Yumi had confirmed an upcoming single entitled LOVE NOTES. The single would later be confirmed by Yumi in a press release. LOVE NOTES featured prominent Japanese singer Hitomi Hayashi, and would become Yumi's best-selling single to date. The single would peak at #6 on the World Chart, #3 in The USA and Canada, #4 in Asia, and #8 in South America; it would also go on to sell over 1.78 million copies. Hitomi Hayashi later stated after the single was released that her and Yumi could not have failed to reach the Top 10. This momentarily sparked controversy for Yumi when she stated on national television that her and Hitomi deserve to peak in the Top 10 because their fans owe it to them for the hard work. The effect of this was seen on Yumi's 38th single, fade Away / Pandora, which peaked at #38 on the World Chart and would sell 90,000 copies less than LOVE NOTES before exiting the charts. After a sincere apology by Yumi via a press release, she announced her next single as passionate battle / Opaque (Interlude). The single made history as the first Double A-Side to include an interlude as a featured track. passionate battle was recorded with Death Awakening after Yumi was contacted by the band's management. The single would see much better success than fade Away / Pandora, peaking at #3 on the World Chart, #2 in the USA and South America, #4 in the UK and Asia, and at #9 in Canada. passionate battle would become Yumi's third Symphonic Metal track to peak within the Top 40 on the World Chart.  On February 14th, 2008, Yumi performed in a surprise performance at the IMA's after party. There she performed the two songs which would become her next single release, \u5fc3\u81d3 (Heart) / \u30a8\u30bf\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3 (Eternity). After the performance, Yumi announced the release of \u5fc3\u81d3 (Heart) / \u30a8\u30bf\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3 (Eternity) as the next single, and declared that her 10th J-Pop album would be titled DISTANCE. On February 16th, 2008, \u5fc3\u81d3 (Heart) / \u30a8\u30bf\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3 (Eternity) was released. The single peaked at #42 on the World Chart, proving to be a flop, but would continue to sell well, moving 1.6 million copies by its 11th week on the charts. On February 23rd, 2008, DISTANCE, the 10th original J-Pop album and 13th original recording from Yumi, was released. The album would debut at #6 on the World Chart in its first week, but claim the #1 position in its second week, alongside the release of DISTANCE ~ \u5371\u967a\u306a\u611b (Dangerous Love) ~. As of its 9th week on the charts, DISTANCE has yet to leave the Top 100 on the World Chart, and has gone on to sell almost 1.9 million copies.  DISTANCE was considered by critics to be a brave departure for the singer. Yumi was perceived to have ventured into a more alternative J-Pop sound. Many critics noted that the album showed extreme signs of maturity, and that older fans would definitely flock to record stores to purchase the album- some more than the younger fans. With DISTANCE's high debuts and consistent holdings in the Top 40, Yumi would celebrate with close friends in Kyoto, Japan with a B-Side's Party. At the party, many B-Sides from her recording sessions with DISTANCE were heard. DISTANCE ~ \u5371\u967a\u306a\u611b (Dangerous Love) ~ would peak at #9 on the World Chart, and help propel the album to the top spot in its second week. The single itself also proved successful, and by its third week had shipped just under 700,000 copies. Also on February 27th, 2008, Yumi expressed concern that Talent Radar was not as focused on her work as they were on other artists. Yumi noted that DISTANCE is her first #1 album of her career, and Talent Radar did not mention the achievement in any press release, but did mention new releases by other artists, and their charting positions. This caused an uproar among fans in Asia who accused Talent Radar of not supporting their Japanese artists by losing Yumi Takahashi to Alpha Omega Records and not providing the same press efforts as other artists on their roster receive. HEART STATION, the sixth single from DISTANCE and 43rd overall, was released into stores on February 30th, 2008. In its first week on the charts, HEART STATION peaked at #19 on the World Chart and sold over 233,000 copies. \u8679\u8272 Drops (Rainbow-Colored Drops) was released on March 13th, 2008, and peaked at #31 on the World Chart, becoming Yumi's 6th Top 40 single from DISTANCE, and 8th overall. Along with the release of \u8679\u8272 Drops, it was announced that DISTANCE and all of its singles have combined sales of over 15 million.Diva: A Requiem  On March 20th, 2008, it was announced that Yumi would release the follow up to her multi-platinum selling Diva: A Classic. The new album would include 8 new songs and 2 interludes. The second interlude, entitled Wind, was previously released on Yumi's 44th single, \u8679\u8272 Drops (Rainbow-Colored Drops). On March 23rd, 2008, Serenade was released as the first single from Diva: A Requiem. The single would peak at #17 on the World Chart and go on to become Yumi's 8th Top 20 single, and 17th Top 40 single. April 2nd, 2008 marked the announcement of Diva: A Requiem's release. The album would be available in CD, Digital Download, 5.1 Surround, Vinyl, and Audio Cassette starting April 3rd, 2008. Coinciding with the release, Yumi will release the second single from Diva: A Requiem on the same week. The second single was announced as Now We Are Free, a cover of the theme song from the movie Gladiator. On April 2nd, 2008, Yumi also announced that she would support Diva: A Requiem with a 21 date world tour the week of the album's release. She is expected to perform 3 gigs in each of the seven major continents. On April 7th, 2008, Yumi announced her departure from Talent Radar Entertainment. Along with the press release, it was announced that she was accepting offers from major labels within 2 weeks preceding the release of her next English-language single. Following the announcement, Yumi's management confirmed her signing with J-STAR Records, a label founded by fellow Japanese singer Hitomi Hayashi. On April 18th, 2008, Yumi was dropped from TALENT RADAR ENTERTAINMENT and J-STAR Records by a mutual decision between her and both labels. Reasons for the removal of Yumi from the rosters were not given, and details have not been announced by the singer or either of the record labels. Little more than a week later, Yumi resigned with TALENT RADAR ENTERTAINMENT in a closed contract.Labyrinth  Yumi also announced the release of her 48th single, LOVE PARADOX, on April 8th, 2008. The return to Japanese Pop was a surprise to much of the music community, as all promotional efforts for Diva: A Requiem were halted, much like the original efforts on Diva: A Classic. As of the April 9th, 2008 World Chart, Yumi's LOVE PARADOX has become her 19th Top 40 single, debuting at #35 on the chart. Yumi stated in a press release that she was, \"surprised that the single debuted so high considering the drastic differences between LOVE PARADOX and [her] former singles.\"  Yumi subsequently announced the release of her 49th single, to be titled FUSION c/w 90s 00s 10s. On April 10th, 2008, the cover for the new single was released, along with a track listing for both the CD and CD+DVD versions. The projected release date has been projected for April 13th, 2008. After a small stint in rehab after being found on the streets of New York City with a blood alcohol level of 3.8, Yumi was released without public awareness on April 22nd, 2008. The singer would tour during her first week out then subsequently announce her 16th album will be titled Diamond, and her 50th single will be called Devil Recognizes You. The single and album were later confirmed by the release of cover artwork for the album. Rumors have been circulating largely about the material on Yumi's upcoming album. Critics have stated that the singer's turn to songs about sex and romance are a stark difference compared to her previous material. They furthermore stated that the singer would probably top the charts with her forthcoming release, but would fail to maintain the same audience that has driven her to the top of the charts.Awards  Nominations:Hayley Williams  Hayley Williams, born October 29th, 1985, is a British musician, who fronts popular Pop-Punk band My Freaky Valentine. Williams grew up in a musical household, and her father would frequently play bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, causing the young Hayley Williams took interest in music at an early age. When she was 13, her parents enrolled her for singing lessons, which turned out to be successful for her. Williams promptly took up guitar at the age of 15, and went onto play in numerous school bands, at one point crossing paths with Lewis Mason (My Freaky Valentine, Drums/Vocals), who was playing Bass and fronting his school band, The Modern Myth. Williams stayed with Mason and his band for two EP releases and a short stint of gigs before they called it quits. Williams left school and enrolled at Leamington Music College, whereas Mason went on to study Art and Graphics at Rugby College. At college, Williams studied Music Tech, and the inspired girl soon found herself funding and building her own studio in her basement, all by the age of 18. From there, she also self-taught herself drums, to enable her to record musical ideas solely by herself, as a one-woman band. Williams' name was on the Coventry circuit after playing in numerous local bands, such as Glass House Riot, Dear Whoever Dance Forever, and The Saturn Dolls, and she had another chance encounter with Mason at local show for rising stars stars Shy Child. The two immediately hit it off with similar influences, and promptly formed the blueprints for what would be My Freaky Valentine. Williams has also played a couple of low-key solo acoustic shows herself, and her own material does exist, though there are no current plans to record.Hitomi Hayashi  Hitomi Hayashi (\u6797\u4ec1\u7f8e Hayashi Hitomi*) born May 12, 1984 in Saitama, Saitama Prefecture, Japan), is a Japanese singer who rose to prominence as a CM model in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Later that year, she embarked on a 32-city tour in Japan and Taiwan, well surpassing her mark for ticket sales.

The tour sold out all dates across Japan, a first for Hitomi Hayashi. In May, a statement from Hayashi's distributor J-STAR Asia announced that Hitomi was working on a fourth studio album entitled love: undercover, set for a mid-summer release. The forthcoming release of the album was delayed due to Hayashi's growing health concerns and hospitilization. The album finally released in September, and climbed to number six on Japan's Oricon charts. In early November 2009, Hitomi Hayashi appeared at Tokyo's J-Records in Shinjuku, where she announced that her next album, entitled Chakra had started production, and that it would be Hayashi's English Language album debut.Health Concerns  On the late evening on August 11th, 2009, Hitomi Hayashi was rushed to Tokyo's Metropolitan Ohkubo Hospital in serious condition after suffering from shock due to Severe Hypercalcemia. Hayashi has a history of Hypercalcemia, a condition resulting from increased calcium levels in the blood. A day later, on August 12th, Hayashi remained in serious yet favorable condition. On August 18th, in the latest press conference by Hayashi's manager Makoto Irino, it was announced that Hitomi was scheduled to be released from the hospital by the end of that week.Discography Collections  In 2008, Hitomi Hayashi is scheduled to release at least two compilation albums.Electric Roses  Electric Roses is a Birdie-nominated Villa Rica, Georgia hard rock band formed in 2000. The band released two albums, their self-titled debut in 2000 and 2001's Forget It!, before dieing in the summer of 2001. In 2005, lead vocalist Flander Hondison and drummer Larry Rendersn formed a new band using Electric Roses as the name (instead of their old \"Python\" name and released a new album on December 2, 2007 entitled NoH TyP, which contained Electric Roses' biggest crossover hits to date, \"Fuck Me Long Time\" and the band's first Hot 100 top ten hit, \"Roll Another Joint\".Lineup  Flander Hondison - Vocals and Guitar Larry Renderson - Drums Mike Monroe - Lead Guitar/Backup vocals Jake Green - BassMusical style and influences  Electric Roses is known for their explicit hard rock music. They have received continuous e-mails about the cussing in their music. Every time they get one of these e-mails they like, they read it aloud at a concert and laugh and joke about it with the crowd. Flander has been quoted saying \"Fuck you if you don't like cuss words in our fucking music!\" at just about all their concerts to date.Information about the band members  Flander Hondison - Born in 1986 by the name of Fernandas Hondison. His parents got divorced when he was seven; Flander was then left without a dad. At age twelve Flander found drugs which helped settle his depression. He started playing guitar shortly after which ended most of his depression, but he still stayed on the drugs. Larry Renderson - Born in 1986 by a seventeen year old slut led to Larry living a hard life as a child. His mom didn't want him, his dad wasn't around, and the only people he had was the band, which was then a group of friends. He wasn't much of a depressed one, still isn't, he's the happiest one in the band, never shows any other emotion. Started playing drums at ten. Mike Monroe - Born in 1986 in Atlanta, Georgia found Mike living out on the streets with his older brother. When he was twelve they moved to Villa Rica, in the band's neighborhood and they all became friends real quick. Mike introduced them to a lot of new drugs, and they introduced him to the band, he started playing the bass at thirteen years of age. Jake Green - Born in 1987, is the baby of the band. He really was the baby, the band took up for him always, no one messed with Jake, they were the only family he had. Jake would often get thrown out on the streets after his dad would beat him when getting drunk, and would have to stay at one of their houses. Jake was never the one for drugs, the only drug he needed to make him feel good was love, after he started playing guitar he seemed to feel better about his life and isn't no where near as depressed as he used to be, at age eleven.Band Biography  During Electric Roses' first days, Flander was working at a teen-sensation clothing store. Flander hated the job, but he used it to his advantage when he got the store to sponsor his band. With the band being sponsored, all the band had to focus on now was writing great songs and playing great songs. After months of writing and recording hundreds of songs in Jake's uncle's studio, Electric Roses released their first demo entitled: Justice is Dead. The band had only played in front of drunks in bars, nerds in coffee shops, and very rarely played with any other band. They didn't really have what many would call a \"fan base\". This meant that the band would have to either come up with a clever way to get recognized, or wait for a record deal to fall from the heavens. Luckily, Jakes uncle was able to get their music on a radio station, with little work. Well, if you wanna' call it that. Jake's Uncle snuck into a radio station one Friday night and switched one of the scheduled cds with one of Electric Roses songs from their album (Justice is Dead). This got Jake's uncle arrested, but at the same time gave Electric Roes a record deal and a fan base around their home town. With a record deal, Electric Roses was able to record a full length album in a high dollar studio. Soon, Electric Roses released Python and was all over the radio stations in America. A year later, \"Forget It!\" was released under KillthePoison. Right after this release and it's promotion tour, Electric Roses had a huge scuffle within the band, causing the band to go on haitius. They felt a break was better than a breakup. The band finally broke up in 2002, with Flander saying \"Electric Roses will return when hell freezes over.\" In 2007, hell froze over when Electric Roses released \"NoH TyP\". The release charted #1 on the charts, and quickly gave Electric Roses back mainstream status.Metamorphosis Records  Metamorphosis Records was founded in September 2008 by Murder Vengeance The Leader of SuicideParty Originally known as Rockstar Records, Bobby felt it needed to be revamped with more staff, and also drop a few acts so more time could be spent with the more important ones.Mission Statement  We are Metamorphosis Records.

Metamorphosis pleaded guilty and paid Jellyfish a large fine. This also lead to their eventual downfall.The Seymours  The Seymours are an English-French indie pop band from London. The band was formed by Ian Picholl (vocals) and Carl Pinchbeck (keyboards), who were soon joined by the other members of the group. They have sold over 8,5 million albums worldwide and have had three number one singles. Ian Picholl, guitarist Mat Gilbert and multi-instrumentalist Carl Pinchbeck are considered the core members of the band and have been the lead songwriters since the group's formation.Midnight/Mythic & debut album (mid-2007)  The band originally gained prominence with their independently released debut single \"My Girlfriend & Caligula\" in mid-2007 and were swiftly signed to Midnight/Mythic Records by then-label co-owner Bikki Bunney. They now consider this as a mere fluke since they firmly believe that the single boasts no qualities whatsoever. A short tour was announced in order to promote the band, during which they released their first single for Midnight/Mythic; the slow, droning \"Superior of the Species\". At the tour's final stop the band announced that they were to enter the studio and record their album, and a few weeks later Ian Picholl revealed in an interview that they had \"about ten songs ready.\" One of these was released as a single, \"Popsicle\", but failed to make an impression the charts. Success would come a short while after with the release of their fourth offering, \"Oh No, Not You Again\" which broke into the top 40 and gained moderate airplay. The group's management quickly shelved the recent umixed studio takes and instead opted for the band's finished demos to appear on the upcoming record in order to cash in on the popularity, a decision the band would later regret. Preceded by the single \"Downers\", The Seymours' debut album A Mutually Faithful, Monogamous Relationship in the Context of Marriage is the Expected Standard of Human Sexual Activity was rushed to release on September 1, 2007 and reached number 18 in the UK charts. The band embarked on a lengthy tour to promote the album, from the UK and Europe to the US, during which tensions grew between band members. Picholl said that \"[the tour was a] bad idea overall. Sometimes we had to pick people from the audience to play for us because we were too strung out.\" US crowds in particular were more unreceptive as the tour drew on, and the disastrous shows would sometimes only last for two or three songs before rioting ensued. The album ended up selling over 4 million copies worldwide, gaining the group wordwide recognition, much due to the surprise #2 hit \"Emmerdale\". The band cancelled the remaining dates of their tour, which by then consisted mostly of UK seaside gigs, citing burnout. Ian Picholl explained: \"none of us wanted to see each other after that [the US tour], let alone play together again.\" Picholl and Carl Pinchbeck laid down acoustic b-sides for the final single culled from the album; \"Swallow\". It failed to spark any interest and the band was rapidly losing momentum, delving deeper into drug addiction. Their management said that \"their career was probably over, anyway.\" Inbetween fruitless studio sessions Ian Picholl and Mat Gilbert collaborated with electronica act Aftershock on the EP Take Us to Your Planet, which recieved lukewarm reviews. Picholl also recorded vocals for Aerospliff guitarist Reef's Jimi Hendrix tribute album Electric Angel. He appears on the track \"Night Bird Flying\".The Seymours & return to form (late 2007-present)  Matters concerning the band remained quiet until November the same year as they, without promotion, released an EP of studio experiments. Dubbed The Holocaust, it featured the dreamy \"Caramel\" which was also released to radio, and recieved a respectable amount of airplay despite being over seven minutes in length. A couple of weeks later The Seymours made their first public appearance together with jazz outfit Chicago Wind on the 11th Annual IMA Ceremony. They also won the Best Newcomer award, despite heavy competition from bands such as Tom o' Bedlam, GirlSpice and Attack The System. Ian Picholl later told the press that he thought the award should be shared with the latter. \"I Say I Deserve Better Than This\", the brand new song performed at the IMAs, was released on December 6 as the first single from the album. A week later the band unveiled The Seymours, a depressing affair which recieved wildly enthusiastic media reviews. The Seymours had now clearly distanced themselves from their soft, lo-fi past with an album that mixed post-punk and indie rock. Recording had been properly conducted this time around, with sessions initiated by Picholl and Gilbert in New York and later polished up in the band's own studio in the Swiss Alps. The album's second single, the music business criticism of \"Poptunes\", ironically hit #1 on the UK charts on the week of the album's launch. \"Le Responsible\", \"Trash\" and \"Stylorouge\" were also successful single releases that propelled album sales and surpassed their debut with hundreds of thousands of copies. At first, a tour was arranged, but these plans fell through when Ian Picholl suffered an injury during the band's set at Midwinter Mashfest. Picholl also shared vocals with My Freaky Valentine's lead singer Hayley Williams on their single \"Signal the Stars\". The Seymours released two singles, \"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\" and \"Life's a Gas\" for the Christmas and New Year Extravaganzas, respectively. In early 2008, the group was nominated for a number of IMA awards but won none. Mid-February saw the members reuniting for a string of concerts in Japan. Mat Gilbert told fans after the final show that the band were currently recording their third album, and that they were aiming at an early 2008 release. The band also played a short set at the Festival Buen D\u00eda on March 15. On May 23, the band debuted three new songs during a surprise appearance for a private party at the Cannes Film Festival. The Seymours played the second Midsummer Mashfest installment on June 22, revealing another batch of unheard songs as well as performing tracks drawn from their second album. Ian Picholl promised fans that they would be back 'very, very soon'. It is believed that the album mentioned by Mat Gilbert in February has been scrapped in favour for new material. This was partly confirmed by Picholl after the show, though nothing has been made official by either The Seymours camp or their record label. Mat Gilbert posted a blog entry on The Seymours website on June 28, updating visitors and fans on the new album, future single releases and new member Timo Sirvi\u00f6. The band's label Midnight Records closed its doors on August 4. It is now speculated that the album's release has been pushed back due to these circumstances. On July 15th, 2009, nearly a year after any news, Ian Picholl, Timo Sirvi\u00f6 and a number of Italian guest musicians performed a stripped down set in support for Rest in Peace on their The Spinning world tour at Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. The show consisted mostly of Italian folk songs and a few reinterpretations of Seymours songs. Picholl and Sirvi\u00f6 spoke briefly to the music press after the show, though there was no mention of new material.Musical style and influences  Both musically and lyrically The Seymours cite bands and artists such as The Beatles, Phil Spector, My Bloody Valentine, Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, Serge Gainsbourg, Prince, Pet Shop Boys, Scarlette & the Retrospect, The Sundays, The Velvet Underground, Orange Juice, The Cure, The Stone Roses, The Jesus & Mary Chain, David Bowie, Jacques Dutronc, Blondie, Mr. Prunce, Neu!, The Kinks, Buchinski and The Smiths as major influences.Awards Awards Nominations References External link(s)  Offical websiteJunction Records History  Junction Records was initially formed by Max Armstrong and Lucy Tyrell as a short term record label until they managed to get a big record deal, but after earning enough money to employ some experienced people they managed to keep the record label going and have since signed many unsigned acts. So they decided to just stay contracted to their own record label so that their future is in their own hands. Junction Records have two record studio's called 4th Street Studio's which is one of the highest quality record studio's around. They also have their offices in a joint on building with various different rooms including a Gym and a lounge area. They have announced plans to expand Junction Records in 2012 by having 2 new 4th Street Studio's built in New Jersey and Los Angeles.Future  Max Armstrong plans to expand Junction Records in 2011 and has said \"I want Junction Records to compete with the major labels and I want to prove that you can have success with an small label.\" In April 2010 Junction Records Merged With Metamorphosis Records. In 2010 Junction Records developed into one of the worlds major record labels and had a bigger roster than they've ever had.Key People Acts Former Acts Discography  This is a list of all of the albums released under Junction Records.Live Albums Studio Albums Caca Katie Price  Katie Price is a singer/songwriter/model from Brighton, East Sussex, England. She debuted with her first single Not Just Anybody (Single). She has released 12 singles , 1 Compilation album , & 2 Studio Albums to date.Music Career  Katie Price made it known back in June 2008 that she was working on her debut album. From the start she had a lot of people that did not believe in her ability. So she started out in the United Kingdom going to local clubs and promoting herself as a singer. She would sing a cover of Heart Of Glass. Depending on the clubs , overall she had a mixed reaction. The industry heard of her trying to start a career and wrote her off as talentless. Through this Katie decided since no label will pick up her , she decided to produce and fund the release of her debut album Not Just Anybody (Album) herself. It was a bold move by her. In August 2008 , Katie has completed work on her debut album. She thought it would be about time that she released the first single. Not Just Anybody (Single) the singlewas released in the United Kingdom only. despite selling over 100,000 copies it was considered a failure. Katie decided not to give up and it was followed up by the Questions/Answers single. Yet again the single didn't make much buzz though it sold close to 200,000 copies. It did however grab the attention of Metamorphosis Records. In early September 2008 , Metamorphosis Records signed Katie to a multimillion dollar deal. They also offered her more regions for her albums/singles to be released in. Katie signed and her next single After Tonight was released in the UK & USA under Metamorphosis Records. It caused an outrage in both regions because of the lyrics and the cover of the singer where she appeared nude. When the public was about to boycott the album from stores due to the sexuality of the single , label owner Bobby Zombie decided it would be best if Katie next released Angel. It was a song dedicated to her family and friends. It was released in the USA & UK. It sold fairly well and showed Katie dressed as an angel fully clothed on the single cover. When it came to the last single from her debut album. Katie convinced Bobby Zombie to let her release Inside Of Me as the next single. It was the most sexual song on the album. Bobby agreed and it was released. The public didn't cry much over the original. It was the scandal surrounding the B.Zombie remix that appeared on the album where the two of them sounded like they were having sex on the track. The controversy also led to rumors that it has caused the divorce of Bobby from Katee Zombie. This led to a very public feud between Katee and Katie. Then Bobby made a statement saying in fact he was dating the married Katie Price. This led Katie to totally pull herself out of the fight between the two soon to be divorced and think about the hurt the rumors must be having on her loved ones. Katie needed to clean up her image badly. So in mid September 2008 , Katie recorded about 20 cover songs. Lots of duets with her husband Peter Andre... Katie never went on the record to deny or say the rumors Bobby was putting out were true or not. Katie then released A Whole New World Feat. Peter Andre for charity with all the proceeds going to charity. She even used their wedding picture as the cover of the single as a message saying their marriage was stronger than ever. The single sold well as well. Then they released another charity duet single... The Best Things In Life Are Free Feat. Peter Andre. That sold better with them doing performances of the single on TV shows and all proceeds going to charity. Along the way of Bobby Zombie seeing how well the singles sold and going all to charity he got a bit greedy saying that Katie must pull some money into the label. He decided he was taking 10 of the covers she recorded and releasing a compilation album confusing many fans to think that it was her second studio album which it was not. At the end of September 2008 , Covers: Collection was released. Katie stopped work on her upcoming second album Rated X and started promotion on the compilation album. She kept reminding the public that it was not her second album and that it was very unexpected. This soon led the public to notice the partnership between herself & Bobby Zombie begin to unravel. Her 8th single was a duet with fellow label mate Natalya Banhart. Part Of Your World was released and became Katie's highest charting singles yet. Coming in at number 27 in the UK charts. It also helped the recent release of the Covers: Collection helping the album to sell over 1 million copies and come in at a high chart of number 7 in the UK. At this time Bobby Zombie has brought Elle Fame in as a co owner of the label. Katie was very pleased with that. Her 9th single released was a Kylie Minogue cover and was Loving Days. The cover was tame compared to Katie's over covers. Then it was followed by the release of the Daphne Aguilera cover song of Play With Fire. Daphne was very pleased to have Katie cover her and asked her to be on album: The Comeback and Katie accepted along with other pop divas. Elle Fame then helped Katie put together the Part Of Your World Tour. Before she went on tour Katie went to the price and urged fans to stop buying the Covers: Collection compilation album that Bobby Zombie is a greedy person and put it out without her consent and though she is proud of the songs and the success of it that she wants the fans to stop buying it. This soon led to more problems between the two and Bobby Zombie soon left the label to Elle Fame & also sold 50% to Freddy Valentine. Katie's tour was deemed a success. During the tour she released a new track Finally it does not appear on any albums. It was to help promote the tour. The song is thank you to all the fans and everybody in the industry that has helped her. When then tour ended , a new band by the name of Babyteeth decided to attack Katie's music. They went on to start a whole war against katie price tour. Katie has no publicly spoken out about the bands and other artists attacks against her music. After the tour Katie finished work on her Rated X album. At the same time she founded Rated X Records so she could sign acts and have more creative control over her music. At the end of October she released her 12th single Rated X (Single). It reached the top 20 in the UK and the top 40 in the USA. Following a week into November her 2nd studio album Rated X was released.Tours Discography Albums Singles Moronic Changeling  Moronic Changeling is a \"madcore\" band on Cruz-Bishop Management from Bristol, UK.Early Life  The \"original three\" Moronics - Kaethe van Mouschi, Somerset Bissell and Nickola \"Nick\" Biggs - met as teenagers. Biggs and Bissell met in a karate class, they later went on to meet van Mouschi in a caf\u00e9. The three became a surprising set of friends, and formed a band, known as \"The Complete And Utter Fruits\". After writing their first song, the three girls approached James Cruz-Bishop III at CBM, then known as Kirsty Cruz Management, and gave him the demo. \"Three dirty girls, with a lyrically terrible song, the guitar even worse than the words,\" Cruz-Bishop said, \"there were so many reasons why I shouldn't sign them. But we had no bands at KCM, Kirsty wasn't around to disapprove, so I signed them. And look where we got to!\"Name Change  The band changed their name to Moronic Changeling after breakfast one morning - Biggs, who never got on with van Mouschi, was trying to think of new insults for her. She came up with \"moronic changeling\", Bissell said that it sounded like a great band name (whether it is or not is debatable), and so it was.Fruitilicious Era Shop Assistant - The Beginning  Despite only being released in the UK and only selling just shy of 50,000 copies, the band considered first single \"Shop Assistant\" to be a success. The catchy, cheesy pop song gained them their first following. It is still the most popular Moronics song, and is usually used as an encore at gigs to this day.\n \"It's the kind of song which you listen to and just can't get out of your head,\" said Cruz-Bishop, manager from beginning to present. \"It's just plain addictive.\"\n The song may be about a male shop assistant, but the cartoon showgirl on the cover became Moronic Changeling's mascot. The outfit that the little faerie is wearing was a favourite of van Mouschi's - Bissell and Biggs covered up more!The First Line-up Change  Basically, everyone (bar van Mouschi herself) agreed that van Mouschi couldn't actually play guitar to save her life. They auditioned guitarists left, right and centre, but nobody seemed to fit. It was pure coincidence that got them Justin Jenkins. Biggs and Bissell happened to be out shopping, when they saw the shop assistant in question in the song - daring ninja girl Biggs asked him out for van Mouschi, it just so happened that he could play guitar, and the rest is history! Going from line-up #1 to line-up #2 after just one single may seem like \"typical Moronic Changeling\" today. Little did they know that Jenkins joining the band would be the first of a long, long list of line-up changes throughout their career.Someotherday & How Will I Go?  Two further singles were released with this line-up. The first was \"Someotherday\" - Cruz-Bishop called this song \"the first song they wrote that made any sense\". Sophy Catherine Kerry, who would later become a member of the band and is the twin sister of current lead vocalist Bikki Bunney, modelled for the cover of this. The lyric is also supposedly the set of words that got Jenkins to propose to van Mouschi. The second was \"How Will I Go?\", a song about suicide. Though some say that this was related to the later suicide attempts of Biggs, at the time the band claimed that \"it means nothing\".The Album & Moving On  On the same day as \"How Will I Go?\", the Moronics' first album \"Fruitilicious\" was released. Selling just over 300,000 copies, it was considered to be something of a depressing flop. This was the final release by this line-up. Almost straight after, van Mouschi and Biggs could no longer stand the sight of each other, and Biggs (literally) kicked van Mouschi out of the band.\n \"Kaethe - you either love her or hate her, big personality,\" Cruz-Bishop explained. \"Nick - hot-tempered, fiery little ninja. The two matched up musically, but they were pretty much made not to get along. How they managed to stay friends for this long is still a mystery to me.\"\n After leaving Moronic Changeling, van Mouschi went on to pursue a solo project, but after this went aboard the failboat, she went on to form the band K.I.C.K.A.R.S.E., which was far more successful. It was time for Moronic Changeling to move on as well - no further singles were released from \"Fruitilicious\", and they went in search of a new lead singer.", "The King of Fighters Wiki": "The King of Fighters Wiki Characters Main Page Featured article  The King of Fighters (series), officially abbreviated KOF, is the premiere series of fighting games by SNK Playmore, formerly SNK.

The most recent game in the series, The King of Fighters XI, was released on October 26, 2005.Featured media  KOF XII trailer at AOUHelping out  To write a new article, just enter the title in the box below.Rugal Bernstein  Rugal Bernstein is an SNK character who made his debut in The King of Fighters '94, where he took the role of final boss, facing by himself whole teams of 3 fighters. Since then he's been in several King of Fighters games as a final boss as well as some crossovers. However, he was only allowed to be used in KoF 98 due to his other KoF appearances being overpowered as Omega/God Rugal.History  According to his official biography, Rugal was born on February 10. His hobby was \"resurrection.\" He had no favorite food or sport (claimed he's good at everything). His fighting style was an amalgam of various arts, including Hakkyokuseiken and House of Strolheim, the styles used by Geese Howard and Wolfgang Krauser. He has adapted several moves from each character, such as Geese's Reppuken and Krauser's Kaiser Wave, though he also uses his own techniques, like the Genocide Cutter. The details of Rugal's early life are unknown, but by the events of The King of Fighters, Rugal had become an international arms dealer, operating out of his aircraft carrier BlackNoah, accompanied by servants and his pet panther, Rodem. Rugal was not only feared in international politics, but also in the fighting world; as a vicious combatant, Rugal took his defeated foes and dipped them in liquid metal, making them into statues to commemorate his battles. Heidern, a mercenary leader, had been trying to infiltrate Rugal's operation, which prompted Rugal to kidnap his wife and daughter, daring him to try and mount a rescue. When Heidern brought an entire company of his best men to the BlackNoah, Rugal, by himself, wiped it out to a man, and would have killed Heidern if his family had not intervened. Instead, he killed them and left Heidern with one eye and grievous injuries. Rugal later sensed a tremendous power in the middle of nowhere, and when he went to take it for himself, Goenitz appeared, took out his eye with one strike, and gave him a small portion of the power of Orochi for surviving the attack. Returning to the BlackNoah, Rugal had a bionic eye implanted, and recruited two secretaries: Mature and Vice. With their help, Rugal organized a King of Fighters tournament, in order to find worthy opponents. During the invitation phase, Saisyu Kusanagi came to the BlackNoah and challenged Rugal. Although Rugal won the battle, he did not subject him to his metal bath. When Saisyu's son, Kyo, arrived with his teammates, he defeated Rugal. Unwilling to accept defeat, Rugal blew up his ship. Rugal was believed dead, but he used the Orochi power to survive. Replacing his destroyed right forearm with cybernetics, Rugal revived Saisyu, brainwashed him, and sent out invitations the following year for another King of Fighters tournament. Rugal used an abandoned missile silo as his base in 1995, and abducted the winning team (again, Kyo's team) to fight Saisyu, and then himself. Despite using the Orochi power and becoming 'Omega Rugal,' Kyo's defeated him. Again beaten, Rugal tried to use more of the Orochi power, possibly for Riot of the Blood, but it consumed him. As his body disintegrated, he saw Iori Yagami, who told him that only those \"of the bloodline\" could control Orochi's power. Legend It is said that Rugal once had a loving and caring heart and that one day a group of unknown people killed his wife. While he was trying to save his family he knocked over a music box, it started playing the tune \"Mockingbird\". The Unkown people restrained him and watched as they killed her, after they left the music box kept playing, he grasped with all his might and broke it. Blood began running from his hand and swore revenge on those who killed his wife. His evil ran from his head all the way to his soul and heart. When he has defeated his opponent or opening his match he gets down on one knee and hears the music box that was playing when they killed his wife. He has yet to know who did it and why. He challenges everyone in hopes of finding them that is one of many reasons why the King Of Fighters Tournament began.Game Information  On their tenth anniversary website, SNK has stated that Rugal in The King of Fighters '94 was originally based on the concept of the \"mightiest (most violent) and most evil boss character ever.\"[1] (Omega) Rugal is also the developers' favorite SNK villain thus far, which is the main reason why he is always the final boss in the dream match games.[2] Rugal is, by SNK's own claims, the prime example of SNK Boss Syndrome. Rugal as a Boss is typically very passive, waiting for the player to attack before unleashing one of his high priority attacks to punish them. The attack that typically fills this role is his signature move Genocide Cutter, a multi-hit, rising kick maneuver which has a large number of invincibility frames. Rugal's Dark Barrier can be used to deflect projectiles thrown by a turtling player. He also has access to a dashing command throw, known as God Press and a version of Geese Howard's Reppuken. These moves together make Rugal capable of sitting at the end of the screen and inflicting damage upon the player for almost any move they make. Rugal also has additional attacks depending on which game he is in, along with a several highly damaging Desperation Moves. Due to his waiting game, it's not uncommon for a player to try to get a time out to defeat Rugal, by dodging his Reppukens and God Presses after landing a few blows. It is said that the original gameplay design for him in KOF 94 involved him being able to copy other characters special moves after they had been performed once by the player, but that this was canceled due to memory restraints. He instead got moves from two other SNK bosses-the above mentioned Reppuken and Kaiser Wave. The fact that he manages to use some of Akuma's classic moves (namely the Shun Goku Satsu and Ashura Warp, a teleport move) in his God Rugal form seems to hint at this. Rugal's Gigantic Pressure was the first move in the KOF series to end with a pillar of energy with the image of a skull in its middle. In KOF95, the pillar also appeared around him when he was being destroyed at the end of the game. In later games, this was shown to be used in supers by other characters related to the Orochi bloodline (Mature in KOF 96, Leona Heidern in KOF 96 Game Boy, Yashiro Nanakase in KOF 97, and Vice in KOF 98), by his son Adel in KOF 2003 and by Violent Ken in SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom. Rugal's somewhat odd Dead End Screamer DM debuted in KOF '98, and disappeared just as fast. The move caused Rugal to aim a jump kick at the enemies' head, and upon connecting, stomp them hard into the ground, and then quickly spin in place on the enemy for a couple seconds. The SDM version had him breaking the enemies' neck with his legs before stomping them down, not unlike the character Gato, who debuted much later. Rugal has made non-canon appearances as a playable character in The King of Fighters '98 both as normal Rugal and Omega Rugal, in The King of Fighters '2002 just as Omega Rugal, and in the Capcom vs. SNK series as normal Rugal and a new version, God Rugal (Ultimate Rugal in U.S. versions). The latter version was designed by Capcom, not SNK, and is the result of Rugal having assimilating Akuma's abilities after defeating him in battle. His capabilities were also toned down in the Capcom vs. SNK series, to make him more balanced against the rest of the cast. Rugal (usually as Omega Rugal) has retained the same theme song, Ketchaku R&D (Showdown R&D), in most of his King of Fighters appearances, though remixed differently each time, and titled differently in King of Fighters '98 (simply titled XXX). In the aforementioned game, Rugal's non-Omega incarnation had another theme song, titled The RR, which had no melodic link to Ketchaku R&D. In King of Fighters 95, his theme was Guitar, Omega, and Rugal, which was a completely different theme song. This was primarily because his soon-to-be signature theme was used in the previous game, and SNK did not wish to repeat the same song for the boss battle of the second KOF game. However, Rugal found himself with another new theme song in KOF 2K2 (possibly because it was developed by a completely different development team than previous games), entitled Last Dance. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, as God Rugal, his theme song was The Lord GOD. This was changed to The Lord ULTIMATE for the US version. Rugal is generally believed to be dead since the events of KOF 95; however, the Rugal fought in that game is referred as \"Omega Rugal\", a cyborg version of the character; in one of the illustrations available in the PlayStation version of KOF 98 there's an illustration showing a series of human-sized test tubes with Omega Rugals in them, hinting that that the individual destroyed by the Orochi power in 95 may have been a guinea pig and not the original; it is also worth pointing out that the NESTS saga features themes including cloning, robotics, cybernetic implants and genetic manipulation as part of its universe, and that in KOF 2002, Rugal is shown sitting at a throne with several NESTS characters around him, hinting at some possible involvement (though it may simply be a send-off, of sorts, to the NESTS saga). Adding to the speculation that Rugal might not actually be dead, in KOF 2000, any striker called, who is dead, will flicker and vanish after performing their attack. Rugal, instead runs off, like any other normal striker.Known techniques Related characters External links  OMEGA RUGAL God RugalKyo Kusanagi  Kyo Kusanagi (\u8349\u8599 \u4eac Kusanagi Ky\u014d) is one of the main characters in SNK Playmore's King of Fighters videogame series; he was first introduced in The King of Fighters '94 as the leader of the Japan team. Having won KOF '94 through '97 and 2003, Kyo is the KOF character with most championship victories in the tournaments, having won 5 tournaments. He is one of the iconic characters of the series and regularly appears on publicity material and merchandise. His name and abilities were designed in order to relate him with the Yamata no Orochi legend. Due to the fact he was highly popular and his outfit changed along the series, the designers created a few clones with his old appearance. Kyo is first introduced as a cock-sure delinquent high school student who is the heir to the Kusanagi clan, who can use pyrokinetic powers. In The King of Fighters universe, his clan is one of the three clans that sealed the legendary snake entity, Yamata no Orochi. Due to his clan's past, Kyo fights against the Kusanagi's enemies; his rival Orochi's soldiers. He enters every The King of Fighters tournament representing Japan and uses his clan's fighting style to combine fire with kenpo. Aside from the main series, Kyo also appears in several other media series such as spin-offs and crossover video games as well as comic adaptations of the series. Video games reviewers have praised his design and fighting style as one of the best from the series. Reviewers noted him to be a necessary character to have in every video game from the series and commented of him to have the best winning pose. Within Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second favorite character. A variety of collectibles based on Kyo have been created, including key chains and figurines.Character Development and Reception  When designing characters for the first King of Fighters, developers wanted a \"snazzy\" new hero who would easily fight against Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting characters. Through most of his development, Kyo was meant to be called Syo Kirishima, and was dressed in martial arts clothing common with fighting games at the time. But late in production, his name became Kyo Kusanagi, likely due to the KOF story's change in direction towards the Yamata no Orochi legend. His change in fighting style was also made as a part of the series' overhaul in '96. To appease all fans, they also included an older version of Kyo from KOF '94 into '97 and placed the '95 version of Kyo in '98, which made both versions of Kyo popular during location tests. The idea of having two Kyos at once lead to the concept of his clones. During the early development stages of The King of Fighters '99, SNK planned not to add in Kyo (his clones included) or Iori to the game, as the story's focus was meant to center on the new protagonist, K'. However, they retracted this decision as \"they couldn't leave these popular characters in limbo\". Kyo was redesigned but some designers wanted his return to '99 with his school uniform. When they were nearing the end of their production schedule, staff members were indecisive upon which uniform the Kyo clone should wear ('94 or '95) when the project head said to just make two clones instead. To save time, the project head then drew designs for Kyo-1 and Kyo-2 on the spot. Veteran developers for the series admit that Kyo's repeated appearances in the series is due to the marketers and the main planners' insistence to add him, Iori, and other SNK regulars in every game, making it a challenge to decide the story for each title. Kyo's voice actor, Masahiro Nonaka, related greatly with his character as being young and reckless until he \"grew up\" in his later appearances. He then expressed some difficulty accepting Kyo on the same level. Along with his rival, Iori, Kyo has been noted by several of the series' designers as being one of the most difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity amongst fans. As of today, Kyo has sported 5 different outfits: Kyo has also sported the most \"versions\" of any other character in the entire series. Additionally, a character with his prototype name appears as an alternate striker for Kyo in KOF 2000 (bearing Kyo's unused character design). Sho's design reappears as Kyo's unlockable 3rd alternate outfit in KOF: Maximum Impact and in the KOF: Maximum Impact 2 as Classic Kyo's unlockable \"normal\" outfit. Another deviation of Kyo comes in the minor appearance of Cosplayer Kyoko, an alternate Striker in KOF 2000 who is a homage to female fans dressing up as Kyo. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second favorite character, placed behind his rival, Iori.Gameplay Maximum Impact 2 Regulation Joystick combo In-Game History Clan background  At first, from the year 200, the Kusanagi and Yasakani clans were allies. However, by 1330, the Yasakani had become jealous and hateful over the Kusanagi's prestige. Therefore, the Yasakani struck a blood pact with Orochi for more power. They renamed their family name to Yagami and their flames, previously red like their former allies, changed to violet from Orochi's taint. Since then, the clans have waged a generation long grudge with casualties made from both sides. It continues in The King of Fighters series with Kyo and Iori Yagami.Rugal Saga  The Rugal saga takes place in The King of Fighters 94 and 95. Shortly after the completion of his training, Kyo competes in a preliminary held in Japan to determine the members of the country's representative team in the King of Fighters tournament. He bests Goro Daimon and Benimaru Nikaido to become the leader of the team, the two becoming his teammates and eventual friends. They reach the finals, where they met the host of the tournament, a powerful fighter named Rugal Bernstein. Rugal boasts his desire to fight powerful opponents and challenges them. After his defeat, he self-destructs his ship in attempt to bring them with him but the team escapes unharmed. In the next tournament, Kyo and his team are invited to another King of Fighters tournament, organized once again by Rugal, who survived his craft's self-destruction. This time, Rugal also brainwashed Kyo's missing father, Saisyu Kusanagi, into attacking his son. Kyo's father regains his senses after he was subdued by the team. To counter the team's strength, Rugal challenges them with power sapped from Orochi. However, Rugal's body was overwhelmed by the power's immensity and he was vaporized after his defeat. Pleased with his son's prowess, Saisyu leaves unnoticed, insinuating that he entrusts the clan's duty to Kyo.Orochi Saga  Prior to the events of The King of Fighters 96, a mysterious man -later revealed to be one of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Goenitz- challenges Kyo to a fight. Kyo arrives, powered by his overwhelming confidence in his fists, only to be defeated soundly by his challenger and sent to the hospital. In spite of his injuries, his anger and spirit from his loss drove him to invent powerful new techniques -this is the canon explanation for Kyo trading his ground-fireball attack for his now trademark flame-laced melee attack strings. He enters the year's tournament to prove his strength to his unknown attacker. In the tournament's finals, he meets the host of the tournament and the younger heiress of the Yata clan, Chizuru Kagura. At the tournament's end, he vanquishes Goenitz with Iori and Chizuru's help. Though he is warned by Chizuru of his clan's destiny with Orochi, Kyo ignores her and promptly departs. Before The King of Fighters 97 takes place, he is pestered by fellow high school student, Shingo Yabuki, to teach him how to create his flames. Though annoyed and flustered by his persistence, Kyo partially agrees to mentor him as a means of gaining free meals. He also experiences nightmares of a strange man defeating him at the King of Fighters tournament but continues to participate. Though it's ambiguous as to which team he enters during the tournament, it is canonly accepted that Kyo joins with Iori and Chizuru for its conclusion. He advances into the finals, where he confronts the remaining \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. When they are beaten, Orochi possesses Chris' body and attempts to destroy the three clans at once. As was done in the legends of their clans, the trio successfully defeat him. In a last-ditch effort, Orochi (manifested in Chris' body) causes Iori to enter the berserk Riot of Blood state, expecting him to turn on Kyo and Chizuru. Instead, Iori snares Orochi by the neck, and Kyo obliged his rival by crippling the great demon with one last deathblow, allowing Chizuru to reseal Orochi. Exhausted, Kyo passes out.NESTS Saga  The King of Fighters 99 took place immediately after the events of The King of Fighters 98. Kyo was taken by the NESTS syndicate and his DNA was used to make various beings for their purposes. He awoke at th 15th day of his coling and find himself surrounded by bizarre gadgets and needles. Kyo enters KOF 99 and KOF 2000 for revenge .in The King of Fighters 2001, Kyo reunites with his old teammates and Shingo to make a comeback in the Japan Team. They join the now NESTS-sponsored KoF tournament to relive their time together as a team.Tales of Ash Saga  In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appeared to both Kyo and Iori, requesting that they form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi. Kyo initially protested allying with Iori (though Iori apparently did not do likewise), but relented to form the Sacred Treasures team. After besting Mukai, the team then investigated the weakening Orochi seal that they had been transported to before fighting Mukai, but were ambushed by Ash, who stole the power of the Yata no kagami or Yata mirror from Chizuru, promising to go after Iori next. Ash escaped and Kyo swore vengeance. In The King of Fighters XI, Kyo, Iori, and Shingo formed a team to try and stop Ash once more. However, the growing presence of the Orochi (namely, the appearance of Magaki) caused Iori to snap and enter the Blood Riot state, and he trashed Kyo and Shingo in a berserk fit. Ash appeared thereafter and stole the Yasakani no Magatama within Iori's body -and presumably Iori's flames. The Rival Team (Benimaru, Duo Lon, Elisabeth) arrive after the incident to whom Ash tells them that Kyo will be next.Personal details  In the games, Kyo's style of speech (pronouns and grammar style that are indicative of arrogance and even rudeness in Japanese culture), distinctive victory cry (Ore no... kachi da!, Japanese for \"This is my victory!\" and translated in KOF: Maximum Impact as \"I am... the champion!\"), and win quotes seem to indicate that he is arrogant, a little devil-may-care and very cocksure of himself. Despite this demeanor, he treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly doting on his girlfriend Yuki - a detail reflective of his heritage, as she is descended from the bloodline of Kushinada, the maiden that was nearly sacrificed to Orochi before the intervention of the Kusanagi, Yasakani and Yata clans. He and his often-absent father Saisyu tend squabble with and grumble over each other when they are together, but merely in jest. By contrast, he gets along well with his mother Shizuka and is very respectful to her. Following the formation of the Japan Team in The King of Fighters '94, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon became good friends with Kyo. Goro (also a friend of Saisyu) is a mentor figure and Benimaru a friendly rival. Kyo has also apparently known Athena Asamiya since childhood, a detail that has received little attention outside of some spin-offs like the KoF: Kyo manga. His extreme disinterest in studies has led to his chronic inability to graduate from high school (which has become subject to in-jokes, though he seems to have just ditched without graduating after KoF'97), and it also was how he met a fan and eventual student of his, Shingo Yabuki. Kyo appears to be strongly driven by his heritage, particularly a sense of justice (or at least a hatred or disdain for villains) and a bond with Iori (of the Yasakani) and Chizuru (of the Yata) - he, however, tends to see such things more as personal matters rather than being a part of his heritage. His hostility towards Iori (which is equally, if not more so, returned) is also a result of his lineage; however, their mutual grudge dwindles somewhat, evidenced by their cooperation against Goenitz, Orochi, NESTS, and during KOF 2003 and XI (admittedly, the two only cooperate grudgingly or as a last resort, and Iori still intends to carry on their blood feud -- Kyo seems to care very little either way about it). Though he never knew Chizuru Kagura prior to the events of KOF '96 and does not appear to have actively befriended her (it's remarkable, though, that he now refers to Chizuru by first name, which in Japanese mindset denotes a noticeable closeness -- his girlfriend Yuki, his best friend Benimaru and his \"student\" Shingo are the only other characters he is known to regularly refer to by their first names), he became enraged over Ash stealing her powers, and swore to get even with him.The Kyo Clones  In The King of Fighters '99, two clones of Kyo appeared as selectable characters: Kyo-1 and Kyo-2. They are clones created by the mysterious organization known as NESTS. After capturing Kyo following the climax of the King of Fighters 97' tournament, they used his DNA to create thousands of identical lifeforms which possess his fighting style and some of his memories, albeit with somewhat differing personalities and traits. They also have an overwhelming hatred of the original Kyo. During the course of the King of Fighters 99', Kyo-1 and Kyo-2 were merely two of thousands ready to be activated by Krizalid. They were presumably destroyed, since both characters don't have a personal ending and don't belong to any team. Kyo-1 is available as an extra costume for Kyo in SVC Chaos for PS2, and is obtainable when pressing the Circle button to select Kyo. In his intro in KoF 99, Kyo takes off his bandana and burns it to avoid being confused for a clone; his winquotes in this game further support his awareness of his clones.Kusanagi  Another Kyo clone was introduced in 2002: Kusanagi. He was believed, by many fans, to have been originally created as a NESTS experiment, because he has a special intro with K9999. During this intro, K9999 yells \"Kusanagi!\" and he acknowledges him as if they both knew each other. This introduction is, in fact, a homage to Akira, because K9999 and Kusanagi have the same voice actors as Tetsuo and Kaneda, respectively. However, his actual backstory is revealed in KoF 2003, which says that he is the product of Chizuru Kagura's magic, used to test the strength for the tournament's contestants. His evil appearance is possibly due to the fact that he was created by Chizuru while under the control of Those From The Past members Mukai (the leader of the KOF 2003 operation) and Botan (the puppeteer who had Chizuru under her control). However, contrary to this, a piece of official art for King of Fighters 2002 shows Kusanagi's flames burning off the flesh on his arm revealing robotic musculature, suggesting he was in fact originally intended to be one of NESTS' Kyo clones. His moves are based primarily on Kyo's KOF '95 moveset. Also, in KOF 2002, he has a special intro with some characters that use weapons in battle, like Choi, Chang, Billy and Whip, being \"Temae! Sude de shoubu shiagare!\" (You! (bastard!) Fight me with your bare hands!) Also, in KOF: Another Day, episode 3, the Ikari team briefly mentions a Kyo clone walking around the vicinities of South Town. While there's no evidence to this fact, some fans consider the \"Kyo clone\" that Heidern mentioned to be Kusanagi (although it is actually them mistaking the actual Kyo for an escaped NESTS copy).Game appearances External links  es.Kyo Kusanagi  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundIori Yagami  Iori Yagami is one of the more popular characters in the King of Fighters series of video games. He first appered in The King of Fighters '95 as Kyo Kusanagi's arch enemy. In KoF '96, Kyo and Iori have a special intro when they face each other. He is 20 years old officially. Iori is a member of the Yagami clan, originally known as the Yasakani. 2000 years ago, a dispute arose between the Yata, Kusanagi and Yasakani clans over which is the strongest, the Kusanagi's claiming to be the most powerful of the three. In order to overpower the Kusanagi, the Yasakani made a blood pact with Orochi, thus turning their flames purple instead of the crimson flames they originally weilded. This pact, however, carried a heavy cost. The Yasakani were doomed to live very short lives. Iori himself is occasianally subject to the Riot of the Blood, which makes him go mad. In KoF '97, after Kyo, Iori and Chizuru face Orochi, he rises from the ground, claiming that he will always be around, as long as other Orochi bloods exist. Iori is then struck with madness, and Orochi tells Iori to kill Kyo, but Iori leaps to Orochi and engulfs him and himself in a pillar of purple fire. While Chizuru casts the spell to seal Orochi away, and Iori holds the Orochi in place, Kyo deals the final blow. Iori and Kyo were thought to have died, but they somehow survived. Iori is also able to resist the Riot of the Blood to some extent. In the secret ending in KoF '96, Iori is struck with the Riot of the Blood, and then he pops up from the bottom of the screen with blood trickling down his mouth. In Iori's proper team ending in '96, he is subject to the Riot of the Blood, and kills Vice and Mature, Rugal's secretarys.Game Appearances Mai Shiranuii  Mai Shiranui is a busty female character of The King of Fighters series. Though she's a strong fighter using fans and fire attacks, she's more famous for her large breasts and flirty nature. She is 21 years old officially.Series Appearances  Mai has appeared in the following King Of Fighters games\u00a0: KOF 94, KOF 95, KOF 96, KOF 97, KOF 98, KOF 99, KOF 00, KOF 01, KOF 02, KOF 03, KOF XI (console version only), KOF XIII. Mai is one of the series' most popular female characters (mainly due to her skimpy costume and large breasts). There was internet backlash due to the fact that she only appeared in the PS2 version of KOF XI, and the fact that she did not appear in KOF XII at all. Some people even went on to say that they refused to buy KOF XII, purely because the busty Mai wasn't in it. To combat this, SNK Playmore revealed that the big-breasted ninja girl was one of the first new characters to appear in KOF XIII. She was announced alongside Yuri Sakazaki and King - thus remaking the Women's Team from KOF 94.Other Appearances  As well as being a recurring character in the Fatal Fury series (appearing in every installment except the original Fatal Fury and Garou: Mark Of The Wolves), Mai has appeared in the Capcom Vs. SNK/SNK Vs. Capcom series, and many other crossovers. SNK Vs. Capcom: The Match Of The Millennium SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash 2 Expand Edition SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS SNK Vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos Capcom Vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Capcom Vs. SNK Pro Capcom Vs. SNK 2: Mark Of The Millennium SNK Gals' Fighters Neo Geo Battle Coliseum KOF Sky StageCameo Appearances  Mai has made unplayable cameos in certain characters endings for the Samurai ShoWdown series, as well as Art Of Fighting 2 in which it is implied that Eiji Kisaragi has feelings for her. She also appears in the eroge game Days Of Memories.She also appears in the Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos.Additional Information  Mai Shiranui is considered to be not only the main big-breasted sex symbol of the King Of Fighters series, but also of the company SNK Playmore. She is generally regarded as \"The Queen Of Fighters\". She is commonly featured in lists composing of the most attractive videogame girls. Among famous videogame girls, her breasts are often the largest. Even though Athena Asamiya has appeared in more KOF games than Mai, Mai appears more recognizable. She is one of the more cosplayed KOF characters. In all of the Capcom/SNK crossovers, Mai is usually considered the rival of Chun-Li from the Street Fighter series. Mai's outfit somewhat resembles that of Maki Genryusai from Final Fight 2, which was released after Fatal Fury 2. Many people consider Maki's outfit to be based on Mai's. Mai appears in the 2010 King Of Fighters Live-Action motion picture - as a main character. She is portrayed by Maggie Q. She is wearing more casual clothes rather than her red outfit from the games.Orochi  The Orochi (\u30aa\u30ed\u30c1) in The King of Fighters is a version of the Kusanagi legend. He is the final boss of The King of Fighters '97. He has white hair, white trousers, and a tattoo across his chest, though this appearance is mainly due to his possession of Chris. The tattoo on his chest represents the eight-headed serpent from the legend. Orochi's form as seen in KOF97 is merely Orochi changing Chris' form to represent the strong-willed fighters of the tournament. His origins are unknown except from the legends told about him. Orochi's true form, as the multi-headed serpent of myth who is among the few depictions that does not show its intents as an outright villain, is seen in Iori Yagami's ending in SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom, in which Orochi speaks to Iori, tempting him to give in to the Riot of Blood. Orochi's storyline, linking itself to Gaia, and being called \"God's Messenger,\" appears to have been inspired from a mix of Neopaganism and Shinto such as Orochi having a direct preference for nature, represented by Gaia, he is also a twist of Christianity and Satanism from The Book of Revelations appearing to be a god-like figure and a demonic serpent in his true form who usurps the redemptions and damnation methods of Christ as well as the nihilist and occultist methods of Satan. Though in the series, the name Orochi is written in Katakana, the name typically translate as The Great Serpent.History  The Orochi, a serpentine being that could cause incredible amounts of destruction and death was originally defeated 1,800 years ago by the members of the Kusanagi, Yasakani, and Yata clans. After rescuing the Sacrificial Maiden, Princess Kushinada, the Yasakani held Orochi in place, the Kusanagi dealt the final blow, and the Yata sealed it off. However, 1,140 years later, when the Kusanagi clan was considered to be the strongest of the three clans and the Yasakani the weakest of the three, the Yasakani clan made a blood pact that allowed them to use the power of Orochi. Such power came at a cost: the Yasakani, now known as Yagami, wielded purple flames and were doomed to live very short lives, with their matriarchs dying in childbirth. This action led to a violent feud between the Kusanagi and the Yagami, and many members of both clans lost their lives. The murder of the leader of the Yata clan in the present day released the seal that had kept Orochi bound away. Hearing of this, the heiress to the Yata, Chizuru Kagura, organized the 1996 King of Fighters tournament in order to unite the two warring clans, represented by Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami. In the 1997 KoF tournament, the Sacred Warriors of the Orochi rise and directly try to resurrect Orochi itself, who is reincarnated as an adolescent boy named Chris. Also, they kidnap Kyo's girlfriend Yuki, who is believed to be the last descendant of Princess Kushinada. After saving Yuki, Kyo deals the final blow to Orochi as Iori holds the serpentine messenger in place, and Chizuru seals it off... just like 1800 years ago... In 2003, a strange group called \"heralds\" made an attempt to break the seal, thus putting humanity in peril yet again. It seemed there were more entities other than the Hakkeshu themselves who were interested in the power of Orochi, and thus made attempts to release him from his current ensealment. Although unable to completely release Orochi, they damaged the seal, enough to make Orochi's influence felt in the world. The heralds intend to siphon the power of the Orochi for their leader's use.Personality  Orochi is extremely critical towards humans, accusing them to be ignorant, or have not changed through the years. Even though continuously defeated by the 3 forces, Kusanagi, Yasakani and Yata, Orochi has little faith in the capabilities of humanity. The reason for this is arguable; some say that this is because of how humans have treated nature, while others (and also implied in KOF97) mention that he sees no hope in the sins of humanity, and that their destruction is the only way to clean the earth. As Orochi is merely avenging the suffering humanity has mindlessly caused nature and the world, and being some sort of check-and-balance in the world of the humans, it can be seen, though not canon to the storyline (Team Edit ending), that Orochi has the capability to forgive as well, where he conceded to the strengths of the fighters after being defeated, but not without saying that they still have a chance and that he looks forward to see the change it wants or again seek destruction. Orochi is far from being a dark or evil entity, despite his true monstrous form, and Kim Kaphwan's branding. In fact, Orochi pays allegiance to Gaia, the mother of the Earth, and should probably be thought of as being chthonic in nature, rather than demonic or heavenly. What the Orochi feels and thinks seems to seep towards the The 4 Devas. Leopold Goenitz, Yashiro, and Chris, and to a somewhat lesser degree Shermie, also possesses the same degree of hatred towards humanity as Orochi would, sharing as far as actual emotions and thoughts of the Orochi itself, especially with Goenitz. (With the proof of this being his dialogues with certain characters in SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom). The same cannot be said with the others of their bloodline, like with Vice and Mature, who either lives against their mandate of the bloodline, or rebelled against it. Mizuchi, a clone of Orochi from NGBC sports the same personality, without the awareness of having followers, and is portrayed to be more messiah-like, making humans realize their error first; however, Mizuchi has identical destructive tendences as the original.Followers of the Orochi  The Orochi has eight mortal followers that fights for this serpentine entity. Curiously, this coincides with the amount of heads this serpent of legend has; four of his warriors are Heavenly Kings, two are Assassins, and two are Elementalists. Of these eight followers, the Four Devas or the Four Heavenly Kings are the most loyal to Orochi, working to set him free from the ensealment by the Yata clan. To revive Orochi, they perform a ceremony that sacrifices the life of a maiden, particularly from the Kushinada clan.The Four Devas (Four Heavenly Kings) The Assassins Other Orochi Bloodline Characters  In 1997 Iori Yagami manages to seal off Orochi despite being under the influence of Riot of the Blood. Iori demonstrated that it was possible to defeat the Orochi blood within and break the curse of the Yagami, when he wielded crimson flames, the original power of the Yasakani, instead of the purple flames that were a result of his ancestor's pact with the Orochi. Yagami had a chance to redeem his family bloodline, when Ash Crimson stripped him of the Yasakani Magatama during KOFXI. Iori is the last heir of the Yagami line, and by freeing himself of both the power and Orochi influence, he had a chance of living normally again. However, for reasons vaguely understood, he once again embraced the power and its perils in KOFXIII.The Riot of The Blood  The Riot of The Blood (called Chi no Bousou in Japan) is a frenzied state of a human being where he/she loses total control, physical faculties and sanity to the Orochi blood within. This only happens to people who are not born with 100% Orochi blood in their veins. Any of the Orochi clan or even the Orochi itself can trigger this state at mere will. The basis behind this condition is due to the resistance of the other half of the blood to the power of the Orochi. A person under the influence of Riot of The Blood can be subdued in due time, as the outburst does not last long, and as long as there is no presence of Orochi power nearby. The only characters known susceptible to this condition are Rugal Bernstein, having a little of Orochi blood gave by Goenitz at the cost of Rugal's right eye and later, his own life; Leona Heidern, half-Orochi on account of her mother's non-Orochi blood; and Iori Yagami, whose Orochi blood was transfused into the bloodline of his ancestors.Gameplay  As a playable character, Orochi possesses immense power, and borders extreme cheapness due to his mostly unstoppable techniques. He can stop just about anybody using his two super moves alone; Return to Nothingness and Enhanced Soul Stealer. He is the first SNK Boss to have a screen-filling super and a one-hit kill. Later KOF bosses like Zero and Magaki would adapt the attack concept of Return to Nothingness. Orochi is among the SNK bosses that do not have crouching attacks, until the game was ported to the Sony Playstation, with severe frame cuts. He was slightly toned down, although still possessing the power that he is known for. Orochi also uses signature attacks that some KOF characters have. Rugal's Genocide Cutter attack is similar to Orochi's hard kick, and his Double Tomahawk command attack (f + B) is identical to Orochi's close hard kick (found in Playstation version, and in Mizuchi, see trivia). In the arcade version of KOF97, he had an infinite combo that involved his reflector move. This was because the said move had zero recovering time, making it possible to cancel into several moves and deal high damage to the enemy. This flaw was fixed in the Playstation version by changing the animation of the move altogether. As of KOF97, all of his DM (Desperation Moves) are considered SDM (Super Desperation Move) caliber and strength.Appearances  Prior to his finalized appearance, SNK planned earlier in KOF97's production to make Orochi's incarnation as a naked Chris, surrounded with light.[1] Template:Wikiquote Template:King of Fighters Characters Template:Neo Geo Battle ColiseumNameless  Nameless (\u30cd\u30fc\u30e0\u30ec\u30b9) is an original character made for The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match. He was made to replace K9999 in the lineup presumably due to the copyright issues surrounding his character. Ureshino comments on his personal blog that other key concepts for Nameless were \"ninja\" and \"immediate reaction\". He is voiced by Daisuke Ono, who also provides the voice of the announcer.Story  He is the 9,999th K' clone and the only survivor of \"Project \u0416\". He has no name and is known by NESTS by his codename \u0416' or \"Zhe Prime\" -\u0416 being a Cyrillic letter with the appearance of a combination of a backwards K and a normal K (\u029eK'). For as long as he can remember, he knew only pain and suffering as a test experiment. He and his \"brothers\" (other clones dubbed as \"K' children\") were tested to see how normal DNA could withstand the Kusanagi DNA due to their unprecedented success with K'. Most of his brothers either exploded or suffered from severe burns from the genetic mutation. Nameless himself has come close to death at least 180 times. Eventually, the scientists learned that it required strong will power to keep the flame in check and focused on painful endurance tests. Nameless lived a miserable existence until he spotted a beautiful yet sad girl named Isolde. Whenever he was badly injured, he would see her near the infirmary. Though he was usually too wounded to speak to her, he fell in love with her. The thought of one day being with her kept him alive through his merciless training and experiments. Once the laboratory members deemed him fit to wield the Kusanagi flame, his custom glove was grafted onto his right arm. The glove is meant to enhance his strength of will, which would theoretically make him as adept as Kyo. After the final testing with his glove was complete, he was sent to earth to test his combat capabilities. He unintentionally killed a woman by merely tapping her shoulder. Impressed by the results, he became an assassin for NESTS. On one of his assignments, he cornered a man who was trying to escape from the syndicate. In a bid to spare his life, the escapee confessed the truth behind Isolde. She was a part of the Anti K' Project and was given the power to control ice. However, her abilities were deemed to be inadequate until she saw Nameless. Seeing the connection between the two subjects, NESTS allowed the two to routinely see one another to bring out their full potential. Regrettably, Isolde died from her testing. Rather than waste her progress, NESTS crafted her DNA into Nameless's glove. Her abilities keep the flames pacified until it's needed for use. Nameless doesn't know if he should believe the man but realizes that his words have weight to them as he hasn't seen Isolde since he received his glove. Not wanting to risk losing Isolde, he unquestionably follows any orders he's given by NESTS. He hopes to one day return her to her rightful body.Personality  A tragic young man who wishes only to be with his beloved. He locked away his emotions to follow his creators' orders without question with the hope that he can resurrect his lover.Powers Fighting Style  His fighting style is roughly the same as K9999's with the exception of several aesthetic changes. He relies more on pure instinct and less on his glove. Gameplay-wise, he is much more balanced than his predecessor and can be seen as a mid/high-tier character.Music Angel  Angel (\u30a2\u30f3\u30d8\u30eb Anheru) (pronounced Ahn-hehl as per the Spanish pronunciation of the word) is a video game character in the 2001 and 2002 releases of The King of Fighters series. She is also playable as a secret fighter in the Japanese PlayStation 2 port of The King of Fighters Neowave, but not in any overseas release. She is depicted as a sexy, white-haired Mexican who works for an organization known as NESTS. Her \"Unchain Circle\" combo attacks make her one of the more distinctive characters in the KOF series.Character design  Styleos is responsible for Angel's character design. It has been said that her appearance is the result of Styleos' \"overwhelming passion\" and that one \"can see his preferences in almost every aspect of her.\" The staff for The King of Fighters 2001 were also said to have \"splurged\" in hiring Mina Tominaga as Angel's voice actress, although her voice actor was switched to the less famous Mayumi Shintani for her appearance in The King of Fighters 2002, whose vocal clips are reused for The King of Fighters Neowave. Angel is one of the more sexual characters in the KOF series. Apart from being tied for the largest bust size of any character (92cm, the same size as Shermie), she wears a very revealing outfit and even undresses slightly during two of her win poses. Quote-wise, her taunt basically translates as \"Do I make you hard?\", and during her \"Loyalty Test for the Liberalists\" SDM, she states that she is \"Angel, 19 years old, a somewhat playful/naughty girl\" (in the fashion of a suggestive personal advertisement). Angel's fighting style incorporates elements of both Muay Thai (as seen in her stance and some of her kicks) and professional wrestling. Some of her moves and mannerisms pay homage to entertainer Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Most notably, her \"Winds Fairground\", \"Blue Monday Parade\" and \"Survivor's Banquet\" mimic his \"Laying the Smacketh Down\", \"Rock Bottom\" and \"People's Elbow\" respectively. Her 2002/Neowave intro/\"Survivor's Banquet\" quote roughly translates to \"Can you taste The Angel's extraordinary skill?\", a play on The Rock's famous \"Can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?\" catchphrase. Her taunt references Terri Runnels \"Horny Little She-Devil\" gimmick. All of Angel's attacks are named after songs by the Japanese band Soul Flower Union. The attacks themselves however, are all named in English with katakana, even when some of the songs alluded to have a Japanese title. For example, Angel's Template:Nihongo D-button throw is named after the Soul Flower Union song Template:Nihongo, which actually translates as \"Starlit Field\". Other songs, though, have English titles (written in katakana), such as \"Go-Go Futen Girl\" (Angel's C-button throw).Gameplay  The following gameplay information is on Angel as she appears in her most recent appearance in The King of Fighters Neowave. While her gameplay has stayed largely the same in her three  appearances, there are some minor differences that may be noted. Angel is unique for her \"Unchain Circle\" (UC) special attacks which must be comboed together in order to work. Angel has five \"Unchain Circle\" starter moves, six UC root moves, seven UC finish moves (including \"Loyalty Test for the Liberalists\", a 'desperation move'), and a special \"Omagatoki\" move. Each UC root move can only be comboed with two other specific UC root moves, but any of the UC starters or finishers can be used with any UC root move. Angel has only has two other special moves that aren't \"Unchain Circle\" moves:Template:Ref label \"Red Sky of Yaponesia\" and \"Mad Murder Roulette\". Another unique aspect of Angel's gameplay are her \"Winds Fair Ground\"/\"Blue Monday Parade\"/\"Survivors Banquet\" 'super desperation moves', which are some of the few 'trap' moves in the KOF series, where she does not attack unless she is hit with a melee attack while in the stance she goes into for about half a second after the move is performed. While in reality only one move, as the button input is the same for all three, the move Angel performs depends on how she is hit. Due to its short duration and unsubtle performance, it virtually requires for the opponent to be already in the middle of an attack when its performed in order for it to be executed.In-game history  In The King of Fighters 2001, Angel is introduced as an agent of the secret organization known as NESTS and is assigned to keep an eye on the experiment K9999, whose purpose is to hunt down traitorous experiments that had left NESTS. She's actually the only person who can more-or-less effectively bond with K9999, seemingly showing genuine interest in his person and role other than being a NESTS secret weapon. NESTS enters a team consisting of K9999, Angel, Kula Diamond and Foxy into the 2001 King of Fighters' tournament with intents on killing the rogue experiment K'. However, during the final moments of the tournament, it was revealed that Angel, along with K9999, was also on a mission to murder Kula and her guardians, and in the end, Angel and K9999 appear to murder Foxy. However, although Foxy has yet to appear in another KOF, this ending is considered to be non-canon, as Foxy is still officially alive. According to the 2001 novel, both Angel and K9999 disappear in the aftermath. Their whereabouts unknown.Game appearances External links ASH CRIMSON Adelheid Bernstein  Adelheid Bernstein or Adel is an SNK character who made his debut in The King of Fighters 2003, where he took the role of alternate final boss, facing by himself whole teams of 3 fighters. He's also appeared in King of Fighters XI as a sub-boss.History  Adelheid Bernstein is presumed to be Rugal's son. He has a sister named Rose, and they fly in the Sky Noah, a dark blue airship. You can face him after the fifth team as the last boss if you don't finish Kusanagi off using a DM or LDM (and thus, Chizuru and Maki don't challenge you). He'll be the game's \"fake\" last boss, and defeating him doesn't earn you an ending. Adel is known to be kind and honorable, opposite to his father's trait. When Rose was brainwashed in the events leading to KOFXIII, Adel knew something was very odd. He then contacted one of his father's victims, Heidern, and worked with him to get to the bottom of Rose's plans and mannerisms, later revealed to have been caused by a member of Those From The Past.Known techniques Related characters Angel (The King of Fighters) Bao  Bao (Chinese: \u5305; Pinyin: B\u0101o; Japanese: \u5305 Pao) was an active member of the Psycho Soldier Team through The King of Fighters '99 and The King of Fighters 2001. With his debut, he became the youngest playable character in the series.Background  Bao was an abandoned orphan left by his parents in the care of a mountain temple in China. Asked by the head priest to adopt him, Chin Gentsai agrees as Bao exhibits psycho power. Before it could get out of control, Chin decided it necessary that Bao should train with him in order to control such power, introducing the boy to Sie Kensou, his other adoptive student, and Athena Asamiya. As Bao trains with them, Kensou gradually loses his powers until they become obsolete. It is unknown how it happens, but Bao and Kensou continue to lose and gain their powers as the years progress as both of them share the same source of energy: the Dragon Spirit. It is unknown exactly how this magnificent energy works, but Ron and Misty (sole survivors of the fallen NESTS organization) seem to take an interest in it, revealing a probable importance of the Dragon Spirit in future KOF storylines.Development history  Bao was created by developers to fill in the missing gap for the team caused by the newer gaming mechanics introduced in The King of Fighters '99, specifically the expansion of teams from 3 to 4 members. The staff went through various concepts of a character to insert into the Psycho Soldier Team, including counterparts for its existing members (an idol younger than Athena, Kensou's love rival, an old woman who looks after Chin) as well as one concept involving \"a mighty male character with a scary appearance but a heart of gold and a love of nature.\" Eventually, they settled on the young boy who shared the same powers as his teammates. Because of his addition to the cast, it is remarked on the 10th Anniversary site that the average age of the Psycho Soldier Team dropped from 42 to 34.Gameplay  Bao is a relatively small target and his attacks can be weak, but his special moves allow him to be very mobile. Most of his attacks, known as the Psycho Ball Crash attacks, involve consuming himself in an aura of Psycho power, rolling into a ball, and launching himself in various directions. The mobility of these moves can allow him to attack and evade at the same time and can even be used to finish matches with a time-out. He also has projectiles that match the trajectories of his Psycho Ball Crash attacks, as well as an SDM that launched a small projectile that traveled slowly across the screen but could be \"detonated\" into a large burst for high damage. However, the power of these were adjusted according to Psycho Soldier Team's storyline; in The King of Fighters 2001, Kensou had regained more use of his powers, namely his Psycho Ball projectile, but this severely reduced Bao's Psycho Ball to a slow, small, and weak ball with incredibly short range. The projectile in his SDM also burst automatically at short range.Appearance  In all of his appearances, Bao wears an orange Chinese outfit with a large cap, long sleeved shirt and mid-thigh length shorts with white trim, black socks, and white shoes. His cap became much, much larger in The King of Fighters 2001 for unknown reasons. He is also among the shortest characters in the whole series, though he and Choi Bounge are exactly the same height.Game appearances Related characters External links Orochi Iori  evil ioriK'  K\u2032 (\u30b1\u30a4\u30fb\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5, Kei Dasshu, \"K Dash\"), sometimes known as \"K Prime\", is a character who debuted as the leader of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters '99. He stars as the reluctant hero in the NESTS saga of the series, often letting his partner Maxima handle any social necessities in his stead. To contrast the previous protagonist of the series, K' was made to be the \"dark hero\". In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the fourth fan favorite character with a total of 338 votes.Origin  The origins of both K\u2032 and Maxima can be found in the Psikyo arcade game The Fallen Angels (Daraku Tenshi in Japan). This obscure 1998 release stars an emaciated goth in tight leather pants named Cool, along with a brawny, cybernetically enhanced police officer named Harry Ness. The man responsible for the design of both characters, Shinichi Morioka, migrated to SNK shortly after The Fallen Angels was released, and elements of Cool and Harry Ness' design were used in the creation of K\u2032 and Maxima. The end result is that K\u2032 looks nearly identical to Cool. His namesake was taken from a clone character in the light novel, Blue Knight Beluzaga Monogatari, which is set in the same universe as the anime, Armored Trooper Votoms. During the early phases of development of The King of Fighters '99, K\u2032's introduction to the series was meant to remove popular characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami from the roster -though this idea was scrapped in the game's release. He is voiced by Yuuki Matsuda and Andrew Scott.Design  K' sticks to the same design in every game. He has white hair, hazel eyes and tanned skin. He also wears a full shiny leather ensemble that consists of a black leather jacket, leather pants, and a red glove that controls his fire.King of Fighters (series) Leona Heidern  Leona (\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca, Reona), also known under her codename Leona Heidern (\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c7\u30eb\u30f3, Reona Haiderun), is a character introduced in The King of Fighters '96 as the new member to the Ikari Team. Before production for her debut game began, developers wanted to create a suitable replacement for Heidern as a part of the game's overhaul. Leona was conceived to be an Orochi descendant by the time of her debut and her designers took special care to let their interests at the time reflect in her actions. Her official nickname is The Silent Soldier. In an interview with one of the series designers, Shinkiro, he replies that Leona is his favorite original character in the series. Aside from the main body of the King of Fighters series, Leona is also featured in a one-shot chapter in the spin-off manga, The King of Fighters: Kyo and has her own character image album.Story  Leona was born in an unnamed village, residing with her family. When she was just a child, Goenitz arrived at her home and demanded to talk with Guidel, the leader of the village. He requested that Guidel join him in their duties to serve Orochi, as everyone in the village were Orochi bloodline members. However, Guidel refused as he and his family liked peace and not the violent tendencies created by the Orochi blood. Enraged, Goenitz leaves, but not before smiling towards Leona. The same night, Leona underwent the Riot of Blood and slaughtered everyone in the village. Goenitz, pleased by the results, puts her blood lust and her memories of her life to rest for another time \"when he needs her again\". Dazed, she wanders aimlessly until she is found and later adopted by Heidern. Surprised by her natural fighting ability, he decides to raise her as a warrior under his command. In 1996, Leona is in her late teens and a capable mercenary. She receives her first official mission: she must take Heidern's place in the Ikari Team for the year's King of Fighters tournament. Her partners were Heidern's favorite mercenaries: Ralf and Clark. Their mission was to investigate Geese Howard, the Southtown kingpin of crime, who had entered the tournament in search of an unknown goal. Knowing that anything Geese may be after could only mean trouble, the new Ikari Team began their mission. During the events of the '96 finals, Goenitz confronts her and reminds her of her Orochi lineage, causing her to worry about the future. Her troubled state carried over to the battlefield, which eventually lead to her and her partners' suspension from military service. Wanting to cheer her up, Ralf enlists them again in the the next year's tournament. She eventually remembers her past fully during the events of King of Fighters '97. Towards the tournament finals, Leona, along with Iori, suddenly went into the Riot of the Blood, induced by Orochi. By the tournament's end, she is successfully subdued and Orochi is sealed away again. Even so, Leona regrets her actions and attempts to end her life. Ralf stops her, and encourages her to continue living. Leona stays as a member of Ikari team for each and every King of Fighters tournaments during the NESTS saga. It was assumed she partook in her normal duties with Heidern during this time frame. In 2003, at the end of the tournament, Orochi's presence was getting stronger, as the seal was broken again. She entered the Riot of the Blood again and attacked Ralf and Clark, badly injuring them. She was pulled out of the team by Heidern in The King of Fighters XI due to the emotional trauma she suffered after the incident.Personality  Leona is a reticent individual who has trouble expressing herself outside of combat or a mission. Aside from Ralf, Whip, Clark and Commander Heidern, Leona does not talk to anyone. Due to her past, she often keeps her emotions in check as she is afraid of losing control and hurting her friends because of her Orochi blood. She often feels lonely, but is comforted with the new family she has found with the Ikari mercenaries.Powers Fighting Style  She shares several moves with her adoptive father, Heidern. The V-shaped slashmarks that appear at the end of her V-Slasher Desperation Move and Super DM are an homage to Choudenji Machine Voltes V -- the titular giant robot had an attack in which it made a V-shaped slash through the enemy, leaving a glowing V for a few dramatic moments before it is destroyed. Her Rebel Spark Desperation Move and Super Desperation Move where she plants an explosive on her opponent then moving away from the opponent while making a pose, is actually a homage to Kamen Rider Black RX -- a Japanese tokusatsu show where the hero impaled his enemy and proceed to do the same pose as sparks came out from his opponent's belly and eventually exploded. Also, her jumping CD attack (Strong attack which knocks the opponent away using both the heavy punch/kick buttons.) resembles Kamen Rider Black's version of the Rider Kick, owing to the sudden, unexplained glow of reddish energy around her foot, and being performed while in the air. Another sentai homage includes her exploding earrings (Himitsu Sentai Goranger). Her other moves take their namesakes from Grendizer and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.Music Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similiar Character Trivia Movelist The King Of Fighters '96  Throws -

His character design is heavily inspired by the character Tetsuo Shima from the 1988 animated film Akira. His name is a homage to a character in the anime, Armored Trooper Votoms. He was believed to be copyrighted by Eolith though SNK has expressed public disfavor for K9999 -presumably due to the explicitness of his tribute- and it is unlikely he will appear in the future. In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the seventh fan favorite character with a total of 156 votes. He is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki, who happens to be the same person who voiced Tetsuo in the Japanese version of Akira. He is 16 years old officially.Goenitz  Goenitz (\u30b2\u30fc\u30cb\u30c3\u30c4, G\u0113nittsu) is a video game character who made his first appearance in the Neo Geo fighting game, The King of Fighters '96 as the last boss, following Chizuru Kagura. He is one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Orochi, with the power to command wind; his full title as a heavenly king is \"Fuki Susabu Kaze no Goenitz (\u5439\u304d\u8352\u3076\u98a8\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30cb\u30c3\u30c4, Goenitz of the Wildly-Blowing Wind)\". Goenitz took his namesake from an alien character in the anime, Space Battleship Yamato. His Heavenly King title is a reference to the 1979 opening theme of Cyborg 009. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Goenitz ranked 46 of the staff's favorite characters. He shared the spot with seven other characters, including Fighter's History character Makoto Mizoguchi, and Street Fighter character, Akuma. He is voiced by Yoshinori Shima.Story  Ever since Goentiz was young, he knew his duty as a Heavenly King and made haste to revive his lord Orochi. In an attempt to reach this means, he became a religious missionary who would travel to those in need. When he was eighteen, he challenged Rugal and easily defeated the older man by taking out one of his opponent's eyes. As an experiment, he granted his opponent some of Orochi's power to see if he could become a valid host for the entity. Goenitz eventually assigns the task of observing the crimelord to two other Hakkeshu, Mature and Vice. Meanwhile, he paid a visit to a remote village where Hakesshu member, Guidel, was staying. To his surprise, Guidel was living a peaceful life and had no interest in their lord's mission. In response, Goenitz activated the Riot of the Blood in Leona which lead to the death of her parents. Pleased with the results, he sealed away her memories and continued to look for ways of speeding up his lord's revival. He notices that the seal is too strong for his lord so he paid a visit to the Yata household. He murders the current head of the clan, Maki Kagura, to break the seal's power. Sometime after the 1995 tournament, he also decides to track the Three Sacred Treasures that previously defeated his lord. Since he had previously judged Chizuru and the two secretaries were keeping an eye on Iori, Goenitz decided to personally test Kyo's strength. Although he expected a glorious fight from the 1995 champion, he defeated the Kusanagi heir with ease. He interrupts the 1996 tournament to finally end all three heirs at once. Although the exact events of the tournament remain unclear, he officially dies during the tournament's conclusion. He either commits suicide or is defeated by Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru. He is said to be the Hakkeshu leader, and leader of the Four Heavenly Kings of Orochi.Personality  Though influenced by Orochi, he retains much of the mannerisms and civility of a priest, which is reflected in his winning poses and his elegant, somewhat flowery speech. He sports the same \"messiah\" attitude that aspires to \"save\" people and dispatch disbelievers. He shows great hostility towards characters of demonic origins such as Demitri Maximoff and Red Arremer.Powers Fighting Style  Goenitz fights mainly with his control over wind with little concern for utilizing any established combative techniques. Like the other Four Kings, his moves are all written using the Cyrillic alphabet. His trademark move, Yonokaze, is a tornado that comes up at random, slicing any foe it touches.Music The King of Fighters characters  The King of Fighters series contains many characters, some of which are from other SNK fighting games, and some of which have appeared in other games. This is a list of characters that have appeared in a fighting capacity since its original incarnation in 1994.Cast Creation and Influences  In an interview with veteran developers, they say that their prototype version for KOF was going to be a side-scrolling beat 'em up titled, Survivor. In this version, it would only use core characters from the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury series, specifically allowing players to play Robert Garcia and Terry Bogard for location testing. However, the idea was scrapped after the debut of Capcom's game with similar gameplay, Final Fight. Since they were attached to the idea of the two series cross-over, they eventually agreed to make their idea into a fighting game. Characters from Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier games were also added in spirit of other gaming genres considered for their final product. Flagship director, Toyohisa Tanabe, asserts that the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury fighters were added specifically for adults. The newer KoF characters -especially for the first game- were aimed to appeal to younger and newer audiences. He adds that every original character for the series is added based on the developers' strong desire to make one. For example, he agreed to include characters such as Benimaru and Chang to add an off-beat variety to the cast, which he previously deemed to be too serious before. Later in the series, their approach to creating their characters altered slightly to also serve as a type of fan service, which he refers to as a collaborative effort between fans and the staff. Several characters that appear in the series are parodies or homages to either anime, manga, actors, films or television shows that the creators are interested in. Noticeable examples are K9999 and Zero. Characters are sometimes added at the seiy\u016b's convenience or to fill in gaps that occur for each installment's story; this happens with Duck King in The King of Fighters XI and Ryuji Yamazaki in The King of Fighters '97.Sub Lists Storyline specific  Characters: Chris, Goenitz, Magaki, Mukai, Orochi, Shermie, Shion, Yashiro Characters: Angel, Igniz, K9999, Krizalid, Original Zero, ZeroSeparate continuity  KOF: Maximum Impact is a series that occurs in a separate continuity from the main games. The King of Fighters EX is a series that occurs in a separate continuity from the main games.Characters Ash Crimson  http://kingoffighters.wikia.com/wiki/ASH_CRIMSONBenimaru Nikaido  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo debuted as one of the members of the \"Japan Team\" during the Orochi Saga (also composed with Kyo Kusanagi and Goro Daimon). He forms his own team dubbed the \"Benimaru Team\" in 2000. Benimaru is born of half-Japanese and American descent, and wears a waist-length sleeveless top with matching jeans/pants. In his later appearances, his top is shorter, exposing his abs. His top is plain black (with short sleeves from '98 to 2002), until it changes to a leopard spot motif in The King of Fighters 2003 and beyond. His straight hair during fights stays up due to a rather exaggerated case of electrostatics. He also appears playable in Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 and Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001. He was loosely based on the character Polnareff from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, right down to his outfit in The King of Fighters '94 and The King of Fighters '95. Even after Benimaru's name was decided on, the game developers continued to refer to him as Polnareff. Additionally, his taunt in The King of Fighters XI mirrors Polnareff's stature from the manga. His vocal performance was initially deemed by his original designer to have nothing to do with the character's original image. Benimaru, while sometimes outspoken and flamboyant, means business in battle since he's very proud of his skills and doesn't want anyone to look down on him for his good looks. He also likes to say English quotes upon winning a battle. He also respects ladies, as shown with a special introduction pose before engaging in battle with a female opponent. Even though he tends to be more than a flighty flirt, when it comes to certain things (along with seeming as if he has an indecisive mind), Benimaru in fact has a heart of gold, his loyalty and respect can go a long way and even behind the American exterior he still holds close the Japanese personality traits. His fighting technique specializes in shooting techniques and electricity. His character also pays homage to the Tatsunoko character, Hurricane Polymar. The attacks Shinkuu Katategoma, Handou Sandan Geri and Gen'ei Hurricane take their names and functions directly from the aforementioned character. Due to the particular pitch in his voice, some fans have voiced question to Benimaru's sexuality to developers, to which they respond, \"It's not what you think. (Not that there's anything wrong with that).\" In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Benimaru was voted as the staff's thirteenth favorite character. He tied the spot with Samurai Shodown character, Hisame Shizumaru.Template:-Brian Battler  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is one of the members of the American Sports Team in The King of Fighters '94. He was supposed to come from an earlier SNK game, Football Frenzy. Early designs of Brian depicted him in more traditional football player fashion, but his final design left him without a helmet and a more \"casual\" uniform. This was done to make him not look exactly like the character Johnny Maximum in the World Heroes series. Despite being named MVP of the year, he had a violent behavior and only found pleasure in tackling his opponents. He was asked by Heavy D! to fill in the missing spot to the three man team, to which he agreed. In their non-canonical team ending of the King of Fighters '94 tournament, Brian claimed he was going to return to playing football for his fans. A running gag seems to exist with the USA Sports team, where they will receive invitations to that year's KOF tournament, only to be beaten senseless and have their invitations stolen from them by another team. This happened to them in 1995, 1997, and 2000 (with Iori's Team -1995-, the New Faces Team -1997-, and Vanessa, Ramon, and Seth -2000- being the respective culprits), and to Lucky Glauber in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum (with Shermie being the assailant). Template:-Candy Diamond  Template:General CVG character Candy first appeared as Kula's starting striker in The King of Fighters 2000. Template:-Chang Koehan  Template:General CVG character Chang Koehan (Korean: Template:Lang, Japanese: Template:Lang Chan K\u014dhan), is one of the reoccurring members of the Korean Team in the series. In Korean, 'Koehan' means \"giant man\", although the more common and generic term for a giant is 'Guh-in' (Korean: \uac70\uc778). He is one of the many characters in the series to fight with a weapon, a ball and chain. He also appears as a playable character in Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, using Choi as his unplayable partner. He was once a feared and violent criminal in Korea. He was spotted by Kim from a prison's surveillance footage and he wanted to use Chang's strength \"for justice\". Though Chang easily broke out of prison, he was caught by Kim and forced to undergo Kim's \"Rehabilitation project\" in KOF. During this time, he befriends a fellow convict who was also caught by Kim, Choi Bounge. Together, they initially schemed for ways of escape but they eventually mellow out and enjoy their companions' company -with protests saying otherwise. Because both him and Choi convinced Kim to join the Garou Team in The King of Fighters XI, they appear in the Garou Team's ending celebrating with them at the PaoPao Cafe. Smart Chang, an alternate Striker featured in The King of Fighters 2000, is a well-built and younger looking version of him. Template:-Chin Gentsai  Template:General CVG character Chin Gentsai (\u93ae\u5143\u658e) is one of the original members of the Psycho Soldier Team, which first appeared in The King of Fighters '94. His character's age and fighting style were considered to be essential for the series when developers were selecting fighters for the roster. He is the elderly mentor to Athena Asamiya, Sie Kensou, and Bao, instructing them to better harness their psychic powers (or Psycho Powers as it is dubbed by SNK) in the mountains of China. Chin teaches them in preparations for \"the worst case scenario of oncoming evil\" and uses the tournaments as a way of training his disciples. Things take a turn for the worse with the introduction of the Dragon Spirit between Bao and Kensuo, with Chin having suspicions on the cause of its emergence. He pulls the team out of competition in 2003 to observe the matter throughly, asking K' and Maxima to investigate the tournament in his place for activity. During the year of the team's absence, he extensively trains Kensou's budding psycho powers -which were regained mysteriously after 2001- to be normal again. Template:-Choi Bounge  Template:General CVG character Choi Bounge (Korean: Template:Lang, Japanese: Template:Lang Choi Bonge) is one of the original members of the Korean Team, along with Chang Koehan and Kim Kaphwan. In Korean, 'Bounge' (more appropriately spelled and pronounced as 'Bungeh') means 'lightning'. He is one of the many fighters in the series who fights with a weapon; his weapons are dual leather-gloved claws. His original costume was changed at the last minute to avoid distinct similarities with horror film character, Freddy Krueger. He speaks with a playful theatrical accent, often ending his sentences with \"-de yansu\". He also has his own character image song, entitled Choi Bounge Ondo, which is played briefly during his entrances in The King of Fighters '98. He appears alongside Chang as a unplayable command character in Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001 and becomes playable in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos. He was a late-night predator who chanced to have stalked on Kim during one of his nightly walks. After he was bested by his prey, Choi was forced by Kim to undergo his \"Rehabilitation project\", in hopes of using the criminal's skills not \"in the name of evil.\" During this time, he also met and befriended fellow criminal, Chang Koehan. Since then, the two have attempted to escape from Kim's training with little success, stressed often to the point of comic relief. The situation hasn't gotten any more lenient with the arrival of Jhun Hoon, who shares Kim's overzealous passion for justice and rehabilitation. Cool Choi, an alternate Striker featured in The King of Fighters 2000, is a taller and darker version of him. Template:-Diana  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who was introduced in The King of Fighters 2000. Aside from assisting and appearing along side Kula, she appears as Maxima's Maniac Striker in The King of Fighters 2000. Template:-Duo Lon  Template:General CVG character Duo Lon (Chinese: \u5815\u74cf; Pinyin: Du\u00f2l\u00f3ng; Japanese: \u30c7\u30e5\u30aa\u30ed\u30f3 Dyuoron) is a video game character who made his first appearance in The King of Fighters 2003 as a member of the year's Hero Team. He is the first male character from The Flying Brigands to resemble a \"handsome\" man and the first to sport an ornate design. His overall look was based on anime title character, Vampire Hunter D. He is a member of the assassin group, the Flying Brigands, -or Template:Nihongo Clan in Japanese- and the half-brother to Xiao Lon. He is an acquaintance of Ash Crimson and Shen Woo. Hoping to hunt down the clan's traitor, Ron, he agrees to enter the tournament with them. However, after discovering Ash's true objectives, he teams up with Elisabeth Blanctorche and Benimaru Nikaido. Information on Duo Lon's design graphy revealed he is one of the nine children of Ron, an assassin who chased after his own father. The design information also pointed out that he is said to be the strongest warrior of the Hizoku clan, a silent guy with rather forgiving nature. Falcoon's one-paged official comic, titled \"Assassin Night\", features Duo Lon on a mission to assassinate one of the guests at a formal social party. The other \"Four Devas\" of the Brigands (Luan, Chat and Sai) are also in this story. Template:-Elisabeth Blanctorche  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is one of three original characters debuting in The King of Fighters XI. Her initial character concept was to be the rival to Ash though developers decided to change her importance into a \"leading lady\" character. Her earlier design resembled a tougher modern-day equestrian including a short whip -instead of her final weapon as a magic wand with whip-like motions. Developers also describe her fighting style as \"orthodox with subtle tricks [to it]\" despite her minimal moveset. She also appears in the ONA promotional series The King of Fighters: Another Day. She initially invites Benimaru and Duo Lon to France to reveal that she knows of the betrayal of Ron, the burning of the Hizoku village, and Ash Crimson's theft of Chizuru Kagura's mirror. They form the Rival Team, and she eventually reveals her acquaintance with Ash, whom she scolds for seeming to forsake their mission. Template:-Foxy  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo first appears as one of Kula's alternative strikers in The King of Fighters 2000. She becomes playable in The King of Fighters 2001 as a member of the NESTS team. She ties her hair with the flag of the NESTS organization. She is considered a tribute to Cutey Honey for the following reasons: her sword is very similar, the manner she dresses, her ability to change from outfits in a flash, and her fighting styleTemplate:Fact. She was originally not planned to be playable and was going to enter the series roster with Diana though time constraints prevented the latter from happening. Although she appears to be mortally wounded during her team's scenario, developers assure players that Foxy is still alive and well. She is a loyal agent of NESTS who was ordered with her college, Diana, to supervise the product of the Anti-K' project: Kula Diamond. They were dispatched to eliminate the rogue agent, Zero, as he was considered a burden to their organization. After their success, Foxy was ordered by her supervisors to enter the next tournament with Kula and two other untrusted agents, K9999 and Angel. After she discovers that the original president of NESTS was murdered by Igniz, she stops her loyalties to the NESTS cartel and joins Diana in becoming an independent party. She is widely considered to be one of the top tier characters during her playable debut.Template:Fact Template:-Goro Daimon  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who debuted as a member to the Hero Team in The King of Fighters '94, along with Kyo Kusanagi and Benimaru Nikaido. His character was created to add a practitioner of Judo to the cast and many elements from his original designs, such as his geta and his victory cries, remained for his final look. In The King of Fighters '97, the Orochi form of Yashiro Nanakase became his elemental rival, as both men share the ability to manipulate earth. Daimon is a former gold medalist of Judo and a mentor to his own dojo. In 1994, he participated in a tournament to determine the fighters who would represent Japan's team for the year's King of Fighters tournament. He loses to Kyo in the preliminary rounds but was chosen as one of the three members for his country. He continues to team with Kyo and Benimaru and becomes friends with them as the years pass. After the climax of The King of Fighters '97, Goro retires from being a fighter and returns to the Judo circuit representing Japan. During his retirement from the tournaments, he married and fathered a son named Daigoro. He returns as a fighter in his later appearances due to either Kyo or Benimaru's requests. Daimon always seems to have a very serious expression, and grunts a lot. However, he has a very warm heart, as he always takes his time to co-exist with nature and encounter himself there. He also likes to teach youngsters about Judo in his free time. He also takes his time to serve as an adviser and as a mediator between Kyo and Benimaru. Template:-Heavy D!  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who first appeared in The King of Fighters '94 as the leader to the American Sports Team. He was added to the series in spirit of other boxing characters popular at the time and gained his tall stature to separate himself from the rest of the cast. Being a famous boxer, but removed from regular competition due to once having nearly killed an opponent in the ring, Heavy receives an invitation to the KOF '94 tournament, forming a team with Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler. After the tournament ends, Heavy D! decides to tag along with Lucky and continue to look for fights all around the world, as he claims he can \"live only in battles\". Like the other members in his team, his invitation is stolen by other teams as a series' running gag. Template:-Heidern  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character best known as a fighter in The King of Fighters series though he originated from an older SNK title, Ikari III: The Rescue, appearing during the game's cutscenes. He debuted as a playable character in The King of Fighters '94 in the Brazil Team (later known as the Ikari Team), along with Ralf and Clark. He was conceptualized to be a \"cold-blooded killing machine\", but his designer grew attached to Heidern and gave him a tragic past. While he may be intimidating in appearance, Heidern is actually a calm individual who deeply cares for his subordinates. Heidern is the commander of the Ikari Warriors, and issues commands to his adopted daughter Leona Heidern and his best soldiers Clark Still, Whip, and Ralf Jones; and is also known as the \"General of the soldiers of Fortune\". He is the master of his own brutal self-made martial art, involving cutting with the use of bladed gloves, which seem to conceal explosives and a form of energy generator (used for his signature attack, Storm Bringer, which is a reference to the infamous Stormbringer sword). In 1986 (eight years prior to The King of Fighters '94 tournament), Rugal Bernstein kidnapped Heidern's wife, Sandra, and daughter, Clara, and challenged him to try and take them back from him. Heidern had no choice but to take the bait, and he and his men directly assaulted Rugal at his Blacknoah. Rugal killed all of Heidern's men by himself, saving Heidern for last. Before Rugal could finish him off, Heidern's family intervened, and sacrificed themselves to save him. The incident left Heidern alone, and missing an eye. After that, Heidern's only mission was to get his revenge. He found Leona, as the last survivor of a destroyed village, during a mission deep in an unknown jungle. He asked her many questions, but Leona remained unresponsive. Realizing it was useless to try and ask her anything more, Heidern decided to keep her at the base for the time being, until he could send her to an orphanage. However, when Heidern came back from a mission, he saw Leona slash a tree to the ground with her hands. Surprised at this display of power, Heidern thought it would be better for the girl to stay with him and train as a soldier. Immediately, Leona began her training under Heidern's orders. She learned all of Heidern's techniques, due to her incredible ability to cut with her hands. Heidern was surprised at how much Leona progressed; she seemed predisposed towards fighting. After he had re-established his team, the Ikari Warriors, he went after Rugal to get his revenge. Beginning in The King of Fighters '96, he assigns Leona to take his place in the tournaments while he issues orders from the sidelines. He continues to play a major part in one of the series' subplots. Template:-Hinako Shijou  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is an original character who was first introduced as a member of the Women Team in The King of Fighters 2000. She was originally modeled after manga title character, Jarinko Chie, who is a brash young women that fights with sumo moves. After designer's protests, her character was radically changed to instead be a naive but warm-hearted high school girl in nobility. She is also a character who became less popular than expected, perhaps due to the lack of female sumo wrestlers at the time. She attends in an all girl school and grew to value sumo's techniques after watching a professional match. Hoping to practice along with her classmates, she tries to create a female sumo club at her school but the idea fails to gain support. Once she hears about the Women Team auditioning for a member, Hinako enters and succeeds in proving her worth by defeating Yuri Sakazaki in a mock match. She continues to appear for their team until The King of Fighters 2003 where she was asked to team with Athena Asamiya and Malin to form the \"High School Girl\" Team. All of her moves are named after real sumo moves. Template:-Jhun Hoon  Template:General CVG character Jhun Hoon (Korean: Template:Lang, Japanese: Template:Lang Jon F\u016bn) is a reoccurring member of the Korean team after his debut in The King of Fighters '99. He is the friendly rival of Kim Kaphwan. He has known Kim since childhood since they trained at the same dojo. They both became masters of separate, stylized aspects of Taekwondo and parted ways from one another. Upon a meeting with Kim, Jhun Hoon noticed the presence of Kim's new \"Rehabilitation project\" consisting of Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge. After seeing Kim's ethics and methods of training, Jhun Hoon decided that he would show him a more \"efficient\" (violent) way of management. He continues to challenge Kim on his methods of enforcement and his skills as a fighter, to which they agree to work together during this time. He is a perfectionist to his students and proud of his ideals of justice and Tae Kwon Do. Though strict and collected during fights and training, he is a moe and pop-star enthusiast during his free time. He particularly likes Athena Asamiya's performances and will lose face to get an autograph from her. The canon reason for his absence in The King of Fighters 2001 was due to his over enthusiasm for such a case where he broke his arm chasing an image of her. Jhun is a unique character because he can actively switch between three fighting stances, counting his starting one. The other two are called Hawk Style and Eagle Style, Jhun can even perform specials that are unique to these stances. An unused design of Jhun appears as a Striker named Kang Baedal in The King of Fighters 2000.Template:-K'  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who debuted as the leader of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters '99. He stars as the reluctant hero in the NESTS saga of the series, often letting his partner Maxima handle any social necessities in his stead. To contrast the previous protagonist of the series, K' was made to be the \"dark hero\". He also appears as a playable character in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum. The origins of both K\u2032 and Maxima can be found in the Psikyo arcade game The Fallen Angels (Daraku Tenshi in Japan). This obscure 1998 release stars an emaciated goth in tight leather pants named Cool, along with a brawny, cybernetically enhanced police officer named Harry Ness. The man responsible for the design of both characters migrated to SNK shortly after The Fallen Angels was released, and elements of Cool and Harry Ness' design were used in the creation of K\u2032 and Maxima. The end result is that K\u2032 looks nearly identical to Cool. His namesake was taken from a clone character in the light novel, Blue Knight Beluzaga Monogatari, which is set in the same universe as the anime, Armored Trooper Votoms. During the early phases of development of The King of Fighters '99, K\u2032's introduction to the series was meant to remove popular characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami from the roster -though this idea was scrapped in the game's release. K\u2032 possesses what may very well be the oddest HDM in the game The King of Fighters 2002, the Crimson Star Ride has K\u2032 slide forward a very short distance, and if he touches the opponent, he teleports behind them, angrily throws a \"thumbs-down\" (one of his winposes) and the opponent explodes in a ball of fire for considerable damage. This move returns in KOF: Maximum Impact 2, only working as a \"reversal-type\" super instead. K's Chain Drive super (now his LDM as of The King of Fighters 2003) undergoes an aesthetic change each game, but always works the same way with K' throwing his sunglasses at the opponent before rushing in with a powerful combination attack. Another K\u2032 (K\u2032's Another Striker in The King of Fighters 2000) is commonly believed and mistaken to be what K\u2032 used to look like before he was injected with the DNA. Quoting from the KOF 10th Anniversary website, it was the final rendition of K\u2032 outside of a last-minute hairstyle change.Template:-Kula Diamond  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo first appeared in the series as the sub-boss in The King of Fighters 2000; she enters as a normal participant in her other appearances. Her original hair color is chestnut brown, but it changes to a light blue when she activates her powers. She's often seen with her companions, Diana, Foxy and Candy Diamond. She was designed to be the antagonistic foil to K', in an attempt to better develop characteristics of the NESTS cartel. She was specially made with attempts to depict a \"14-year-old girl\" with \"appropriately girlish\" gestures with help from newly hired female staff. She is a being created by NESTS to exterminate the cartel's traitor, K'. She possesses the same design as K', with DNA altered to use ice powers instead. Despite the fact that their subject was a mindless puppet with no sign of emotions (aside from being an innocent young girl), the NESTS cartel was not willing to repeat the same mistake they made with K'. Therefore, NESTS created an android called Candy Diamond, who would monitor Kula's behavior and assure that Kula would accomplish her missions, providing assistance in battle if she was needed. NESTS also assigned two of their top agents (Diana and Foxy) to supervise and prevent any sort of betrayal by Kula. She is often ordered by either Diana or Foxy to exterminate other traitors to NESTS -such as Zero or Igniz- but has been known to disobey her orders for the sake of others, such as the destruction of the Zero Cannon. After NESTS' destruction, she allies herself on friendly terms with her created target, K' and his companions, understanding that both their lives were ruined by NESTS. Whip affectionally refers to her as the \"little sister\" of the group.Template:-Leona  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character introduced in The King of Fighters '96 as the new member to the Ikari Team. Before production for her debut game began, developers wanted to create a suitable replacement for Heidern as a part of the game's overhaul. Leona was conceived to be an Orochi descendant by the time of her debut and her designers took special care to let their interests at the time reflect in her actions. In an interview with one of the series designers, Shinkiro, he replies that Leona is his favorite original character in the series. Leona is also a playable character in \"Metal Slug Survivors\" and \"Metal Slug Soldiers\" -both mobile games, the hand-held game SNK Gals' Fighters, and the crossover title SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium. Aside from the main body of the King of Fighters series, Leona is also featured in a one-shot chapter in the spin-off manga, The King of Fighters: Kyo and has her own character image album. Leona is very quiet and does not like to talk much. She has a cold attitude, and, aside from Ralf, Whip, Clark and Commander Heidern, Leona does not talk to anyone. She seems fearless on the outside, but she is afraid of hurting her friends because of her Orochi blood. Leona hates the sight of blood (because of the massacre she caused as a youth), but when she fights, she always seems to get covered in it. She's often lonely, but knows that Ralf, Whip, and Clark are always behind her. She shares several moves with her adoptive father, Heidern. The V-shaped slashmarks that appear at the end of her V-Slasher Desperation Move and Super DM are an homage to Choudenji Machine Voltes V -- the titular giant robot had an attack in which it made a V-shaped slash through the enemy, leaving a glowing V for a few dramatic moments before it is destroyed. Her Rebel Spark Desperation Move and Super Desperation Move where she plant a dynamite to her opponent then moving away from the opponent while making a pose, is actually a homage to Kamen Rider Black RX -- a Japanese tokusatsu show where the hero impale his enemy and proceed to do the same pose as sparks coming out from his opponent's belly and eventually explodes. Also, her jumping CD attack (Strong attack which knocks the opponent away using both the heavy punch/kick buttons.) resembles Kamen Rider Black's version of the Rider Kick, owing to the sudden, unexplained glow of reddish energy around her foot, and being performed while in the air. While she is experiencing the Riot of The Blood, her hair turns pink and her eyes are white. She has the ability to move and jump faster than normal. She retains all of her moves, but can generally execute and recover from them quicker. Players can select this form of Leona through a special code in The King of Fighters '97. Though non canon, Leona has the power to transform into her Orochi form in The King of Fighters 2002 and The King of Fighters Neowave. Template:-Lin  Template:General CVG character Lin (Chinese: \u9e9f; Pinyin: L\u00edn; Japanese: \u9e9f Rin) was one of the new characters introduced in The King of Fighters 2000 as a member of the Benimaru Team. He, along with the Flying Brigands subplot, was created without the entire staff's knowledge, leading to some developers being surprised by his team's ending. Though he is no longer an active member in KOF, his story and character have not been abandoned. He is one of the \"Four Devas\" of the the assassination group, The Flying Brigands -or Template:Nihongo Clan in Japanese- which is apparently on the brink of ruin. He was enticed by the agent Seth to enter the King of Fighters tournament in order to find their clan's missing leader, Ron. After learning that Ron had defected to NESTS, he tracks the activities of NESTS' renegades, K' and company, in hopes of finding his leader. He continues to search for Ron even after NESTS' destruction, presumably meaning to execute him. For an unexplained reason, he appears next to Ron in the Psycho Soldier Team's ending in The King of Fighters XI. He is a master of the Poison Hand technique, which enables the user to turn their own blood into venom. Template:-Lucky Glauber  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo first appeared in The King of Fighters '94 as a member of the American Sports Team. His prototype design was based on the character Hakim in the martial arts film, Game of Death. His current design exists due to the plainness of the original though his karate stayed as a remnant to his tribute. Lucky is a karate champion who is also a former professional basketball player who is asked by his friend, Heavy D!, to form a team with him in the King of Fighters tournament. Aside from his desire to help bolster his friend's confidence, Lucky joins the tournament to test his fighting ability. In their ending, he says he'll continue street fighting. He, along with the rest of the members of the American Sports Team, have a running gag in the history of KOF which involves their invitations being stolen by other participants. Similarly, in the backstory of Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, Shermie defeats Lucky and takes his invitation to the tournament. Template:-Malin  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who debuts in The King of Fighters 2003 as a member of the High School Girls Team (alongside Athena Asamiya and Hinako Shijou). Her addition to the series was made due to Choi's absence in the game of her debut. The game producers state that her name should be spelled as Malin and not Marin, adding that \"this is the humble preference of the supervising designer and a mystery to us all\". She becomes a member of the Anti-Kyokugenryu Team in The King of Fighters XI due to her animosity towards one of the style's practitioners, Yuri Sakazaki.Template:-Mature  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo appears as a member of Iori's Team in The King of Fighters '96. The designers at the time created both Mature and Vice with the image of a \"ruthless woman\" and a \"cruel woman\" respectively. Their origin story was mostly based on the notion of Rugal employing secretaries prior to The King of Fighters '96. Aside from serving Rugal, both women were also spies and wielders of Orochi. Both women were unavailable during location testing and were likely finished near the end of the game's production schedule. Both her and Vice were killed by Iori in his Riot of Blood state at the end of the 1996 tournament. Template:-Maxima  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character best known for debuting as a member of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters '99; he originated from an older SNK title, Robo Army. He was added to the cast with the desire to add a \"somber and reliable middle-aged character\" to counteract the introduction of multiple teenage characters -though his character bio indicates he is still in his late twenties. Maxima was a Canadian soldier who led a normal life until he found out that his comrade-in-arms Rocky was killed in an incident involving NESTS. To avenge Rocky he decided to sacrifice his previous life, had his face and name changed and his \"ordinary\" life destroyed. To infiltrate the cartel without being recognized he had his body cybernetically modified by Dr. Makishima, hence his codename of Maxima. As a cyborg, his strength and reaction time increased to superhuman level with built-in weapons (an originally-blocked hand cannon and a powerful cannon-like weapon installed in his chest) and the ability to conduct instant data analysis. He also has some degree of cyberpathy (he is able to perform feats such as connection to the satellite via cybernetic part of his mind according to Maxima's personal story in KOF: Maximum Impact 2 and K' Team story in The King of Fighters 2003). These systems are powered by a miniaturized nuclear reactor called Maxima \"Heart\". It's unclear whether his real heart remains as part of those 20% of his body which is still organic or it was replaced with its artificial analogue. He infiltrates NESTS and is assigned to be the partner to K'. They both defect from the cartel after K' encounters his clone, Krizalid, and grows sickened by the organization. Since then, he has become K's steadfast companion and he is often the one who enters both of them into the following tournaments. In 2001 Maxima discovered that Rocky's brain was placed into a robot by NESTS. The \"reunion\" didn't last long as Igniz got rid of his \"rebellious servant\". As a last gift, Rocky activated his friend's Final Cannon (Maxima Beam) which eventually became his special attack. The original Maxima and Rocky were from Robo Army (as shown in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash), but similar to other titles (ie: Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting and Savage Reign) they are from a \"different universe\". Even their \"creation\" is different as NEST was not involved, and in the end of RA, Maxima and Rocky get their bodies back. Template:-Momoko  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is one of the three original characters debuting in The King of Fighters XI, along with Oswald and Elisabeth. There, she belongs to the Psycho Soldiers along with her idols and martial arts teachers, Athena and Kensou. Her name means Peach child in Japanese. Momoko also appears in the recent SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS as an SNK character card. She was added into the cast to fit the image of the younger Psycho Soldier team, though developers have expressed discomfort with adding a character as young as her amongst a large group of adults. Series illustrator, Hiroaki, drew her character \"in her age group's defense\" but struggled in making her as sweet as he would have liked. Momoko is the first character to use Capoeira in the (2D) KOF games (Soiree Meira and Richard Meyer in the KOF: Maximum Impact series also practice it, Bob Wilson is the most well known for it and share the most similarity, but Duck King uses hip-hop dance as a fighting style, not Capoeira, despite having similar techniques). While most of her techniques are physical, they are accompanied by what looks like stardust. Also, her LDM is a powerful beam-like attack similar to the Kamehameha from Dragonball Z. Momoko is a chain-move style character, similar to characters Angel and Gai Tendo. She is the fifth character in The King of Fighters games who can use her buttocks to attack, the first four being Mai Shiranui, Yuri Sakazaki, Shingo Yabuki and Athena Asamiya. Her version of the technique can be done three times in a row, similar to Fei Long's \"Rekka Ken\". Momoko's \"DoReMi Canto\" DM stands out by being a Deadly Rave-type move (attack sequence that requires the player to press a button for each individual attack) that has seven variations, which makes for effective high/low guessing games. During the move, Momoko chants the solfege, though one of the variants (an easy, \"mess-up\" option) sees her going off key and performing the same kick four times in a row. The name of the DM may be a reference to the magical girl anime Magical DoReMi, which even features a character named Momoko (though she does not resemble this Momoko very closely). Template:-Oswald  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is one of the three original characters debuting in the video game The King of Fighters XI. There, he belongs to the year's Hero Team along with Ash Crimson and Shen Woo. He was created under the image of being an older gentleman and is enigma to even the creators. Developers consider his moves to be comical compared to the seriousness of his image, especially the move Joker when it is blocked or misses. They chose to leave the result of his fight with Shen (see below) ambiguous, implying that fans would have been disappointed with the outcome. It is revealed at the end of the tournament that Oswald joins Ash and Shen Woo to obtain money and drugs named 'Dragon Pills' (or 'Ryu-gun' in Japanese). Ash agrees to give information regarding the drug to him, explaining that it can only be given to him if he defeats the provider's enemy, Shen Woo. The two men fight but the results remain uncertain. Many fans have noted that Oswald's card-based fighting style is remarkably similar to X-Men's Gambit (this comparison is most obvious between Oswald's Joker LDM and Gambit's Royal Flush super). Another notable reference is the Batman villain The Joker: by holding Start and pressing D (for the arcade version), Oswald's palette colors his suit blue with red hair/cards and white face-paint. Template:-Ramon  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo made his first appearance in The King of Fighters 2000 as a member of the year's Hero Team. Ramon is known as the only character to speak Spanish in the game. His moves and attacks are inspired by Tiger MaskTemplate:Fact. He was created to appeal to the South American fanbase and has a fighting style primarily surrounding around body slams. He is a famous Lucha Libre wrestler who is loved by his fans in the wrestling circle. He was approached by Vanessa, who requested in his cooperation with forming a team for The King of Fighters 2000 tournament. Feeling he could expand his horizons and competitive spirit further, he accepted to cooperate with her. Since then, he has a one-sided infatuation with Vanessa. After The King of Fighters 2000, he continues to team with Vanessa upon her request, often along with Seth. Template:-Ron  Template:General CVG character Ron (Chinese: \u9f8d; Pinyin: L\u00f3ng; Japanese: \u9f8d\uff08\u30ed\u30f3\uff09Ron) was first introduced as a pivotal sub-plot character in The King of Fighters 2000. He later appears as a Striker for the original Zero in The King of Fighters 2001. Though he isn't playable in the series, he serves as an important side-story character. According to his official profile, his main objective is to be able to manipulate the dead. He is the former leader to an elite assassination group known as the Flying Brigands -or Template:Nihongo Clan in Japanese- and the father to a number of their members, including Duo Lon and Xiao Lon. He betrayed the Flying Brigands by joining NESTS for personal gain, labeling himself as a traitor by many of the group's members. After NEST's destruction, he reveals his interest in a mysterious power shared by Sie Kensou and Bao known as the Dragon Spirit. The importance of this power to Ron is unknown. Template:-Saisyu Kusanagi  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who debuted in The King of Fighters '94 as a victim in Rugal's gallery of defeated fighters. He appears as a mid-boss in The King of Fighters '95 and becomes playable for the first time in The King of Fighters '98. He was originally meant to have died in The King of Fighters '94 but was added in at the last minute of developing stages for The King of Fighters '95. He was the previous head of the Kusanagi clan who left his family to face worthy opponents across the globe. After his defeat by Rugal, he was brainwashed by his secretaries -primarily by Vice- to fight his son, Kyo. Upon his defeat, he regains his senses and escapes from the ship, Sky Noah, unnoticed. Saisyu then leaves the clan's duties to his son, presumably resuming his travels. In The King of Fighters 2001, he appears before a distraught Shingo Yabuki and spends a year properly teaching him the Kusanagi fighting style.Template:-Seth  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a videogame character who made his first appearance in the series as a Striker in The King of Fighters '99 Evolution. He debuts as a playable character in The King of Fighters 2000 as a member of the Benimaru Team. He was created along with Vanessa, though Seth became the visual model for her. Developers wished to have a character with \"the powerful image of a big, dark, middle-aged man with a Mohawk haircut\". Seth's prototype name was \"Dick\". He was ordered by his superior Ling to enter the King of Fighters tournament to capture the Flying Brigands leader, Ron. To do this, he arranges to team with Benimaru Nikaido, Shingo Yabuki and Lin. During the tournament, he learns that Ling is really Zero in disguise and that Ron had joined with NESTS. He continues to investigate Ron's activities as the series progresses, presumably to prevent him from becoming too powerful. He was also asked to attend Heidern's conference with the Agent Team in The King of Fighters XI. Template:-Shen Woo  Template:General CVG character Shen Woo (\u795e\u30fb\u6b66) is one of the members of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters 2003, also composed of Ash Crimson and Duo Lon. He was first conceptualized to be a \"wild and sexy man\". Due to his fighting style revolving around punches, designers for his fighting style had to create enough distinction in his attacks to avoid confusion with Ralf and Yashiro. His appearance is also jokingly referred to by creators as being the main hero in Ash's place. Little is known about the true origins of the mysterious fighter \"Shen Woo\". What is known is that he was raised in the Chinese city of Shanghai and given the nickname Shen Woo for developing his own, devastating street-fighting boxing style best described as \"violent\". He soon came to be very feared, and grew to enjoy the thrill of the fight. Eventually, he came to know the enigmatic fighter Ash, who entered Shen, himself, and Duo Lon as the \"Hero team\" into the KOF 2003 tournament. Despite he and Duo Lon having suspicions of Ash's agenda, Shen couldn't care less as he was too eager to find and face stronger opponents. At the end of The King of Fighters XI, Ash decides to settle his teammates' agendas. Oswald joined the tournament looking for a drug known as the \"Dragon Pills\", an illegal and off-the-market drug. Ash explains that the provider for this drug will not sell it but will consider giving it to Oswald if he defeats their adversary, Shen. Since Shen is looking for a strong opponent to fight and Oswald needs the \"Dragon Pills\", Ash decides to pit his two teammates against each other. The outcome of their fight has yet to be determined. Template:-Shingo Yabuki  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a reoccurring character who first appears in the series in The King of Fighters '97 as an edit entry. Creators to the series explain that he is designed to be the comic foil to Kyo. While Kyo was a hero, Shingo is meant to be a \"simple and plain, everyday guy\". To follow his character persona, he was also meant to be marketed on a lesser scale of importance for his introduction to the series. He is one of the cheerful and silly characters in the series. He considers all fighters as his friends, making everybody see him as a weird but good kid. Shingo admires Kyo like an idol, and often dedicates his victories to him. He dreams of being able to wield flames like Kyo, which is stressed to the point of comic relief throughout the series. For instance, in The King of Fighters 2003, Shingo can randomly produce a small flame spark when performing his 115 Shiki: Dokugami Mikansei (Unfinished Poison Bite) attack. However, it seems that only Shingo can see this \"flame\", mainly due to Shingo not being a part of the Kusanagi bloodline. He replicates several of Kyo's moves sans the flames. He isn't perfect though as he always takes out his handbook if he seems to forget a move. He also \"messes up\" certain moves (such as the 101 Shiki: Oboro Guruma Mikansei (Unfinished Twilight Wheel), Shingo Kinsei Ore: Mu Shiki, and Shingo Kinsei Oreshiki: Rouka Guruma) where he falls or collapses during or after their executions. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Shingo was voted as the staff's seventh favorite character. Shingo's character shares several parallels with Sakura Kasugano from the Street Fighter series: both are students, both fight in their school uniforms, both wear a headband, both are very cheerful and eager to please, and both want the main character of their respective games to teach them to fight and had been rejected. Though the results differ as Ryu tells Sakura he's still learning and thus cannot be her teacher, while Kyo either ignores or beats up Shingo for annoying him. SNK minorly stresses this character relation in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, as both characters can support one another. Template:-Sie Kensou  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who first appeared in the SNK video game Psycho Soldier. He appears in The King of Fighters series as an active member of the Psycho Soldiers Team. He also appears as a character in SNK's action-RPG, Crystalis. He is one of the few characters in the series who speaks in Osaka ban, a trait that followed him in all other appearances. He has an unrequited crush on his teammate, Athena Asamiya. He is one of the young disciples of Chin Gentsai who wields psychic powers -dubbed by SNK as Psycho Powers. Both he and Athena are trained by Chin to prepare for \"the worst case scenario of oncoming evil\" and use the tournaments as a method of training for such an event. Plans go awry when Kensou loses his powers in The King of Fighters '99 yet saves Athena with a previously unknown latent energy. It is later revealed to be the Dragon Spirit, a power he somehow shares with younger teammate, Bao. He regains his powers and masters this newer power in The King of Fighters XI, much to the satisfaction of former NESTS member, Ron. The deeper meaning of the Dragon Spirit's importance has yet to be revealed. In earlier incarnations, his victory poses often had \"wardrobe malfunctions\" with over-exaggerated poses. The food he sometimes he eats before or during matches are baozi. In Psycho Soldier, he was Player 2 (Athena Asamiya was Player 1). Even back then, he was comic relief: in scenes where both characters would jump from a high level to a low one, Kensou would fall flat on his face. This version of Kensou also appears as normal Kensou's Another Striker in The King of Fighters 2000' and recently in SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighter Clash DS as an SNK character card. Template:-Vanessa  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who first debuted as a Striker in The King of Fighters '99 Evolution. She becomes playable in The King of Fighters 2000 as a member of the Hero Team. She is the first boxing female of the series and one of the first females to use this style in fighting games. Like Maxima, she was created as a middle-aged female to contrast the multiple teenage characters in the roster. Developers also mention their intentions to make her playable in The King of Fighters '99 though this didn't happen due to time constraints. She is a normal housewife who discreetly serves as a mercenary agent. Working under the orders of commander Ling, Vanessa and fellow agent  Seth are commissioned with the job of joining the King of Fighters tournament, held by Ling himself. They are to follow the footsteps of the NESTS cartel, which Ling and his agency persecuted. The two agents part from one another with Vanessa recruiting prime suspects, K' and Maxima, as her teammates. She also scouts the talents of Mexican wrestler Ramon to complete their team. Her objective from then on is to observe the activities of the NESTS defectors based on Ling's orders. She becomes a free agent after Ling's defeat -who was impersonated by Zero- often teaming up with Ramon and Seth. In The King of Fighters XI, she reveals herself to be an old acquaintance of Blue Mary's past lover, Butch. Together with her and Ramon, Vanessa enters the tournament under orders to receive information concerning the broken Orochi seal and the mysterious members of His Distant Land. Her fighting style shares several similarities with Fatal Fury character, Rick Strowd. Template:-Vice  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo is a character who debuted as a member of the Iori Team in The King of Fighters '96. Both she and Mature are descendants of Orochi with her being the \"cruel\" one of the duo. Both women were still being developed during location testing and were likely finished near the end of the game's production schedule. She also appears playable in Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 and Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001; both titles are a part of the crossover effort in the Capcom vs SNK series. She is a violent person, taking great pleasure in killing others and seemingly immune to their pain. For instance, her grudge against Saisyu began due to his stubbornness to submit to her during his brainwashing. Additionally, it should be noted that she and Mature are not precisely friends, but instead help each other in order to free the power of Orochi. At the end of the 1996 tournament, Vice and Mature were killed by Iori when he entered an unexpected Riot of the Blood state. She is one of the first female grapplers for the series, using a variety of throws to corner and interrupt her opponent's advances. During fights, Vice will often harshly berate her opponent, either by sarcastically remarking the damage she will be doing or by commanding her foe to submit. Template:-=Template:Whip  Template:General CVG character Template:Nihongo, whose real name is Template:Nihongo, is a character who first appeared in The King of Fighters '99 as the new member to the Ikari team. Her affinity for whips earned her the nickname, Template:Nihongo -which roughly translates to \"Whip Girl\"- by Ralf. Whip also appears playable in the hand-held game, SNK Gals' Fighters. She was planned to enter the series in The King of Fighters '96 but was pushed back to The King of Fighters '99 due to Leona's introduction. She is an enigmatic and quiet individual who acts towards her own goals. She is a clone of K's sister and once worked for NESTS as an assassin. She befriended Krizalid, under the assumption that he was her brother, before she escaped and joined the military. She is eventually assigned to Heidern's mercenary unit for the King of Fighters tournament to investigate NESTS. While her team isn't present, she privately interrogates NESTS agents to find information regarding herself and the whereabouts of her brother. Once she realizes who he is, she reveals their relation to one another and joins him in his objective to destroy the NESTS cartel. After NESTS' downfall, she returns to her duties under Heidern's command. Her move, Desert Eagle, depicts her shooting her opponents with a machine gun. The firearm is edited from the American release of the games in arcades, but is uncensored in the home release versions. She also originally pointed a pistol at Zero during the Ikari Team ending in The King of Fighters 2000 though this was also edited for American release.Template:-Guest Characters  KoF has featured several unlockable guest bosses over the years for players to face.

In her original appearance in Fatal Fury 3: Road To The Final Victory, she fights wearing her leather jacket. However, in the KOF series, she only wears it before the match begins. She takes it off and gives it to her dog, Anton, to keep it safe. Mary did not appear until KOF 97. SNK decided to allow fans to vote what characters they wanted to see in KOF 97 to make the '97 Special Team. There were 3 polls in 3 different magazines and that was how Blue Mary, aswell as Ryuji Yamazaki and Billy Kane, appeared in the KOF series. Apparently, Mary just barely beat Duck King (from Fatal Fury) by a few mere votes. Although apparently not appearing in KOF XIII, she is one of the most anticipated to appear in a future KOF title.Other Appearances  As well as being a recurring character in the Fatal Fury series (appearing in every installment since Fatal Fury 3, including a cameo in the Garou: Mark Of The Wolves featurette - Memories Of Stray Wolves), Mary has appeared in\u00a0: SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash 2 Expand Edition She hasn't appeared in any actual fighting game crossovers, as of yet.Additional Information  In the KOF games, in most of Mary's pre-fight and win animations, her dog Anton appears. Apparently, Mary's appearance is based upon Android 18 from the manga and anime series, Dragonball Z - the main physical trait being the short, blond hair. Aswell as her baggy trousers, combat boots and skin-tight red top, Mary wears an oversized belt. People joke (including members of SNK Playmore) that her belt gets longer and looser in every KOF game. In Fatal Fury 3, while Mary is searching for Jin Chonshu and Jin Chonrei, she meets and befriends Terry, whom she grows rather attached to. However, it is not actually confirmed that she loves/has a crush on Terry. Interestingly though, in Garou: Mark Of The Wolves, Terry completely shun's B. Jenets advances, meaning either one of two things - he genuinely isn't interested in B. Jenet or else he has a partner, which some people speculate to be Mary. However, none of this has actually been officially confirmed by SNK Playmore.Games K  The King of Fighters '94 The King of Fighters '95 The King of Fighter '96 The King of Fighters '97 The King of Fighters '98 The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match The King of Fighters '99 The King of Fighters 2000 The King of Fighters 2001 The King of Fighters 2002 The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match The King of Fighters 2003 The King of Fighters XI The King of Fighters XII The King of Fighters XIII The King of Fighters XIVShermie  OROCHI SHERMIESeries Appearances  Shermie has only appeared in 4 KOF games thus far; KOF 97, KOF 98, KOF 02 and KOF Neowave. She did not appear in the KOF Maximum Impact series.Other Appearances  Shermie is playable in: SNK Gals' Fighters SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash 2 Expand Edition Neo Geo Battle ColiseumAdditional Information  She is one of the four Orochi leaders, along with Yashiro, Chris and Goenitz. As such, when she appears playable in a KOF game, she is usually on the same pre-set as Yashiro and Chris. Her eyes are never visible as her bangs constantly cover them. Although she didn't appear in any KOF Maximum Impact games, she was considered for Maximum Impact 2, but the developers felt there may have been an issue with the physics engine along with her hairstyle (meaning they didn't want to reveal her eyes). In the end, she was ultimately rejected. She primarily has red hair, but her Orochi form gives her brown or purple hair.

New fan remake of Space Quest III by Dogma Day Games. Includes: The game is in production right now. No release date can be predicted, but hopefully it will be done eventually.The Story  We last left our hero, Roger Wilco, drifting aimlessly through space after destroying Vohaul's space fortress. The ship is low on fuel, and Roger lies asleep inside...but not for long. Roger wakes up on a garbage ship. Now dazed, stupefied, and wondering what he's doing there, Roger has to find a way out. Roger must travel to alien worlds, do random things, and once again save the universe from evil.Production  So far the remake is getting a lot of stuff done. All the death message pics are finished, several backgrounds have been done, and a good time is being had on the production crew. The game is being programmed in AGS, a powerful tool for adventure game making.Extended Plot?  The Space Quest III remake will have a slightly extended plot. The extra stuff is being decided and written at the moment, and the very talented Vroomfondel is helping the team with writing these wacky, crazy twists.Remake Astro Chicken  Astro Chicken was remade as a separate minigame for the never-completed SQ3VGA. It features multiple levels and \"space wind\". There is no secret code presented at the end of the remake.Latex Babes  The Latex Babes are beautiful, but potentially deadly human and humanoid women who reside on Estros.Background  From Roger Wilco's perspective he first encountered the Latex Babes for the \"first time\" paradoxically in SQ10 era, however, however, from the Latex Babes perspective they first encountered each other at some point between Space Quest V and Space Quest 6 (according to databases on board the DeepShip 86). After stealing a timepod and escaping from the Space Quest 12 era during the Space Quest 4 game, Roger ended up on Estros in the SQ10 era. There he was accosted by the Latex Babes. Zondra was extremely angry at Roger for supposedly running out on her. (The SQ4 era Roger, of course, was completely baffled by this, since at that point he had never encountered the Babes before). The Babes attempted to torture Roger back at their fortress, but were interrupted by a sea slug attack, which Roger defeated. The Babes were so grateful that they went to the Galaxy Galleria to celebrate and took Roger with them.Culture  They seem to be fond of shopping, and have been known to frequent the Galaxy Galleria. Their main residence seems to be in a secret underground (and underwater) hideout, which is seen in the Space Quest 10 time period. It provides security for their nefarious deeds, as well as having a chair designed for torture. Their leader is a woman named Zondra.Behind the scenes Dialogue  \"Right!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Our hero!\" \"Sale!\"Images  (Click for larger images.)ComPost Database Entry Latex Babes  These natives of the planet Estros are usually nubile humanoid females, although the occasional wily, stringy male is not unheard of (and are peripherally necessary for the propagation of the species). Turn-ons include constructing the finest underwater craft in the galaxy, arc-welding, and shopping; turn-offs are Estrosian Sea Slugs, plaque build-up above the gum line, and two-timing janitors. Favorite foods are Eelwort Sashimi (Replicator #8771877) and roasted drymouth Gourami (Replicator #2712090).   This is a featured article.

The book comes with a hint revealer to facilitate the display of hints. Available for 5 buckazoids from the Bargain Bin at Software Excess. Roger still had the hintbook when he served aboard the SCS Deepship 86, which he kept in his quarters.Back of Book  The Two Guys from Andromeda's latest sci-fi comedy, SPACE QUEST IV, will give you hours of frustration unless you have this hintbook. Want to know how to get the dog into the hanging basket? Want to find out how to attach the melon? Buy this hintbook and it all becomes obvious. You'll hit your head and say, \"Boy, how stupid could I have been? A moron could've figured this out. I must be a real dimwit, a pathetic nimnal, a wretched, idiotic excuse for a human being not to have figured out these simple puzzles in the first place.\" Try it and see!The Hints Behind the scenes Roger Wilco  Roger Wilco is descended from a long line of Roger Wilcos before him, each of them were Maintenance Specialists. His father was a Roger Wilco, so was his grandfather. \"To seek out new life and new civilizations... To boldly go where no man has gone before..\" A wonderful sentiment, isn't it? Ships full of people searching the cosmos, expanding their knowledge into yet uncharted regions of many galaxies, and looking for new lifeforms? Boldly exploring what can be, but has not yet been? But what happens when the toilet backs up? The answer is found in the human, Roger Wilco, strange hero from Xenon, who's come to save our toilets from total destruction! If his boss is watching, at least.Background  Roger Wilco's career has gone from the depths of the trash compactor to the heights of glory. From humble beginnings as a janitor (junior grade) aboard the research vessel Arcada, Roger has gone on to become one of the most admired figures in the galaxy through his exploits in the Space Quest series. He could be considered the ultimate overachiever, having exceeded any reasonable expectations of his abilities. On the other hand, he might only be the luckiest sucker ever to draw breath. In all, Roger is a scrappy character and a good guy to know... If only for his advice on getting out Gargleblaster stains.General Information  Roger Wilco was originally born in test-tube 696, his parents had dispensed with all the inconvenient aspects of childbirth. He apparently has a brother. Roger Wilco was considered a wiz on a kazoo during preschool. Roger Wilco as a kid at least had a pet kitten and a dog. He used to buzz the family dog with a Kamen Kruiser when he was a child. He knew from the age of five that he wanted to be a janitor, and help clean up the universe. As he grew into boyhood he was given the nickname Tangle Toes, it was one of the more kinder nicknames he received. Roger Wilco gave up licking wires as a cheap thrill when he was six. He used to play the ancient Stratego board game as a kid as well as with dolls. His favorite childhood doll was spider droid action figures. He spent thousands of hours fantasizing snuffing Spittle Slimes. He also had experience with Nukem Dukem robots and played in them for fun. He spent years playing other innocent droid games. He also had typical fears of the Monster in the Socket. He used to scream into the outlet. He also spent many hours of his youth playing Blazing Paddles. When Roger Wilco was a young boy on Xenon, he used to climb a tree. He once got a big dent in his head from falling out of it. Once he was picked on by a local bully, who ground his face in to the asphalt. As a kid, Roger grew to enjoy the wet-tar smell. His dad used to bring him to Phleebhut to see the World O' Wonders when he was just a kid, to see Mog. He was just a little tyke running around in coveralls. He would enjoy all the fun things to do around the park, including many different rides (that used to be there). He and his dad would take the elevator to the top of Mog's head and look at the view through his eye. Roger used to be afraid of the double Ferris wheel that used to be there. He also used to ride on the Tilt-a-World and it was one of the worst experiences he ever had, it left him spinning. Roger enjoyed the grub that used to be served there--especially the sweet stuff, candy. Such as N & Ns. He and his dad could eat a whole bag of them, except they'd pick out all the green ones. They also enjoyed the hot dogs. Roger used to pole vault back in highschool during his eleventh grade. He used to vault all over the place, over cars, bushes, swimming pools. He even pole-vaulted over the principle one time. Roger is a Janitor 2nd Class, and an exemplary one at that. When not fixing toilets or scrubbing decks, Roger spends his time accidentally saving the universe. As it turns out, Roger has been in a number of adventures, although few of his own choosing. After graduating from university, his first assignment was aboard the starship Arcada. Early in his career, Roger saved the galaxy from the evil Sariens, and the Doctor of Evil, Sludge Vohaul. He barely escaped their exploding ship and was awarded the Golden Mop. However, his fame soon died down and he resumed work upon a space station. Soon he was captured by Vohaul and forced to escape, eventually killing Vohaul... Or so Roger thought. After another adventure in which Roger saved the world from the Pirates of Pestulon, Roger was forced into the future to save the world from Vohaul's disembodied head, which had taken over his homeworld. He joined the StarCon Academy to fulfill his dream to become a starship captain. He spent his days there dodging classes and sleeping over the lectures. He managed to destroy 3 trainer ships, one even before leaving the hangar when he attempted to activate hyperspace. While at StarCon Academy the light of distant suns reaching his eyes, causes a wave of homesickness for his friends and family on distant Xenon. Then its said he has doesn't have either, and is able to get on with business. Roger has given interviews in Space Piston Magazine and The Official Guide To Roger Wilco's Space Adventures, and was also featured in an article in the Galactic Inquirer. He has written journal of his adventures which were designed to explain to people of the past about the future. He sent them back in time in order to inspire designers to create computer games about his adventures in order to insure his own future existence. They were later published in the form of The Space Quest Companion. A series of personal running monologues from Roger Wilco have been published within the \"Official Guide to Roger Wilco's Space Adventures\". Roger Wilco was mysteriously missing in the Space Quest XII era, it is believed in that era he may be dead. Of course if he simply does not exist in that era, its possible that he was indisposed somehow (limbo between time periods, era skipped via time dilation, or ColdSleep or other form of suspended animation again). Whatever the case at some point his physical years will catch up with him, it is said that in fifty years he will end up with senility (of course its anyone's guess when he will have physically aged fifty years, rather than simply skipping eras).Titles and Nicknames Trivia Education and experience Favorite Books & Entertainment  His favorite book is Bill the Galactic Hero, by Harry Harrison. It's about this poor guy who was just minding his own business, and he get's dragged off to another planet. All this weird stuff happens to him, but by the end of the book he's the hero of the galaxy. Boy, where do these guys get their wild ideas? It just amazes him.

A list of other articles that either take place in or reference SQ4 are below:Beatrice Creakworm Wankmeister  Beatrice Creakworm Wankmeister (Bea for short) was G6 Quadrant's Ambassador to the Star Confederacy, and a Princess (though by protocol prefers to be referred to as Ambassador). She was the future wife of Roger Wilco and mother of Roger Wilco, Jr.Background  Striking looks, a keen intellect, and a strong personality combined to make Beatrice Wankemeister one of the most effective negotiators in the history of the G6 Quadrants diplomatic corps. An outspoken advocate for sentient species' rights and environmental issues, Beatrice's vigorous activities in these areas had lead to several legislative measures and two stellar protocols, including one on hazardous waste disposal. Beatrice's natural inclination to speak her mind had been tempered but not eliminated, by her years of service to the diplomatic corps. She had gone after intersteller consortiums with dogged tenacity that, at times, bordered on the obsessive. She remained single, having little time or interest for anything but her work. Soon she had become the Ambassador to the Star Confederation for the G6 Quadrant. She was so concerned with the biological ramifications of the Sludge Bandits that she transmitted the locations where they dumped their waste around the relatively uninhabited G6 quadrant. She also requested the deployment of shome ships from the StarCon Academy but she was met with scepticism. Captain Raemes T. Quirk however insisted that she'd accompany him aboard the SCS Goliath as it patrolled the alleged dump sites. During a shuttle recovery, the crew of the Goliath was attacked by mutated survivors from the colony of Klorox II, and only Wankmeister escaped unharmed in an escape pod that landed on the nearby planet of Thrakus. The crew of the SCS Eureka followed her pod beacon and she was rescued from the mutated crew of the Goliath, but was hit with some Primordial Soup. Aboard the SCS Eureka, Wankmeister reveals to Captain Roger Wilco that she took the Goliath's warp distributor cap, thus hindering their plans to attack StarCon. Roger Wilco placed Wankmeister in the CryoSleep for suspended animation to slow the progress of her Pre Monster Syndrome caused by the insidious Primordial Soup. This gave the crew time to travel to the source of the Primordial Soup, Genetix, where she was successfully cured and placed back into the cryogenic chamber to rest. The heroic actions of Roger Wilco at last endeared him to Wankmeister, and the future laid out for Roger in Space Quest 4 finally seemed possible. In a future era, she would later bear Roger Wilco a son, Roger Jr., who would grow up to be a great rebel leader of the Time Ripper resistance movement. She would sadly not see her son's success as she along with future Roger apparently died (or disappeared) under mysterious and unknown (at least from SQ4 era Roger Wilco's point of view) circumstances sometime before the era of Space Quest 12.Behind The Scenes  Beatrice is the only character in the Space Quest Series besides Roger that can be killed in a way that results in a game over for the player. The reason for this is because of the paradoxical implications of Space Quest 4. If Beatrice dies during the course of Space Quest 5, Roger Wilco Jr. will never be born. If Roger Wilco Jr. is never born, then he won't be able to travel back in time to save Roger Wilco from the Sequel Police on Magmetheus in Space Quest 4. Therefore, Roger Wilco will have been killed by Sequel Police then and will cease to exist in Space Quest 5. So that rather morbid future hinted in SQ4 is not an alternate future, but the future that Roger Wilco is moving towards, if he likes it or not. There maybe slight alternate versions of that dark future (see Parallel universe) but that dark universe will happen, and there is no way to stop it (much like Judgement Day in Terminator).Monolith Burger  Their motto is, \"Just for the krill of it.\" Monolith Burger is a subsidiary of Monolith Synthetic Industries, Inc.. It is a popular or unpopular (depending on ones perspective) fast food chain scattered throughout the known universes. With locations such as the Monolith Burger Fast Food Dive in Sector 62, and the Galaxy Galleria location.Background  Open to everyone who can follow their simple \"no shirt, no shoes, no service\" policy, Monolith Burger offers a completely unhealthy menu for those among you who just can't live without fast food. Their franchises are frequented by uncountable species every day. They even offer a full-featured arcade featuring such classics as Astro Chicken, for those who aren't entertained solely by their food. Monolith Burger is the most ubiquitous fast food franchise in all of the known space. Founded centuries ago by Megalith ik'Monolith--a Stoneoid from Accretion XXIV. The only fast food chain to survive the infamous \"Food Wars\", Monolith has reached the highest level in the fast-food industry by getting mentioned in the Galactic Inquirer, and who can blame them - their \"food\" is revolting, having once been described by Roger Wilco as tasting like \"the slick skin of a Vorlian mucusworm\". In fact, Roger also famously noted that the food at Monolith looks less like food the more one makes the mistake of looking at it. Monolith Burger serves up the most generic chow along the spaceways. Greasy, tepid, over-salted and under-carbonated burgers, fries, shakes, organic and non-organic salads, krill cookies, and artificially flavored and sweetened whipped petroleum byproduct sundaes. It's food just like mother used to make. It sticks to your ribs, and stays there for a long time. There are separate menus for most sentient species, all of which receive the same warm reviews. It has been estimated that over the centuries, Monolith Burger has sold enough burgers to stretch around the Milky Way a thousand times, if placed end to end. Double or triple that number if you include fries. The most amazing fact is that, if someone were to actually put all of those fries or burgers in a row, Monolith Burger guarantees that the first one in line will be just as fresh and tasty as the last. And, vice versa. Guaranteed. Or your money back. They offer fly-through service, which is open late for your convenience. The decor, like the menu, is the same throughout the galaxy. Booths with plastomold seats and tables are available for your discomfort, and a menu will be hanging from the ceiling over the counter. When entering their local Monolith restaurant, customers will no doubt be able to notice the delicious aroma of home-cooked food - a smell insidiously piped in by the company in order to mask the odor of the real food. Their menu includes originally-named items such as the Monolith, the Mini Monolith and the Jumbo Monolith. For the more adventurous, the Filet-O-Orat is available. Most of their menu items are available with Polycheeze. For the kids, the Monolith Fun Meal is available, which comes complete with the Monolith Burger Prize o' the Day, a toy for only 7 buckazoids! Parents of course pay this rip-off price in order to avoid the wrath of their kids. Dressed in their crisply starched uniforms - which may possibly be made of the same substance as the food itself - all of Monolith's sales employees are highly trained in the art of suggestive selling (also known as \"not taking no for an answer\".) Therefore, you will find that all of your meals WILL come with the optional Space Spuds and of course a drink of either Tang or Sloppy Slurper. All food comes in the classic, dirt cheap, Monolith Food Bags. For the ultra-adventurous, try the Big Belcher Combo. This includes a Jumbo Monolith with Polycheeze, Space Spuds with Extra Grease, and a Sloppy Slurper! All for only 9 buckazoids. Also, if you are lucky enough to be in the SQ10 period, try their amazing Monolith Slugburger Combo. If their food needs that little bit extra, they have two synthesized versions of ancient vegetable sauces: their famous Mono Sauce (a.k.a. Ketchup) and their famous Mono Sauce No. 2 (a.k.a. Mustard). As well as more conventional advertisements, Monolith Burgers are also known for their outrageous marketing gimmicks. In February 3009, Monolith hired a convincing Elvis lookalike to work behind the counter in order to promote their new Banana Sandwich Combo. It apparently worked, as they ended up on page 6 of the Galactic Inquirer. Although some franchises only employ males, Monolith Burger is an excellent place to work, with raving testimonials from ex-employees, such as Roger Wilco. Promotion prospects are excellent, in fact, Roger was told he could become Assistant Manager if he stayed with the company for half an hour. For those working in the kitchen, they offer the excellent wage of 1 buckazoid per burger. They also allow you to start slowly, and don't expect you to be an expert until you have worked there for several minutes. They also have a very fair disciplinary system, allowing a full ten mistakes before you are fired, and there is always the possibility of second chances. Monolith Burger runs an Employee of the Week award every Week. The Employee of the Week for the outer space establishment, every Week, is Brfngnlx Ykzyxzk. Hiring is done through a very brief interview with the manager. The Galaxy Galleria branch of Monolith Burger is run by a gruff pachyderm and/or pig-like individual, who advertises for staff in Popular Janitronics magazine.Mascots Locations Menu  Menu may vary depending on Monolith Burger location (some items may be secret menu items not appearing on standard menu).Drinks Desserts Condiments & Toppings Jones in the Fast Lane (Menu) Production  Monolith Burger's burgers are created on their MasterBurger 2000. Here, condiments and buns are placed on the burgers in an assembly line fashion. They are then warmed in a microwave or under warming lights before being served. The concept of \"food hygiene\" seemingly being completely unknown at Monolith, the food is often left out under the warming lights for a long time until a sucker dumb enough to order it comes along. Strangely enough, the condiments used by Monolith Burger appear to be at least semi-sentient - a fact which becomes apparent if the player attempts to converse with, smell or taste them during the Space Quest X time period.Perma-Bun  \"I'm your Perma-Buns. Nothing goes outta here unless it's in me!\" \"I smell like any other set of 299-year-old buns.\" \"I'm a Perma-Bun. While I have absolutely no taste, I do have a shelf-life of 3 centuries.\"Ketchup  \"Hello. I'm the ketchup. Did you know there's more sugar in me than in ice cream? It's a fact.\" \"Yeah, that's right. No smell. Better no smell than a bad one.\" \"I'm the best little condiment you ever tasted. You know I am, really. I'm not kidding, I am!\" \"Squeeze me, for a plop of catsup. Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!\"Lettuce  \"I'm Lettuce. Real Old Lettuce. Lay me down on the burger. I like to go first.\" \"Get yer nose off me! What do I look like, a nostril mat?\" \"I'm Lettuce. I taste like an old leaf, OK?\"Mayonnaise  \"Hi. I'm Mayonnaise. I'm cholesterol-laden and ready to clog an artery when given the chance.\" \"Don't bother. I'm really quite bland.\" \"Some people think I taste oily. I don't think so. Do you?\" \"Don't look now, I'm dressing!\" \"Squeeze me for a plop of mayonnaise, you knucklehead!\"Mustard  \"I'm your mustard. Squeeze me.\" \"Pungent, eh?\" \"Go ahead. Take a big lick of ol' Mr. Mustard. You'll be sorry.\" \"Squeeze me for a plop of mustard.\"Pickle  \"Bite me, I'm a pickle!\" \"I'm the pickle. I smell like vinegar on a spring morning.\" \"I taste like crunchy toe-jam sauted in vinegar.\"Behind the Scenes  Monolith Burger and its logo are both spoofs on McDonald's Corporation. The mention of how the burgers served by Monolith taste like the \"skin of a Vorlian mucusworm\" might possibly be in reference to an urban legend concerning how McDonalds supposedly use worm meat as a \"filler\" in their burgers. Monolith Burger is featured in SQ3, SQ4, and one of the Nick's Picks Space Quest Minigames. Monolith Burger also appears in Jones in the Fast Lane, another Sierra title. The cashier reveals that there are 45 calories per french fry, and that the burgers are poached (as opposed to broiled or fried). They also sell \"preadolescent irradiated kung fu tortoise\" figurines (a reference to the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series). They also use \"less soy\" in their burgers, and deep fry everything (including their drinks). The unhealthy attributes of the JITFL food is a parody of the criticism of the quality and nutrition of McDonald's food (and fast food in general). Such places have gradually improved their quality since the release of the films Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation. The cashier in JITFL whispers to the customer that \"the manager wishes to abolish minimum wage\". This refers to the fact that most fast food workers are paid minimum wage.Characters  This is a listing of all articles pertaining to characters in the Space Quest universe. You can add your article to this listing by either employing the Character template or by adding [[Category:Characters]] to the end of your article.Aluminum Mallard  The Aluminum Mallard was Roger Wilco's personal ship used during Space Quest III and to the beginning of SQ4.Background  The Aluminum Mallard was found in an unusable state by Roger Wilco on a garbage freighter in Space Quest 3. Roger managed to find a warp motivator for it, and replace its auxiliary reactor with one found in the rat's lair, but the ship uses wiring of uncertain quality.  \nThe Aluminum Mallard, as seen in the beginning of Space Quest 3. It was captured by the Pirates of Pestulon but retrieved to again serve Roger in his transport of the Two Guys From Andromeda to Earth and his consequent journeys. It has since been seen outside the bar where Roger was captured by the Sequel Police in Space Quest 4. On his return to Magmetheus he learned that the Mallard had been towed away for overtime parking and impounded as payment to cover his yearly pledge renewal to Patrician Broadcasting. Roger was stranded on the planet with only just enough buckazoids to buy passage back to Xenon, where he joined the StarCon Academy.Technical Details  When landed, the ship can be accessed from the rear ramp, however a hatch is also provided on the roof in case you like playing with heights. Of course, the hatch is mainly used for docking with space stations such as Monolith Burger. The interior of the Aluminum Mallard is equipped with one pilots seat and two passenger seats. The systems of the Mallard are powered by an auxiliary reactor, which can be accessed via a panel behind the passenger seats. Opposite the passenger seats is a computer display, used for viewing the ships blueprints and diagnostic systems. To the rear of the craft is a panel with a red button marked 'Open/Close' which, strangely enough, opens and closes the rear ramp. Light speed is powered by the warp motivator, which is accessed via a panel on the roof of the ship, and cannot be accessed from the interior. All ships systems are controlled via the computer screen in the cockpit. The main menu of the computer provides options for engines, navigation system, take off, cruise, light speed, attack speed, radar, weapons systems. The navigation system is used for scanning the sector for planets and stations, and the computer also plays a delightfully annoying little tune for you while scanning... over and over and over again! The ship has three standard speeds: cruise (painfully slow), attack speed (fast enough to shoot and dodge things, but unfortunately slow enough to get shot at!) and light speed. Flying with the radar deactivated is not recommended, and once you have turned the radar on, you cannot turn it off while in flight. The ship is equipped with limited front and rear shields (which are useful for deflecting enemy blasts and other random objects), as well as frontal phasers, however these weapons systems cannot be used while landed, and only one of the shields can be used at any one time.Blueprints  (Click for a larger image)Behind the scenes  The name of the ship comes from the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo's ship from the Star Wars films.Aluminum Mallard (unofficial)  Aluminum Mallard appears in fan games, see Aluminum Mallard (unofficial).Astro Chicken: The Mindless Video Game  Astro Chicken: The Mindless Video Game (aka Astro Chicken) is an arcade game, released both in Space Quest III and as stand-alone game. The stand-alone verison was actually the first demo for Space Quest III. The games subtitle originates from the The Space Quest Companion (and is handy to distinguish the game from the character of Astro Chicken).Background  Astro Chicken is a phenomenally popular arcade game developed by ScumSoft (specifically the Two Guys From Andromeda) dramatizing the flight of a chicken. Its success allowed it to be followed up with Ms. Astro Chicken. This arcade game is licensed for use in Monolith Burgers across the Galaxy.Instructions  Astro Chicken must land on the Astro Chicken Landing Pad. He's depending on you to bring him to safety! Controls\n Left Arrow: Move Left\n Down Arrow: Stop Left/Right Movement\n Right Arrow: Move Right\n Up Arrow: Toggle Flapping Feed: Don't use up all your feed! Hit the landing pad too fast and you'll bounce back up. Landing outside the landing pad is fatal. If you fly too high you'll bounce off the atmosphere and plummet back to the surface.Secret Message  The Two Guys from Andromeda embedded a secret message into the ending of Astro Chicken. Roger Wilco decoded it with a Decoder ring from his Monolith Burger Fun Meal.The Decoded Message  Help us! We are being held captive by ScumSoft on the small moon of Pestulon. An impenetrable force field surrounds the moon. It must first be deactivated. Its origin is unknown to us. ScumSoft security is armed with Jello Pistols. We're counting on you whoever you are.  Two Guys In TroubleMusic  (38 seconds - 606 KB) File:Astro Chicken.mp3External links  [Download]Behind the scenes  Astro Chicken is played in a similar fashion to arcade classic Lunar Lander.References  The Astro Chicken theme song is actually a variation on a popular folk song called the Chicken ReelSee Also  Astro Chicken FAQSludge Vohaul  Sludge Vohaul is the arch-enemy of Roger Wilco, and an evil clone of Slash Vohaul, he is Elmo Vohaul Pug's great-great-grand-clone and uncle of Raemes T. Quirk. He is the boss of the Sariens, Apemen, and the Sequel Police. It is implied that Sharpei has some sort of family link with Vohaul.Background  Sludge Vohaul is the evil clone of Slash Vohaul, he was once like other humans but became twisted. In the old days, he used to test his inventions and creations on himself. But based on his appearance, being his own guinea pig had its own disadvantages. Sludge claims he was the genius behind the Star Generator when it was still in the concept stages. It was to be his ultimate war weapon until some Elder scientists (including Slash Vohaul) decided it would be better used saving lives rather than destroying them. While Sludge may have designed the concept, Slash Vohaul was considered better researcher and invented the actual technology. From that point on, the cyborg Sludge was allowed to specialize only in the development of articial sweeteners and processed cheese foods. He vowed he would take revenge on the Federation that did that to him During Space Quest 1 Vohaul had the Sariens steal the Star Generator prototype from the Arcada, and employed them to defend it and execute his plan to use it as a weapon. However, his plan ended up being defeated by Roger. Roger eventually learned the full details of Vohaul's previous plan when he was captured by Vohaul's henchman, and brought before him in Vohaul's Asteroid Fortress orbiting Labion during Space Quest 2. At that time Vohaul was devising a new plan to unleash door-to-door salesmen upon Xenon. Roger was eventually able to kill Vohaul by stopping up his life support system. Sludge Vohaul continued to be a problem after his death when another of his plots (or that of one of his clones) lead to the Sarien invasion of Xenon and the capture of the second Star Generator by a combination of Sariens, cloned insurance salesman, troopers and the Pirates of Pestulon. Although Roger became trapped in the Hoyle program during this event just as he was about to save the Generator he escaped and saved the universe. However, Roger still ended up encountering Vohaul again. It seems that Vohaul, in amazing foresight, had placed his thought patterns on a Leisure Suit Larry disk at some point during SQ2. In the future, the government of Xenon (who coincidentally had also developed time travel abilities by that time) loaded up the infected Leisure Suit Larry software into their systems (which now controlled Xenon), and Vohaul was essentially re-animated. He sent Sequel Police to capture Roger in the Space Quest 4 era, but Roger's son, Roger Jr, managed to save him. Roger (Sr.) was sent to the Space Quest 12 era to stop Vohaul; however, Junior was captured while Roger was occupied in his task. Roger eventually managed to stop Vohaul yet again and save his son. Vohaul, who would have seemed to have been killed for good this time, was the victim of Roger's superior abilities (or dumb luck) with computers. But perhaps not, it is rumored that changes in Space Quest IV (including the Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros and SQ12 time zones) are largely due to yet another of Vohaul's petty revenges. Although Roger believes he finished him off, he worried about the return of his archenemy while exploring the bowels of Stellar Santiago's body. Vohaul still made him have to change his underwear more than the average person, There were things in there he would not have wished upon his old nemesis. As long as Vohaul can be cloned or have his memory copied to another computer or body, the possibility of Vohaul's return is infinite.Nicknames and Titles Behind the scenes  In the games there isn't a clear explanation as to who Slash and Sludge Vohaul are. Infact its strongly implied in SQ2 that Sludge and Slash may have been one and the same individual, as Sludge claims to be the genius behind the Star Generator and makes no reference to Slash (in SQ1 Slash claims to be the genius behind the Star Generaor and makes no reference to Sludge). The Space Quest Companion added the idea that Slash Vohaul warned of his evil clone, and the Sariens in the datadisk. The book also extended Vohaul's explanation of his plan to include mentions of Slash being the person who designed the Star Generator (and Sludge being jealous of him). Thus separating the two into separate characters more directly. In The Official Guide To Roger Wilco's Space Adventures, Roger Wilco gives Sludge Vohaul several nicknames, Slime/Mr. Slime, Slop, Porky and Fatback/Old Fatback. In SQ2, the narrator calls him His Lardness. In SQ6, Roger sees things inside Stellar's intestines he wouldn't even wish on Sludge Vohaul.Sludge Vohaul (unofficial)  Sludge Vohaul appears in the fan fiction, see Sludge Vohaul (unofficial)Dialogue Space Quest II  \"Well, I'll be darned! My miniaturization beam DOES work.\" In the old days, I'd test these things on myself. But as you may have noticed by my appearance, being my own guinea has had its disadvantages.\"Space Quest 4 As Himself  \"Off to Magmetheus with you, then. It is time for Wilco to meet the fate which I have crafted for him.\" \"Hello, Roger Wilco. Surprised to see an old friend? You have no idea how special this moment is for me. This is no chance encounter, I can assure you.\" \"I have just one loose end to tie up before I begin my reign as the supreme being of all that exists.\" \"I do not like to lose! You were a blemish on what would otherwise be a perfect record of domination, terror, and invincibility. Besides, I'm still a bit miffed about that asteroid deal in Space Quest 2.\" \"Anyway, to relieve the pain of my humiliation, and prevent you from being a pain in my... future, you must die. It's been nice seeing you one last time. Men, do the dirty deed.\" \"Well, what have we here?\" \"That is no longer a concern.\" \"Wilco will surrender to us once he has learned we have captured his son.\" \"Then he will be destroyed, once and for all. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\" \"Take a good look, Roger!\" \"Remember this poor, wretched soul, for he is your son.\"Possessing Roger Jr.  \"Ah-ha-hah! Hello again, Roger. It's me, your old friend, Sludge Vohaul. I've taken the liberty of 'borrowing' your son's body. I had to remove him first, to make room for my mental self. His is on this disk. Say, it's most enjoyable to be in a young, healthy body, even if it's from your bloodline.\" \"In fact, I like it so much, I think I'll keep it. I guess we'll have no use for this, anymore.\" \"Now it's time to settle things, once and for all. You'd better be careful, though. Keep this in mind: If I die while in this body, that disk will be useless. Your son will never draw another breath. And if you don't defend yourself, you will never live to buff another helmet.\" \"Come on! Show me what you've got, mop jockey!\" \"Is that the best effort you can muster? All this 'space hero' nonsense must be getting to you. You're getting old, Roger. I, on the other hand, am enjoying the physical joys of youth.\"Images  (To be added.)References SQ0  This is a Category for SQ0.

While wandering around the streets, be careful to avoid the zombies and security droids to avoid being vaporized. If you hear one coming, hide behind a pillar or under an overhang, out of sight. This will also score you a few points. Head off to the east and pick up the ROPE that is lying on the pile of rubble near the bottom of the screen. Now, return to the west and head west again. You'll find yourself at the wreckage of a skimmer. Examine the wreckage and take the POCKETPAL TERMINAL from the glove compartment. Now, head to the north to find an abandoned tank. Look in the hole and take the UNSTABLE ORDINANCE. Unstable, eh? That sounds dangerous! Replace the UNSTABLE ORDINANCE and be on your way. Head to the north and hide behind the pillars of the building. Enter your inventory and throw the ROPE onto the ground. When the pink bunny marches by, use the HAND icon to attempt to snag him in your snare. When you capture the BUNNY, examine it in your inventory. Remove the power cell from its back and place it in the POCKETPAL. Now, head south and to the west. You should be on a screen with a sewer grate on the ground. Pull it up with the HAND icon and drop through. When you drop into the secret chamber, grab the JAR from the desk. Then, pull up the desk blotter. There, you will find a button. Press it to find out exactly what made Xenon such a pile in the first place. When the message is finished, open the sewer hatch on the left side of the screen. Once in the sewers, head up a bit and then all the way over to the left. From there, you can head down to the ladder leading out of the sewer. As you make your way past the the grating on the wall, a green slime will ooze out and begin to follow you. Scoop a bit of the SLIME up using the JAR you found back in the secret complex. When you poke your head out of the manhole, you'll witness the Sequel Police's patrol ship land. After the Police clear out, leave the manhole and head for their ship. Climb into undercarriage hatch (the landing-gear compartment) and they will unknowingly fly you to the command headquarters. When you arrive, go left and wait for a Timepod to appear. When its occupant heads over to talk with his partner, make a dash and hop into the Pod. If you're using the disk version of the game, this will bring up the copy protection for the game. Use the chart below to disable the timepod's security system. If you're playing the CD-ROM version, feel free to ignore the following meaningless chart. Now, you're ready to head out. Very important: Write down the code that is on the control panel when you enter the pod. You will need this to get back to Space Quest XII later. Now, enter a random set of symbols or two to escape to Space Quest X. If you're having trouble getting out, sometimes a row of the bottom right characters--the ones that look like question marks--will work. Also, try the reverse of the SQ12 code. Boarding the patrol craft and stealing the timepod are two of the \"problem points\" of SQ4 for faster computers. If you're having trouble boarding the ship, try downloading a saved game to bypass these troublesome segments of the game (or slow down the game using Mo'Slo or Turbo).Space Quest X  Upon arriving in the much-less-bleak Space Quest X, you should head to the west and then to the outcropping on the far left hand side of the screen. This will cause the shadow of a pterodactyl to pass overhead. Now, return to the east (where you left the Timepod) and head down the rock steps. You'll be nabbed by the pterodactyl and get carried off to its nest. Momentarily, a Sequel Police droid will join you in the nest. Use the HAND icon to search him and take the GUM WRAPPER you find on him. Examine the WRAPPER more closely in your inventory. Then, climb out of the nest through the hole in the bottom left side. You will fall into the pools below and be captured by the Latex Babes of Estros. Their leader Zondra will drag you off to their complex. After the submarine ride, you will find yourself strapped into a chair at the mercy of the evil Thoreen. As she is about to subject you to the horrors of the epilator, a giant Estrosian Sea Slug will appear and scare away the Babes. When your restraints are released, press the red button on the chair. Then, grab the OXYGEN TANK sitting on the floor and toss it into the Sea Slug's mouth. When the Sea Slug is defeated, the Babes will take you off on a celebratory shopping trip to the monument of consumerism known as the Galaxy Galleria. When the Latex Babes abandon you, be sure to pick up the dropped ATM CARD. Now, you can explore the Galleria a bit. Clockwise around the Skate-O-Rama, the stores in the Galleria are Sacks, Buckazoid Bill's Sushi Bar and Arcade, the Big and Tall Store, Monolith Burger, Radio Shock (or Hz. So Good in the CD-ROM version), and Software Excess. First, head for the Big and Tall Shop and get a fresh set of clothes. Then, go to Monolith Burger and sign on for a burger assembly position to earn some extra buckazoids. Be sure to get at least 70 BUCKAZOIDS before you're fired. When you are finally fired, return to the entrance of the Galleria and take your boss' discarded CIGAR BUTT. Now, you'll need a clever disguise to take advantage of the ATM CARD you found earlier. After having examined the CARD in your inventory, go to Sacks and buy the black DRESS and wig for sixty buckazoids. Then, go to the ATM machine near Software Excess and, using the ATM CARD along with your clever disguise, empty the account. Then, enter Software Excess and buy the SPACE QUEST IV HINT BOOK from the bargain bin. Open up the HINT BOOK and read it through. Now, return to Sacks and switch back to your old clothes. Head for the Arcade and play Ms. Astro Chicken for awhile. When you're finished, walk upwards a bit until the Time Pod materializes. Then, loop around the row of games in the middle of the arcade and out the door without being spotted. Get on the walkway heading to the southwest. At Sacks, switch over to the walkway heading northeast. Continue on this walkway until reaching the stairs leading down to the Skate-O-Rama. You'll need to elude the Sequel Police at the Skate-O-Rama. This portion of the game works slightly differently in the floppy disk and CD-ROM versions of SQ4. The following sections are adapted from Peter and Jeremy Spear's The Space Quest Companion, Second Edition (Osborne McGraw-Hill, 1993). Once again, if the Skate-O-Rama sequence seems impossible, you might want to download a saved game or try to slow down SQ4 using either Mo'Slo or Turbo. Once you reach the Arcade again, hop in the Time Pod and be sure to write down the current code before you leave. Then, enter the combined codes from the HINT BOOK and the GUM WRAPPER (with the portion from the HINT BOOK first) and get ready for a blast from the past!Space Quest I  Wow! It's good old Ulence Flats--complete with stunning EGA graphics! Make your way south to the bar and enter. Talk with the Monochrome Boys until you're kicked out. Then, kick over their bikes parked outside. As you run off to hide, they will come rushing out. Once they leave, return to the bar and grab the BOOK OF MATCHES. Now, head back toward your Time Pod. When the Monochrome Boys attempt to run you down on your way back to the Pod, jump out of the way at the last possible minute with the WALK icon. Enter the Time Pod and key in the code for Space Quest XII that you copied down at the beginning of the game (you did copy it down, didn't you?).Back to Space Quest XII  When you arrive back in Space Quest XII, head to the rightmost screen of the complex. Throw the SLIME on the lock and enter. You'll find yourself in a corridor. Don't head down it! There is a laser security system in effect. Use the MATCHES on the CIGAR to smoke up the corridor enough to see the beams. Then, use the controls on the wall to rotate the beams until they're straight and you can walk through unharmed. The correct codes are 156 for the first pair of beams, 024 for the second beams, and 108 for the third. If you fool around with the beams first, however, these codes won't work. Enter the M.C. Escher-esque computer maze and look on one of the several terminal plugs and note its shape. Now, head back to the Time Pod, return to Space Quest X, go to Radio Shock (Hz. So Good) and purchase the POCKETPAL ADAPTER that matches the shape of the terminals in the Super Computer. Now, go back to the Time Pod and return to SQ12. Attach the ADAPTER to the POCKETPAL and plug it into one of the terminals. Wow! Plug and Play technology! You'll want to head for the area in the bottom-left hand side of the schematic. You'll need to avoid the security droids patrolling the Super Computer during this sequence. Probably the easiest way to do this is to stand still for a few seconds immediately upon exiting the corridor with the laser security beams. When a droid appears, quickly return to the corridor. Wait for about ten or fifteen seconds and exit back into the Super Computer. There shouldn't be any droids to plague you now. Head to the left and into the command chamber. Enter the code from the SQ4 HINT BOOK and enter. You will find yourself in a Macintosh-style interface (shudder). First, flush the droid icon and then the brain icon. Now, head up to the top level and enter one of the tunnels. This will bring you to Vohaul's inner sanctum. Much to your surprise, Vohaul is inhabiting the body of Roger's son! You have to fight him, pushing forward in order to avoid being pushed off the platform. After a short struggle, you'll knock Vohaul into the transfer beam, suspending him. Climb down the ladder to get the DISK Vohaul tossed away. Insert the DISK into the access panel on the platform and select \"disk upload,\" \"beam upload,\" move the pointer to Roger Jr, and press \"beam download.\" At times, this sequence can be troublesome. If the above method doesn't work, play with it a little. If performed correctly, you will save Roger Jr, vanquish Sludge Vohaul (again), and complete the game! A job well done! You've successfully managed to complete Space Quest 4! Now, just sit back, relax, and enjoy the endshow.Two Guys From Andromeda  The Two Guys from Andromeda were the authors of many of the Space Quest series. Consisting of Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe.Background  They claim to have been born sometime in the distant future and having originated from the Andromeda Galaxy. At some point they were abducted by the ScumSoft company from the Andromeda System and were forced into service as programmers. They were known for such classics as Astro Chicken and its later sequel Ms. Astro Chicken. They were trapped at their job, but managed to sneak a distress call into the programming for Astro Chicken. If a player got a good enough score, they could get a coded message that could only be translated with a Decoder ring available in a Monolith Fun Meal. When Elmo Vohaul Pug (assumably) found out about it, he had the Two Guys sealed in a block of Jello, but they were saved by Roger Wilco. Roger helped them escape from the clutches of the Pirates of Pestulon, but they ended up flying into a black hole during their escape. After they passed through the black hole, they ended up going back in time and landed on earth in 1986 where they were hired by Ken Williams to work at Sierra On-line and began designing games. Showing gratitude to Roger Wilco for saving them they swore to immortalize him by making him a star of his own computer game, and the Space Quest series was born. At least one of the Two Guys confirmed that disks containing Roger's journal was from their era and were most likely accurate. The Two Guys from Andromeda went on to create the Space Quest series of adventure games reaping fame and fortune. They knew a good thing when they saw Roger's documents, and simply made a straight adaptation of his exploits to the medium of computer games, changing only the occasional name or detail. The two guys spent their entire lives slaving for the Sierra company,, at least for a while. They grew fat on their success and soon burned out and began a drunken tailspin into obscurity. At some point, during the development of SQ4, the guys returned to space and the future together. They went on to advertise their latest game in the Space Quest X time period (possibly having traveled too far into the future). It was likely that the latest game they were advertising was SQ4 (but could have been Space Quest X or perhaps even Space Quest XII). Shortly before the Space Quest V period, they visited the StarCon Academy lounge and one of them walked out on their 10,000 buckazoid tab and lost their space ship. The Two Guys soon split up not long after, during the SQ5 era, Mark Crowe became known as the One Phoney from Andromeda, and the Galactic Inquirer exposed him to be a human from Earth that had impersonated an Andromedan. He was caught back in the past back on earth applying the costume and makeup. He was also caught impersonating a human Starcon officer. Although it hasn't been entirely confirmed rumor has it that Scott Murphy the other former member of the Two Guys from Andromeda is also Homo Sapien, he has appeared as an apparent human for the release of Space Quest 6. It is unclear how they originally ended up in space and the future in the first place. All is certain is that he somehow was returned to Earth by Roger Wilco sometime in the distant future.Behind the scenes  The two guys consisted of Mark Crowe, who did most of the music and visual art in the early games, and Scott Murphy, who was the programmer. The first four games in the series were designed by both Crowe and Murphy. After Space Quest 4, the team split up, and Space Quest 5 was designed solely by Mark Crowe (in which he was outed to be a human from the in-universe perspective). Space Quest 6 was designed by Josh Mandel, although later work on the project was done by Scott Murphy, making Mandel the \"third guy from Andromeda\". Leslie Balfour, was the co-designer with Scott Murphy on the cancelled Space Quest 7 project at Sierra and thus she was self-proclaimed \"Gal from Andromeda\". In Space Quest 3, the Two Guys from Andromeda enter the Space Quest universe as internal game characters. The scenario goes that those two arrived eventually to Earth and entered Sierra Entertainment, creating hence the Space Quest games. When assuming this identity, the Two Guys are pictured always wearing a mohawk wig, disco glasses and a mask with a long animal-like snout, since referred to as 'Andromedan'. Space Quest 3 offered a cardboard Andromedan Snout in its package as a gift to the players. The Two Guys appear in the Sierra Catalog video presentation of Space Quest 3, and their names are mentioned to be Sisbot and Ezerk. However these names don't appear again. In Space Quest 3, they go by their names Scott and Mark, when talking to Ken Williams. They also go by their full names occasionally in early games SQ1-4. The Two Guys offered assistence with the Space Quest Companion, First Edition. Mark Crowe later assisted with the second edition, and verified it as a legitimate source. Although it was primarily Mark who offered support.Dialogue Space Quest I  The Two Guys only appear in the VGA version if you die by acid pool or laser. They proceed to replay the death while conversing how stupid Roger was. The following diolouge comes from the acid pool death.Space Quest 4  The Two Guys don't actually make a full appearance in SQ4, but they do provide commentary when quitting or restarting the game. At one point during the game there is a crowd surrounding Software Excess. One of the customers says that the Two Guys are inside signing their latest game.Audio  \"See ya on the chronostream, time jockey!\" \"Are you sure you want to restart?\"Orat  The Orat is a creature native to Kerona (many apparently live at Orat Bay) which loves to eat, particularly the children of the Keronian natives. They prefer darkness, and as such, may be seen in dark caves.Background  Orat appears to be a Keronian name for the creature (translated into approximate English/Xenonian language), and it is actually shortened form of their full Keronian name. More specifically Orat appears to be the shortened name for the specific Orat that Roger killed (see Grell for similar name usage). When speaking of the individual \"Orat\" (capitalized) is employed, when speaking of the species \"orat\" is often used (however this is not always the case). There are several known varieties of Orats with different morphological differences. The most famous of these are the versions Roger encountered in the Space Quest I: The Sarien Encounter (original version) and Space Quest I: Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter (time sector) time sectors. These changes appear to be unforeseen side effects of time travel on Roger Wilco's part or direct influence by Sludge Vohaul in yet another of his revenge plots. The Orats at first glance appear to be subsentient, and not even to have much language skills, other than grunts and growls (something not even the dialect translator can decipher). But it is said Orats are normally known for their intellectually stimulating conversations in the monster and beast community. But from a human perspective, Orat seems limited to grunts in the way of response to probing questions. Growls sound the same in any language. Incidently, the Orat (original version) from the original time sector appears to be much more intelligent in comparison. The Orat's main food source is that of Keronian young. Its not know if they are also afraid of spiders, but perhaps after a certain encounter they might as well be (see below). One such creature was actually completely obliterated by Roger Wilco in Space Quest 1. Although the accounts of how he managed it are inconsistant. Roger has claimed to have killed it by feeding it a bottle of Dehydrated water, he has also claimed to have killed it by luring a Sarien Spider Droid into the the Orat's cave and allowing them to kill each other Still in another account Roger gave in Space Piston Comix he claimed to have fired a phaser at the roof the cave and dropping rocks on the orat. It is unclear on if Roger's inconsistant accounts are a product of exaggerations from his overactive ego, compulsive lying, the effects of time travel, or if he has actually killed more than one Orat on Kerona.Other Mentions  Another Orat nearly killed the actor Darth Lumix during the production of The Sarien Encounter movie. Later, a famous toy based on the same creatures was produced (actually the original EGA species), namely the Orat on a Stick. He acquired this from the World O' Wonders on Phleebhut. Then, in Space Quest 6, during Roger's short imprisonment at the brig on board the SCS DeepShip 86, a Rack of Orat was among the various foodstuffs served to him. He also pointed out that he hadn't seen this stuff since Space Quest 1. The beds at the same brig are said to be made from (or at least feel like) imitation orat hide. Roger once got ticked off because \"the Sirian Goat Cheese on the Grilled Orat Salad tasted fakey\" and shot the Replicator in his quarters with a phaser welder, which left a hole in there that hadn't been repaired until SQ6. But that was back in his Salad Days. Additionally, the vents on the replicators prevent the odors of the food from spreading throughout the ship, which, as the Narrator points out, is a good thing if one has ever smelled Poached Seaslug in Orat Coulis. Pay-per-view Orat Fights are occasionally broadcast on Subspace Transmissions and are often watched by the crew of the SCS DeepShip 86 via the viewscreen at 8-Rear. An article in the Space Piston magazine from SQ4 also suggests that Timepods could be used to go back in time and place bets on such upcoming Orat fights. Speaking of timepods, it should also be mentioned that the Timebuster 2000 SUX has artificial orat fur upholstery. The Dandy RecipeBeamer from the Hz So Good Catalog is said to be able to provide a perfect recipe for you even if all you have handy is a can of Condensed Cream-of-Orat Soup and a box of Nano-Wafers. A death message in Space Quest 4 says \"It's not over 'till the fat lady Orat spits... EEE-UCK! Well, I guess it's over. All over. All over everything!\" \"Don't give an orat's vas\" seems to be a common expression, at least on Polysorbate LX in the Space Quest 6 era. The narrator tells Roger that \"They don't seem to give an orat's vas\" when he shows something of little interest to the other patrons at the Dew Beam Inn. A book called \"The Hidden Life of Orats\" can be found on Dr. Beleauxs' bookshelf at Delta Burksilon V.Orat-based foods  In the original Space Quest time sector, it appears that Orats were anything but 'edible'. But that hasn't stopped species from trying in later eras.Here's a convenient summarising list of all Orat-based foods mentioned in the Space Quest series:ComPost Database Entry Orats  These aggressive carnivores have been the bane of visitors to the planet Kerona for hundreds of years. Hulking and heavily muscled, orats walk on two powerful hind legs. They enjoy crushing other lifeforms with their massive forearms. They also enjoy basketball, and often combine the two by playing a quick game of one-on-one with a recent catch. Interestingly (or not), the flesh of the Orat is highly prized for its flavor and buttery texture. It's found as a common ingredient in the cuisines of several different planets. As a result, there is a burgeoning black market in Orat-poaching. For that reason, the Orat is considered an endangered species, but nobody seems to mind except for a few chefs.Behind the scenes  The killing the orat by using the spider droid method only appears in the remake. In the original you had to destroy both enemies seperately. The Companion covers this new method in its novelization of Space Quest 1. The Official Guide to ROger Wilco's Space Adventures instead uses the classic method and seperates the kills in both editions of the story (the novel based on the original version, and the novelization of the remake).SQ5  This is a category listing for Space Quest 5: The Next Mutation. You can add your article to it by adding a [[Category:SQ5]] entry to the bottom of the page. A list of other articles that either take place in or reference SQ5 are below:Space Quest 6: The Spinal Frontier  SQ6 was released in 1995 and ran on the last version of the SCI engine, SCI32. This allowed it to use SuperVGA graphics at a 640x480 resolution with 256 colors. It abandoned the tradition of other SCI games by not having the interface in a pull down bar at the top of the screen; instead it resorted to a verb bar window along the bottom of the game, like LucasArts' SCUMM games. The graphics style also changed to be more cartoon-like in appearance than in previous games. It was the last to be officially released in the SQ series. The most notable uses of SVGA in the game occur in the intro with the exterior shot of the DeepShip and the lightspeed shots of the shuttle. Due to management issues, many hints were omitted from the game, making several puzzles harder to solve than originally intended. To get past the first thug in the apartment, you have to put the Pelvis rug on the floor and dance on it to generate static electricity, which you use to electricute him. You then have to look at the titles of CD-ROMs to get one that gives you information on how to convert the Datacorder into a homing beacon. However, this hint does not tell you how to do it, which was unintended. The information was supposed to be in the magazine, but was put into the manual instead. It also appears that the developers wanted to act as if Space Quest V never happened. Roger is demoted to janitor and is expelled from Star Con Academy. Very few references are made to Space Quest V. Even though Stellar acts as a new love interest for Roger, the game barely maintains continuity that Roger's love interest must remain with Beatrice.Things We Don't Hear in Space Quest 6  A cut description of one of the guys in the Cyberspace office.

Utilizing his vast intellect Roger concocts a brilliant scheme, and races to Sludge's hideout, risking everything for his girlfriend. Roger straps a JATO rocket to his back and light's it. Our courageous hero, shows no fear. Look at him, he behaves without regard to his own safety. This man is an inspiration to us all. But what will become of our hero?

The decision was based upon the relatively successful Space Quest 6 (which was released a while back in March 1995) and upon the feedback Sierra was getting from fans all around the planet who demanded to see another Roger Wilco space adventure. Whatever you might have heard about Space Quest 6 sales figures, the game was a success. It sold a lot more copies than Space Quest 5 did. However, it had cost around 5 times more and unfortunately (I'm sure you saw this one coming), it didn't sell 5 times as much. This known fact would later be an argument for the marketing guys to scrap the project. The design team for Space Quest 7:June/July 1997 - Sierra released some basic information  The team is currently developing a Space Quest 7 prototype (which will be a playable demo) and a rolling SQ7 promo, which will be included in the upcoming Space Quest Collection CD-Rom. Since the project is still so young, not much has been decided regarding story line, interface, etc. The team will be trying to introduce a multiplayer aspect to SQ7, as well as a single-player mode. It remains to be decided whether they want to go for the RPG-style multiplayer, or a hybrid. According to Scott Murphy, Space Quest 7 will contain some 3-D elements. However, these elements will NOT require the use of a 3D accelerator card and the game should retain its standard 2-D scrolling view.Working Titles Tagline December 1997 - Space Quest 7 project \"on hold indefinitely\"  The Space Quest 7 project was being put \"on hold indefinitely\" around late December, 1997. The reason why was given in this e-mail fans from all around the globe received. It was written by Scott Murphy and Leslie Balfour: To the Friends and Fans of Space Quest, As you all know, the path to Space Quest 7 has been long and bumpy, and we were never sure what we would find at the end of the road. The decision has been made, after much soul-searching and agonizing, to put Space Quest 7 on hold indefinitely. The joy for the team has been in the journey. We've made many friends out there, and it has been quite heartening to know that Roger Wilco has so many fans. I look forward to continuing the friendships I've developed over the last year. But Sierra is in the process of many changes, and we had to take a hard look at whether a Space Quest 7 project made sense. Unfortunately for those of us who love Roger and his stupid antics, other projects just have more to offer both to the company and to our customers in general at this time. Please don't worry about the team. We will all move to other projects at Sierra On-Line. Many of us will go over to the Babylon 5 space combat game, which will be coming out in Holiday 1998. Others will go over to the B5 adventure game, which will also come out in 1999. Both of these products will reflect Sierra's commitment to excellence in space games, and I hope you'll consider playing them if you have the opportunity. I am sending this email to those of you who have sent me mail lately. Please pass the information on to any Space Quest fans I inadvertently omitted. Finally, don't be sad for Roger. Just think of him as weary from making us laugh for all these years, ready for a break from his adventures. He and la Wankmeister want to settle down, raise a family. And perhaps as we look up in the sky, a distant star will remind us that somewhere, in a distant galaxy, Roger Wilco is probably getting pantsed. Thanks again for all your support, The Space Quest Team -Leslie Balfour -Scott MurphyLater works  This project was eventually restarted in 1999, and pitched to management, but ultimately did not have enough support to continue within the company. Few details are known about the SQ7 relaunch, save that there was one very ardent supporter, who later left Vivendi.Trivia  In the file manager in Space Quest 6, there is a drawer labeled \"SQ7\".  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundSpace Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II  Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II (aka Space Quest 12, or Space Quest XII--Vohaul's Revenge II (A new beginning)), is a future time sector in which Xenon has been overrun by Sludge Vohaul (in the form of the Vohaul virus) and his minions. A band of rebels is all that remains of Xenon's future inhabitants. Space Quest XII was visited by Roger Wilco by way of Space Quest 4 in his efforts to save Xenon and his son Roger Jr. from Vohaul. It's indicated that Roger Wilco is 'gone' possibly dead or missing in this time era. Not even Beatrice Wankmeister exists in this era as well.Behind the scenes Space Quest XII (unofficial)  The era of Space Quest XII is visited in fan games and fan fiction, see Space Quest XII (unofficial).SQ7  This is a Category for SQ7. You can Add your page to it, by adding a [[Category:SQ7]] entry to the bottom of the page. This is to group together all of the SQ-elements from this game.", "Pac-Man Wiki": "Pac-Man Wiki Ghosts  The Ghosts are the main enemies of the Pac-Man series and have antagonized Pac-Man and all of Pac-Land in their appearances. The most notable ghosts are the four members of the Ghost Gang who have appeared throughout the series as both antagonists and protagonists. Despite ghosts often being cruel and mischievous, some have been shown to be nice, but most have rejoiced in antagonizing Pac-Man. They have to be careful though, because Pac-Man has a chance of swallowing them whole, usually when a Power Pellet is obtained. They are spectral beings that dwell in Ghost Land and will sometimes travel to Pac-Land to cause havoc and mischief.Biology  Ghosts are spectral ectoplasmic entities with the common ghostly traits of being semi-intangible, being able to levitate and can leave trails of ectoplasm on living beings. They mainly attack Pac-People by biting them despite many having no visible teeth or by covering them in slime, and they also do not appear to have a very good diet, with much of their \"food\" appearing to be made up mostly of inedible and gross muck like garbage, worms, body parts and other unidentifiable substances and slimy goo, however, due to being spiritual entities without organs, these substances do no permanent harm to them. The fact that they have things such as sewers and sewage implies they still need to expel bodily waste products like Pac-People. Blinky has even admitted to passing gas on one occasion, which, sad to say, dramatically improved the smell of their food. With proper seasoning, their food can be made edible to Pac-People. It appears that the majority of ghosts are former Pac-People, but usually bare no resemblance to their living selves, and apparently they come in a wide variety of colors and types apart from the usual standard ghostly appearance, with some appearing gigantic, cycloptic, octopus-like or etc, and it appears that they may be able to freely change between these forms depending on their moods and personalities, a likely benefit of no longer being restricted by physical forms. However, ghostly animals appear to still somewhat resemble their living animal forms unlike Ghostly Pac-People.Weakness  In the original games and cartoon, their main weakness is the Power Pellet, which can be eaten by almost any type of Pac-Being, such as Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Jr. Pac-Man, other Pac-People and Pac-Animals. When eaten, Pac-People posses the ability to eat them and it causes them to turn blue with fear. Once eaten, their empty bodies will return to a chamber in the center of a maze where Pac-Man has no access and return to their original forms to continue chasing him. In the newer games and animated series, Pac-Man is the only one capable of eating them due to his status as a \"Yellow One\" and can do so even without berries in certain games while in others it is required. Power Pellets have also been replaced with Power Berries which simply act as empowering items that can give Pac-Man unique abilities that can defeat Ghosts more easily, but are still not required for eating Ghosts.Varieties  Ghosts, especially the Ghosts of Pac-People, come in a wide variety of shapes and forms but the majority usually appear to resemble the most common appearance of ghosts with round heads and ghostly tails but with a wide assortment of colors.Ghost Gang  The Ghost Gang ghosts are the original antagonists of the first Pac-Man game and in most of the other games in the Pac-Man series they are portrayed as either villainous or friendly. They are a group of four ghosts named Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde whose roles in the series has been mostly varied, going from either villainous ghosts that like to torment Pac-Man for fun to allies that help Pac-Man during serious situations, however most of their solo villainous efforts usually consist of them just teasing him or chasing him, while in others they take on a more antagonistic role due to being ordered to do so by their superiors. Nonetheless it appears they usually antagonize others simply for the fun and joy of scaring and pranking them rather than genuine hate or malicious intent. Throughout the series, the roles and names of Blinky and Clyde are often mixed up and this has been commonly referred to by fans as the Clyde and Blinky error.Blinky  Color: Red (Sometimes mistakenly swapped with Clyde, so sometimes orange.) Character: Bad-tempered, crude, bossy, bully, fast, bratty, grouchy, dangerous, mean,\u00a0sarcastic, greedy, and the leader of the four.Inky  Color: Blue (Cyan.) Character: Goofy, shy, unpredictable.Pinky  Color: Pink Character: Mischievous, persistent, tricky, has a crush on Pac-Man from time to time.Clyde  Color: Orange (Sometimes mistakenly swapped with Blinky, so sometimes red.) Character: Cowardly and seemingly dumb, but may be smarter than he lets on and doesn't really care about chasing Pac-Man.Sue  Color: Purple (Originally Orange in Ms Pacman.) Character: Annoying, Powerful, Slow.Dinky  Color: White (With Propeller Beanie.) Character: Annoying, Mischievous.Yum-Yum  Color: Red (With White Bow.) Character: None ShownOther Notable Ghosts  Throughout the many spin-offs of Pac-Man, other ghosts have been added.In-Game Behavior  Ghosts are limited by not being able to turn unless they reach an intersection. Each ghost will behave differently once it has reached an intersection. Some will move randomly, while others focus on chasing Pac-Man or ambushing him. Other times, the ghosts will revert to scatter mode where they try to spread themselves among the four corners of the maze.Related Species  Spectral MonstersPac-Man  Mr. Pac-Man (\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 Misut\u0101 Pakkuman), also known as Sr. Pac-Man or Puckman,\u00a0is the protagonist of the Pac-Man series.

Many other titles in the franchise follow the same basic plot, including:Ms. Pac-Man  Main article: Ms. Pac-Man (game) In the game Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Man fell in love with Ms. Pac-Man. Pac-Man only appeared in cutscenes and was not playable. He also had his first child with her, Jr. Pac-Man, in this game.Jr. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man  Main articles: Jr. Pac-Man (game), Baby Pac-Man (game) Jr. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man show the adventures of Pac-Man's two children, Jr. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.

In his youth, Pac-Man trained under the mighty Pac-Master during his summer vacation. He taught Pac-Man all about fighting and power pellets, so he could help in defending Pac-Land from the many Ghosts that plagued it. During his training he grew close to Pac-Master's family, he especially grew close to Pac-Master's beautiful daughter who would one day become his future sweetheart, Ms. Pac-Man. Sadly, the joy would not last for long, as a young group of Ghosts were planning to summon a powerful Ghost named Golvis, who had been banished to the far reaches of space, to defeat Pac-Master. Golvis used his magic guitar Jack to turn every Pac-Person into limbless orbs, thus making them unable to move. The guardian spirit of Pac-Land, Krystal, temporarily defeated Golvis, but was only capable of saving the young Pac-Man. She then convinces Pac-Man to help her save Pac-Land, as he is the only one left. After traveling throughout all of Pac-Land they finally reach Golvis' home base where, with their combined forces, finally defeat Golvis, thus restoring the bodies and saving all the Pac-People.Pac-Man World series Pac-Man World  Main article: Pac-Man World His next adventure took place in Pac-Man World.

The one responsible for this was Orson, the evil ghost from the first game, who desperately needs Pac-Man's help.Animated Series  Main article: Pac-Man (TV Series) In 1982, Hanna-Barbera produced the animated television series Pac-Man, which featured the misadventures of Pac-Man and his family in Pac-Land. Pac-Man is seen in the show taking care of his family, going to work guarding the Power Pellet Forest, or defeating ghosts when he needs to. The Ghosts have a leader in this show - a pale green-skinned humanoid named Mezmaron - who wanted to defeat Pac-Man and seize the Power Pellets. Pac-Man was often addressed as \"Packy\" by his wife Ms. Pac-Man, who he would address as \"Pepper\". Pac-Man himself was voiced by veteran comedian and writer Marty Ingalls.Other appearances Pac-Man World Rally  Main article: Pac-Man World Rally Pac-Man appears as one of the playable characters. Pac-Man is a fast character and drives a \"light\", four-wheeler vehicle.Pac-Man Monsters  Main article: Pac-Man Monsters After a new evil comes to Pac-Land, Pac-Man must travel far and wide defeating and recruiting all manner of Ghosts and Monsters while gaining more power to combat the new evil.Pac-Man 256  Main article: Pac-Man 256 A game seemingly taking place right after the original Pac-Man, in which Pac-Man must continue to survive against the ghosts in the maze while also trying to escape from the evil Glitch destroying everything.Super Smash Bros. series  Main articles: Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Pac-Man appears as a third party character in several Super Smash Bros. games. His appearance and moveset is largely influenced by arcade Pac-Man and other Namco titles from the 80s (most prominently Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, Pac-Land and Mappy). Super Smash Bros. for Wii U features a stage based off of Pac-Land, and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS has a level based on the classic Pac-Man maze. So far, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate only has the Pac-Land stage (game is not released yet).Mario Kart series  Main articles: Mario Kart Arcade GP, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 Pac-Man has appeared as a playable racer in several Mario Kart games, specifically the arcade ones. Alongside Mario and all his friends, he is joined by Ms. Pac-Man and Blinky, alongside Namco's Mametchi and Don-chan (DX only). He is replaced with Pacster in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX.Film Wreck-It Ralph  Main article: Wreck-It Ralph Pac-Man makes a cameo appearance in Disney's 2012 film Wreck-It Ralph, where he was shown at Fix-It Felix Jr.'s Penthouse party, commemorating his game's 30th anniversary. Later, Ralph loses his temper and accidentally wrecks a cake, pelting Pac-Man with bits of it, and Pac-Man does a jaw drop at Ralph's behavior.Pixels  Main article: Pixels Pac-Man appeared as an antagonist in the 2015 film Pixels as one of the arcade invaders attacking New York City. When confronted by the films protagonists, Toru Iwatani is among them and tries to reason with his creation, even calling him his son. However his touching words have no affect on the alien Pac-Man, who proceeds to bite off Iwatani's hand and continue rampaging through the city. While eating everything in his path, Pac-Man is then chased by the heroes in their souped-up ghost cars which they use to tackle Pac-Man with fields of energy which KO him on impact. After several chases throughout the city and three hits, Pac-Man is seemingly destroyed and the city saved. At the end of the film, Iwatani's hand is restored by the aliens after their defeat.Kamen Rider films  Main article: Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac-Man vs. Ex-Aid & Ghost with Legend Riders This film is the eighth of a series of Kamen Rider crossover films called Movie Wars. Much like in Pixels, Pac-Man is an antagonist, but isn't actually at fault as his likeness was used by the main villain to infect the world with a virus of his likeness. A Pac-Man game themed item, known as the Pac Adventure Gashat, is given to Kamen Rider Ex-Aid in a spin-off YouTube Special. Numerous references are made to the original game with this power-up (such as Ex-Aid needing to obtain a 'Power Cookie', based on the Power Pellet, to be able to successfully damage his foe).Personality  Pac-Man loves to eat. His regular meal includes Pac-Dots, Power Pellets, and fruits such as Cherries, Strawberries, and Oranges. He also seems very good at navigating mazes, due to his extensive time in them. In the 1980's cartoon and the later Pac-Man games, Pac-Man was a fairly easygoing sort and a dedicated father and husband. While he would often get perplexed by most situations he found himself in, he would always come out on top of them.Appearance  Pac-Man is a yellow, circular creature with a large mouth. He has a long, Pinocchio-like nose and two eyes which are shaped like himself. He is commonly shown with arms and legs in artwork, but he is often limbless within the games themselves. He often wears red boots and orange gloves, and occasionally has a red hat as well. Some earlier incarnations feature slightly different designs, most notably the Bally Midway artwork found on U.S. arcade machines, which features a red-eyed blob with long feet. Since around 1983 or so, his overall design has remained much more consistent.Abilities  Pac-Man has different abilities, as well as those received from Power Ups, found in various Pac-Man games.Arcade series Super Pac-Man  A superhero alter-ego of Pac-Man. First seen in Super Pac-Man, Pac-Man grows huge and can run through maze walls and ghosts. In some later games, it gives Pac-Man the ability to fly instead. It is gained by eating a Super Pellet.World series Butt Bounce  This attack can be used by jumping with the X button, then pressing it again while in air. There is a rare power-up where if the player touches it, Pac-Man gains the ability to do a Super Butt Bounce where if the player does the control for a normal butt bounce, a huge explosion will occur and any enemies in a certain radius will be terminated. It can only be used once per power-up.Rev Roll  Pac-Man will run in place at a high speed and releasing the button will have him roll into a ball in any direction in which he is pointed. Using the Rev Roll on a ramp will send him high into the air. It can be used to destroy most enemies.Pac-Dot Shoot  If Pac-Man has at least one Pac-Dot he can shoot one from his hand like a bullet and damage enemies.Super Pac-Dot Shoot  This attack is a stronger form of the previous attack. To use this attack, hold down the O button and Pac-Man will do the exact same thing, except he will spin around and then shoot a huge blast of Pac-Dots from his hand. There is also a requirement for this attack. Pac-Man must have at least 10 Pac-Dots to use it.Swim  If Pac-Man enters water, he instantly floats on the water. To go underwater, press and hold the triangle button. To go back to the surface, press and hold the X button. Pac-Man can do a dolphin flip if you jump out of the water while holding the X button.Flip Kick  By jumping in the air, and pressing the Square or X buttons, Pac-Man jumps in the air, and flips with his foot extended. This can be used to smash high up boxes.Steel Body  Using the Steel Ball Power Up, Pac-Man's body will become steel and he can hardly be damaged. He can stand on fire and walk across lava.Tiny Pac/Shrink Pellet  Using the Shrink Pellet Pac-Man will shrink in size and will be able to go through small doors. But enemies can squish him like a bug. Pac-Man is very good at using this ability. It is very uncommon for him to be attacked when he is very small.Punch  Using the O or B button, Pac-Man can punch at enemies.Electro Shock  With the Electro-Shock Power Pellet, Pac-Man can also perform an Electric Shock with the same button command. Pac-Man will be able to shoot electricity from his hands and can damage or stun enemies.Triple Butt Bounce  If you hit the X or A button 4 times, Pac-Man will preform a Triple Butt Bounce. A small shockwave comes out of Pac-Man.It can kill up to 2 enemies at a time.Ribbon Ring Power  Using the Red Ribbon Power Pellet Pac-Man's body will glow. When running a red afterimage will follow behind him. If he creates a ring around enemies the ring will close and do damage to them.References Blinky  Blinky (\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc Blinky), also known as Akabei, is the leader of the Ghosts and the arch-enemy of Pac-Man. He chases Pac-Man constantly, and is hard to shake once he starts. He is known to have a short temper, and is good friends with Pinky, Inky,\u00a0and Clyde. He also has a daughter named Yum-Yum. While originally the main antagonist in the first Pac-Man arcade game,\u00a0his role has largely been diminished to secondary antagonist or an ally in recent incarnations, though he is still considered the series de-facto main antagonist in remakes of the first game and by older fans.History Arcade Games Pac-Man  Main article: Pac-Man (game) Blinky first appeared with Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, the other members of the Ghost Gang, in Pac-Man. He starts out of the Ghost Home in the center of the Maze. Blinky is the most persistent of the original four; he is the only ghost in the arcade games that will always directly target Pac-Man when in \"chase\" mode (thus his nickname, Shadow, as in he \"shadows\" or follows Pac-Man). When the ghosts are in \"scatter\" mode, Blinky typically occupies the top-right corner of the maze. After Pac-Man eats a number of Pac-Dots, Blinky will accelerate; this state is colloquially known as \"Cruise Elroy\". The number of Pac-Dots that Pac-Man must eat in order for Blinky to become Cruise Elroy gets lower and lower as the game progresses. In certain later games, Blinky's \"Cruise Elroy\" state is triggered by how long the character remains on the maze rather than the remaining Pac-Dots. Blinky follows a similar role in these subsequent games:Pac-Land  Main article: Pac-Land Pac-Land features Blinky and the other ghosts as they try to stop Pac-Man using cars, buses, UFOs, and planes. No ghost is stronger than the other in this game, and the only one who acts differently from the others is Sue.Pac 'n Roll  Main article: Pac 'n Roll Blinky and the ghosts appear in Pac 'n Roll as enemies. They team up with Golvis in order to get rid of Pac-Man after their previous defeats. Although Blinky, Inky, Blinky and Clyde weren't completely interested in getting revenge, they went along with Pinky's plans due to her bossiness. After the destruction of Golvis's UFO, Blinky and the others watch Pac-Man on a television in the middle of the ocean. The ghosts then discover the reason Golvis was imprisoned was because of his clumsiness, not because of his power, much to their annoyance.Pac-Man World series  NOTE: In the Pac-Man World trilogy, Blinky and Clyde's names are swapped. These appearances are going by their color rather than their name. For more information, see Clyde and Blinky error.Pac-Man World  Main article: Pac-Man World Blinky appears in the second cutscene, holding a burlap sack with Ms. Pac-Man inside it, who he kidnapped believing it was Pac-Man. He also appears in Toc-Man's Lair as one of the four roaming ghosts. He also appears as an enemy in some levels.Pac-Man World 2  Main article: Pac-Man World 2 Blinky is the fourth boss in Pac-Man World 2, as one of the ghosts who unintentionally released Spooky. Blinky fights from a machine which attacks using fireballs and fiery blades (mounted on the bottom of the machine, which may knock Pac-Man off the stage). He is invulnerable to Rev-Rolls; Pac-Man must bounce on the glass cockpit to destroy it. He later appears in a huge submarine called the Megawhale with the other ghosts, in a final attempt to stop Pac-Man from reaching Ghost Island.Pac-Man World 3  Main article: Pac-Man World 3 In Pac-Man World 3, Blinky is a playable character, and teams up with Pac-Man. He can attack using a ghostly screech called \"Sonic Boo\". He is first mentioned by Orson, who tells Pac-Man to find all of the Ghost Gang in the Spectral Realm. Pac-Man only finds Pinky, who tells him that Erwin is using Inky and Clyde for power, and has connected them to an energy-sucking machine used to power Erwin's robots. Later, Pac-Man finds Blinky caught in a cage and mocks him; Blinky declares that he'd rather be left in the cage than be mocked. When Pac-Man releases him and tells him about Erwin's siphons, Blinky agrees to help him, albeit temporarily. He then helps Pac-Man in various battles, and later single-handedly defeats Spectral Fiend (an ally of Erwin's) and one of Erwin's siphons.Animated Series  Main article: Pac-Man (TV Series) In the 1982 animated series, Blinky appears alongside Pinky, Inky, Clyde, and Sue. He works with Mezmeron in attempt to stop Pac-Man and seize the Power Pellets. Here he is depicted as slow-witted and cowardly; this was the first (and only) time he was portrayed as such. He also has grammar problems.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures Blinky made an\u00a0appearance in the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures TV series. Rather than an enemy of Pac-Man, he (along with Pinky, Inky and Clyde) act as Pac-Man's allies. Like in some other media, Blinky seems to act as the leader of Ghost Gang. He is depicted as having a rivalry of sorts with Inky.\u00a0Other appearances Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde appear as enemies for Pac-Man, petrifying him whenever they appear. Unless Pac-Man is able to get a Power Pellet, he will faint. Occasionally, the others will leave important items behind after they are eaten. Once their leader, the Ghost Witch of Netor is defeated, Blinky and the others fly off.Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness  Main article: Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness Along with the other ghosts, Blinky was recruited by the witch Mesmerelda to stop Ms. Pac-Man from finding the four Gems of Virtue. Blinky and the ghosts fail in their mission, allowing Ms. Pac-Man to defeat Mesmerelda and restore Pac-Land.Pac-Man World Rally  Main article: Pac-Man World Rally Blinky appears as a playable racer in this game. He is a medium-weight, and wears green goggles. Blinky is also featured in the stage Ghost Mansion.Pac-Man Party  Main article: Pac-Man Party Blinky appears as a playable character in Pac-Man Party. In the game, he aids Pinky, Inky, and Clyde in stealing cookies from Mr. Cookie. At the end of the game though, it is revealed that they never stole the cookies, and that they were actually given to them by Mr. Cookie himself to test Pac-Man and his heroism.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game)  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game) Blinky, alongside his other three cohorts, appear in the video game adaptation of Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures as an ally of Pac-Man.Pac-Man 256  Main article: Pac-Man 256 In Pac-Man 256, Blinky, unlike the other ghosts, behaves very much like he did in the original game(s), constantly chasing Pac-Man. Blinky reverses direction when blue.Mario Kart series  Main articles: Mario Kart Arcade GP, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 Blinky has appeared as a playable racer in several Mario Kart games, specifically the arcade ones. Alongside Mario and all his friends, he is joined by Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. He does not appear in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX.Super Smash Bros. series  Main articles: Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Blinky makes a handful of cameos in several Super Smash Bros. titles, all of which are in his 8-bit form. He is incorporated into Pac-Man's moveset as his side-smash, and he can also be summoned as an Assist Trophy. In Super Smash Bros. for 3DS/Wii U, he and Pinky are also part of Pac-Man's taunt; both of them are replaced with Fairies in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In the Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS stage \"Pac-Maze\", Blinky appears as a stage obstacle. He behaves similarly to the original arcade game.Film Wreck-It Ralph  Main article: Wreck-It Ralph Blinky, along with Pinky and Inky, make a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph at Game Central Station.Pixels  Main article: Pixels While Blinky himself did not appear in the movie, the red ghost car from Pac-Man's scene assumed his role, and had \"BLINKY\" as its license plate. This car was driven by Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler).Characteristics Appearance  Blinky is a red-colored ghost. He has big eyes, and often has an angry expression. He is typically limbless within games, but some incarnations show him with arms, sometimes with orange gloves as well. In the TV series and Pac-Land, Blinky wears a wide-brimmed hat, and has a somewhat cowardly and afraid expression rather than being angry. In Pac-Man Party and Ghostly Adventures, he has a protrusion to the top of his head (which he calls his \"hairdo\") and blue eyes; his arms are also stubbier.Personality  Blinky is the most determined of the ghosts, and the leader of the Ghost Gang. He is often depicted as the most intelligent and most conceited of the quartet. He is also the most aggressive ghost in all \"maze-oriented\" Pac-Man games, relentlessly chasing Pac-Man/Ms. Pac-Man. Though Pac-Man (under most circumstances) is an enemy of all of the ghosts, Blinky is his main nemesis among them; however, some games depict this as a form of friendly antagonism. In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, Blinky is still the de-facto leader of the Ghost Gang, but is now an ally and friend of Pac-Man rather than a pseudo-antagonist. Despite this, there have been occasions where he has enjoyed frightening and picking on Pac-Man, and has also shown to enjoy upsetting Pac-People the most out of the four ghosts, showing that even as an ally, he still possesses mischievous tendencies.Clyde  Clyde\u00a0(\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9 Clyde), also known as Guzuta,\u00a0is one of the four main ghosts in the Pac-Man series. While the other three ghosts are off chasing Pac-Man, Clyde will be off doing his own thing. He is typically portrayed as the least intelligent and most submissive ghost. He is good friends with Blinky, Pinky, and Inky. While originally one of the main antagonists in the first Pac-Man arcade game, his role has largely been diminished to being a secondary antagonist or an ally in recent incarnations.History Arcade Games Pac-Man  Main article: Pac-Man (game) Clyde first appeared alongside Blinky, Pinky, and Inky, the other members of the Ghost Gang, in Pac-Man. He starts on the righthand side of the Ghost Home in the Maze's center, sitting next to Pinky. While his movements have been described by Toru Iwatani as \"random\", Clyde's movements are deliberate. Clyde actually does directly chase Pac-Man (exactly the way Blinky does) most of the time. But when Clyde gets within an eight-space radius of Pac-Man, he starts to retreat to the lower-left corner of the maze, which is where he targets during \"scatter\" mode. He continues this role in the following subsequent arcade games:Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man  Main articles: Ms. Pac-Man (game), Jr. Pac-Man (game), Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze In Ms. Pac-Man, Clyde is jokingly renamed to \"Sue\". In Jr. Pac-Man, his name is changed again to \"Tim\". While both of these ghosts look identical to Clyde and behave the same way, they are considered different characters. Sue was colored purple in future games and the TV series, and Tim was colored a lighter orange.Pac-Land  Main article: Pac-Land Pac-Land features Clyde and the other ghosts as they try to stop Pac-Man using cars, buses, UFOs, and planes. No ghost is stronger than the other in this game, and the only one who acts differently from the others is Sue.Pac 'n Roll  Main article: Pac 'n Roll Clyde and the ghosts appear in Pac 'n Roll as enemies.

For more information, see Clyde and Blinky error.Pac-Man World  Main article: Pac-Man World Clyde appears as a D.J. in the second cutscene, and is scolded by Toc-Man for playing poorly. He also appears as an enemy in some levels.Pac-Man World 2  Main article: Pac-Man World 2 Clyde is the first boss in Pac-Man World 2, as one of the ghosts who unintentionally released Spooky. Clyde pilots a giant frog-like robot. He fights in an arena that looks like a small, dried up pond. Clyde has only one attack method, which involves the frog-robot sticking out its tongue; the tongue is spiky, and inflicts damage to Pac-Man. He is the only ghost to have a different machine than the others. He later appears in a huge submarine called the Megawhale with the other ghosts, in a final attempt to stop Pac-Man from reaching Ghost Island.Pac-Man World 3  Main article: Pac-Man World 3 In Pac-Man World 3, Inky and Clyde are captured and put into a cage by Erwin. Pac-Man has to team up with Blinky and Pinky to save Inky and Clyde.Animated Series  Main article: Pac-Man (TV Series) In the 1982 animated series, Clyde appears alongside Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Sue. He works with Mezmeron in attempt to stop Pac-Man and seize the Power Pellets. Clyde is depicted as the leader of the Ghost Gang; this was the first and only time he was portrayed as such. He tended to be the most vengeful towards Pac-Man. He frequently would get annoyed with Inky for being so stupid.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures Clyde made an\u00a0appearance in the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures TV series. Rather than an enemy of Pac-Man, he (along with Blinky, Pinky and Inky) act as Pac-Man's allies. Clyde is shown as being dumber in the series than his typical portrayals, and is shown to be a rather sensitive soul in nature. Despite apparently being the dumb one of the group, he occasionally hints that he is more intelligent than he lets on, generally by being more verbose than the others.Other appearances Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures Clyde, Blinky, Pinky, and Inky appear as enemies for Pac-Man, petrifying him whenever they appear.

Clyde is also featured in the stage Ghost Mansion.Pac-Man Party  Main article: Pac-Man Party Clyde appears as a playable character in Pac-Man Party. In the game, he aids Blinky, Pinky, and Inky in stealing cookies from Mr. Cookie. At the end of the game though, it is revealed that they never stole the cookies, and that they were actually given to them by Mr. Cookie himself to test Pac-Man and his heroism. Often, Clyde ended up getting left behind by the other Ghosts. His mother is also mentioned in the game, apparently noteworthy for her baking ability.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game)  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game) Clyde, alongside his other three cohorts, appear in the video game adaptation of Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures as an ally of Pac-Man.Pac-Man Monsters  Main article: Pac-Man Monsters Clyde appears as one of the collectible characters in Pac-Man Monsters. He is an earth-type character and has high HP base stat. He can be evolved up to three times starting from his plain appearance.Pac-Man 256  Main article: Pac-Man 256 In Pac-Man 256, Clyde appears as a regular enemy. He tries to go downward whenever possible, and when he hits a wall, he moves left or right towards Pac-Man. When Clyde is blue from a Power Pellet, he moves upwards away from Pac-Man.Super Smash Bros. series  Main articles: Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Clyde makes a handful of cameos in several Super Smash Bros. titles, all of which are in his 8-bit form. He is incorporated into Pac-Man's moveset as his side-smash, and he can also be summoned as an Assist Trophy. In the Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS stage \"Pac-Maze\", Clyde appears as a stage obstacle. He behaves similarly to the original arcade game.Film Wreck-It Ralph  Main article: Wreck-It Ralph Clyde appears in the Disney film Wreck-It-Ralph as the head of a therapy session called Bad-Anon, where villains of other games come by to discuss about the experience of their roles. He is portrayed as smarter and more emphatic here than in the games. When Ralph mentions he wants to try to be a hero in other games, Clyde gets alarmed and turns blue.Pixels  Main article: Pixels While Clyde himself did not appear in the movie, the orange ghost car from Pac-Man's scene assumed his role, and had \"CLYDE\" as its license plate. This car was driven by Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklange).Characteristics Appearance  Clyde is an orange-colored ghost. He has a somewhat dopey-looking expression. He is typically limbless within games, but some incarnations show him with arms, sometimes with red gloves as well. In the TV series and Pac-Land, Clyde appears similar to a 1920's mob boss with a bowler derby hat. In Pac-Man Party and Ghostly Adventures, Clyde is very large, and has a curl of hair on his head. His appendages were made more tentacle-like as well.Personality  Clyde in the early games tended to be very cowardly. His personality is probably best described by his alternate Japanese \"Character\" name, Crybaby. He doesn't mess with Pac-Man much, and is sometimes shown to be afraid of him; he prefers to keep his distance as much as possible.Pinky  Pinky (\u30d4\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc Pinky) is one of the four main ghosts in the Pac-Man series. She attempts to ambush Pac-Man by moving parallel to him. In certain continuities, Pinky has been shown to have a one-sided crush on Pac-Man, which normally goes unreciprocated. She is good friends with Blinky, Inky, and Clyde. While originally one of the main antagonists in the first Pac-Man arcade game, her role has largely been diminished to being a secondary antagonist or an ally in recent incarnations.History Arcade Games Pac-Man  Main article: Pac-Man (game) Pinky first appeared alongside Blinky, Inky, and Clyde, the other members of the Ghost Gang, in Pac-Man. She starts inside of the Ghost Home in the Maze's center, sitting in the middle of Inky and Clyde. Pinky's movement is very strategic. By following Pac-Man's direction (approximately four spaces ahead of wherever he is headed) rather than Pac-Man himself, Pinky usually ends up taking a roundabout path to him. She tends to move counterclockwise around blocks. Because of this, however, if Pac-Man comes face-to-face with Pinky at an intersection, she will, more often than not, turn away. During \"scatter\" mode, Pinky occupies the top-left corner of the maze. She continues a similar role in these subsequent games:Pac-Land  Main article: Pac-Land Pac-Land features Pinky and the other ghosts as they try to stop Pac-Man using cars, buses, UFOs, and planes. No ghost is stronger than the other in this game, and the only one who acts differently from the others is Sue.Pac 'n Roll  Main article: Pac 'n Roll Pinky and the ghosts appear in Pac 'n Roll as enemies. They team up with Golvis in order to get rid of Pac-Man after their previous defeats. It was Pinky's idea to resurrect Golvis. Although Inky, Blinky, and Clyde weren't completely interested, they went along with Pinky's plans. After the destruction of Golvis's UFO, Pinky and the others watch Pac-Man on a television in the middle of the ocean. She scolds Golvis, declaring that she's had enough of his foolishness. She then discovers the reason Golvis was imprisoned was because of his clumsiness, not because of his power.Pac-Man World series Pac-Man World  Main article: Pac-Man World Pinky appears in the game's cutscenes, and as an enemy on some levels.Pac-Man World 2  Main article: Pac-Man World 2 Pinky is first seen watching Pac-Man sleep from outside his window. She picks a flower, presumably infatuated with Pac-Man. Soon after she and the other ghosts pick the Golden Fruit from the tree, Spooky appears and convinces the ghosts to aid him in his plans to get rid of the Pac-People. She is the third boss of the game. Her fight takes place in a snowy area, with platforms on all sides to jump and attack from. She, like Inky and Blinky, made a ghost-like robot for her fight. It has the ability to shoot snowballs.Pac-Man World 3  Main article: Pac-Man World 3 In Pac-Man World 3, Pinky is a playable character, and teams up with Pac-Man. She can create platforms for Pac-Man to jump on, and the two characters can be switched back-and-forth. She is first mentioned by Orson, who tells Pac-Man to find all of the Ghost Gang in the Spectral Realm. Pac-Man only finds Pinky, who tells him that Erwin is using Inky and Clyde for power, and has connected them to an energy-sucking machine used to power Erwin's robots. Pinky then helps Pac-Man find the other ghosts.Animated Series  Main article: Pac-Man (TV Series) In the 1982 animated series, Pinky appears alongside Blinky, Inky, Clyde, and Sue. In the cartoon, Pinky was male rather than female, having the deepest voice of the ghosts. He works with Mezmeron in attempt to stop Pac-Man and seize the Power Pellets. Pinky was depicted as a slow-witted tough guy. He had the ability to shape-shift into various substances, such as a hot air balloon. Pinky would often merge together with the other Ghosts to create various objects, such as a frisbee or a kite.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures Pinky made an\u00a0appearance in the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures TV series. Rather than an enemy of Pac-Man, she (along with Blinky, Inky and Clyde) act as Pac-Man's allies. In the series, she has\u00a0an intense romantic interest for Pac-Man, which she develops during the series' pilot epiode; she even got to kiss Pac on one occasion. She is rather hotheaded and easy to anger, particularly towards Cylindria, who she sees as a rival for Pac Man's affection.Other appearances Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures Pinky, Blinky, Inky, and Clyde appear as enemies for Pac-Man, petrifying him whenever they appear. Unless Pac-Man is able to get a Power Pellet, he will faint. Occasionally, the others will leave important items behind after they are eaten. Once their leader, the Ghost Witch of Netor is defeated, Pinky and the others fly off.Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness  Main article: Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness Along with the other ghosts, Pinky was recruited by the witch Mesmerelda to stop Ms. Pac-Man from finding the four Gems of Virtue. Pinky and the ghosts fail in their mission, allowing Ms. Pac-Man to defeat Mesmerelda and restore Pac-Land.Pac-Man World Rally  Main article: Pac-Man World Rally Pinky appears as a playable racer in this game. She's a light-weight class racer, and wears a blue bow on her head. Pinky is also featured in the stage Ghost Mansion.Pac-Pix  Main article: Pac-Pix Pinky is the only Ghost Gang member to appear in Pac-Pix. She is the most common enemy faced by Pac-Man. Her card information states: \"Her charm is her large eyes. She's relaxed and enjoys life at her own pace.\" Pinky also appears in her original arcade incarnation as a special enemy.Pac-Man Party  Main article: Pac-Man Party Pinky appears as a playable character in Pac-Man Party. In the game, she aids Blinky, Inky, and Clyde in stealing cookies from Mr. Cookie. At the end of the game though, it is revealed that they never stole the cookies, and that they were actually given to them by Mr. Cookie himself to test Pac-Man and his heroism. She also befriends Patra after facing off against her.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game)  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game) Pinky, alongside her other three cohorts, appear in the video game adaptation of Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures as an ally of Pac-Man.Pac-Man Monsters  Main article: Pac-Man Monsters Pinky appears as one of the collectible characters in Pac-Man Monsters. She is a light-type character and has high HP base stat. She can be evolved up to three times starting from her plain appearance.Pac-Man 256  Main article: Pac-Man 256 Pinky appears in Pac-Man 256 as a regular enemy. Unlike her main series equivalent, she stays still. When Pac-Man is in Pinky's line of sight, she moves towards his direction and will not stop until she hits a wall. True to her nickname Speedy, she is the fastest ghost in the game, being able to outspeed Pac-Man. Pinky cannot move at all when Pac-Man has eaten a power pellet.Super Smash Bros. series  Main articles: Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Pinky makes a handful of cameos in several Super Smash Bros. titles, all of which are in her 8-bit form. She is incorporated into Pac-Man's moveset as his side-smash, and she can also be summoned as an Assist Trophy. In Super Smash Bros. for 3DS/Wii U, she and Blinky are also part of Pac-Man's taunt; both of them are replaced with Fairies in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In the Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS stage \"Pac-Maze\", Pinky appears as a stage obstacle. She behaves similarly to the original arcade game.Film Wreck-It Ralph  Main article: Wreck-It Ralph Pinky, along with Blinky and Inky, make a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph at Game Central Station.Pixels  Main article: Pixels While Pinky herself did not appear in the movie, the pink ghost car from Pac-Man's scene assumed her role, and had \"PINKY\" as its license plate. This car was driven by Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad).Characteristics Appearance  Pinky is a pink-colored ghost. She has big eyes, but her slanted eyelids and eyelashes partially obscure them. She is typically limbless within games, but some incarnations show her with arms, sometimes with gloves as well (either orange or purple-colored). She is sometimes seen wearing makeup. In the TV series and Pac-Land, Pinky wears a hat, and has a \"tough guy\" personality. In Pac-Man Party and Ghostly Adventures, she has shoulder-length hair and blue eyes, and looks somewhat younger; her arms are also stubbier.Personality  Pinky is quite feminine and calm, but is just as mischievous as the rest of the Ghost Gang, and won't hesitate to stop Pac-Man if he tries to stop their antics. When chasing Pac-Man/Ms. Pac-Man in the maze, her strategy is to ambush them rather than chase them. Even though she is not as fast as Blinky, this strategy makes her one of the more persistent and tricky ghosts. In Pac N' Roll, she is shown to be quite cunning and mean, having been the one who came up with the plan to summon Golvis and ruin the Power Pellet Harvest Festival. In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, Pinky is shown to have a crush on Pac-Man. As with the other ghosts, she is now an ally and friend of Pac-Man rather than an enemy.Gender  In Pinky's earliest appearances, the character was often shown as being male, most prominently in the 1982 animated series. The only 80s media showing Pinky as female were the Pac-Man Trading Cards, of all things. Seemingly starting in the late 80s, Pinky began appearing more feminine within promotional artwork. Both male and female designs for the character were used inconsistently throughout the 90s; by the 2000s all games showed Pinky as a woman. The general consensus overall is that the character is\u00a0female.Inky  Inky (\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc Inki), also known as Aosuke, is one of the four main ghosts in the Pac-Man series. He is often depicted as a goofy and slow-headed ghost, not perusing Pac-Man unless other ghosts are near. He is good friends with Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. While originally one of the main antagonists in the first Pac-Man arcade game, his role has largely been diminished to being a secondary antagonist or an ally in recent incarnations.History Arcade Games Pac-Man  Main article: Pac-Man (game) Inky first appeared alongside Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde, the other members of the Ghost Gang, in Pac-Man. He starts on the lefthand side of the Ghost Home in the Maze's center, sitting next to Pinky. Here, Inky does not pursue Pac-Man as directly as Blinky and Pinky do. However, Inky can also pose a very serious threat to Pac-Man, as he is arguably the least predictable ghost. His behavior is dependent on Blinky's and Pinky's, using the relative positions of both him and Pac-Man. This can lead to Inky often trapping Pac-Man between himself and another ghost. Inky's movements will seem a lot more random the farther away Blinky/Pinky are from Pac-Man. When in \"scatter\" mode, Inky occupies the lower-right corner of the maze. He continues a similar role in these subsequent games:Pac-Land  Main article: Pac-Land Pac-Land features Inky and the other ghosts as they try to stop Pac-Man using cars, buses, UFOs, and planes. No ghost is stronger than the other in this game, and the only one who acts differently from the others is Sue. Inky does have one key difference from Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde however; he can throw Mini-Ghosts from inside windows, attacking Pac-Man from above.Pac 'n Roll  Main article: Pac 'n Roll Inky and the ghosts appear in Pac 'n Roll as enemies. They team up with Golvis in order to get rid of Pac-Man after their previous defeats. Although Inky, Blinky, and Clyde weren't completely interested in getting revenge, they went along with Pinky's plans due to her bossiness. After the destruction of Golvis's UFO, Inky and the others watch Pac-Man on a television in the middle of the ocean. The ghosts then discover the reason Golvis was imprisoned was because of his clumsiness, not because of his power, much to their annoyance.Pac-Man World series Pac-Man World  Main article: Pac-Man World Inky appears in a chef outfit in the second cutscene, and is scolded by Toc-Man for \"not making his cake chocolate\". He also appears as an enemy in some levels.Pac-Man World 2  Main article: Pac-Man World 2 Inky is the second boss in Pac-Man World 2, as one of the ghosts who unintentionally released Spooky. His fight takes place on tree tops in the rain forest canopy area. He fights in a giant, ghost-like machine, with razor blades on all sides. It can be damaged by rev-rolls or butt bounces. He later appears in a huge submarine called the Megawhale with the other ghosts, in a final attempt to stop Pac-Man from reaching Ghost Island.Pac-Man World 3  Main article: Pac-Man World 3 In Pac-Man World 3, Inky and Clyde are captured and put into a cage by Erwin. Pac-Man has to team up with Blinky and Pinky to save Inky and Clyde.Animated Series  Main article: Pac-Man (TV Series) In the 1982 animated series, Inky appears alongside Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue. He works with Mezmeron in attempt to stop Pac-Man and seize the Power Pellets. He is portrayed as the dumbest and clumsiest ghost. He frequently messes up his missions, much to the annoyance of his peers, and is always bossed around and insulted by Clyde. He also has a big pocket, so he is the one who takes supplies along.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures Inky made an\u00a0appearance in the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures TV series. Rather than an enemy of Pac-Man, he (along with Blinky, Pinky and Clyde) act as Pac-Man's allies. He seems to be the most sarcastic of the group, and may be the most intelligent member. Blinky is shown to have a sort of rivalry with him as well.Other appearances Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures  Main article: Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde appear as enemies for Pac-Man, petrifying him whenever they appear. Unless Pac-Man is able to get a Power Pellet, he will faint. Occasionally, the others will leave important items behind after they are eaten. Once their leader, the Ghost Witch of Netor is defeated, Inky and the others fly off.Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness  Main article: Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness Along with the other ghosts, Inky was recruited by the witch Mesmerelda to stop Ms. Pac-Man from finding the four Gems of Virtue. Inky and the ghosts fail in their mission, allowing Ms. Pac-Man to defeat Mesmerelda and restore Pac-Land.Pac-Man World Rally  Main article: Pac-Man World Rally Inky appears as a playable racer in this game as a light-weight class racer. Inky is also featured in the stage Ghost Mansion.Pac-Man Party  Main article: Pac-Man Party Inky appears as a playable character in Pac-Man Party. In the game, he aids Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde in stealing cookies from Mr. Cookie. At the end of the game though, it is revealed that they never stole the cookies, and that they were actually given to them by Mr. Cookie himself to test Pac-Man and his heroism.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game)  Main article: Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (video game) Inky, alongside his other three cohorts, appear in the video game adaptation of Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures as an ally of Pac-Man.Pac-Man 256  Main article: Pac-Man 256 In Pac-Man 256, Inky's behavior differs from the main arcade games. Inky patrols around his designated block by default, only chasing Pac-Man if he comes close enough.Super Smash Bros. series  Main articles: Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Inky makes a handful of cameos in several Super Smash Bros. titles, all of which are in his 8-bit form. He is incorporated into Pac-Man's moveset as his side-smash, and he can also be summoned as an Assist Trophy. In the Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS stage \"Pac-Maze\", Inky appears as a stage obstacle. He behaves similarly to the original arcade game.Film Wreck-It Ralph  Main article: Wreck-It Ralph Inky, along with Blinky and Pinky, make a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph at Game Central Station.Pixels  Main article: Pixels While Inky himself did not appear in the movie, the cyan ghost car from Pac-Man's scene assumed his role, and had \"INKY\" as its license plate. This car was driven by Toru Iwatani (played by Denis Akiyama).Characteristics Appearance  Inky is a cyan (blue) colored ghost. He has big eyes, and often has a happy/excited expression. He is typically limbless within games, but some incarnations show him with arms, sometimes with gloves as well (either orange or teal-colored). In the TV series Inky wears a hat, and in Pac-Land he has a spot of hair. Both of these portrays show Inky as being stupid (a role more commonly filled by Clyde). In Pac-Man Party and Ghostly Adventures, Inky has little to no resemblance to his original design; he is very skinny, has twirly hair, and teeth. He is also a much darker blue, and is portrayed as being the smartest of the four ghosts.Personality  Inky's personality is pretty straightforward; He's goofy, and usually doesn't fully think things through. This often makes him appear a bit dimwitted, but not as much as Clyde. Inky is typically the funny and mellow ghost who tries to remain cool - but he fails to keep his cool when scared or scolded by his fellow ghosts.Ms. Pac-Man (character) Ghosts  This is the category for Ghosts.Jr. Pac-Man (character) Pac-Man World Rally  Pac-Man World Rally is a kart racing game, developed by Smart Bomb Interactive in 2006.Gameplay  World Rally is a racing game in the same vein as Mario Kart. The player navigates their vehicle-bound character through multiple laps in a racetrack, racing against other opponents. Seven other racers appear in each course (five in the PSP version). The overall goal is to reach the highest place number possible (preferably 1st). What makes this game unique are the Pac-Man mechanics applied in the game. The player can collect Pac-Dots (the yellow button needs to be triggered first) to fill up their Pac-Meter; if it's full, the player will turn into a Pac-Mobile, and can eat their opponents for a limited amount of time (much like the Power Pellet's effect in the original Pac-Man). The player can also collect fruits (the corresponding fruit button needs to be triggered first) in order to access shortcuts, making the race easier. As with most kart racers, many power-ups appear within the game, which are gained by running into Pac-Boxes. Most of them are blatant copies of Mario Kart power-ups. They include: There are also several unlockable power-ups, which include: In GP mode, you race in a Cup which consists of 3-4 tracks each. Depending on the position you gained after each race, you'll get points. The racer with the highest points wins the gold Cup.Characters  Each character has a different race car with different stats: speed, acceleration, and steering.Tracks  ** = Is exclusive to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) version.Battle Mode  In Battle Mode, instead of using the ordinary power-ups, the player uses weapon-like items based on the fruits from the original Pac-Man (i.e. a strawberry rocket, a cherry bomb, etc.), which have limited amount of ammo and various damaging powers. The objective in the Battle Mode varies depending on the game mode the player chooses:Battle Arenas  ** Is exclusive to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) version.Battle Power-Ups Challenges  A mode exclusive to the PSP version. There, the player can select from one of three modes:Home Ports  All versions came out on the same day. While the PSP version has much more content than the others, it is debatable whether it is the superior port, as less opponents appear in each race.Trivia Sue  Sue (\u30b9\u30fc Suu)\u00a0is a female ghost from the Pac-Man series, commonly shown as being purple (but is orange in some other appearances).History Arcade Games Ms. Pac-Man  Main article: Ms. Pac-Man (game) Sue first appeared alongside Blinky, Pinky, and Inky in Ms. Pac-Man. Her role is identical to Clyde's in the original Pac-Man, and she looks identical to him as well. She starts on the righthand side of the Ghost Home in the Maze's center, sitting next to Pinky. While her movements are often described as being \"random\", Sue's movements are deliberate. Sue actually does directly chase Ms. Pac-Man (exactly the way Blinky does) most of the time; but when she gets within an eight-space radius of Ms. Pac-Man, she starts to retreat to the lower-left corner of the maze, which is where she targets during \"scatter\" mode.Pac-Land  Main article: Pac-Land In Pac-Land, Sue does not ride a vehicle like the other ghosts do, and instead always chases Pac-Man from behind. Sue travels at a slow pace (in fact, Sue is the slowest ghost in this game), but when the timer runs out, she begins to charge at Pac-Man mercilessly.Pac-Mania  Main article: Pac-Mania Carrying over her aggressive persona from Pac-Land, Sue behaves as Blinky typically would, but never enters \"scatter\" mode (she momentarily changes direction with the other ghosts, but always uses Pac-Man as her target). However, Sue moves at the same speed as Pinky in this game, which is pretty fast compared to the other ghosts, but slightly slower than Blinky (who always moves the fastest).Animated Series  Main article: Pac-Man (TV Series) Sue appears as the fifth Ghost Monster in the Pac-Man animated series, and the only female member. Rather than wearing a specific hat, as each of the male ghosts wore, Sue wore a pair of earrings. She was often defeated by Ms. Pac-Man.Other appearances Pac-Attack  Main article: Pac-Attack In some versions of the game, Sue can appear as one of the ghosts dropped with a block. She is also the primary ghost dropped for the 2nd player in \"VS Mode\".Quest for the Golden Maze  Main article: Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze In this game, Sue appears in her original orange color rather than purple. She more closely resembles Clyde in-game, but the instruction manual confirms the character is Sue.Pac-Man 256  Main article: Pac-Man 256 Sue makes her first appearance in fourteen years in Pac-Man 256. She appears in groups of three, and can only move horizontally. She is also the slowest of all the ghosts.Characteristics Appearance  Sue originally appears as an orange ghost in Ms. Pac-Man, as a female counterpart to Clyde. She is later depicted as a violet ghost, based on the animated series version. Unlike the other ghosts, Sue often appears to have narrow eyes and eyeshadow, presumably to express her gender.Personality  Sue is never given a defined personality, though the animated series depicted her as somewhat sly - but like the other ghost monsters, she has an extreme lack of intelligence.\u00a0In several Pac-Man games, Sue is one of the more aggressive ghosts chasing after Pac-Man, particularly in Pac-Mania.Pac-Man Party  Pac-Man Party is a video game for the Wii, developed by TOSE and published by Bandai Namco Games in 2010. It was released for Pac-Man's 30th anniversary, and kickstarted the \"Pac is Back\" reboot of the Pac-Man series.Story  While checking the mail one day, Pac-Man found a letter from Mr. Cookie, the manager of the Cookie Factory, saying that a thief is planning to steal his recipe to a batch of extra-powerful Power Cookies. Not long afterwards, Blinky rammed into Pac-Man, stealing the cookie recipe in the process. Pac-Man must get the recipe back and stop the Ghosts.Gameplay  The game could be described as a hybrid of Mario Party and Monopoly (and to a lesser extent, Pac-Man Fever). The player picks their character, and travels along a board collecting Cookies. The player must collect the set amount of cookies, and return them to the Cookie Factory before anyone else does. To decide how many moves each player will make, a very basic minigame is played (shooting balloons, dart-throwing game, etc.). When a player lands on a blank space, a Castle is built; when the same person goes back to the castle, they will gain more cookies. But if the opponent lands on the claimed castle, a full-fledged minigame will begin; the winner of this minigame will claim/reclaim the castle. Once a player reaches the set amount of cookies, the game ends.Story and Party Modes Mini-Games Classic Games Pac-Man Party 3D  A Nintendo 3DS port under the name Pac-Man Party 3D was released on November 18, 2011. It is mostly the same as the original game, save for 3D graphic support and different control schemes in some minigames. This version removes the worlds Mirage Oasis and Crystal Cliffs, presumably due to hardware constraints; all other features are retained.Trivia External links Spooky  Spooky (po japo\u0144sku: \u30b9 \u30d7 \u30fc \u30ad \u30fc Spooky) Is the main antagonist of Pac-Man World 2. In Pac-Man World 2, his main goal was to get his tree, Wormwood, to hold all five Golden Fruit. He was originally captured and held under the Golden Fruit tree by the brave Sir Pac-A-Lot, but one night, the Ghost Gang were fooling around in Pac-Village and picked the Golden Fruit from the tree. Spooky escaped from his imprisonment and ordered the ghosts to\u00a0destroy Pac-Man and all the residents of Pac-Land.Appearance  Spooky is a large, looming ghost of massive size who emits a dark aura of intimidation. He wears a horned helmet, shoulder guards, and red gloves. Spooky has three clawed fingers, and crimson eyes. In Pac Man World 2 he is a purple ghost; in Pac Man World Rally he is dark gray.Personality  Unlike the common ghosts of Ghost Island, Spooky's character represents what evil actually is. He is angry, intimidating, and deadly powerful. He is fear-loving and enjoys the suffering of others. He seeks danger on a very high scale!Powers  Spooky is a very powerful being capable of using all sorts of magic. Although much of his power comes from his staff, it appears he can also use magic without it. For example he can look at the ground and cause it to crack. He is able to shoot fireballs, summon various creatures, and cause a meteor shower. Spooky's other powers include his being able daze Pac-Man for a short amount of time, and creating a powerful tornado made of energy and fire.History  Past Spooky's goal was to terrorize Pac-Land and destroy the existence of the Pac-People. However, he hardly had any help in struggling to take over Pac-Land. To stop Spooky's reign of terror, a noble knight named Sir Pac-A-Lot reached Spooky and dueled against him for a long while. Spooky eventually lost the fight and was sealed away under the biggest tree in the middle of Pac-Ville. He was locked under it by five golden fruit (resembling the ones that Pac-Man eats during the game) which would keep him sealed for eternity so long as the Golden Fruits remained.Pac-Man World 2  \"Take this Golden Fruit that imprisoned me and follow me, if you want to get rid of these Pac-People...FOREVER! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\" - Spooky to the ghosts Spooky appeared outside of the tree when the four ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde removed the golden fruit in an attempt to vandalize Pac-Village. Spooky emerges from the tree and explains his plan to the ghosts on how they will steal the fruit and destroy the Pac-People and rule Pac-Land. Spooky and the Ghosts then prepare leave to prepare Spooky's plan. Pac-Man and his family were asleep during the whole commotion but by morning after discovering the fruits were missing, Pac-Man went in search for them and battled his way through Spooky's forces. \"You'll never stop me!\" - Spooky to Pac-Man After a long adventure, Pac-Man finally advances to Spooky. Spooky tells him that he won't give up his plan, thus the battle is on.Boss Fight  At the beginning, it shows Pac-Man putting the golden fruit back on the tree. His reward is a gold-ball powerup that never wears off. Spooky comes out from behind the tree and cuts the boundary of the village circle. This causes the piece of ground to fly up in the air while being surrounded by a deadly tornado. Prickly bushes sprout everywhere. The stormy tornado surrounding the battlefield is filled with flying debris and is deadly to the touch. Pac-Man will instantly die if he makes contact with it. During the battle, Spooky can summon enemies to attack Pac-Man and can also shoot fireballs and cause a meteor shower of meteors made of energy and fire. Plus, he can daze Pac-Man for a short amount of time with a spell. Spooky will fly around the terrain shooting meteors at Pac-Man with his scepter/staff. He will also use his scepter to summon enemies to appear on the battlefield to help defeat Pac-Man. The enemies vary in the different phases in the battle. It starts with Neander Pac-Men, Pac-Asites, and Spiders in the first phase. It then switches to Spiders, Pac-Asites, and Skeletons in the second phase. And finally just Skeletons and Rev Roll Rams in the last phase.Eventually Spooky will levitate low enough for Pac-Man to Flip Kick him. This process repeats two more times and then Spooky will shoot fireballs and the fire will follow Pac-Man. Keep Flip Kicking him when he in reach. At the end of the battle, if Pac-Man lets Spooky levitate in the air for a certain amount of time, Pac-Man will become dizzy for a few moments. A few more Flip Kicks will defeat Spooky.Spooky's Defeat  After a long battle, Pac-Man strikes at Spooky, until he finally falls, and just like Pac-Man's ancestor did thousands of years ago, Pac-Man sent Spooky back to his prison under the Golden Tree. Thus defeating Spooky and bringing peace in Pac-Land for many more years to come.Pac-Man World Rally  In Pac-Man World Rally, Spooky is a default Character. He is in the Heavy weight class and looks slightly different from his previous appearance.Pac-Man Monsters  Spooky appears as an event King Boss in Pac-Man Monsters, referred to as\u00a0Ghost Spooky.\u00a0His appearance yet again differs from the previous two. He can also be hatched from a King Boss egg in a weaker form, simply referred to as Spooky.Pac-Man World 2  Pac-Man World 2 (\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c92\u00a0Pakkuman W\u0101rudo Ts\u016b) is a game released by Namco Hometek in 2002 for various platforms. It is the second game in the Pac-Man World series.Story  One night in Pac-Village, while all the Pac-People are asleep, Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde appear and decide to mess around. Mischievously they pick the Golden Fruit off the village's Golden Fruit Tree and play with them. Suddenly the ground shakes, and tree shoots out of the ground. Pinky and the others look in shock; the imprisoned Spooky the ghost was released from underneath the tree. He then convinces the four ghosts to steal the Golden Fruit and join him to destroy the Pac-People. When Pac-Man wakes up the following morning, Professor Pac-Man tells him what happened and recaps the history of Spooky; a long time ago, Sir Pac-A-Lot defeated Spooky and used the Golden Fruit to imprison him under the tree. With the fruit removed, it is up to Pac-Man to get it back and defeat Spooky once more.Gameplay  Like in the first game, the player controls Pac-Man in a 3D environment, guiding him along a linear path with the simple objective of reaching the end. He must also evade enemies like Ghosts and Bears. The game has 25 levels in six different-themed environments, alongside 16 unlockable Galaxian mazes. All basic features of the first game - Butt Bouncing, Rev Rolling, Power Pellets and the like - are implemented into this game, but are now perfected in their mechanics. The Steel Ball power-up also returns, joined by the new Shrink Pellet, which makes Pac-Man tiny for about six seconds. Pac-Man also has a new move that allows him to kick in the air.Mazes  Mazes are unlocked by collecting Galaxian Flagships, which appear in the majority of levels; you only have to collect the Galaxian itself (unlike in Pac-Man World 1, where you must also open a door with it). Eating the item will transport Pac-Man into a three-dimensional maze, akin to the classic arcade games. The mazes can be replayed in Sue's Arcade.Sue's Arcade  In Pac-Village, there is an arcade led by a Pac-Person named Sue. This houses six arcade machines, which can be played once the player has collected the amount of required Tokens. Tokens are scattered throughout levels, with each one containing 8 tokens (and an extra 9th token for getting 100% completion). The games include:Game Boy Advance version  A version of Pac-Man World 2 was released for the Game Boy Advance in late 2005, over three years after the console versions. It is a 2D platformer rather than a 3D one, due to the rather limited GBA hardware (which begs the question as to why it received a port anyway). The game has a slight amount of depth to it, with Pac-Man being able to walk in all four directions (but the game is still primarily 2D). The perspective is rather off, and it can be hard to tell how close/far away objects and platforms are. Levels are rather lengthy, taking about twenty minutes each to complete - an uncommon site for portable games. There, inexplicably, isn't a save feature either, only a finicky password system that doesn't work very well. Aside from its many gameplay differences, the game also features many glitches, errors, and simply inconsistent elements. No extra arcade games appear within this release, yet they are still credited on the copyright screen. Three Galaxian mazes do appear, but there are four Galaxians total - the final one does nothing, despite a textbox appearing stating a new maze was unlocked. In level 3, a red ghost is completely frozen in place and never moves, despite a blue ghost next to him moving just fine. These are just a few examples of the many oddities found within the game.Home Ports  The\u00a0PlayStation 2\u00a0version was the first to be released, which was shortly proceeded by nearly identical ports for\u00a0GameCube and Xbox. The GameCube version is generally considered the better of the three, as it has higher quality graphics and was frequently bundled with Pac-Man Vs. Later reprints of Pac-Man World 2 seemed to tone down the difficulty somewhat. Generally versions under labels like \"Player's Choice\" (GameCube) and \"Greatest Hits\" (PS2) contain the \"easy\" version, while copies without these labels are more difficult. The Japanese PS2-only release was reportedly made even easier. As previously mentioned, the\u00a0Game Boy Advance\u00a0version is completely different than the other ports.Trivia Pac-Man World  Pac-Man World (\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 Pakkuman W\u0101rudo) is a PlayStation game released in 1999 by Namco Hometek to celebrate Pac-Man's 20th anniversary. It is the first game in the Pac-Man World series, and can be considered the companion game to\u00a0Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness.Story Synopsis  Pac-Man arrives home on the day of his 20th birthday. He opens the door to his house only to find it is deserted and in ruins. Toc-Man's henchmen, the Ghosts, have kidnapped Pac-Man's family & friends, Ms. Pac-Man, Jr. Pac, Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka, and Chomp-Chomp!

Hidden throughout the Quest, Pac-Man will face Challenging puzzles and games made famous by Pac-Man's previous adventures. Even the Ghosts - Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde - are back for a new chance to gobble Pac-Man. So Get ready to chomp into action as the legendary Pac-Man battles to save his friends in the Quest of a lifetime!\"Gameplay Quest Mode  The player navigates Pac-Man within a three-dimensional space whilst defeating enemies, solving puzzles and collecting items. The main goal is to get to the Token at the end of each stage, which will complete the level. Throughout each level, Pac-Man will run into various objects such as switches, doors and treasure chests. Some of these can only be accessed in a specific way (such as using a certain kind of Fruit to open a door). Pac-Man also has a Health meter, which has four hit points - luckily, extra health is scattered across stages. There are also underwater segments where Pac-Man has to swim, and is unable to walk on the surface; the Steel Ball power-up allows him to walk underwater, but only lasts a short time. Letters spelling \"P-A-C-M-A-N\" also appear in each level. By collecting every letter in a stage, the player will be transported into a bonus level, where the player must eat as much fruit as possible before the timer runs out. In the PlayStation version, obtaining \"P-A-C-M-A-N\" in every level will unlock a series of outtakes from the game's cutscenes. Many stages will feature a Galaxian Flagship in them. These unlock Mazes, which play similarly to the original Pac-Man. They can later be accessed again in the Mazes mode (see below). Besides running, jumping and eating, Pac-Man can use a multitude of moves, including: Most enemies can be defeated by butt-bouncing or shooting pellets at them, except for Ghosts, which can only be defeated by eating a Power Pellet.Rescuing Friends  One Key and one caged Friend are found in each world of the game, often on different levels than each other. The key must be used to rescue the imprisoned family member. All five friends are required to be rescued in order to reach the final world of the game.Levels  There are 23 levels in Quest Mode (12 in the GBA version), which are divided into sets of themed worlds. The last level in each world features a boss battle. Below are the levels listed:Mazes Mode  Mazes Mode is a collection of mazes, resembling that of the original Pac-Man; you run around collecting Pac-Dots while avoiding the ghosts, and must collect every dot to finish the level. They contain several obstacles and twists not found in previous Pac-Man games. This mode begins with three already provided mazes for each stage; to unlock the other 18 mazes, you must collect every Galaxian in Quest Mode. Once every maze is unlocked, the player can play Marathon, which consists of all 36 mazes back-to-back. If completed, the hidden art gallery is unlocked, which contains concept art from the game.Classic Mode  The Classic mode is nothing more than a faithful port of the original Pac-Man (seemingly the same version found in Namco Museum Vol. 1).Home Ports  The PlayStation version was the first to be released. The Game Boy Advance version has several features removed (Mazes Mode, Classic Mode, etc.) due to it running on inferior hardware.Trivia References Toc-Man  Toc-Man (\u30c8\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 in Japanese\uff09are a series of three robots created by Orson created to impersonate the design of Pac-Man.Pac-Man World  The first Toc-Man serves as the main antagonist in Pac-Man World. He sends various minions to kidnap Pac-Man's family and friends on Pac-Man's 20th birthday and has these henchmen hold them hostage throughout various locations on Ghost Island. In game, Toc-Man is not encountered until the very end of the game, where he serves as the final boss. After Toc-Man is defeated, it is revealed that he was a robot being piloted by Orson, a ghost that was jealous of Pac-Man's popularity. Pac-Man ends up eating a power pellet and chomping Orson shortly after the defeat.Pac-Man World 3  The second Toc-Man appears in Pac-Man World 3. Unlike the first incarnation, it is a large battle mecha that can be piloted by both Pac-Man and ghosts. It first appears in the Banni Wastelands, where Orson asks Pac-Man to help him calibrate Toc-Man. In Toc-Man Battle, Pac-Man and Clyde fight against Erwin's army of huge robots. Pac-Man uses Toc-Man's punch and Clyde does his Sonic Boo, which is amplified by Toc-Man's gun to help destroy the robots.Pac-Man World Rally  The third Toc-Man robot is one of the playable characters in Pac-Man World Rally. He is classified as being a heavy racer, and has the highest top speed in the game, but also the lowest acceleration and handling stats in the game. Toc-Man uses a redesign of his Pac-Man World design, which is smaller in size. Unlike the other two models, this Toc-Man seems to act on it's own, without anyone piloting it.Attacks  In the first phase, Toc-Man will attack by shooting fireballs (even starting off the battle with this attack). He then will use one of Pac-Man's abilities, that being pac-dot shoot. Pac-Man will get hurt if he's hit by the shot, or the shockwave that comes after it. Toc-Man will leave pac-dots behind after his pac-dot shoot, and Pac-Man needs to eat these so he can shoot them at Toc-Man. The number of pac-Dots will decrease if Pac-Man successfully shoots Toc-Man with them. Eventually, if Pac-Man gets all the pac-dots, then Toc-Man will resort to only shooting fireballs. Once Pac-Man lands all the pac-dot shots in Toc-man, he'll be magnetized to the center of the stage, and pillars will rise, allowing Pac-Man to butt-bounce the robot's head. In the second phase, Toc-Man no longer shoots fireballs or uses pac-dot shoot. Instead, he butt-bounces himself, hurting Pac-Man with shockwaves if the yellow hero is close enough. The amount of times Toc-Man will butt-bounce is random. During this part of the battle, Pac-Man must butt-bounce five blue switches to get Toc-Man magnetized to the center of the stage again, allowing him to deliver a butt-bounce of his own again. After repeating this process a couple of times, the third phase comes into the battle. During the third phase of the fight, Toc-Man will still butt-bounce, but now use a new attack. He will charge up a rev-roll, while aiming at Pac-Man, and then roll around the arena in a circle twice. Pac-Man will get hurt if he's hit. Toc-Man's decision to rev-roll depends on how far Pac-Man is away from him. So if Pac-Man is up close, then he'll likely try to butt-bounce on him. If Pac-man is far away enough, then Toc-Man will more likely attempt to hit him with a rev-roll. After rev-rolling, Toc man will get tired and sit on the ground for a while. This gives Pac-Man the opportunity to damage him with a rev-roll. If he doesn't in time, then Toc-Man will get back up and start attacking again. After rev-rolling into Toc-Man a few times, Pac-Man defeats his robotic look alike and earns victory. Throughout the whole battle, there will be three red ghosts floating around the arena. Of course, touching one will hurt Pac-Man. But fortunately, they don't target him. So Pac-Man would most likely get hit by one if he's not paying attention.Quotes  \"No, No, No! You idiots!

It was created by Toru Iwatani and released by Namco in 1980, and published by Bally Midway for U.S. distribution. The game would go on to become a cultural icon worldwide.Namechange  Pac-Man was originally released under the English name \"Puckman\". The game's katakana was actually closer to \"Pack Man\", meaning the original name was likely translated incorrectly. Upon its release in the US, the name was changed to \"Pac-Man\" due to fear of vandalism of the \"P\" in \"Puck\" being changed into an \"F\". Due to this actually being closer to the intended name, the name was changed to Pac-Man in Japan for subsequent sequels.Gameplay  The player guides the titular Pac-Man\u00a0through a maze to eat\u00a0Pac-Dots; when all dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man -\u00a0if a ghost touches him, a life is lost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets, provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts. The ghosts turn deep blue, reverse direction, and move slower when Pac-Man eats one. When a ghost is eaten, its eyes return to the ghost home where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue ghosts flash white before they become dangerous again. The amount of time the ghosts remain vulnerable varies from one round to the next, but the time period generally becomes shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the ghosts don't change colors at all, but still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten. In addition to Pac-Dots and Power Pellets, bonus items, usually referred to as Fruits (though not all items are fruits) appear near the center of the maze. These items score extra bonus points when eaten. The items change and bonus values increase throughout the game. A series of intermissions play after certain levels toward the beginning of the game, showing a humorous set of interactions. There are three total, appearing after\u00a0levels 2, 5, and 9. The third intermission appears several times afterward on later levels.  Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default\u2013DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points (15,000 or 20,000) or disable the bonus life altogether.Scoring System Ghosts  The four ghosts, formerly known as \"monsters\", are the enemies in the original arcade game. They cycle through different \"modes\" of behavior, colloquially known as \"scatter\"\u2013where they retreat to the four corners of the maze\u2013and \"chase\"\u2013where their A.I. kicks in. Each ghost has unique A.I., programmed so that the game would not get impossibly difficult or boring. There are certain one-way areas on the maze\u2013namely, the two \"T\" formations located directly above and below the Ghost Home (the box in the center of the stage)\u2013that the ghosts can travel down through, but can't go up through. There are also two entrances to a tunnel on either side of the maze that Pac-Man can travel through and come out the opposite side of the screen on, which will slow the ghosts down if they enter it. Yet another advantage Pac-Man has over the quartet is that he can turn slightly faster. Once each ghosts' mannerisms are fully learned, they can be easily manipulated by the player to get a very high score. Here is a breakdown of each ghosts' behavior when in chase mode, generally speaking: Here is a set of all of the ghosts' character names (hinting at their behavior), and nicknames. (The alternate names for Puck Man are triggered through a DIP switch.)Split-screen level  When the player gets to the 256th level, while the left side of the maze is fine, the right side becomes a garbled mess of code, therefore making the level impossible. The right side has some Pac-Dots too, but only 9, and some are inedible. The right side of the screen also traps the ghosts and can make Pac-Man go off the screen. If one uses a hack to skip the level, then the game goes back to the first level. Because of this bug, a perfect game only counts the first 255 levels. This is more commonly known as a kill screen. This level later inspired its own separate game, called Pac-Man 256.Home Ports  Pac-Man first appeared on home consoles in 1981, and has appeared on nearly every system since. The game has been released for the following systems and devices in some way, shape or form. Homebrew versions of Pac-Man have also been released for the Atari 7800, Fairchild Channel F, and MS-DOS, alongside countless \"improved\" versions of Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 (one of which, Pac-Man 4K, was officially licensed by Bandai Namco).Other versions  There are many variations of Pac-Man that are fundamentally the same as the original game, but feature several differences that make them stand out. These games include:In other games  The first Pac-Man is also featured in some newer games in the series. The following Pac-Man games contain the original arcade version.Namco Museum port  This version of the game, introduced in Namco Museum Volume 1 (1995), is notable for being perhaps the most frequently rereleased \"official\" version of Pac-Man from 1995 to 2005. This version is easy to identify, as it features an 8-bit border with Puckman artwork surrounding it. Being based off the original's source code, it is mostly faithful to the arcade version, but a few things were altered in gameplay: Most versions of Pac-Man after 2005 are completely accurate recreations of the arcade version rather than ports (with references to Midway removed); as such, the ghosts all behave as they originally did, and any patterns applicable to the original version will work on these. The Namco Museum 50th Anniversary and Xbox Live Arcade versions were among of the first of them. The latter featured an updated screen border with artwork based on Pac-Man World instead of the original Puckman.Play Online  These versions of Pac-Man are either listed in the public domain or are considered abandonware. Clicking the game title will lead you to a playable online version of it from archive.org (mobile compatibility may vary).Trivia External links Pac-People  Pac-PeopleOrson  \"It's so unfair, you ruined everything. Nobody loves a ghost.\" \u2015- Orson, Pac-Man World \"Try to bring her back in one piece, two at most\" \u2014- Orson, Pac-Man World 3 Orson (Japanese: \u30aa\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3 Oson) first appeared in Pac-Man World. He only directly appeared at the end, after Pac-Man defeated his Toc-Man robot. Orson was once eaten by Pac-Man, after he claims \"Nobody loves a ghost.\" He returns in Pac-Man World 3 as an ally. He is the one who tells Pac-Man about Erwin's evil plot, and builds a new Toc-Man to assist Pac.Characteristics Appearance  Orson is green in color and has a high pitched voice. He is generally regarded as a super genius.Personality  Smart and kind, Orson shares a mutual respect with Pac-Man, despite getting eaten by him once. While Orson has a tendency to be skittish, he will always be there to help Pac-Man when the need arises.\ufeffHistory Early life  Orson always had a love for science, but he became jealous of Pac-Man because of his popularity. Orson wanted Pac-Man to be forgotten so he himself can become more popular than Pac-Man. Orson's life back then, however, was very different then the party life he lives in current times.Pac-Man World  Orson constructed Toc-Man sometime around his early twenties, the same age as Pac-Man. Orson planned that Toc-Man would work for him and help him overthrow Pac-Man. Orson taught Toc-Man to serve him and obey him. Nevertheless, Toc-Man enjoyed partying rather than chase after Pac-Man until Pac-Man appeared in Ghost Island. Though Pac-Man was invading and Toc-Man didn't know well of what to do, as he never listened to Orson.Pac-Man World 3  Pac-Man defeated Toc-Man and Orson noticed his strength. Pac-Man would sometimes work for Orson\u00a0in\u00a0a capacity\u00a0similar to\u00a0an agent. Orson would assign Pac-Man missions in Pac-Man World 3. Once the objectives started getting rough, Orson would allow Pac-Man to utilize his old Toc-Man machine, thus the missions became easier and Pac-Man was able to defeat Erwin and the rest of the famed ghosts. It is unknown if his affiliation with Pac-Man ended in tragedy following Pac-Man's decision to eat and shoo off the four main Ghosts at the end of Pac-Man World 3.Trivia Enemies  This category is for enemies within the games or other media that hinder Pac-Man such as monsters, robots, or nameless non-individual lackeys and groups.Games  This category is for all games in the Pac-Man series.Baby Pac-Man  Baby Pac-Man (\u30d9\u30d3\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 Beb\u012b Pakkuman), also known as Pac-Baby, is the second-born, infant child of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and the younger sibling to Jr. Pac-Man.History Arcade Games Mr. & Mrs. Pac-Man  Main article: Mr. & Mrs. Pac-Man The first appearance of Baby Pac-Man was in Mr. & Mrs. Pac-Man.

This character is a baby girl, and is stated to be Ms. Pac-Man's younger sister, and the daughter of Pac-Master. She is saved by Pac-Man after he defeats Golvis for the first time.Appearance  Baby Pac-Man, as one would expect, looks like an infant Pac-Man. He has a mixture of his mother and father's traits, and is often seen wearing a bonnet or a hairbow. He always has a pacifier in his mouth.Gender  In most of its appearances, Baby Pac-Man is referred to as a boy. However, in Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures, Baby Pac-Man is stated to be a girl in the opening intro. This was likely an error by the English localization team, possibly getting confused by Baby's hairbow. The general consensus overall is that the character is male.Pac-Man World 3  Pac-Man World 3 is a game released in 2005 to celebrate Pac-Man's 25th anniversary. It is the third game in the Pac-Man World series, and was developed by Blitz Games.Gameplay  Like its predecessors, Pac-Man World 3 is a 3D platformer starring Pac-Man. Unlike the first two however, World 3 features more fighting and melee-style gameplay, making it more of a beat 'em up than a true platformer.Playable Characters Power-Ups  All power-ups last for exactly fifteen seconds.Levels Story  Note: some parts of this section may be considered spoilers. It's Pac-Man's 25th birthday, and Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man have prepared a cake for him. Pac-Man arrives at his house, and he begins teleporting to random places. He starts flying towards his cake, about to smash into it, before being teleported outside of Pac-Land. It was Orson teleporting Pac-Man, using a Pac-Man arcade machine. Pac-Man is sent to a sewage dump. Orson explains that an alien named Erwin was attempting to destroy Pac-Land using his Spectral Siphon. Pac-Man later meets up with Blinky and Pinky, who claim that Inky and Clyde were captured by Erwin as well. After meeting up with the two, Pac-Man heads to the Spectral Realm. Erwin was beginning to rip apart the fabric of space and time, in the event of a Spectral Paradox. He rescues Inky and Clyde from their imprisonment, and defeats the Spectral Fiend, one of Erwin's henchmen. Heading back to the Realm for the final time, the area is in the worst state possible - Erwin's siphoning has completely destroyed it. Making his way through the now decrepit Realm, Pac-Man succeeds in traversing through the sinking landscape. He makes it to the Shadow Temple, where Erwin is hiding out as a last resort, as the ripping of the space-time continuum was about to destroy the universe. Pac-Man defeats Erwin, and the world is saved. Pac-Man returns to Pac-Land with no threat of Erwin and his nefarious scheme.Home Ports  No version is considered particularly better than the others, although the Nintendo DS port is often cited as the worst version, due to it featuring many glitches.Trivia Pooka  Pookas are an antagonistic species from the Dig Dug series of games. They are recurring characters in the Pac-Man series, where they are portrayed as being good instead of evil. They are good friends with Fygars, and mortal enemies of Dig Dug.Appearances alongside Pac-Man Pac-Man World  Main article: Pac-Man World In the opening cutscene, Pooka is seen hopping down a trail with Baby Pac-Man bouncing on his head, on his way to Pac-Man's party.

As such, they are peaceful towards the Pac-Man family, due to them being friendly with the Pookas, but are against Dig Dug, as he dug through their burrows. While they are very cowardly, they are not afraid to fight when surrounded by other Pookas, and will attack their opponent. If they are the last Pooka standing however, they will run away in fear (or even jump into the ocean, as seen in Dig Dug II).Trivia ", "Wiki Dead Space": "Wiki Dead Space ", "Space Channel 5 Wiki": "Space Channel 5 Wiki Space Channel 5 Wiki Featured article  Purge the King Purge the King, or King Purge, is a deadly mecha that Ulala, Space Michael, and the rescued people of the studio must combat together in Space Channel 5 Part 2 More...Helping out  To write a new article, just enter the article title in the box below.Ulala  Ulala (\u3046\u3089\u3089 Urara) is the main protagonist of the Space Channel 5 series. She is Space Channel 5's star reporter and a huge hit with the galaxy audience. She is shown to be an excellent dancer, and is one of SEGA's most recognizable female characters.Information  Ulala is 22 years old at the time of both games. As well as an excellent dancer, Ulala is skilled at playing several musical instruments, including the guitar, drums and keyboard. She wishes to become the number one news reporter in the entire galaxy. Off hand, her favorite ice cream flavor is cherry vanilla, her blood type is B, and her Zodiac sign is Gemini.Background  Ulala was born somewhere in Japan on planet Earth on May 30, 2477 at 1:18 AM. As for the origin of her name, Ulala's mother is from a small town east of Japan. Her name was given to express the tone of the town. As a child, she watched Galaxy Kids News, presented by Shinichiro Tachibana. At the age of 12, Ulala was the sole survivor of a spaceship accident. She was rescued from the brink of the galaxy by a Space Channel 5 reporter, and the rescue inspired Ulala to become a reporter for the station that saved her life. The reporter that saved Ulala soon left Channel 5 however, and she never got to thank him for saving her. Eight years later, Ulala started to work for the station. However, it wasn't for another two years that she got her big break as a space reporter, covering the Morolian Invasion in the first Space Channel 5.Personality  Ulala is often portrayed as confident; often heading into danger without showing the slightest trace of fear. When the Morolians invaded Spaceport 9 and people fled in panic, Ulala confidently strutted forward to deliver her report. In Space Channel 5, she often remarks smugly about her performance if she does well against her opponent; stating \"That was fabulous!\" or \"I kicked butt!\" with a confident tone. However, Ulala can get less smug when she doesn't do well; stating phrases like \"I...saved SOME of them, at least!\" and \"I gotta get better at this.\". In Part 2, Ulala seems to have taken a less confident stance against the Rhythm Rogues. She often exclaims shock at some of the drama in the game, such as when people are taken hostage. In the original, she stated these developments calmly and professionally. However, Ulala still retains plenty of her confidence from the prequel, stating during the first boss fight \"Whatever happens...I'll give it a dance!\". Dead Pixels described Ulala as 'gaming's ultimate diva; confident and ready to meet any challenge,' but also 'uniquely human, excitable and dramatic, and never without the help of friends and fans alike as a result.\"History Space Channel 5  Ten years after being rescued from an explosion on a station station by a reporter from Space Channel 5, Ulala struts onto the scene under that very same station. Morolians have invaded and are forcing people to dance the galaxy over and under the orders of Fuse, Ulala begins dancing the aliens into submission to save the helpless victims from horribly grooving to the beat. While investigating the invasion, Ulala has to fend off rival reporters Pudding, from Channel 42, and Jaguar, the suave man from the Space Pirate Broadcasters. Eventually, Channel 5 reaches where the Morolians' base is said to be located within the Asteroid Belt. Inside the base, the Funkiest Dancebot \"Morolian Monroe\" is ready to take on Ulala. It's a rough fight and unfortunately Jaguar catches up to the swingin' reporter. However, he offers to lend a hand in defeating the dancebot and the two take on Morolian Monroe together. Ulala shoots the screens that appear and Jaguar covers her by shooting at the two-in-one alien directly. After the battle, it's discovered that the Morolians were being brainwashed as well and, on Fuse's orders, Ulala shoots out the television screen that was keeping the Morolians in the room hypnotized. The secret base falls apart and everyone evacuates. As Ulala is riding out of the large tubing leading outside and pulling double duty in saving the Morolians, Jaguar comes over the comlink between Ulala and Fuse, saying: \"I found where the brainwash signal's coming from. Looks like it's frequency is the same as Channel 5's.\" Ulala, Pudding, and Jaguar head out to Space Channel 5's HQ to find a bunch of Morolians convening in a meeting on making people dance. At the end of the room is Channel 5 CEO Chief Blank, presumably the mastermind behind the entire invasion. He runs - more like teleports - away from the trio and the chase continues. Space Michael is encountered in the connecting hallway and he's saved from the Morolians, joining Ulala as she heads for the control room. There Ulala rescues the \"Keyboard Grrrl\" and everyone marches toward the elevator. Inside, Mr. Blank is seen sitting on a chair. Taunting the pink-haired reporter, he zooms up to the roof while Ulala is left with a mass of Morolians to take care of. Saving Hoorg, the Morolian Leader, completes the group following Ulala up to the final confrontation. Emerging from the elevator, Ulala and her companions learn a surprising fact about Chief Blank. He doesn't care about truth. In fact, he wants every reporter to share his vision. The \"Ultimate Reporter\" Evila is sent to outdance Ulala, but the robot fails against the groovy moves of the spunky reporter. The puppet is taken care of, it seems that Ulala has won. At least until the roof of the dome opens up and Fuse yelps for help. A humungous robot, Giant Evila, has taken the broadcasting ship and the director inside hostage, leaving it up to Ulala aboard the Astrobeat Jr. along with Jaguar and Pudding on their own crafts to dance-off against the new threat. Ulala must move in the opposite direction of what she hears to keep Fuse safe. Giant Evila gets bold, knocking away both Pudding and Jaguar before the sound system fails and Ulala loses her rhythm. Ulala is knocked away, let to float in space. An A Capella beat picks up and Jaguar reaches out to grab Ulala, twirling her slightly back onto the Astrobeat Junior. Ulala now has a chant support, giving her a rhythm to groove to. She retaliates and finally Giant Evila's head disconnects from the rest of it's body, hovering above everyone. It shifts to the image of Chief Blank, who reveals that ratings are everything to him. If television was all for ratings, then what was the problem with brainwashing the masses? Chief Blank, now called Blank TV, activates the \"Blank Dimension\" sucking him and Ulala into a separate space to do battle, yet the chant support is still clearly heard. Through a somewhat confusing game of TV laser tag wherein Ulala must shoot the screens with the correct beam (either \"shoot\" or \"rescue\"), the strength of her support increases. People start singing along with Ulala even when Blank's screens act as feet and hands in a way one could only see to believe. The Blank Dimension shatters and Ulala is free. When the energy of the crowd is pumped up, Fuse says for everyone to focus all of their energy on the station's antenna. Ulala, Jaguar, Pudding, and some Morolians each get a line in as the energy builds, becoming tendrils of a brilliant blue against the dark, specled canvas of space. Those tendrils work their way up the antenna just as Blank says his last three commands: \"Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!\" Everyone shouts the same right back, fully charging the antenna and blasting Blank, claiming he'll be back, into deep space. Ulala wraps up her final report and marches off with friends and former foes alike along a glittering trail left by Fuse's ship. They make their way to the end of the galaxy.Space Channel 5: Part 2  Sometime after the Morolian invasion, Ulala was sent to cover an attack on a cruising spaceship. This was Ulala's first encounter with the notorious Rhythm Rogues, marking her appearance in the sequel. After saving hostages of the cruise ship, Ulala comes across Kin, Kon and Kan in the Lookout Dome. The mechas sent by the Rhythm Rogue mastermind, Purge, to defeat Ulala are toppled although it seems Purge was expecting this as he says: \"The party's just begun.\" Ulala is later sent out to cover the kidnapping of Space President Peace, interrupting the channel's regular broadcast to report at Space Park. Although Ulala manages to save the President from the Rhythm Rogues' fiendish robot Pon Piriri, he was quickly whisked away by Rhythm Rogues member Shadow. When Purge revealed a ransom exchange for the hostages and the President, Ulala, Fuse and Noize quickly dispatched themselves to the exchange point. Despite warnings from Space Police Chief Pine to back off and leave the investigation to her, the Channel 5 team continued to make their way to the exchange point. As Ulala successfully escaped attacks from Pine, Space Michael sent a message to warn the group that Space Channel 5 had been attacked by robots. Ulala, Fuse, and Noize immediately return to the space station, declaring the ransom scoop a trap. Upon arriving at Channel 5 HQ's airspace, Ulala and the Astrobeat are attacked. Ulala goes it alone and manages to make it inside the station, rescuing Space Michael. The pair, along with many Evila (Upgrade) bots, enter the core and encounter Purge in the flesh for the first time. Purge cleverly uses Peace as a shield while fighting Ulala, but the reporter is able to defeat him with ease. Fuse dives in the Astrobeat Spaceship to deliver the final blow, but the laser shot he fires at Purge is rebounded towards Ulala. Fuse takes the blow for Ulala and ploughs into the fiery depths of the station. Ulala screams as Purge laughs manically before making off with the station's broadcasting antenna, and Ulala is stunned while Space Michael evacuates the station. Noize manages to rescue Ulala, but the Astrobeat Jr runs out of power. Ulala attempts to dance in order to regain power, and manages to create enough to escape the exploding space station. Ulala screams out for Fuse as the station finally explodes. Pine summons Ulala and Space Michael to Purge's base, and the duo arrive alongside rival reporters Pudding and Morolian Boss Hoorg. However, they are quickly found out and encounter Shadow again, prompting a band battle between the Rhythm Rogues and Ulala's group. Ulala's group wins and Shadow is revealed to be a brainwashed Jaguar. Jaguar quickly informs Ulala that Purge is intending to complete a weapon known as 'The Ballistic Groove Gun', which will force the whole galaxy to dance. As the whole group face off against Purge's robots, Ulala is soon led into a one-on-one dance battle with Purge. However, things take a turn for the worse when Purge uses dance power to turn into Purge the Great. Ulala turns desperate, and although she manages to avoid several shots from Purge, he quickly charges a shot which sends her spiraling to the ground. Fuse's voice urges Ulala to get up, as her friends and fans join her. Ulala is revived and takes on Purge with the help of her friends and many of those she rescued earlier in the game. Successfully rescuing President Peace, Purge quickly attempts to take out the entire mass with his Ballistic Groove Gun, but Fuse miracously turns up and urges Ulala to defeat Purge. Ulala responds \"Purge! Enough of your trash TV!\" before blasting him off into the galaxy with the help of her friends. Ulala states that 'Now...happy days, are indeed here again!' before strutting to the end of the galaxy with her entourage.Space Channel 5 VR: Kinda Funky News Flash  Ulala is set to reappear as the protagonist in the remake and teams up with two new Channel 5 recruits, Lou and Kee as her partners. They appear to team up to defeat Morolians, who invade the headquarters forcing people to dance, in a premise similar to that of the first game.Relationships with other characters Fuse  Fuse is Ulala's boss and the director of Space Channel 5. He guides Ulala throughout the levels, and can be very strict on the poor girl if she messes up. However, he gives nothing but praise if she does well, and even becomes fascinated by her moves. It is unknown how Ulala sees Fuse, whether a father or a brother figure, but she seems to care for him a lot. She rescued him from Blank's clutches in the first game and in Part 2, she was reluctant to escape the exploding station without Fuse. Judging that Fuse took Purge's hit for her, he clearly cares for her as well.Pudding  Pudding is UIala's rival reporter from Channel 42. In both games, she and Ulala face off in fierce showdowns for ratings. Whilst Pudding is rather arrogant in the first game, confident that Ulala is no match for her, she seems to have gained respect for her rival in the second game. This doesn't stop her from gloating when she wins their battles, however. In both games, Pudding ends up helping Ulala in order to defeat the main villain.Jaguar  In the first Space Channel 5, the mysterious reporter that ended up saving Ulala as a kid turns out to be Jaguar. At first, he butts in on Ulala's reports and tests her dancing skills; he says 'Not bad!' if the player does well, showing a hint of respect for Ulala. Perhaps Jaguar's reason for ambushing Ulala so much is because he thought she was in league with Chief Blank, being an SC5 reporter, but this is purely speculation. He rescues Ulala again after Blank launches a devastating attack on her during the final part of the first game, showing he cares about her. In the second game, Ulala returns the favour by saving him from Purge's control in the Mystery Zone. Seeing as how both reporters have saved each other's lives, and share the ideal of 'truth over ratings', it suggests that Ulala and Jaguar care and respect each other more than the traditional SC5 fan can see in the video games.Appearances in other games Sonic Riders (GameCube, Playstation 2, Xbox, PC)  Ulala appears in the game as a playable character. She is a Speed Type character, and her Extreme Gear board is the \"Channel 5.\", a white board with a 5 mark on it. Ulala is also one of the only characters incapable of riding bikes. Her Extreme Gear the\u00a0Channel 5\u00a0is actually a flat Astrobeat with a Channel 5 logo on it. Interestingly, the team that made the SC5 games were also responsible for Sonic Riders. However, Ulala does not reappear in the game's sequels, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity and Sonic Free Riders. A Space Channel 5 segment was also featured in the track SEGA Illusion, which was based on many SEGA IPs.Sega Superstars (Playstation 2)  Ulala is also featured in SEGA Superstars with her only minigame. It is heavily based off of 'The 100 Stage Dance Battle' from Space Channel 5 Part 2; even re-using sound tracks and various commands already used in the game's mode. The player must copy the Morolian's moves to save hostages. They can use 6 different buttons to use the different commands, and Ulala will point at that button with the player. Noteworthy is that this mode is called 'Ulala's Swingin' TV Show!' in the game, suggesting it is another one of her programmes she runs.Sega Superstars Tennis (Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS)  Ulala is one of the many SEGA characters to make a long-overdue return to the gaming world in this game as a playable character. Pudding also appears in this game; playable as well. Ulala is the 'control' type and her Superstar Move causes her to change into her white outfit. She then sends the ball in a 5 shape to the other side of the court, and Morolians pop up, causing her opponent(s) to dance when touching Morolians. There is also a Space Channel 5 court based on a spaceport, along with many Morolians who dance. A few tracks also return from the franchise to play on the court. Interestingly, Steve Lycett, executive producer of the game, stated that one of the mini-games that didn't make it into the final version was a Space Channel 5 mini-game. It is suspected, although not confirmed, that it would have been similar to the shooting sections from the game, but in a tennis format.Sega Splash Golf (PC)  In SEGA Splash Golf, Ulala is one of the optional caddies for the player to have. She also seems to re-tain her 'Channel 5' gear from Sonic Riders for this game; riding it in one of the trailers.Samba De Amigo (Wii)  In Samba De Amigo Wii, Ulala was the only SEGA character besides Sonic the Hedgehog to make a special guest appearance. She dances with Amigo in a tv broadcast room in Space Channel 5. Many Morolians and also Miis join Amigo and Ulala in dancing. Interestingly, Amigo seems to have been giving his own tv show, titled 'Samba TV', suggesting he and Space Channel 5 struck a deal for Amigo to have his own program. Ulala's stage has three songs. 'Mexican Flyer', which is Space Channel 5's main theme, 'Groove is in the Heart', which was ironically the same song SEGA asked Lady Miss Kier to advertise Space Channel 5 with back in 2000 and 'Do It Well'. 'Mexican Flyer' is actually the only SEGA song outside of Samba De Amigo to make an appearance in the game; unlike the original's many tracks from other SEGA games.Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Wii, Nintendo DS, PC, Mobile)  Ulala appears as an unlockable character in Sonic and SEGA All Stars Racing. She is one of the few Hovercraft types in the game; riding a floating space pod dubbed as the 'Astro Glider'. She is also the sole female racer besides Amy Rose. Ulala's All Star Move is named 'Tension Blast'. When she gets it, the reporter vanishes in a flash of pink light and re-appears on top of her vehicle; a Morolian now driving it. As she strikes the 5 pose, Morolians appear above the racers ahead of Ulala and forces them to dance. Meanwhile, Ulala withdraws her trusty space blaster and begins shooting at everyone, striking dance moves if she hits them. The icon for the move is a Blue Morolian. The announcer for the game seems to show hints of liking Ulala; when she is struck by a weapon, he claims \"A hit on Ulala! She'll be used to those.\", as well as saying \"Some beautiful driving from Ulala who looks good in first...looks good most anywhere!\". When Ulala wins a race, he yells \"CALL MEEEEEE!!!!!\". Three Space Channel 5 tracks were meant to appear in the game and were sixty percent complete, however, they were dropped.Hatsune Miku Project Diva and Project Diva Dreamy Theater  Although Ulala does not actually appear in this game, Hatsune Miku, a virtual turquoise-hair diva, has a module in both games called \"\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb5; (Space Channel 5),\" in which Miku wears Ulala's retro gear. The only thing that is different here is Miku keeps her long pigtails, only they are now pink. Her eyes also become the same shade of blue as Ulala's. Also in the games, you can upload tracks from other sources and make Miku and the other characters dance to it by creating what is known as an \"Edit PV.\" Some have made Miku disguised as Ulala dance to a report Ulala actually danced to by using moves that were similar to the directional moves in the game. In both games, the skirt of Ulala's outfit has moving physics. Also in this game Miku has another module based on Ulala's clothes called \"\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb39 (Space Channel 39)\" in which Miku still has her color scheme, but her top resembles Ulala's with a pink \"39\" on it, her boots have tall heels like Ulala's boots, and she wears very short shorts.Project X Zone  Ulala appears in the 3DS game, Project X Zone, a crossover RPG developed by Banpresto and Monolith Soft. She joins in Chapter 23, appropriately titled \"Ulala's Swingin' Report Show\", where, in the world of Resonance of Fate, the X Zone team is in the middle of stopping a statue of Leanne containing one of Aura's Segments from crashing into a gate. After the statue makes it halfway through the stage, Ulala appears, actually announcing the title of the chapter and begins making a special report about the party's activities. After annoying Devilotte with her commentary, Coco\u2605Tapioca and a group of Morolians,\u00a0Yaroo and Plurp, then appear on the tracks, in the path of the moving statue. The party realizes that if the statue makes contact with the robot, it will be shattered along with Aura's Segment. Ulala joins the party after the conversation, with the game announcing that\u00a0Coco\u2605Tapioca must be defeated by the end of the fifteenth turn or a game over will be declared.\u00a0 As a Solo Unit, Ulala can be assigned to any Pair Unit as their combo assist. When called in to help, Ulala walks into the middle of the battle and calls on three other Sega characters to attack for her: Opa-Opa from\u00a0Fantasy Zone, Harrier from\u00a0Space Harrier and Scooter from\u00a0Alien Storm. Once all their attacks pass, she finishes up with two shots of her trademark Tension Blaster before jumping out of the way.\u00a0Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed  Ulala appears as a playable character once again in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. This time, she is available from the start. Pudding is also playable in this game, but she must be unlocked. Ulala drives a white futuristic three-wheel sports car with a Space Channel 5 theme. For her All-Star move, Ulala shoots pink, heart-shaped blasts at her opponents while two Morolians dance behind Ulala's plane.Controversy  Lady Miss Kier, former lead vocalist of Deee-Lite, filed a lawsuit against SEGA claiming that Ulala was an unauthorized use of her likeness. She claimed SEGA offered her $16,000 to license her name, image, and songs for a video game, though she declined the offer. Afterwords, they allegedly went ahead and used her likeness anyways, causing her to file the suit. She ultimately lost, having to pay all of SEGA's $608,000 in legal fees.\u00a0 Ironically, Deee-Lite's 1990 hit \"Groove Is in the Heart\" was licensed by SEGA for use in the Wii game \"Samba de Amigo\", with Ulala guest starring in the level.Trivia Quotes Part One Part Two See Also Purge  \"Now the REAL party starts! The whole galaxy will dance for me!\" -Purge Purge (\u30d1\u30fc\u30b8, P\u0101ji') is the leader of the dancing group the Rhythm Rogues and the main antagonist of Space Channel 5 Part 2. With his robots and his henchman Shadow, he plans on making the galaxy happy through dance.Character Info  When Purge was 9 years of age, he was successful in the field of wave mechanics. Because of this, he had a powerful enough social and economical status to live on his own. Eventually however, he started to believe that everyone in the galaxy was stupid and unhappy and that he had to lead them to paradise. With that belief in his head, he decided that he had to make the galaxy dance for him. Purge's birthday is unknown and remains a mystery to this day. He is 18 years old and his blood type is A. When he made his first robot, he didn't give them emotions. This was because he didn't want them to run away and grew up surrounded by them. At certain points in the game, Purge is revealed to be able to use Dance Energy similar to Ulala, even getting his own \"Groove Aura\". His is blue, with electricity surrounding it.Personality  Purge has an extremely playful, almost childlike, personality. It's rare for him to take anything seriously, and he considers everything to be a game, including life or death situations. He has unusually strong self-esteem, which is partially due to Hubris. Purge sometimes tends to exaggerate things.Story Opening Cutscene  \"You saw it....\" Purge is first seen in the opening intro of Space Channel 5 Part 2. He is heard exclaiming to Jaguar that he saw the Ballistic Groove Gun before using hypnotism on him, thus cutting the players view to static. After the movie plays, it reveals that the movie was seen through Purge's point of view as it cuts to him watching the end of the video. This is also the only time in this game that we see him with his goggles off when he has his cloak on.Report 1: Ulala Back in Action!  \"They call me Purge! I'll make the galaxy dance for me!\" Purge's shadow can be seen in the background monitors of the Kin Kon Kan battle. He faces off against Fuse in a singing battle as Ulala and her entourage take on the singing robots. Depending upon if the player saved the hostages or not, Purge's dialogue changes significantly. \n For example: \"I'll never give up!\" becomes \"You don't stand a chance!\" After beating Kin Kon Kan, Purge exclaims that the \"party's just begun\" as he leaves.Pre-Report 2 Intermission Cutscene  \"Your precious Space President, Peace... Has been captured by us, the Rhythm Rogues!\" Purge takes over Moro Channel 5's broadcast from time to time in the game to give the player information.  In this cutscene, he's taunting the fact that he kidnapped President Peace using a plant mutation ray to create Pon Piriri.Pre-Report 3 Intermission Cutscene  \"I'll exchange the President AND the hostages for 6.6 trillion Space Dollars! Meet me at Point Double X!\" In this cutscene, Purge gives a message to Ulala and Pine. He tells them that he'll return all the people he's kidnapped for 6.6 trillion Space Dollars and to meet him at Point Double X. It's later revealed that this ransom scoop was only a trap to distract everyone long enough for Purge to put his true plan into action.Report 4: The End for Space Channel 5!?  \"I need this Space Transmitter to complete my grand plan! Soon enough... none of you... will have a thing to worry about!\" After saving Space Michael from Shadow, Ulala heads for the core of the station. Purge flies over and points out the fact that he has President Peace hostage. Ulala then engages in a double boss fight: One with the Purge Hovercraft and one with the Peace Carrier. After a while, Purge decides that he's taken quite a bit of damage and goes to plan B. He hides behind the Peace Carrier, using him as a human shield. The player must now play in reverse in a style similar to that of the Giant Evila. If the player fails, the shot will hit the President, and Purge will fire a bright pink Chu laser similar to that of Ulala's. After a while, Purge will connect his Hovercraft to the Peace Carrier and create Purge the King. Space Michael takes the lead as the main singer to counter Peace's forced attacks and Ulala meanwhile uses Chu and Hey to counter Purge's singing . As the battle goes on, the station starts to fall apart and more people come to your aid. Eventually, Purge is left weak as Fuse flys into the station. Using the collective power of everyone in the Core helping Ulala, Fuse fires a shot of energy at Purge the King. Purge screams in pain as he is seen struggling... then deflects the shot perfectly, revealing that he was pretending. Fuse takes the hit for Ulala as is sent flying to his \"doom\". Purge takes this moment to take the satellite and leave, taunting Ulala. His Robos are seen trying to stop Ulala as she tries to escape the station before it self-destructs.Report 5: The Spies Get Revenge  \"Couldn't you buy me just a little more time? You can't change back yet!\" During the first half of the trap set up for Ulala and her comrades in the Mystery Zone, Purge laughs every time they clear a room. Purge is seen again after Ulala and her friends make it past the Dark Rhythm Robots and duel The Shadows in a Battle of the Bands. Shadow is defeated, slightly changing back into Jaguar for a moment, before Purge appears and tells him that he can't change back. At that point, the genius reactivates the brainwashing signal, making Jaguar scream in pain. Purge then asks Ulala if she can spot the real one amongst the impostors, laughing manically. During the battle, when Shadow is trying to fight the control, Purge can be seen dancing in the background. After rescuing Jaguar, Purge grades you on how well you did in the report. One of three lines can be said depending on your rating: 49% and under: \"I wonder how long you'll last...\" 50 to 99%: \"Not bad at all!\" 100%: \"We're going to have fun together...\"Report 6: Purge's T.V. Special!  \"Welcome to my very own TV Show! This antenna you gave me is working just great!\" Using the newly finished Ballistic Groove Gun, Purge fires a test run, forcing a whole arena of hostages to dance to his whim. Ulala and her group take on Purge's Bodyguard Robos through a singing battle. After beating the Robos, Ulala will run onto Purge's stage only to find that she and Purge have been separated by an invisible wall. Purge wants to take Ulala on alone as he reveals his own Super Form: Dancing Purge. He takes Ulala in a Solo Dance Battle with her Dance Energy slowly charging the Ballistic Groove Gun. Soon enough, Purge reveals his power source to be President Peace trapped in a dome that focuses on his energy. With Ulala, President Peace and the Audience's power free for him to use, Purge creates the Dance Dimension X and becomes Purge the Great. Ulala tries to dodge the attacks, but Purge eventually fires multiple attacks at the same time, presumably killing her. With Ulala dead, the Ballistic Groove Gun's charge is finally complete...Grand Finale  \"Dance yourselves to hell, see if I care!\" Ulala is brought back to life thanks to the support of everyone helping the dancer, and she becomes Super Ulala. With everyone by her side, she takes on Purge the Great once more.  This time, she saves President Peace and takes on Purge in a singing battle to Mexican Flyer. After beating Purge, the Dance Dimension is broken and Purge retreats into the Ballistic Groove Gun, now transformed into a satellite. Fuse reveals that he's alive and helps focus the power of the 86,429 fans into one funkified force! Ulala and everyone tells him that he was wrong to think how he did before firing one last super powered shot.Bad Ending: Last 3 Chus Missed  Missing the last 3 chus in the game has Fuse's antenna fail at the most critical moment as the game cuts to a black screen. It is presumed that Purge wins, but this is not confirmed. Another point of view that could be seen is that both Purge and Fuse's antenna's failed.Good Ending  \"See you next Week!\" Purge is sent into deep space trapped in the Giant P seen earlier in Report 6. With the rogue defeated, the galaxy is finally at peace again. Purge is seen at the end of the Credits March, shown that he survived. He's strutting like Ulala as he walks to the other side of the screen. When Purge leaves the screen, he'll give one last command to confuse the player and keep them from getting a 200% rating.Ulala's 100 Stage Dance Battle  Purge appears as the final challenge in the 100 stage dance battle for the first set of 100 when you wear the Morolian suit. This is the only time in the game that Cloaked Purge is seen using Dancing Purge's moves. Beating him unlocks Cloaked Purge for use in the Changing Room.Purge Jr  \"I won't forget this!\" In the Extra Reports, Purge is known as Purge Junior. The only thing that changes is the line when he's sent off into Space. It is unknown if Purge Jr is really Purge's son or not.Ulala's Channel J  Purge got his own game in Ulala's Channel J, released only in Japan for the Vodaphone called \"Purge's Electric Shock Punishment Show\", which takes place after the events of Part 2. The translated text is as follows: Channel 5's anti-hero Purge is now causing mayhem on your cell phone! Introducing \"Purge's Electric Shock Punishment Show!\" Collect the lightning bolts that fall on the screen. Use the number keys to electrifiy the floor and punish those disobedient Robos!

A quick little brain electrifying action game!Trivia Gallery Artworks and Scans  Gallery continued ==>External Links  Space Channel 5 at G-rev.com (Officially UGA certified) UGA's Official Diaries (found through the Internet Archive Wayback Machine)Pudding  Pudding (\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3 Purin) is the ever-persistent rival of Ulala in the Space Channel 5 series. Usually seen with her groupies, you can bet something\u2019s going down when both her and Ulala enter the scene.Information  Pudding is a nineteen year-old reporter for Channel 42. A former teen idol, she now has a waning fan club although she can usually be seen with her bodyguards and groupies. Her catchphrase is \"It's me, Pudding!\" or \"Pudding desu!\" in the Japanese version. Her favorite color is turquoise. She was born on September 5, 2480, her Zodiac sign is Virgo, and her blood type is AB. After the Morolian invasion, Pudding decided to incorporate guitar skills into her reporting.Background  Before becoming a reporter for Channel 42 Pudding was a teen idol for four years. She was very popular and even went as far as to get two nose jobs since her sixteenth birthday to look beautiful. When it was time for her to step down from her profession, Pudding found a job as a reporter for Channel 42, even hiring some fans to be her \u201cbodyguards\u201d while on the air. In the Second World play-through of Part 2, she has attracted a comedienne impersonator in the form of Padding.Personality  Always the vain one, Pudding is never one to back down from a challenge unless she has been humiliated to an extent. Her competitive attitude and jealousy towards Ulala is mostly likely caused by her sometimes childish personality, and her natural competitive side from her days as a teen idol. Pudding also has quite the temper when she doesn't get her way. This usually goes hand-in-hand with her being humiliated such as in Part 2's second report when she shouts \"I quit!\" after being beaten by Ulala. Despite this, Pudding seems to have respect to those with better skills than her; she treats Ulala nicer in Part 2 when issuing a challenge to her unlike in the first game. However, she still likes to butt in on other's shows in both games, and doesn't hesitate to gloat when she is performing well.History Space Channel 5  Pudding makes her debut appearance in the first report, strutting in front of a Channel 5 camera and catching the attention of Fuse (\"Is that another reporter?!\"). A dance battle ensues between her and Ulala, ending with her defeat. She shows up again in Report 3 as one of the reporters out to get to the scoop of the Morolian secret base before anyone else. She makes it into the base first, but is hypnotized as a result. Ulala frees her and the former teen idol leaves the scene. Report 4 sees Pudding teaming up with Ulala and the Space Pirate Broadcaster Jaguar as they confront Channel 5's CEO, Mr. Blank. She makes her way through Space Channel 5's HQ, following Ulala as they eventually reach the top of the station. In the Giant Evila battle, she shoots the humongous robot along with Ulala and Jaguar. Unfortunately, she's the first to be knocked away by the mecha. She comes back to cheer on Ulala in a chant support and marches off to the end of the galaxy along with her and a bunch of others.Space Channel 5: Part 2  First appearing at the start Report 2, Pudding later faces off against Ulala at Fountain Square in a guitar duel. After being humilated at the hands of the pink-haired reporter, Pudding leaves in a fit with her bodyguards. In Report 3, she appears among the other reporters to get the scoop on the ransom for President Peace. Zooming out of nowhere, Pudding shouts, \"The scoop is miiiine!\" With a quick wave to Ulala she going forward through the sky. However, she doesn't stick around for long - in fact, she's gone almost as quickly as Ulala sights her - once the Space Police show up to shoo away all members of the press. Pudding returns and sticks around in Report 5, creeping around Purge's Mystery Zone space station with Ulala, Space Michael, Hoorg, and Pine. When all five of them wind up surrounded by Dark Rhythm Robots, Pudding takes care of the robots on the right side of the room. After the intermission, the team must take on The Shadows, a group of four BuffBots and Shadow, in a Battle of the Bands. Naturally, Pudding plays the guitar for their side. Pudding continues her appearance through the sixth and final Report. Marching down the path towards Purge, Pudding points out that the Ballistic Groove Gun has been sucking up all the dance energy of the crowd. Her line for when facing down the Mass-produced Peace Carriers is \"I'll end this!\" She and the others are eventually cut off from Ulala by an invisible wall, leaving Ulala to dance-off against Purge by herself. After the intermission, Pudding is the first to cheer on Ulala to get up and beat Purge the Great. Once Dance Dimension X is shattered, she is one of the people right next to Ulala as they berate Purge. (\"You're the one who isn't happy!\") When Purge is blasted into space and Ulala wraps up her show, Pudding walks off to the end of the galaxy with everyone.Quotes Space Channel 5\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0Space Channel 5: Part 2 Trivia Space Michael  \u201cWoo!\u201d -Space Michael Space Michael is a well-known super star of the galaxy, over in the Space Channel 5 series.Character Info  Super star Space Michael has an impressive dance energy that can make the whole galaxy groove.

Come on!\u201d). He\u2019s right behind Ulala as she transforms into Super Ulala and keeps going against Purge the Great. Once Dance Dimension X is broken, he stands next to Jaguar and moonwalks after Purge is blasted into space. He\u2019s right beside Pine as everyone makes their way to the end of the galaxy.Trivia Pine  \u201cPeople call me Pine! Eastern Venus Space Police.\u201d -Pine Pine is part of the \u201cred-hot Space Police\u201d in Space Channel 5 Part 2. She\u2019s chief of the Eastern Sector Space Police and along with her backup, Sexy 1 and 2, this vixen is ready to lay down the law through missiles and drum battles.Character Info  Space Police Chief Pine is a cowgirl dedicated to maintaining order across space. With her assistants Sexy 1 and Sexy 2, she can dish out justice on her drums. Beyond a twin sister named Texas, whom is only revealed in Extra Mode, there are no other family members of whom to speak. Pine is a special investigator at the dedicated Police Unit of the same organisation of the Space Rescue Police that serves as both Fire and Police department for the entire galaxy. Pine was born on June 5 and,\u00a0according to the\u00a0Sugoku Sugoi Guide Book, is 27. She is blood type A and her hobbies include swimming, reading, and horse riding. However, none of these are referenced to in-game. They are just little tidbits indicated within Pine\u2019s in-game profile.Personality  Pine has a strong sense of justice and isn\u2019t afraid to stand herself up close and personal with those who break the law. Using everything in the arsenal of her ship, she won\u2019t hesitate to do what\u2019s right and keep civilians safe. If someone who might be a disruption to an important investigation refuses to stand down, even if that someone is a civilian such as Ulala, Pine will do what\u2019s necessary to prevent said investigation from being compromised. Although Pine has a tough exterior, she isn\u2019t hard-headed. As heard at the end of Report 4, she knows when she\u2019s in over her head and requires assistance. She also has a soft side though it isn\u2019t shown much. The fact that she asks for Ulala\u2019s help instead of arresting the reporter for the stunt pulled in Report 3 should say something about her heart. Pine is one woman you don\u2019t want to mess with.Space Channel 5 Part 2 Report 3: Meet the Sexy Space Police!  \u201cYou should\u2019ve heeded the warning.\u201d Pine and her backup crew are first met not long after Ulala and a horde of other reporters arrive at Point Double X. When all but Space Channel 5 leave, the Space Police Vessel, the Playgirl, opens fire at the resisting members of the press. It begins dropping bombs, firing missiles, and shooting laser beams at Ulala and the Astrobeat in an attempt to drive them away and stop them from disrupting the investigation. When it becomes clear that Channel 5 will not be deterred, Pine along with Sexy 1 and Sexy 2 come up on deck and (after Pine\u2019s theme song is sang) start a drum battle with Ulala and her co-worker Noize. Depending on how well Ulala and Noize play, Pine has differing reactions. With the Space Police defeated, all three women retreat then fire a large missile at Ulala who takes it out in three chus.Report 4: The End for Space Channel 5?!  \u201cThis is Pine. I need your help. Please respond.\u201d While Pine doesn\u2019t actually appear in this report, she does send a message out to Ulala that she needs help.Report 5: The Spies Get Revenge!  \u201cThe reading on Purge and the President points us in this direction.\u201d Pine meets Ulala and her friends at the rendezvous in Purge\u2019s Mystery Zone space station. She helps lead them towards Purge and President Peace before an alarm goes off in the base. During the second half of the trap when everyone must stick together and shoot the Dark Rhythm Robots, Pine covers the left half of the screen. After the intermission, Ulala\u2019s team must take on The Shadows, a group of four BuffBots and Shadow, in a Battle of the Bands. Pine, of course, plays the drums for their side.Report 6: Purge\u2019s TV Special!  \u201cThis is the end of the line!\u201d Pine walks alongside Ulala and the rest of the team from the previous report as they confront Purge and his Rhythm Robots. She and the others are eventually held back by an invisible wall and cannot join Ulala as she faces off against Dancing Purge. Pine is first to appear again after the intermission, urging Ulala to not give up against Purge the Great. She is seen dancing with many others alongside Ulala in the finale. When Dance Dimension X is broken, Pine says \u201cI\u2019m going to heal that sick mind of yours!\u201d This is accompanied by her crossing her arms and nodding, an action reminiscent from the show \u201cI Dream of Jeannie\u201d.Trivia Jaguar  \u201cI am the voice of Truth.\u201d -Jaguar Jaguar (\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc Jag\u0101) is the mysterious man who always pops up on the scene in the Space Channel 5 series. Declaring himself as \u201cthe voice of Truth\u201d, he is usually seen with a Space Pirate or two to back him up in public.Character Info  Jaguar is a handsome reporter for the Space Pirate Broadcasting Station. He\u2019s a great advocator of Truth and commands the broadcasting ship, the Rogueship-A-Go-Go. He favors the scent of gasoline, and his relationship status is unknown. He\u2019s most likely single though. He saved Ulala\u2019s life when she was younger when she was the sole survivor of spaceship accident.Background  There isn\u2019t much known about Jaguar aside from hints and clues one can gather about his mysterious past. This man was once a reporter for Space Channel 5, and notably saved a young girl\u2019s life back around in 10 years before the Morolian invasion. However, after sensing something was amiss about CEO Chief Blank, he left the station and became a Space Pirate, calling himself \u201cthe voice of Truth\u201d.Personality  A charismatic man, Jaguar holds Truth to be one of the most important concepts to life. He was wary of Channel 5 when Mr. Blank was in charge, but has lightened up since then. Striving for the Truth does get him into trouble sometimes, as seen in Part 2 when he disappears for a good chunk of the game, during which the Rhythm Rogues cause trouble. He seems to have feelings for Ulala as it is unknown to herself despite being far behind of her age.Space Channel 5  First appearing on the Luxury Spacecraft G in Report 2 with the crew of the Rogueship-A-Go-Go, Jaguar comes off as a snubby man towards Ulala and Channel 5 in general. In fact, whenever he teases Ulala he says \u201cChannel 5\u201d instead of her name. He is beaten by the pink-haired reporter and leaves the area of the spacecraft just as Morolina shows up. In \u201cReport 3: Catch the Scoop!\u201d, Jaguar hinders Ulala from going any further towards the Morolians\u2019 secret base. When the Space Pirates fail to stop her, he follows after Ulala, delving deep into the modified asteroid that serves as the base. He helps Ulala beat Morolian Monroe, an alien she couldn\u2019t possibly beat herself, by shooting at the dual aliens directly while she takes care of the screens that appear. Ulala shoots out the television that was controlling the Morolians in the boss room, and the base begins to fall apart. As she flees and saves as many Morolians as possible, Jaguar comes over the comlink for Channel 5 and tells them that he\u2019s found out that the brainwashing signal is coming from the same frequency as Channel 5\u2019s. Report 4 sees Jaguar, Ulala, and Pudding marching into Space Channel 5\u2019s HQ, confronting CEO Chief Blank, or at least try to until he teleports away. Jaguar and the girls proceed to head through the station, rescuing Space Michael along the way, until they reach the top where Chief Blank reveals his true personality. Blank cares not for Truth, comparing it to a disease. Ulala defeats Chief Blank\u2019s \u201cperfect reporter\u201d Evila, a tweaked security bot, with Jaguar and Pudding at her side. Both join Ulala in coming to Fuse\u2019s rescue when Giant Evila grabs the Astrobeat. The huge robot swings a limb at Pudding then Jaguar, leaving Ulala alone. It's not long before Ulala, too, is knocked her platform in front of Giant Evila. Jaguar has his Space Pirates start up a rhythm in A Capella to help Ulala get her groove back. While they do that, he floats off of his broadcasting ship and grabs Ulala. He tells her, \"You've done well, Ulala. You'll be safe now.\" and returns her to her platform, ready to defeat Giant Evila. Once the monstosity of a mecha is beaten, Blank TV appears, a screen with the image of Blank on it, and the CEO announces his motive for brainwashing the masses: ratings. Jaguar is standing on the Rogueship-A-Go-Go when the Blank Dimension is broken and the energy of the crowd charges up Channel 5's satellite as Fuse has directed. \"You are an enemy to Truth, and all that is good.\" With that final statement, he, Ulala, and the girl's entourage repeat Blank's commands of \"Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!\" right back at him. The satellite fires a brilliant beam of blue at the station chief's screen and he is sent off into space. He marches alongside Ulala \"to the end of the galaxy\" with friends and former foes alike behind them.Space Channel 5 Part 2  Jaguar is seen in the opening cutscene, but disappears in a screen of static after hearing Purge say, \u201cYou saw it....\u201dReport 4: The End for Space Channel 5?!  After Shadow\u2019s defeat at Ulala\u2019s dance skills, Jaguar groans as his form flickers for a moment. Before Ulala can get a good look at him, he teleports away.Report 5: The Spies Get Revenge!  Losing the Battle of the Bands was just enough for Shadow\u2019s form to flicker again. Purge appears on the screens in the room and makes Jaguar scream in pain as the brainwashing signal takes over him again. Purge then \u2018invites\u201d Ulala to play a little game of \u2018which one of them doesn\u2019t belong?\u2019. Ulala takes this opportunity to free \u201cthe man in search of truth\u201d from Purge\u2019s grip. No longer under the control of the young genius, Jaguar informs Ulala and her friends that Purge has built \u201ca fearsome Ballistic Groove Gun\u201d from all of the satellites that have been stolen. The Milky Way\u2019s in danger and they need to hurry.Report 6: Purge\u2019s T.V. Special  \u201cNot gonna happen!\u201d The elevator Jaguar and the others are on opens up as \u201cthe first feature\u201d on the Purge TV Show. He, Ulala, and the rest groove down the steps and across the walkway towards Purge. Just as they reach him, a transparent wall prevents him, Pine, Pudding, Hoorg, and Space Michael from helping Ulala dance against Purge. During the second half of the report, Jaguar encourages Ulala to continue batting Purge the Great. Jaguar is off to Ulala\u2019s right while dancing with her and after Dance Dimension X is broken, he tells Purge: \u201cStrength without love won\u2019t change anything!\u201d He helps \u2018chu chu chu\u2019 Purge into deep space, dancing to the end of the galaxy with the rest of the previously captive audience of the Purge TV Show.Space Channel 5 VR: Kinda Funky News Flash  He is set to reappear for the Space Channel 5 VR remake soon.Trivia Quotes Part One Part Two Evila  \"I am the Ultimate Reporter, Evila.\" -Evila Evila (\u30a4\u30d3\u30e9, Ibira) is a Channel 5 security bot in the Space Channel 5 series.

This is the sequel to the game Space Channel 5. The PlayStation 2 version was released in Europe (except for the UK) in 2003, and was released in North America in 2003 as part of a sole package called Space Channel 5 Special Edition which included the original game, Space Channel 5. Space Channel 5: Part 2 (Limited Edition) was released in Japan featuring a carrying case and a set of large headphones (Dreamcast version only). In October of 2010, Sega announced that Part 2 was going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Network, the release date pegged at around early 2011. The game was released for the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on October 4th, 2011. The game begins some time after the Morolian invasion when Ulala makes her comeback on the reporting scene. She's back out in front of the camera, but a mysterious dance troupe known as the Rhythm Rogues make her job a little bit harder. People are being held hostage and even the President has become a victim of the troupe. With some groovy new dance moves, Ulala might stand a chance at uncovering the plot that Rhythm Rogue leader Purge has in store.Plot Report 1: Ulala Back in Action!  \"Ulala's Swingin' Report Show!\" Ulala's arrives on the Space Symphony ship, encountering the mysterious dance troupe, the Rhythm Rogues, as well as their ground leader Shadow. Ulala makes her way through the lounge area, saving hostages of the cruise ship along the way until she arrives in the Lookout Dome. Inside, Shadow introduces Ulala to the real leader of the troupe, Purge. Rising from an elevator in the center of the area, the singing mechas Kin, Kon and Kan appear to take on Ulala and the rescued victims of the Rhythm Rogues. Through a tough battle consisting of taunting, back talk, and robot babies, the mechs are toppled. However, it seems this comes as no surprise to Purge as he says: \"The party's just begun.\" Outfits To Unlock: 3Report 2: Nature's Revenge!  Space President Peace is at the band festival being held at Space Park when a mutant plant controlled by the Rhythm Rohues captures him. Reporters from Channels 1, 5, 42, 88, and Moro-Channel 5 arrive to cover the crisis, but Pudding is first on the scene, except she does not face Shadow. Ulala, spotting Shadow and some Black Flyers, makes her way to the conveyor belt he hovers above. It isn't long before the smooth and slow music picks up the pace and Shadow reveals that the same mutant plant as before is now holding space children hostage. Aiming carefully, Ulala manages to free them as well as their teacher before heading off to Fountain Square. \"Get your coverage from Channel 42!\" Rising from the main fountain is Pudding and her bodyguards. She challenges Ulala to a guitar duel. It's quite lengthy, but at last Channel 5's top reporter emerges victoriously. With Pudding having quit the battle, Ulala is faced with the Space Bird Mistress who is being forced to dance. Saving her, the Birdmen, and the workers of Space Park takes some quick and accurate shooting, but Ulala manages to do so. After that, it's off to the Greenhouse. The source of the mutant plant is found, along with Peace who is guarded near the very top of the Greenhouse. It's Ulala and her entourage versus Pon Piriri. Seed bombs, throwing star-flowers, and vicious vines aren't enough to deter the pink-haired woman and the true form of Pon Piriri is revealed as a mecha. Shadow shows up, initiating a waltz battle ensues. Ulala succeeds in defeating this strange plant robot, freeing President Peace. His song soon after revives Pon Piriri, whose digital face lightens in a yellow hue as it sways to the rhythm. Just as Ulala is wrapping up the special edition of her report show, Shadow reappears, tazes peace, and warps both of them out of the area. The President of the galaxy has been taken hostage by the Rhythm Rogues. Outfits To Unlock: 4Report 3: Meet the Sexy Space Police!  When Purge reveals a ransom exchange for the hostages and the President (6.6 trillion Space Dollars), Ulala, Fuse and Noize quickly dispatch themselves to the exchange point. Despite warnings from Space Police Chief Pine to back off and leave the investigation to her, the Channel 5 team continue to make their way to the exchange point. Both groups eventually meet for onboard the Space Police vessel, the Playgirl, for a drum battle. Noize backs up Ulala whilst Pine is backed up by two identical ladies. Ulala and Noize end up winning one for Channel 5 and move on, not expecting a rather large missile to be fired at them. In three \"Chus\", it explodes. As Ulala successfully escapes Pine's final attack, Space Michael sends a message to warn the group that Space Channel 5 has been attacked by robots. Ulala, Fuse, and Noize immediately return to the space station. Outfits To Unlock: 3Report 4: The End for Space Channel 5?!  Upon arriving at Channel 5 HQ's airspace, Ulala and the Astrobeat are attacked. Ulala goes it alone and manages to make it inside the station, rescuing Space Michael from Shadow on the elevator leading from the Control Room to the station's Core. The pair, along with many Evila bots, make it to the heart of Channel 5 only to encounter Purge. He reveals President Peace, trapped inside the Peace Carrier mecha. Alternating between copying the mecha's moves and shooting at Purge as he moves across the wall of the Core in his hovercraft, the young, giddy genius decides to play a little game: a dance battle in reverse. One false move could endanger the life of the President, but Ulala passes that stage of the fight only to come face-to-face with Purge the King, the combination of Purge's hovercraft and the Peace Carrier. A heated sing-off ensues with other Channel 5 employees coming to the aid of Ulala and Space Michael. The battle is so intense, it literally shakes the Core of Space Channel 5. Space Michael sings back in rhythm to the robot when it says \u201cdance\u201d while Ulala and, eventually, the crowd take care of the Chus and Heys. It\u2019s a sign that Ulala\u2019s dance energy is shining through when she doesn\u2019t even say actual words anymore and instead make sounds like \u2018hut\u2019 and \u2018hup\u2019. Cue Fuse diving into the Core inside the Astrobeat Spaceship to deliver the final blow. A triple \"Chu\"-charged shot is amassed in the ship's antenna, and a shot is fired in the same manner as was done to Chief Blank. At least that's what they expected. Instead, the robot holds onto the orb of dance energy and rebounds towards Ulala. Fuse dives the Astrobeat in front of the reporter, taking the hit instead and ploughing into the fiery depths of the station. The ship goes crashing deeper into the Core and Purge laughs, teleporting out of the Core that is ready to collapse in on itself. Ulala screams as Purge laughs manically before making off with the station's broadcasting antenna. The young woman is stunned while Space Michael evacuates the station. Noize manages to rescue Ulala, but the Astrobeat Jr. runs out of power. With only dance and jiggy power left, Ulala attempts to regain power through her groovy dance moves. She manages to create enough to escape the exploding space station, shouting out Fuse's name as the station finally explodes. Outfits To Unlock: 2Report 5: The Spies Get Revenge!  Ulala and Space Michael sneak into Purge's base, the Mystery Zone, meeting Pudding, Space Police Chief Pine and Morolian Boss Hoorg. However, they are soon discovered, finding themselves in a trap that they must dance and shoot their way out of. Upon exiting the trap, the group encounters Shadow again, descending on top; of a transport pod. A Battle of the Bands occurs between \"The Shadows\" and Ulala's group. Ulala's group matches the beats of Shadow and the BuffBots, Shadow flickering back to a man who is unsure of what is happening. Several screens pop up along the walls with Purge on them and the young genius strengthens the signal keeping Jaguar as Shadow. Jaguar screams in pain, warps in front of Ulala along with the BuffBots, and Purge asks if she wants to play a game. \u2018Which one of them doesn\u2019t belong?\u2019 in which the BuffBots turn into Shadow Impostors and Ulala must use \u2018the circle button beam\u2019 on the Shadow/Jaguar that\u2019s legit. Once Ulala fires enough blasts of her rescue beam, Jaguar, who nearly became free several times during the \u2018game\u2019, comes back for good. No longer under the control of Purge, Jaguar informs Ulala and her friends that Purge has built \u201ca fearsome Ballistic Groove Gun\u201d from all of the satellites that have been stolen. The Milky Way\u2019s in danger and they need to hurry. All together, they ascend in the same transport pod Jaguar had arrived on. Outfits To Unlock: 2Report 6: Purge's T.V. Special  The transport pod Ulala and her comrades are on opens up as \u201cthe first feature\u201d on the Purge TV Show. The team of Ulala, Pudding, Pine, Jaguar, Hoorg, and Space Michael groove down the steps and across the walkway towards Purge. Just as they reach him, a transparent wall prevents the others from helping Ulala dance against Purge. Led into a one-on-one dance battle with Purge, Ulala pulls out her best dance moves to beat the culprit responsible for so many wrong-doings throughout the galaxy. However, things take a turn for the worse when Purge uses the dance power of the audience to turn into Purge the Great. Dance Dimension X is activated, and much like the Blank Dimension, Ulala is trapped alone with her opponent towering over her. Ulala turns desperate, and although she manages to avoid several shots from Purge, he quickly charges nine shots which send her spiraling to the ground. Noize shouts for her. She doesn't move. And Purge continues to dance. Fuse's voice urges Ulala to get up, as her friends and fans join her. Ulala is revived (and Dance Dimention X change from an area of horrible static to shades of lovely pink due to Ulala becoming Super Ulala) and her entire group takes on Purge. Successfully rescuing President Peace, the Dimension sparkles with blueish-green energy as a combination singing/dancing battle ensues. The intensity of the battle is too much for the Dance Dimension X, and Purge the Great is sucked into his Ballistic Groove Gun as pure energy. He attempts to take out the entire mass of Morolia, the place where his TV Show was supposed to take off, with his Ballistic Groove Gun (now just one modified satellite), but Fuse miracously turns up and urges Ulala to defeat Purge. Ulala responds \"Purge! Enough of your trash TV!\" before blasting him off into the galaxy with the help of her friends in a triple \"chu\" blast. Ulala states that 'Now...happy days, are indeed here again!' before strutting to the end of the galaxy with her entourage. Outfits To Unlock: 3Characters  Space Channel 5's top reporter. When she was young, a reporter from Space Channel 5 saved her life, and she wanted to become a reporter for Space Channel 5. She carries with her trusty microphone and two guns. The Chu Beam is used for shooting aliens, robots and other attackers while the Rescue Beam is used to rescue hostages being forced to dance. When ratings are high, she emits a pink aura, signifying she is full of groove energy. The broadcaster of Space Channel 5. He remains in the broadcasting ship all the time, and his face is never seen. He relays instructions to Ulala to help her through her missions, although he often gets fascinated by Ulala's moves Space Michael, based on Michael Jackson, appears as a cameo in the first game, but becomes a fully involved character in Part 2. After being rescued by Ulala from the Rhythm Rogues, Michael uses his singing skills against Purge the King. A reporter from Channel 42, who usually shows up early on in the games. With her bodyguards, groupies and her catchphrase \"It's me, Pudding!\" (\"Pudding desu!\" in the Japanese version), she challenges Ulala but usually finds herself beaten. In Part 2, she challenges Ulala to a guitar battle. In both games, she teams up with Ulala on later levels A reporter from a Pirate broadcasting station dedicated to giving viewers the truth. He mysteriously disappears while investigating something. Later, it is revealed that he was brainwashed by Purge, becoming \"The Shadow.\" He is saved by Ulala at the end of Report 5. Ulala's partner who provides transportation for Ulala using a platform ship powered by dance energy and jiggy power. In Space Channel 5: Part 2, he helps Ulala in a drum battle against Pine. A member of the Sexy Space Police. In Part 2, when dozens of reporters are heading for a scoop, Pine lays down the law to clear the area, opening fire on Ulala who refuses to leave. She then challenges Ulala and Noize to a drum battle. Later on, she calls on Ulala's help to stop Purge. Leader of the Morolians. In the first game, Morolians were brainwashed by Blank into attacking people and forcing them to dance. Boss Moro was one of the last Morolians Ulala had to face before confronting Blank. In Part 2, he is a news reporter on Morolian News, which airs in between reports but constantly gets hijacked by Purge. In Report 5, he joins Ulala in stopping Purge. As the galactic president, Peace loves nothing more than to sing, but unfortunately whenever he gets the chance, he gets kidnapped by the Rhythm Rogues. His amazing voice provides a massive source of groove energy that Purge uses for evil. The main antagonist of Part 2, Purge is a sly dancer and leader of the Rhythm Rogues. Using his henchman Shadow and his army of robots, Purge kidnaps President Peace and steals satellites from several TV stations. This is all to complete his Ballistic Groove Gun in order to make the galaxy dance for him.Two-Player Mode  The only difference between dancing solo or with a friend is cooperation. In two-player mode, player one controls directions and player two controls the actions of the \"A\" and \"B\" buttons or the \"X\" and \"O\" buttons. In the Steam/PC version, \"chu\" is mapped to the \"J\" button and \"hey\" is mapped to the \"K\" buttonOther Features Extra Mode  Once the game has been completed and the credits roll, the player has the option of playing through a more difficult version of the game. The timings are stricter, ratings are harder to obtain (and thus hearts and stars are harder to get), and certain key characters have switched with an alternative counterpart.Ulala's 100 Stage Dance Battle  Optional from the main menu is a special mode that allows Ulala to go through 100 dance turns with only one heart. Some of the dance turns seem to resemble those found in the first game.Changing Room  Throughout the course of the game, the player can fulfill special goals to unlock various costumes for Ulala to wear in her reports or in the 100 Stage Dance Battle. These range from the costumes that she normally wears to skins of her friends and foes alike to unique clothing. There are 40 total.Gameplay  The game is basically a \"listen and repeat\" game just like it's predecessor; players are given a rhythm containing multiple gestures and must repeat them back exactly as heard. The dance commands merely use the existing movement buttons. The \"up\" button corresponds to Shadow raising one hand or Ulala raising both hands. For \"down\", Ulala lowers only her right hand, her left hand containing her microphone. When either the \"left\" or \"right\" button is pressed, she only moves her hand in the respective direction. No other input is needed for her to dance, although at some points during the game when one is instructed to press \"down\" on the directional buttons, one can easily press the other directional buttons to make Ulala or one of her companions make a different movement so long as it's with the rhythm. The \"A\" button, \"X\" button, or the \"S\" key is used for shooting at the Rhythm Rogues, or whatever the current threat is, or to simply make another dance move. The \"B\" button, \"O\" button, or \"D\" key is used for rescuing hostages or making some unique movement in a report. Originally the \"A\" or \"X\" button would have the characters say \"shoot\", but now they say \"chu\". The \"B\" button,\"O\" button or \"D\" key is now used for the \"hey\" command. (The keys have no such history.) In between the 'Simon Says' sections, Ulala appears to be taunting the opponent, or in a slump, dancing badly, depending on how many moves the player got or missed respectively. The performance also extends to the music. If Ulala misses a certain number of moves the music changes to an off tone one and if she has a better performance, certain extras will be played (as for example the glockenspiel in the second report if Glockenspiel Primary Schooler is saved). Ulala is given a certain number of hearts or stars in correspondence to the ratings she has achieved. If she misses a move or makes an incorrect move she will lose a heart or star. If she loses all the given number of stars or if the ratings drop down to 0.0%, the game will be over and Fuse will become upset with her. Various changed have been made since the first game. The scoring system has been changed, giving or taking away a percentage from the ratings depending upon how Ulala performs in each dance turn. Moves can be charged while holding down a button and instrument battles have been added, the latter being played by using any of the directional buttons. There is a 100 stage battle mode, in which players have to play 100 consecutive dance turns with only one heart. Some of the turns seem to resemble those found in the first game. There is also a 2 player mode, where one player controls directions and the other controls actions, and an alternate story mode where characters, costumes and dance moves are different.Version Differences Playstation 2 versions  As far as gameplay and visuals go, there aren't any recognizable changes in the Playstation 2 port of Space Channel 5: Part 2 (aside from the obvious: it's in English for the first time).

For those who ordered Space Channel 5 directly from Sega or certain retailers, they received \"Space Channel 5 Planet Dance [The Worlds Greatest Club Hits] Sampler\", a CD that, aside from having Ulala and and the title of the game on the cover, had nothing to do with Space Channel 5.Plot  Set 500 years in the future where space travel is now the norm, it\u2019s apparently still difficult to maintain ratings for a television station. Channel 5, after years of broadcasting, has plummeted in the ratings, and if something isn\u2019t done soon it will be permanently canceled. Enter Ulala, station director Fuse\u2019s last hope of reviving the nearly dead Channel 5. He sends her out as the final resort to report on the invasion of an alien race called the Morolians.Report 1: Introducing...Ulala!  Ulala arrives on scene at Spaceport 9, the first area the Morolians invade, where chaos has broken out. She struts and dances her way through the main lobby, then the Flight Control Tower where the Space Rescue Police's mission to save the workers of the spaceport has gone awry. Things seem to be going well until the rival reporter of Channel 42, Pudding, strides in front of Channel 5's camera. She and Ulala quickly have a dance-off to see who is better. Ulala proves to be a formidable opponent, making Pudding and her Henchmen to retreat. With that taken care if, Ulala and the people she rescued head off for the Launch Pad. There, the hypnotized robot Coco Tapioca confronts them in a dancing duel. It isn't long before the mecha is defeated and Ulala's report show wraps up successfully.Report 2: Spaceship S.O.S.!  Onboard the Luxury Spacecraft G is where Ulala finds herself next doing her Swingin' Report Show. She heads from the cockpit to the dining hall with the crew of the vessel right behind her. It's after she saves the Space Diva that a shadow looms over her and her posse. It's the Rogueship-A-Go-Go and the Space Pirates! Some technical difficulties are brought to the broadcast of the report show, and when the static clears the camera focuses on the infamous Space Pirate Jaguar. He challanges Ulala to a dance-off, though the pink-haired woman proves she can get down. She perks Jaguar's interest before he zooms away with his jetpack. Ulala has no choice but to continue onto the Observation Platform. As Jaguar and the other Space Pirate Broadcasters get away, following after the mothership of the Morolian fleet, Ulala and the rescued victims of awful dancing face off against Morolina, yet another dancing robot. She uses space children and Morolians alike as shields before using her tongue to attack. Even against such dishonorable tactics, Ulala prevails, shooting up the ratings for Channel 5 even more as she and her posse march away.Report 3: Catch the Scoop!  Somehow it happened, but no one questions it: the secret base of the Morolians has been discovered within the Asteroid Belt. Ulala rides the Astrobeat Jr. as she races reporters from other channels to get the scoop. Pudding, her bodyguards, Shinichiro Tachibana, and 88MAN are among those whom Ulala shoots at in order to clear the way to the secret base. Jaguar shows up, his ship blasting a large asteroid in front of Ulala soon after he confronts ulala with her space Pirates. He's able to hold her off long enough, incidentally, for Pudding to make it inside of a humongous, modified asteroid. Although, her luck quickly changes as she's hypnotized by the Morolians and in need of saving. Freeing the former teen idol, Ulala delves deeper into the far-out twists and turns of the base until she reaches the Head Office. A wide-screen television (like as new television example: LCD television) is setup there, with the strongest dancebot of them all lurking within, and\u00a0it goes by the name of\u00a0Morolian Monroe. It attacks safely from inside the monitor, but soon emerges from it, revealing that it\u2019s a two-in-one robot. Morolian Monroe changes tactics quickly, forcing Ulala to trace the trail it leaves from one side of the bot to the other. Although when it splits up into two robots, one green and one pink, Ulala hops off the Astrobeat Jr., the battle becoming even harder. The bots gang up on Ulala, making it impossible to get a single shot in. Both Ulala and Fuse are startled when Jaguar finally catches up with them. Instead of taunting or challenging Ulala, however, he extends his help to the Channel 5 reporter and together they are able to defeat Morolian Monroe. Victory doesn't last long as strange images begin appearing on the giant TV. Morolians crowd around Ulala, and she questions if the aliens were brainwashed too. Fuse tells her to \"Shoot at the TV\", and once she does the screen blows out. The Morolians immediately revert to normal, being free at last and Fuse come to the conclusion that someone has hypnitzed them to force the\u00a0earlier hostages to dance. The secret base shakes and everyone is forced to jet as the place begins to explode. As Ulala is riding out of the large tubing leading outside and pulling double duty in saving the burning Morolians, Jaguar comes over the comlink between Ulala and Fuse, saying: \"I found where the brainwash signal's coming from. Looks like it's frequency is the same as Channel 5's.\" In an unbelievable turn of events, the Channel 5 team knows where to head to next: The Channel 5 studio.Report 4: Evil in the Galaxy Revealed!  Ulala, Pudding, and Jaguar strut into Channel 5 Headquarters to find the source of the mastermind at work behind the invasion. It turns out to be none other than Channel 5 CEO Chief Blank. He runs - more like teleports - away from the trio and the chase continues. Space Michael is encountered in the connecting hallway and he's saved from the Morolians, joining Ulala as she heads for the Control Room. Inside of the elevator there, Mr. Blank is seen sitting on a chair. Taunting the pink-haired reporter, he zooms up to the roof while Ulala is left with a mass of Morolians to take care of. Saving Hoorg, the Morolian Leader, completes the group following Ulala up to the final confrontation. Emerging from the elevator, Ulala and her companions learn a surprising fact about Chief Blank. He doesn't care about truth. In fact, he wants every reporter to share his vision. The \"Ultimate Reporter\" Evila is sent to outdance Ulala, but the robot fails against the groovy moves of the spunky reporter. The puppet is taken care of, it seems that Ulala has won. At least until the roof of the dome opens up and Fuse yelps for help. A humongous robot, Giant Evila, has taken the broadcasting ship and the director inside hostage, leaving it up to Ulala aboard the Astrobeat Jr. along with Jaguar and Pudding on their own crafts to dance-off against the new threat. Ulala must move in the opposite direction of what she hears to keep Fuse safe. Giant Evila gets bold, knocking away both Pudding and Jaguar before the sound system fails and Ulala loses her rhythm. Ulala is knocked away, let to float in space. An A Capella beat picks up and Jaguar reaches out to grab Ulala, twirling her slightly back onto the Astrobeat Junior. Ulala now has a chant support, giving her a rhythm to groove to. She retaliates and finally Giant Evila's head disconnects from the rest of it's body, hovering above everyone. It shifts to the image of Chief Blank, who reveals that ratings are everything to him. If television was all for ratings, then what was the problem with brainwashing the masses? Chief Blank, now called Blank TV, activates the \"Blank Dimension\" sucking him and Ulala into a separate space to do battle, yet the chant support is still clearly heard. Through a somewhat confusing game of TV laser tag wherein Ulala must shoot the screens with the correct beam (either \"shoot\" or \"rescue\"), the strength of her support increases. People start singing along with Ulala even when Blank's screens act as feet and hands in a way one could only see to believe. The Blank Dimension shatters and Ulala is free. When the energy of the crowd is pumped up, Fuse says for everyone to focus all of their energy on the station's antenna. Ulala, Jaguar, Pudding, and some Morolians each get a line in as the energy builds, becoming tendrils of a brilliant blue against the dark, specled canvas of space. Those tendrils work their way up the antenna just as Blank says his last three commands: \"Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!\" Everyone shouts the same right back, fully charging the antenna and blasting Blank, claiming he'll be back, into deep space. Ulala wraps up her final report and marches off with friends and former foes alike along a glittering trail left by Fuse's ship. They make their way to the end of the galaxy. Although the report isn't truly over until the results screen pops up.Characters  Space Channel 5's last minute reporter to help bring up the ratings. She carries with her trusty microphone and two guns. The Chu Beam is used for shooting aliens, robots and other attackers while the Rescue Beam is used to rescue hostages being forced to dance. When ratings are high, she emits a pink aura, signifying she is full of groove energy. In Space Channel 5 Fuse fully backs her up as Channel 5's last resort to stay on the air. The broadcaster of Space Channel 5. He remains in the broadcasting ship all the time, and his face is never seen. He relays instructions to Ulala to help her through her missions, although he often gets fascinated by Ulala's moves. When Channel 5 is on the brink of being canceled for good, he supports Ulala when she winds up being the only reporter left who could possibly save the station. Space Michael, based on Michael Jackson, appears as a cameo in Report 4. He later becomes a fully involved character in Part 2. A reporter from Channel 42, who usually shows up early on in the games. With her bodyguards, groupies and her catchphrase \"It's me, Pudding!\" (\"Pudding desu!\" in the Japanese version), she challenges Ulala but usually finds herself beaten. A reporter from a Pirate broadcasting station dedicated to giving viewers the truth. In the first game, he tends to act snubby against Ulala's affiliation with Space Channel 5. He was a former member of Space Channel 5, and was indeed the reporter who saved Ulala's life years ago, but he sensed corruption from the station's head chief, Blank. He does, however, rescue Ulala once again from Blank, and uses his back up group to get Ulala back in the groove. Leader of the Morolians. He decides which plans should be used in the ongoing invasion of the earth people. Doesn't realize that the Morolians were brainwashed by Blank into attacking people and forcing them to dance. He is one of the last Morolians Ulala has to face before confronting Blank. The head Chief of Space Channel 5 in the first game, Blank became corrupt and brainwashed the Morolians to stage an alien invasion, so that he would get many ratings. He despises reporters who 'spread truth like disease' and even creates a robot clone of Ulala called Evila to replace her. He is soon defeated using the dance energy of the crowd and sent flying into space.Extra Mode  Once the game has been completed and the credits roll, the player has the option of saving and playing through a more difficult version of the game, although it is most noticeable in Reports 1 and 2. The timings are stricter and the dance turns tend to be longer.Gameplay  The game is basically a \"listen and repeat\" game; players are given a rhythm containing multiple gestures and must repeat them back exactly as heard. The dance commands merely use the existing movement buttons. The \"up\" button corresponds to the aliens raising both paws or Ulala raising both hands. For \"down\", Ulala lowers only her right hand. Her left hand contains a microphone. When either the \"left\" or \"right\" button is pressed, she only moves her hand in the respective direction. No other input is needed for her to dance. The \"A\" or \"X\" button is used for shooting at the Morolians or simply another dance move. The \"B\" or \"O\" button is used for rescuing hostages (In report 2, however, in the first phase of the boss, the \"B\" or \"O\" button is not used for shooting directly at the hostages.There also appears to be mispronunciation of \"shoot\" when the player presses either the \"A\" or \"B\" button. In the manual, it says \"shoot\", but the Morolians say words that are quite similar to \"kiss\" or \"chin\". Ulala, Pudding, Jaguar and Evila say \"chu', while Fuse says \"shoot\" or \"chu\". In between these scenes, Ulala appears to be taunting the opponent, or in a slump, dancing badly, depending on how many moves the player got or missed respectively. The performance also extends to the music. If Ulala misses a certain number of moves the music changes to an off tone one and if she has a better performance, certain extras will be played (for example: a guitar solo in the first level). Ulala is given a certain number of hearts in case she misses a move or makes an incorrect move. If she does so, she will lose a heart. If she loses all the given number of hearts, she will then hunch over and become upset, with Fuse shouting at her. In a boss fight, losing all of the hearts results in a game over. The same goes for if Ulala doesn't meet the expected percentage or ratings in a report.Version Differences Playstation 2 versions  As far as gameplay and visuals go, there aren't any recognizable changes in the Playstation 2 port of Space Channel 5. However, in Space Channel 5 Special Edition, some things have been altered from the original version. This section also details the differences between Part 1 and Part 2.Space Channel 5SE vs Space Channel 5 Space Channel 5 Part 1SE vs Space Channel 5: Part 2SE Space Channel 5: Ulala's Cosmic Attack  Space Channel 5: Ulala's Cosmic Attack was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 by THQ as part of an agreement that gave THQ the exclusive rights to make Game Boy Advance games based on Sega franchises. It is a remake of the original Space Channel 5.Development  In discussing the study of target demographics, Mizuguchi related the story of designing Space Channel 5, which was at first a vague assignment from Sega that asked only that Mizuguchi design a game with a broad enough appeal to draw in even casual female gamers. \"This was the first I'd heard of casual female gamers\", he said, \"so I didn't really know what to do. I personally interviewed a lot of young girls, trying to find out what they like.\" Women, he says, tend to enjoy puzzle games, while male gamers \"want to be on top, they want to accomplish something and be the champion.\" It's difficult, he insists, to create a game that appeals to both males and females on an equal level. Mizuguchi has also stated that Space Channel 5 was inspired by the dance troupe Stomp . He highly enjoyed the performance, and began thinking why musicals were so much fun, but more importantly \"How can we get this feeling into an interactive process?\". It was then that Space Channel 5 was born. Michael Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Space Michael in Space Channel 5, near the end of the game. The May 2007 issue of EGM contains a quote from series creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi concerning what it was like to work with Michael: He had a more prominent role in Space Channel 5 Part 2 where he became the new head of Space Channel 5. Whilst Ulala is distracted by a fake scoop, the headquarters are attacked and Space Michael is kidnapped by Purge and the Rhythm Rogues and has to be rescued by Ulala in a level featuring several of Michael's trademark dance moves. He then joins Ulala in facing up against Purge. In both versions of the game, Michael speaks in English, which is subtitled into Japanese in the Japanese version.Lawsuit  In early 2003, Lady Miss Kier, formerly of the band Deee-Lite, initiated a lawsuit against Sega corporation for allegedly stealing her former persona and using it as the basis of a video game character. The lawsuit was based on accusations of copying her look of knee-high boots, short skirts and a pink ponytail, for Sega's Ulala character design. Lady Miss Kier (real name is Kierin Kirby) claimed that Sega offered to pay her $16,000 to license her name, image and songs for the game, though she rejected their offer. Kirby later learned that the videogame maker went ahead and used her resemblance anyway, and she decided to initiate the lawsuit. She ultimately lost the suit and a later appeal and was liable to pay Sega's legal fees of $608,000 (reduced from $763,000 requested).Trivia Appearances in other games  Ulala, along with other Space Channel 5 elements, have appeared in several other video games: Ulala has also made a cameo in the 2001 film Josie and the Pussycats, where she is popular in the merchandising in a store that Wyatt visits to try out a demo CD.External links Shadow  \u201cWe are known as the Rhythm Rogues.\u201d -Shadow Shadow (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30fc, Shad\u014d) is the ground leader of the Rhythm Rogues in Space Channel 5 Part 2. He continually taunts Ulala and is always seen either personally battling her or introducing her to a boss of a report. He is the Rhythm Rogues alter ego of Jaguar up until Report 5 in Space Channel 5 part 2. He is voiced by Tom Clarke Hill in the English version, and Sho Hayami in the Japanese version.Character Info  Shadow is the mysterious field captain for Purge\u2019s Rhythm Rogues. He follows any and all orders, teasing Ulala during her \u201cSwingin\u2019 Report Show\u201d even when she wins.Personality  Shadow is a bit of a flirt towards Ulala and is very loyal towards Purge. He\u2019s playful at first towards the persistent reporter, then takes a bit of a nasty turn when he threatens her later on in the reports. (\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand no....\u201d)Story Report 1: Ulala Back in Action!  Shadow debuts aboard a spaceship with an army of Rhythm Robots at his side. With them, he forces the people on the ship to dance. Those who aren\u2019t taken away are left scattered around the spacecraft and are saved by Ulala once she struts onto the scene. Shadow faces Ulala three times before the show\u2019s \u2018intermission\u2019 where he introduces Ulala and the real leader of the Rhythm Rogues, Purge. Shadow warps out before Ulala battles Kin, Kon, and Kan.Report 2: Nature\u2019s Revenge!  Shadow reappears again at the Space Park, luring Ulala out onto a conveyor belt that malfunctions. He challenges her soon after she and the Space Children disembark from the runaway machinery. He prevents two children and one teacher from being rescued, forcing Ulala into another dance battle \u201cbefore they melt\u201d. Shadow later shows up at near the end of Pon Piriri\u2019s defeat, he challenges Ulala to a waltz battle. After his defeat he disappears for a moment giving a false sense of victory, then reappears shocking President Peace and teleporting away with him.Report 4: The End for Space Channel 5?!  Shadow captures Space Michael and Ulala must boogie down to save the station chief. Even with four BuffBots Shadow is unable to stop Ulala from saving Space Michael. Just as the duel ends, Shadow\u2019s form flickers to that of a man in a black and white suit as he stumbles. He teleports away before Ulala can get a good look at him.Report 5: The Spies Get Revenge!  After Ulala and her teammates make it through Purge\u2019s trap at the Mystery Zone, Shadow drops down from an opening in the ceiling of a room with four BuffBots. Together they are the Robotic Band: The Shadows and they take on the others in a Battle of the Bands. It\u2019s one heck of a show, although when Ulala\u2019s team wins, Shadow flickers back to the same man Ulala saw before: Jaguar. Several screen pop up along the walls with Purge on them and the young genius strengthens the signal keeping Jaguar as Shadow. Jaguar screams in pain, warps in front of Ulala along with the BuffBots, and Purge asks if she wants to play a game. \u2018Which one of them doesn\u2019t belong?\u2019 in which the BuffBots turn into Shadow Impostors and Ulala must use \u2018the circle button beam\u2019 on the Shadow/Jaguar that\u2019s legit. Once Ulala fires enough blasts of her rescue beam, Jaguar, who nearly became free several times during the \u2018game\u2019, comes back for good.Trivia Quotes Noize  \"All that's left is dance and jiggy power!\" - Noize Noize (\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u304f\u3093, Noizu-kun) is Ulala's dependable co-worker in Space Channel 5 Part 2. He works directly under Fuse and it is speculated, although not confirmed, that he is the only person to have seen the mysterious director. Noize is voiced by Alan Marriot in the English version and Ken Okazaki in the Japanese version.Character Info  Noize is a whiz-kid when it comes to inventing. He helps out on repairs to the broadcasting shuttle and creates new types of microphones for Ulala to use in her reports. The Channel 5 technical development chief headhunted and found him due to his skills in technology. In his free time, Noize likes to mix music. According to the Gyun Gyun Guide Book, Noize is 15. Noize also helped out in the creation of Evila Upgraded.Personality  Noize is hard working and reliable, and will always be there when Ulala needs a hand. He's very mature for his age, but still seems to be worried about his co-workers.\n This is especially seen when Noize takes over for Fuse. Messing up will have him yell out worried for Ulala (\"Please be careful Ulala!\"). Despite this, it seems that he also has a sarcastic side, as shown when you decide to quit the game (\"Oh geez, thanks.\"). In the end though, he's a kindhearted person who'll look out for the people he cares about.Story Report 1: Ulala Back in Action!  \"Here we go Ulala!\" Noize is first seen piloting the Astrobeat Jr in the Pre-Report Cutscene for Report 1. He's flying Ulala over to the Space Symphony, where the Rhythm Rogues are forcing people to dance. At the end of the report, Noize can be heard with Fuse. Depending on your rating, Noize will either be getting Fuse coffee, trying to clean up coffee that Fuse spilled on himself, or trying to calm Fuse down.Report 3: Meet the Sexy Space Police!  \"Battling Drums!\"  After flying Ulala around the Playgirl to avoid Pine's missles, he helps out Ulala against Pine and the two Sexys in a drumming battle. This is the only time in the story that we see Noize out of the Astrobeat Jr. After beating Pine, Noize hops back into the Astrobeat Jr and helps her stop a giant missle fired at them.Report 4: The End for Space Channel 5?!  \"Let's get a charge going!\" When Fuse takes the hit for Ulala and is sent flying to his \"doom\", Noize helps Ulala escape from the station, which is about to self-destruct. The Astrobeat Jr is in a rough condition, the antenna is broken and the machine can only run on Dance and Jiggy Power. With Ulala's dancing and shooting skills, the two escape the station at the last second. Noize is forced to fly away as Ulala screams out for Fuse.Reports 5 and 6  \"Ulala, you're right on the money!\" With Fuse gone, Noize is forced to take over as Ulala's \"boss\" in a way. He gives the reporter praise for when she hits the commands perfectly. But if the player messes up even once, Noize becomes worried for her safety and tells her that \"she'd better be careful!\" He gives new players info about Jaguar when Ulala saves him, telling us that \"He's the guy who once saved Ulala's life!\" In Report 6, Noize is forced to watch as Ulala takes on Dancing Purge, and eventually Purge the Great. He screams out for Ulala when she is presumably killed. In the Grand Finale, Noize is just as shocked as Ulala when Fuse returns, revealing that even he didn't know that Fuse was alive. This is also confirmed in the credits, when he tells Fuse that \"He can't believe that he's alright!\"Trivia Fuse  \u201cOut of sight, baby!\u201d -Fuse Fuse (\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba, Hy\u016bzu) is the director for Space Channel 5 in the series of the same name. He\u2019s never been seen outside of the Astrobeat, and he directs Ulala from behind the scenes.Background  Much of Fuse\u2019s past is unknown both prior and during his reign as director of Space Channel 5. He nearly lost that position as Channel 5 went downhill, nearly becoming canceled. With Ulala as the only reporter left at the time of the Morolian invasion, he put his full support behind her and hoped for the best.Character Info  Fuse is probably one of the most puzzling characters technically on the scene. The main reason for that is because he has never been seen, and the only people who probably have seen him face-to-face are Ulala and Noize. At 35 years-old, it is unknown for long he has been working at Space Channel 5. He stands behind Ulala, giving her his full support. Fuse was born on September 21 and he is blood type O.Personality  Fuse is described as a normally laid-back kind of guy, but when it comes to ratings, he turns into a hot-head, pure and simple. He scolds Ulala daily, but it just may be because he's worried about her, the ratings (albeit not to the extent of Mr. Blank), and his reputation of being a tough guy. He has a short fuse, hence his name, and it's often said that doesn't help morale amongst his staff. He does care about what happens to Ulala though, as ultimately seen in Report 4 of Space Channel 5 Part 2. He also seems quite clumsy.Space Channel 5  During the Morolian invasion Fuse backs up Ulala, often telling her where to go, what to do, and either scolding or giving his approval depending upon how well she performs. He doesn\u2019t appreciate other reporters like Pudding and Jaguar hogging the scoops that Space Channel 5 needs to stay on the air. Although he often gets in a remark or two directed at them. In Report 3, Fuse fret about other reporters catching up with Ulala, particularly shown when Jaguar reaches Ulala\u2019s position within the Morolian base. Although when the base is exploding and Jaguar tells him and Ulala about the truth of the frequency of the brainwashing signal, he\u2019s more than surprised. It\u2019s not everyday that an invasion is controlled by the CEO of your place of work, using the frequency of your broadcasts to brainwash aliens who brainwash people. While Ulala, Jaguar and Pudding go to Channel 5 HQ confront Chief Blank in Report 4, Fuse is stuck in the Astrobeat. It isn\u2019t until after Ulala defeats Evila that he literally gets into a tight situation. He pleads for help from the reporter as Giant Evila, a gigantic robot of Blank\u2019s, holds the spaceship firmly. Ulala and her companions must shoot in the opposite direction that they hear, but one by one they are all knocked away by the mecha\u2019s hand. The sound system providing the rhythm winds up busted and it takes an A Capella song by everyone at the station plus Jaguar\u2019s Space Pirates to get Ulala back in her groove and save Fuse.Space Channel 5 Part 2 Report 1: Ulala Back in Action!  Fuse is back, once again backing Ulala who is back in action. This time around though, instead of merely giving out commands, comments, accolades, or harsher scoldings, he actually sings during certain segments in Ulala\u2019s report show. He truly shows off his vocals for the first time when Ulala confronts Kin, Kon, and Kan in the Lookout Dome.Report 2: Nature\u2019s Revenge!  Fuse doesn\u2019t need a sixth sense to send Ulala out to Space Park when President Peace is captured by the Rhythm Rogues. He reminds Ulala that she has a guitar when Pudding shows up and gives Ulala the commands to strike a pose soon after that. At the Greenhouse where Pon Piriri resides, Fuse asks if Ulala can handle the onslaught of ivy that the robot attacks with before she\u2019s suspended above the floor by four vines. For some reason, the Fuse-man disregards the President\u2019s exit, saying \u201cGood job, well done\u201d if Ulala has danced well enough.Report 3: Meet the Space Police!  Channel 5 heads to Point Double X, but unfortunately so does every other news station in the galaxy. When the Space Police show up, Fuse refuses to leave without the scoop. The Astrobeat handles the Hey commands given by Pine\u2019s ship, the Playgirl, while Ulala on the Astrobeat Jr. handle the chus. He eventually tells Noize to backup Ulala on the drums as Pine and her comrades step out onto the deck. When all is said and done, an emergency transmission from station chief, Space Michael comes through. Fuse promptly tells everyone to get back to the Channel 5 HQ after cursing that they followed a false scoop.Report 4: The End for Space Channel 5?!  The Astrobeat cannot go on as it is swarmed by Rhythm Robots the moment it enters the airspace of Space Channel 5 HQ, so Ulala is sent off on her own. It isn\u2019t until later that the craft breaks free and comes to Ulala\u2019s side. Without question, Fuse\u2019s moment of glory comes at the end of the battle against Purge the King in Report 4. He rushes into the Core of Channel 5 studios when Ulala, Space Michael, and much of the crew of Channel 5 have weakened Purge the King. The satellite on top of the spaceship harnesses their dance energy and fires, much like what happened with Mr. Blank, except that the mecha doesn\u2019t fall apart. Instead, the robot holds a the sphere of energy and throws it back, the orb of death aimed straight at Ulala. Before anybody knows it, the Astrobeat dives in front of the pink-haired reporter, taking the hit and turning a hue of red. Fuse\u2019s ship goes down, although his last words are quite inspiring to Ulala: \u201cUlala, the universe depends on your funky moves!\u201d The Astrobeat crashes further into the Core, the heart of Channel 5 collapsing in on itself.Report 6: Purge\u2019s T.V. Special  Just as Dance Dimension X shatters and Purge the Great is sucked into the satellites for the Ballistic Groove Gun, the Astrobeat rises from below of what used to be Purge\u2019s television show. Not even Noize knew that Fuse had survived. His first command to Ulala is: \u201cFocus the power of the 86,429 fans into one funkified force!\u201d Ulala, Jaguar, Pine, and Pudding get their last lines in, berating Purge for his actions while Fuse aims the satellite of the Astrobeat one more time, ready to finally finish this. With the combined energy of everyone at the Mystery Zone, it\u2019s enough to \u2018chu chu chu\u2019 Purge into the depths of the galaxy. Fuse guides his ship to create a path of sparkles again for Ulala, her friends, and her entourage to march and dance along to the end of the galaxy.Quotes Part One Part Two Trivia Chief Blank  \"I must dispose of these peons who spread truth like disease!\" -Chief Blank Chief Blank (\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30af, Buranku) is the big bad daddy-o of Space Channel 5 and is the main antagonist of it's game version. He shows up in Report 4, leading Ulala and her companions to the top of Channel 5\u2019s HQ. He\u2019s voiced by Gary Martinez in the English version and Kenji Utsumi in the Japanese version.Character Info  Not much is known about Blank prior to his ratings-driven craze. In fact, not much is known about him, period. It is known, however, that his favorite color is plaid and he loves ratings above all else. He\u2019s also apparently been watching Ulala\u2019s progress for some time (enough to design two robots after her, although Giant Evila is stretching it a bit).Personality  The words from his Space Channel 5 profile say it better than anyone could: \u201cHe is a man with a purpose. Driven solely by the thrill which can only be obtained by high ratings, this man\u2019s a loon.\u201d Blank seems more friendly in the sequel than in the first game, teaching the player nice tips to get a perfect score.Space Channel 5  The Morolians have invaded, brainwashing the masses of the galaxy to dance against their will. No one knows why until Report 4, where Chief Blank pops up. It had taken Jaguar, the \u201cvoice of truth\u201d, to discover that the brainwashing frequency controlling the Morolians was the same frequency as Channel 5\u2019s, leading a trio of reporters (Ulala, Pudding, and Jaguar) to Space Channel 5\u2019s HQ. All of the clues pointed to CEO Chief Blank as the one who was manipulating the Morolians. At the top of the station, Mr. Blank reveals that he believes truth to be like a disease and that all reporters should share his vision. He sends out \u201cUltimate Reporter\u201d Evila to defeat Ulala, but the security bot fails. As a backup plan, he uses Giant Evila to grab the Astrobeat spaceship with Fuse still inside it. With the director as a hostage, Ulala and her comrades are forced to move in the opposition direction of what they hear.  Giant Evila flings a hand at Pudding and then Jaguar, leaving Ulala to fight alone. The sound system cuts off and Ulala is shot off the Astrobeat Jr., left to float in space. It\u2019s not over though as Jaguar saves Ulala and the reporter is back to finish the dance battle. Soon, the head of the abnormal robot lifts off and spins, revealing Blank TV. The CEO then reveals why he brainwashed the masses: for the ratings. Apparently, he\u2019s coo-coo for them. Blank activates the Blank Dimension, sucking Ulala inside. Unfortunately for him, Ulala was still able to feel the rhythm of her chant support and soon broke out. Using five television screens to barely hold himself up, Blank wobbles from the intensity of his battle with Ulala, her energy fueled by the crowd. Fuse tells the crowd to focus all their energy into the station\u2019s antenna, and when Blank gives those last few \u2018shoots\u2019, Ulala and the others copy his commands, fully charging the antenna and blasting Blank\u2019s screens apart, the main one with him in it sent hurtling into space. Sometime after this but before Part 2, he resigns.Space Channel 5 Part 2  \"Let me teach you a hidden command...\" Chief Blank cameos in Extra Mode during Report 4. In the Cheerleader part, instead of saving a Channel 5 Peon, you can save him, along with I'm Too Sexy. His profile reveals how to unlock \"Invincibility Mode\" so Ulala can get 100% (or 200%) on her ratings. There is also an unlockable costume you can use of him in the changing room.Trivia Main Characters  Our swingin' main performers of the stage. These include the villains, robots, back-up crew, and heroes.Dancing Purge  \"Time for a Special Guest... President Peace!\" -Dancing Purge Dancing Purge is a serious threat to Ulala now his cloak has been ditched. He's filled with dance energy and his movements are more fluid. It's going to take everything she has to bring him down. But the question is: How far did Purge think this plan through?In-game Profile  \"A more stunning version of Purge, who dances with burning fury now that he's absorbed the dance energy that was sucked out of the audience.In-game Profile (Japanese Version)  \"Purge\u2019s lovely form that absorbs a portion of the dance energy sucked from the audience into his body in order to dance with more incredible force. Once he starts wiggling his hips, it\u2019s all over! It\u2019s a signal that he\u2019s starting to bend spacetime.\"Trivia Ulala/Gallery Hoorg  Hoorg is the Morolian Boss in the Space Channel 5 series. He may seem lazy\u2014and he probably is\u2014but he\u2019s loyal to any cause he feels is right to support.Character Info  Hoorg was the planner of the Morolian invasion, and wasn\u2019t about to outright believe the truth that Jaguar uncovered at the time. It\u2019s probably because of his weight, but Hoorg\u2019s weak point is his knees. He is also very ticklish. His love for watching television pays off and he eventually becomes a news presenter for Moro-Channel 5.Personality  Hoorg is an independent Morolian who loves television. He\u2019s a bit lazy, almost always seen sitting on his rear. But when he\u2019s really needed, he\u2019ll get to work on backing up what he believes is right, even if he regrets jumping right into the thick of something dangerous.Space Channel 5  In-between the Reports, a bunch of Morolians convene to discuss how to further hypnotize the people of the galaxy. Of these is the notably plumper Hoorg, the boss of the Morolians who ultimately decides if a plan should be used or not. It turns out that he and the other Morolians had been brainwashed by CEO Chief Blank of Space Channel 5, which is not too surprising considering that he and the others had been scheming right inside Channel 5 HQ. Hoorg escapes when Ulala, Jaguar, and Pudding strut into Channel 5 studios, though he is later saved by Ulala before she confronts Evila. He dances right behind her as the security bot is taken down. He isn\u2019t seen again until everyone marches to the end of the galaxy.Space Channel 5 Part 2  Hoorg is the news presenter for Moro-News of Moro-Channel 5. In Reports 2, 3, 4, and 5, the newsdesk is shown before Purge hijacks their broadcasting signal to declare bits and pieces of his plan without giving it away entirely. Hoorg reports on Space President Peace visiting Space Park, the outstanding number of people being abducted throughout the galaxy (365,968), and the theft of various news station satellites.Report 5: The Spies Get Revenge  In Report 5, however, there are sounds of distress as crashing is heard in the background of the news studio. Instead of reporting the news, Hoorg appears in the Mystery Zone along with Pudding to aid Ulala, Space Michael, and Pine in saving Peace and finding Purge. The alarm goes off and he and the others run into a room and straight into Purge's trap. Just when they think it's over, it's not. The second half of the trap has Dark Rhythm Robots surrounding everyone. They must stick together and shoot the robots if they hope to make it out. Hoorg covers the lower half of the screen. After the intermission, Ulala\u2019s team must take on The Shadows, a group of four BuffBots and Shadow, in a Battle of the Bands. Hoorg plays a unique part of the makeshift band, making odd noises for their side for his corresponding BuffBot.Report 6: The Purge T.V. Special  \"Everyone's under control!\" Hoorg hops down the steps after stepping out of the elevator onto Purge's stage. He and the others are \"the first feature\" for the Purge TV Show. When facing the Mass-produced Peace Carriers, his line is: \"Stop right there, moro-moro!\" His words are for naught as a transparent wall is soon erected, cutting him, Jaguar, Pudding, Space Michael, and Pine off from Ulala, who is left her to dance alone against Purge. During the second half of the report, Hoorg calls out to Ulala, encouraging her to continue dancing against Purge the Great. He's off to Ulala's left as the dance battle starts up again, then up above her once Peace is freed from his prison. Dance Dimension X finally shatters and he stands beside his fellow Morolians. With Fuse back on the scene, a final blast of collective dance energy is aimed at Purge. The end result is the young genius being trapped in a giant 'P', shot off into deep space. \"Ulala's Swingin' Report Show\" wraps up with Hoorg, along with everyone else in the area, dancing to the end of the galaxy.Trivia Sexy 1  \u201cDon\u2019t go on!\u201d -Sexy 1 Sexy 1 is a female space cop who backs up Space Police Chief Pine in Space Channel 5 Part 2.Character Info  Not much is given about Sexy 1. Being a backup character in one report doesn\u2019t leave much to be said, even in the in-game profile. For starters, Sexy 1\u2019s real name is Mimi. This is only revealed after playing through Report 3 and getting the Morolian Points enough times to make the hint disappear from her profile. Mimi\u2019s father, the Space Police Chief, inspired her to choose her profession. In addition, she can hit a drum 97 times per second. The only difference between her and Sexy 2 is their hair color.Report 3: Meet the Sexy Space Police!  Sexy 1 is only encountered in the third report for a brief time. Aside from telling the mass of reporters to leave (\u201cDon\u2019t go on!\u201d), she also has a join threat with Pine at the beginning.

He is usually heard singing to any and all who care to listen, but that all changes when the Rhythm Rogues appear at Space Park.Character Info  Not much is known about Peace despite him being a very important character. He\u2019s the Space President of the galaxy and \u201cworks hard to bring peace and happiness\u201d to everyone. He most likely won his presidency through his Power of Song. It\u2019s created whenever he sings and it\u2019s enough to make even the most hardened of hearts melt and make the toughest of men cry. When he starts singing, Peace emits a powerful aura, with sparkling around him.Personality  Peace is a gentle, selfless man who enjoys singing and making people happy. He does what's necessary to see smiles on the faces of others.Story Report 2: Nature\u2019s Revenge!  Peace debuts in the pre-report cutscene, speaking with some reporters at Space Park. He\u2019s about to sing when all the lights go off and a flower from Pon Piriri appears. The broadcast is interrupted by Purge, saying that the Rhythm Rogues have captured the President. Near the end of Ulala\u2019s report show, Peace is seen again. He\u2019s trapped high above in the Greenhouse, standing on Pon Piriri in \u201cPlant Mode\u201d. He pleads for Ulala to hurry and help him. She complies and when Pon Piriri is finally beaten, Peace begins to sing the opening to \u201cThis Is My Happiness\u201d. He descends, flowers blooming around him and even Pon Piriri gets back on it\u2019s feet in joy. Ulala goes ahead and wraps up her report, but Shadow warps in, shocks Peace, and warps out again with the crooner in tow.Report 4: The End for Space Channel 5?!  Though Peace cannot move, he arrives on the scene in Channel 5\u2019s Core as Purge, riding in his hovercraft, introduces Ulala and Space Michael to the Peace Carrier, which has the president trapped inside. The Peace Carrier ends up using Peace\u2019s Power of Song to attack the station chief and the crew of Space Channel 5.Report 6: Purge\u2019s T.V. Special  Still unable to move, Peace is unveiled by Purge as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d on the Purge TV Show. Just after revealing him, Purge turns into Purge the Great, the machine with Peace inside acting as an armband for the super duper suit while in Dance Dimension X. Once Ulala is back on her feet as Super Ulala, she is able to free President Peace with the combined energy of her dance energy and the power of love between her and her friends. Out of his prison, Peace is able to finally sing. He belts out the lyrics back to Purge the Great along with Ulala and her entourage. Dance Dimension X finally shatters under the intensity of the sing-off and Peace stands proudly amongst the thousands of fans Purge had captured.

As its name implies, it is the fifth Channel in the galaxy. Channel 5 is one of the seven known Channels in the era of Space Channel 5, and is famous for being the main protagonist's channel. Thanks to its main reporter, the Channel has become very popular around the universe, with a huge amount of ratings.

The channel's signature move is a \"5\" done with the right hand, as Ulala frequently does at reports' end.Employees Studio  Main article: Channel 5 Headquarters Because of Channel HQ's destruction at the end of the Report 4, it is unknown how the Channel will work in the future.TV Shows Purge the Great  \u201cUlala. I needed your dance power, you see. Now we have all the power we need.\u201d -Purge the Great Purge the Great, or Great Purge, is the final boss of Space Channel 5 Part 2. Once Dancing Purge\u2019s Ballistic Groove Gun has been charged with enough dance energy from his captive audience, he uses that power along with Peace\u2019s song to become an incredible force to be reckoned with. This super duper suit is able create Dance Dimension X, the place where Purge shows Ulala his true power. With strong electrical orbs being hurtled towards Ulala, it seems she\u2019s finished. In fact, she is. Purge sends nine orbs filled with a strong electrical current at Ulala, presumably killing her. However, through the power of love Ulala is revived and she stands up again, transforming into Super Ulala. With an immense amount of dance energy surging through her and friends by her side, Ulala is more than a match for Purge the Great. Even when Bodyguards accompany their master the reporter is not discouraged. Worst of all for Purge is that Peace breaks free from his prison at long last due to Ulala's funky moves. Purge sings back to Peace, Ulala, and her posse, revealing through song that he doesn't understand the power of love. He says to teach him love, as if it were something that could be harnessed like dance energy, before the opposition gets out one last line. Dance Dimension X is broken and Purge the Great is sucked into the antennas of the Ballistic Groove Gun.In-game Profile  \u201cThe ferocious result of the combination of energy from the audience\u2019s dancing and Peace\u2019s song.

But beware: You just might start to like them...Kin/Kon/Kan  Kin, Kon, and Kan are a trio of singing mechas Ulala faces off against in Space Channel 5 Part 2. This choir of bosses appears in \"Report 1: Ulala Back in Action!\" in the lookout dome of the invaded spaceship. In \"Singing Mode\" these robots are relatively harmless as Purge sings in the background. While Kin and Kan are in charge of left and right respectively, Kon is left with the commands of up and down. All three say 'chu' together, but Ulala's shuts them down. The trio can reactivate themselves and go into \"Berserk Mode\", making things hectic. Their bodies extend to reveal tiny robots that hurt when they crash into Ulala. Kin, Kon, and Kan rarely say 'chu' together in this mode and make for a great example of what to expect in later reports. They are deactivated again, this time by Ulala's Tension Blasters.In-game Profiles  (Singing mode)\n\"These singing robots will hit you with choreographed oldies dancing.

Hey, could you possibly fly this bird any faster, Commander?!\" Hanson shouting at the top of his lungs, but unheard by the Commander due to the interoir noises inside the Pelican. \"They cant hear you sir, that damn rattling noise is just too damn loud\" Said Cole, sounding like a moron to his superior. \"Thanks for stating the obvious, Dumbass.\" Hanson said to Cole, irratated by his statement. Hahahaha!!! Your mine now Humans. Jahea said with confindence and amusement while piloting his moderatly damaged Serap fighter, and firing upon the squad's wounded pelican. \"Ma'am, Im getting some stange readings 82.45 degrees off our starboard side, range 2.53 kilometers. Mikaela sounding slightly nervous, but hid it from her superior. \"Ignore it, we'll deal with that as soon as we lose this guy, ill give him credit though, hes good.\" Tori said, sounding intereted at first at the reading but interuptted as a plasma bolt from Jahea's Seraph impacts the pelican. \"Ma'am somethings happening!\" \"What the hell? what is that?\" Tori saying with disbelief as her eyes fell upon the strange black and blue rift in space. \"All systems are out! weapons, navigation, Comms, and the engines!\" Said the Lieutenant commander, sounding very frustrated with the situation. Everyone inside the pelican fell a sudden jerk foward, heading into the rift \"ALL HANDS, BRACE FOR IMPACT!!!\" Mikaela shouting over the mic and into the carrier bay where the squad was \"enjoying\" the ride. \"Oh Shit, this is gonna suck!\" said Stroms \"By the rings, im being pulled in, all my systems are out, i cant maintain control!\" Jahea said with much dred in his voice. Chp. 2: Welcome to Aegis 7 \"Ugh, Holy Crap that hurt\" Muttered the Spartans in the cockpit. \"Uhh Mikaela\" \"Yes Ma'am?\" \"Where are we?\" \"I dont know Ma'am, our insturments are rebooting, and wont be able to get an accurate position until the reboot is complete.\" \"Well, how long will the reboot take?\" \"10, maybe 15 minutes, i cant currently give you an accurate estimate for the moment.\" \"Crap\" Tori said sounding upset. \"HOLY CRAP!!!, WHAT WAS THAT?\" Shouted Hanson with a ringing noise in his ears. \"I dont know sir, maybe an E.M.P. burst from that seraph that was chasing us?\" said Locklear, sounding very uneasy. \"Major?\" said cole, sounding sick \"Yes? what is it Private?\" \"Sir, I dont feel so good\" \"Dont worry kid, once the commander finds out whats wrong, she'll turn this bird around and take us home\" Just as The Major was done comforting him, Cole wittingly threw up all over the Major's boots, but even more disturbing was that he threw up BLOOD. \"My god. Corporal, give him some bio-foam.\" \"But sir, hes not even hit. i think it just might be the motion sickeness after what just happened.\" \"Maybe, but give him the foam just in case.\" \"But sir he-\" \"You want me to make that an order?\" Said Hanson sternly \"No sir\" said Stroms sounding nervous and uneasy, then proceeded to give Cole the bio-foam. \"This is Jahea Fazhelmee sending out a distress beacon to any and all covenat units with range of this signal, anyone out there? I repeat, anyone out there?\" he looked down and despair came over is face. \"By the Prophets, not enough power, maybe I can siphon power from that human ship.\" Said the Zealot, sounding pleased. \"Ma'am, Navigation just came online\" Mikaela said sounding very surprised. \"Really, whats our position?\" asked Tori \"Ma'am, we are nowhere near our original position, we are in a completely new system\" \"What system are we in?

A voice came over the speaker in the carrier bay, it was the commander. \u201cTroopers, strap yourselves in, this could a little bumpy, ETA: 90 seconds\u201d As the squad and zealot head toward the orbit decaying ISHIMURA, they have no idea what horrors that ship has bred. Chp. 4: A Sore Landing As the Squad with the zealot in tow, a loud POP echoed for through carrier bay of the pelican and into the cockpit. \u201cUh, sir? What was that?\u201d asked a very nervous Private Cole. \u201cI have no idea\u201d Hanson said who was just as nervous. Suddenly, a loud CRASH noise rocked the pelican \u201cSHIT, WHAT HAPPENED?!\u201d yelled Tori \u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW COMMANDER, ALLS I KNOW IS WE\u201dRE GOING IN HOT!!!\u201d Tori grabbed the mic. \u201cALL HANDS BRACE FOR IMPACT!\u201d They are on the devil\u2019s doorstep. \u201cUgh, Holy Crap that hurt!\u201d Tori said while shrugging off the impact. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t my armor lock up?\u201d Stunned and confused, Hanson thought he was still inside the pelican, turns out he was thrown clear, and not that for from Tori, just seconds later, he regained his senses. \u201cHello?! Anybody hurt?!\u201d cried Hanson. Hanson saw his C.O. standing amidst the fire and flames. From his point of view, her armor looked completely unscathed. \u201cCommander! Over Here!\u201d Tori called in over the radio. \u201cHanson, Keep your voice down, I have bad feeling about this place.\u201d \u201cYou and me both\u201d Said Hanson while trying to catch his breath amidst the smoke. \u201cCheck on your men, see if they are okay\u201d Hanson gave out a grateful \u201cYes Ma\u2019am Hanson walked to rear of the pelican, looking through the window, he saw all of me getting up slowly, but nevertheless, getting up. He tapped on the window in Morse code. \u201cNOT\u201d \u201cSAFE\u201d \u201cINTERIOR\u201d \u201cCOMMS\u201d \u201cONLY\u201d Locklear was the first one to fully get up, helping up Cole, then Stroms. \u201cMajor says we need to go to interior comms, it s not safe out there.\u201d Said Locklear, echoing in his voice was fear and fear alone. \u201cSIERRA 724 come in, repeat Mikaela, come in\u201d Tori radioed for her missing comrade. \u201cCommander, ugh, good to hear from you, I\u2019m 15 feet below you to your port side\u201d Mikaela called in with pain in her voice. \u201cYou okay there, Spartan?\u201d \u201cILL live, but I think my arm is broken, I won\u2019t be able to climb back up to your position.\u201d \u201cHold position there Spartan, ill return with a solution to that.\u201d Said Tori with confidence. 5 minutes later A roaring sound loomed over Mikaela\u2019s position;\u00a0; a shotgun and SMG suddenly fell into her hands, it was the commander hovering above with the help of a jetpack \u201cLets get you out of this hole lieutenant commander\u201d Mikaela let out a sigh of both pain and relief \u201cThank you Commander\u201d \u201cCan you walk?\u201d asked Tori sounding concerned. \u201cYes I can Commander, thank you\u201d \u201cLets check on our guest\u201d \u201cBy the rings, ugh, what happened?\u201d Jahea said while looking around in his downed seraph. \u201cGood, you two didn\u2019t get damaged, thank the gods.\u201d As Jahea grabbed his equipment he started to crawl out the wreckage. \u201cEveryone, grab what ever ammo you can find, something tells me we\u2019re going to be here a while\u201d Tori said quietly over the comms. A strange figure suddenly stood from the flames and smoke, Tori grabbed her smg off her left hip, took off after the figure, and she just realized it was the elite pilot that been chasing them. \u201cIf you were any other human, I would kill you where you stand, but we do have truce in order, you kill me, I don\u2019t kill you, am I correct?\u201d \u201cYes, you are correct, we have a truce. But once we get off this ship, all bets are off\u201d Tori said when outstretching her hand. \u201cFair enough\u201d The two enemies shook hands, as the Mikaela and the troopers watched. \u201cI guess this is temporary diplomacy\u201d Mikaela saying this to herself. Chp. 5: An Unfriendly Crew 10 minutes later in the flight lounge Big metallic doors open up from the flight deck open to the flight lounge, Tori and Mikaela are the first ones to enter. \u201cClear left.\u201d Said the commander \u201cClear right\u201d Mikaela said, while grabbing her left arm in pain \u201cUgh, I don\u2019t even know how I broke it, it doesn\u2019t seem possible\u201d \u201cWell its possible Mikaela, so get used to it\u201d \u201cAlright come on in troopers, but come inside in pairs, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s here\u201d Tori said suspiciously as she looked around the lit flight lounge. Stroms and Locklear came next, then Hanson and Cole, Then came Jahea, energy sword in his left hand, Plasma rifle in the right. \u201cWhat are you humans looking for, there is not soul in sight, aside form these weaklings\u201d Jahea said with a chuckle \u201cHEY!\u201d shouted Cole who was butt hurt about Jahea\u2019s comment. \u201cKeep it down private\u201d whispered Hanson \u201cCommander, what\u2019s next?\u201d \u201cWe need to check the ship\u2019s status, see why her orbit is deteriorating.\u201d Said Tori while holstering her Rifle. \u201cHanson, Locklear, set up a perimeter; we need to make sure nothing gets in or out\u201d Said Tori while examining her Tacpad. \u201cUhh, commander, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, we are the only ones on board this ship, we haven\u2019t encountered anyone from the ship\u2019s crew, I\u2019m telling you, this ship is abandoned\u201d Hanson said while removing his helmet and placing it on the chair next to him. \u201cThe weakling is right Spartan, we need to be on our highest guard and be ready for-\u201c \u201cHold on, I hear something\u201d interrupted Tori, who held her rifle with both hands, and flashlight on the rifle lit. \u201cI hear it too, and it sounds close\u201d Said Jahea readying his sword. \u201cYou two are so-\u201c Hanson was interrupted but a sudden siren companied with locked shield doors \u201cShit, what\u2019s that?!\u201d \u201cMy guess, quarantine.\u201d Suggested Locklear. A series of scratching noises made its way into the room, coming from the ceiling. \u201cWe have company\u201d Tori said aggressively. Scratching noises stopped, and then a sudden CRASH came through the ceiling. \u201cMY GOD\u201d Said Tori while looking at the monsterly figure that approached behind Hanson, then decapitated his head with one swing what it looked to be a blade in its hand, then she realized \u2026.\u201cThat is its hand\u201d Everyone watched the horror as the monstrosity continued to dismember and naw on Hanson\u2019s corpse. \"Open fire!\u201d \u201cWHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?!\u201d yelled Mikaela. \u201cI don\u2019t Know\u201d yelled Tori \u201cGo! Get to the Medical deck, we\u2019ll meet your there commander!\u201d shouted Locklear, with urgency in his voice. Chp.6: Getting to The Medical Deck \u201cGO GO GO!!! GET TO THE ELEVATOR!!! Shouted Tori, who still had the gruesome memory of what happened to her team member. \u201cMikaela, get in there! Stroms, toss one!\u201d commanded Tori Stroms didn\u2019t even reply, he just did what he was told, and tossed a frag \u201cOh my god, oh my god!\u201d screamed Stroms, his scream was filled with pure terror As soon they were on the elevator\u2026 \u201cWhat the fuck were those things, was that the crew?\u201d Tori asked strongly toward Mikaela. \u201cI don\u2019t know, all I know is those things are mean, very mean\u201d said Mikaela while still clenching her injured arm. Tori and Mikaela both looked down on Stroms He sat in the corner of the elevator in fetal position, rocking himself trying to calm himself down, but what he witnessed was just too gruesome for an O.D.S.T. to handle. The elevator stopped and the door opened to a small room, where a corpse laid and blood written on the walls reading \u201cCUT OFF THEIR LIMBS!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know about this commander, im kind of wishing that elite was with us now\u201d Tori didn\u2019t answer, but in her mind, she agreed. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d asked Mikaela. Still clenching her arm. \u201cFor now, we go to the Medical deck, how we get there is another story\u201d Tori said with certainty, but in her mind, the images of Hanson\u2019s death kept crawling back. Soon enough, the trio reached a platform with what appeared to be a tram was waiting. \u201cLooks like you will get treatment for your arm, Mikaela, as for Stroms, he\u2019s going to need a therapist.\u201d As soon as she said that comment, out came Stroms, strong willed again and ready for battle. \u201cSorry I lost it back there, I just have never-\u201c \u201dNeither have we Stroms, trust me, your not alone\u201d encouraged Tori, knowing she was right. \u201cOkay, how do we move this tin can?\u201d asked Tori. As soon as she said that, a voice came through small speaker \u201cPLEASE SELECT YOUR DESTINATION\u201d \u201cSounds easy enough\u201d said Mikaela, clenching her arm. \u201cMedical deck\u201d Tori said to the computer. The trio boarded the tram, next the door closed behind them, and the tram started toward the medical deck. 2 minutes later \u201cWELCOME TO THE MEDICAL DECK\u201d Chp. 7: Dark Shadows As the tram entered on to the Medical deck, all the lights from the landing all the way to the Security Station door were either out or flickering with their last ounces of power. The Spartans and Storms exited the tram with extreme caution. \u201cOkay People, go to night vision, and move with caution, after that thing attacked Hanson, we need to have our guard up at all times, no slip ups, or you will pay the price just like Hanson\u201d Tori said while equipping silencers to her SMG\u2019s. When they switched on their night vision, the reality sunk in. \u201cThe entire Crew was slaughtered by these things.\u201d Mass amounts of blood and decomposing corpses littered the entire way to the security station door, the smell of both the blood and bodies was so strong, the stench got into the Spartans breathing system, Tori and Mikaela were forced to put on hazop breathing apparatuses due to the strong odor. \u201cI can\u2019t see anything commander, its too dark for me to see\u201d Said Mikaela, before accidentally bumping into Stroms \u201cHey, watch it\u201d Stroms yelped as he too bumped into Mikaela. \u201cCareful you two, just stay quiet, and follow me.\u201d Said Tori cautiously \u201cHow can you see commander? It\u2019s too dark even for you\u201d Mikaela said still clenching her arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me as well as you think lieutenant commander, I can see things no other human Spartan cant, I push my eyes to their limits to see in the dark, that\u2019s how I can see\u201d explained Tori. Just as Tori was finished explaining, the door leading into the security station opened, with Jahea waiting for them. Tori and Mikaela looked around. \u201cWhere are our men?\u201d Asked Tori aggressively, questioning the elite. Her hand was slowly approaching her left SMG. \u201cRelax, Spartan, your so-called \u2018troopers,\u2019 they are unharmed, but not out of harms way, not yet.\u201d \u201cI am going to ask again, Where are our men?!\u201d Tori snapped to Jahea. \u201cWe were heading toward the station, but we got separated when those demons attack us for the second time, my guess is, they are on another part of the ship.\u201d \u201cCrap\u201d sighed Tori. \u201cMa\u2019am, with your permission, I would like to go look for them\u201d said Stroms strongly as he stepped foward, tightly holding his SMG \u201cNot going to happen, corporal, we don\u2019t even where these things are coming from.\u201d \u201cI will accompany him Spartan, if we encounter those demons again, I will slice them in two\u201d said a confident Jahea readying his energy sword. \u201cAgreed, Stroms, you up for it?\u201d Stroms gave out hearty laugh \"Yes Ma\u2019am, I am up for it\" A sudden growl came into the room, then overlapping growls. \u201cAw Crap, he we go again\u201d sighed Stroms as he readied his weapon. \u201cAllow Me, Spartan\u201d Jahea insisted. \u201cBe my guest\u201d Tori said, while in her mind \u201che\u2019s going to get his ass kicked\u201d Jahea readied his sword, and then a classic Elite war-cry; as the zealot Plunged into the fight, slashing sounds rang from his blade, as did the roars of pain from the creatures. Spartans and Stroms paying close attention as the elite\u2019s sword decapitated the limbs of their attackers; one by one they fell before him. When it was all over, the smoking limbs and bodies of the creatures littered the floor\u2026. \u201cThese creatures are not even worthy to be killed by my blade, but its done.\u201d said an unscathed Jahea. \u201c\u201dWow\u201d murmured Stroms who was in disbelief. \u201cNot bad\u201d Said Tori, sounding impressed \u201cNot bad at all\u201d \u201cOkay, now that\u2019s over with, can we get someone to take a look at my arm\u201d said Mikaela, clenching her and with more pain in her voice than usual. \u201cCan do Mikaela\u201d Tori said while putting a confident hand on Mikaela\u2019s left shoulder. \u201cThis is SIERRA 619 broadcasting on any and all open channels; I have an injured soldier with me and requesting medical assistance, repeat, I have an injured soldier with me and requesting medical assistance over\u201d No reply. \u201cDamn, this ship is a complete-\u201c A female voice came over the comms \u201cThis is USG ISHIMURA senior medical officer Nicole Brennan, come in SIERRIA 619\u201d Tori gave out a grateful sigh, glad to hear another voice over the open comms \u201cYes, Dr. Brennan, I have a Soldier here with me here that has a broken arm, and she needs medical attention as soon as possible\u201d \u201cAre you with Earthgov?\u201d Asked Nicole with hostility in her voice \u201cPlease repeat your last message Dr. Brennan; I didn\u2019t quite get your last message\u201d \u201cAre you with Earthgov?\u201d Nicole asked again. \u201cNo we are not Dr. Brennan, Different branch of the military, we will explain once we see you\u201d \u201cAlright then, just make sure your friend that\u2019s with you doesn\u2019t get killed, those things are swarming all over the ship, look at your locator for directions.\u201d \u201cDr. Brennan, I\u2019m afraid my armor isn\u2019t equipped with a-\u201c Stroms interrupted as his Map on his HUD just received a waypoint \u201cMa\u2019am, I have her location, according to my Waypoint, Dr. Brennan\u2019s location is about 70 feet beyond that door.\u201d A brightly sign just above the door to the left of the group read ISHIMURA CLINIC. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s move!\u201d Tori ordered. The door opened revealing a lit Hallway; floor covered with blood trails, littered with corpses, and decapitated limbs of the same creature that attacked the group before, only this time, there were several new creature bodies that were big and bloated, arms still intact, legs completely severed. As Stroms approached one the bloated bodies, he poked his SMG into what appeared to be the head, a barely audible growl came from the body, but audible enough to where Mikaela was close enough to hear it, while Tori was Half way down the hall with Jahea. \u201cSTROMS, GET AWAY!\u201d Shouted Mikaela The bloated body clawed it way towards Stroms, Its growl was much louder now, but Tori and Jahea, had just walked into the next room, Mikaela readied her shotgun, and pointed the barrel into the creatures face. \u201cEat Lead, you ugly motherfucker\u201d said Mikaela While holding the shotgun with her one good arm. The Sound of Mikaela\u2019s shotgun going off echoed through the entire hall way, and possibly through the entire ship, letting the creatures know that the Spartans meant business. While in the other Hallway, Tori and Jahea met Dr. Brennan. \u201cWhen you said you weren\u2019t Earthgov, you weren\u2019t joking, so what exactly are you?\u201d asked Nicole while examining Tori\u2019s armor. \u201cI am a genetically enhanced super soldier bred for war, but in the short story, I am called a Spartan.\u201d \u201cA\u2026 Spartan, I don\u2019t think I have heard about you soldiers, what planet are you from?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m from Earth, but my big friend here isn\u2019t\u201d Tori said, while referring to Jahea. Just as Nicole was about to ask where Jahea was from, Mikaela\u2019s shotgun blast echoed through the vents, the group came running out the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on Mikaela? Tori asked, assault rifle in her hands. Mikaela holstered her Shotgun just as Stroms kicked the now-actually dead bloated body. \u201cNothing Commander, just clearing the floor\u201d said Mikaela with slight chuckle, but then that chuckle turned into a groan of pain as she dropped to the floor. Nicole approached Mikaela, knelt down and examined her injured arm. \u201cTell me where it hurts\u201d said Nicole asked while feeling the underside of Mikaela\u2019s wrist armor, then moving up toward the shoulder bade. Mikaela let out a cry of pain \u201cThere!\u201d Nicole\u2019s hand was on Mikaela\u2019s right upper arm, and made a quick Diagnosis \u201cYou have a broken Humerus bone Lieutenant commander, actually into two places,\u201d Mikaela said in her mind \u201cshit, I knew it\u201d \u201cWhat can you give her Doctor?\u201d asked Tori while looking at Mikaela\u2019s broken arm. \u201cLet me look around in my Office, I will be right back\u201d Said Nicole as she got up and walked away, and just as Nicole walked down the hall, 2 familiar faces appeared, Locklear and Cole. Their armor appeared to have mass amounts of blood on it, but seemingly unharmed. \u201cYou boy\u2019s alright?\u201d Tori asked as her eyes wondered to them. \u201cWe\u2019re alright commander, very low on ammo; I believe I have\u2026 one clip left, what about you Cole?\u201d \u201cI have one clip too, we had to use these strange tools just get out alive\u201d Cole brought up the tool just as Nicole returned. \u201cHEY! Watch where you\u2019re pointing that plasma cutter\u201d Said Nicole as she ducked out its line of fire. \u201cSo that\u2019s what it\u2019s called\u201d Said amused Cole, holstering the cutter. \u201cSo what do you have for me Dr. Brennan?\u201d asked Mikaela \u201cI have this bone stasis brace for it, put it on, it will dull the pain, but will help fix that arm. I had given one just like this one to my boyfriend, he said it helped tremendously when he was working\u201d Mikaela removed her Grenadier shoulder armor and put on the brace, much to her surprise, the brace did as Nicole said. \u201cWow, I feel great\u201d Mikaela said as she opened and closed her fist repeatedly to get the feeling back in her left hand. \u201cGlad to hear it Mikaela\u201d Tori turned to Nicole \u201cHow long will it take for the bone to heal?\u201d \u201cMy boyfriend said his arm was completely healed with 2 weeks\u201d Said Nicole While Happily Watching Mikaela Flex and unflex her arm with no signs of pain. \u201cSo how did you get onboard the ISHIMURA?\u201d asked Nicole. \u201cWe Crashed landed as we came in to close proximity to the ship\u201d Tori Said shaking her head with her hand over her visor. \u201cHmm-\u201c \u201cThank you for the brace, doctor, but do you know where we can get spare parts for our ship? We are stuck here until we get it repaired.\u201d \u201cDid you come here on a shuttle?\u201d asked Nicole with a look of uncertainty on her face. \u201cYou can say that, but I believe the elite can shed some light on what our ship looks like\u201d \u201cElite?\u201d \u201cShe means me \u201c said Jahea He pulled out the handle for his energy sword, but instead of the sword energizing up, It showed the pelican to Nicole on what it looked like.\u201d \u201cInteresting\u201d said Nicole with a confused look on here face, but as she was about to say open her mouth to ask another question, a dark figure appeared at the dark end of the hallway, only this time, the figure had bigger blades in its hands. Tori took off running after the figure, but as she rounded the corner, another creature with Blades its hands gave out a roar toward her, but this time the creature was darker, bulkier and had blazing blood red eyes. Tori quickly grabbed both her SMGs off her hips and fired multiple rounds into the arms of the creature, it moved in closer as Tori reloaded, she temporarily dropped her guns, and started giving her strongest kicks and punches to the creature, she went on to grab both arms of the creature, and with much surprise to her self, she ripped off both arms with little effort. \u201cSo, where can we find some parts? Asked Tori with an amused tone. Everyone looked at her with a strange look, eventually she looked at her hands, and they were bleeding through her armor. \u201cOh crap\u201d Tori said with a dazed tone, eventually dropping to the floor. \u201cHold on, lets wrap those up\u201d said an alarmed Nicole, who quickly got some gauss for Tori\u2019s hands. \u201cSo, aside from this, where can we get some parts?\" Laughed Tori Nicole didn\u2019t hear her as she wrapped Tori\u2019s hands \u201cDr. Brennan?\u201d \u201cOh, uh, Engineering deck\u201d Nicole said after coming back to reality. \u201cThank you doctor, ill take it from here\u201d said Tori as she got up from the floor. \u201cPlease, call me Nicole\u201d \u201cThank you Nicole\u201d \u201cI never got your name\u201d Nicole called to Tori as she and her team started toward the door. She turned her head\u201d My name is Tori\u201d The door shut behind Tori and her team and in front of Nicole, who ran her hand through her blonde hair \u201cIsaac, where are you?\" She said to herself, sounding very scared. Next stop: engineering Chp. 8: Stomp it into the ground 10 minutes later \u201cWelcome to the Engineering Deck\u201d The tram made a screeching sound and jerking motion as it came to a stop at the Engineering deck station landing, the group walked out of the tram, looking around, to the sounds of parts falling off from a far distance down the tram tunnel, electrical wiring partially exposed, giving off a hissing noise. But this time, instead of darkness, the landing for Engineering deck was fully lit. The group advanced down the corridor and into the control room. \u201cClear left\u201d said Tori with assault rifle in hand \u201cClear right\u201d Said a more energized Mikaela, holding her shotgun. \u201cTroopers, you are clear to enter\u201d Radioed Tori. Locklear, Stroms and Cole entered with Jahea covering their six. \u201cOkay, Commander, what do we got?\u201d asked Locklear with his SMG on his shoulder. \u201cThe ships orbit is decaying faster than anticipated and I don\u2019t what makes the ship hold this position\u201d Said Tori while removing her helmet, revealing her short and thin blue hair. \u201cThis ship must have a centrifuge to hold its orbit\u201d continued Tori. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what\u2019s out commander, requesting to take a team down to reinitialize the centrifuge.\u201d asked Mikaela. \u201cGranted, get it online, but take the Troopers, I want to keep my eye on the elite\u201d Tori said with a suspicious look toward Jahea. \u201cThank you, Troopers, Lets Move!\u201d Said Mikaela with a serious tone Mikaela and the troopers started for the elevator door, eventually getting in. 1 minute later The troopers and Mikaela reached the decontamination room leading into the centrifuge, where a brightly lit panel in front of Mikaela read \u201cInitialize Decontamination process?\u201d The Process began with sprinklers overhead with the eventual lockdown \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this\u201d said Stroms with a very nervous tone. \u201cMan you always have a bad feeling about something\u201d remarked Cole. Stroms bad feeling was confirmed, more of the creatures where out side of the decontamination room, banging and clawing at the windows of the decon room, eventually heading up to the ceilings. \u201cBe alert, those things might try their way in here through the vents\u201d Said Mikaela, Drawing up her shotgun. \u201cThe vents, Are you serious?\u201d said Cole with his voice cracking. A CRASH came through the front vent that the group was looking at, out came a small creature what appeared to be a infant with three tentacles coming out its back, it gave out a hiss at Mikaela, then another, this time, no legs, a sythe for a tail, leaping on to Mikaela who dropped her shotgun, the creature trying its best to bite and decapitate the Spartan, but the overwhelming strength from Mikaela was too much for the creature, eventually Mikaela was able to grab hold of its tail, twist it very sharply, and stomp its head so hard, it smashed as if someone where taking a sledge hammer to an apple. \u201cTaste steel motherfucker!\u201d exclaimed Mikaela. Decontamination Process complete \u201cWell that was something\u201d said Mikaela while tossing the leaper\u2019s body aside. \u201cSierra 724, what\u2019s your status? Over\u201d radioed Tori \u201cWe\u2019re just getting decontaminated, commander, we\u2019ll be on our way shortly\u201d \u201cRoger that, Sierra 619, out\u201d \u201cTroopers, get your asses in gear and move\u201d ordered Mikaela Chp. 9: Too much? The Group eventually came to a dimly lit two-way hallway, one half of the hall going left, the other going right \u201cSo which way Lieutenant commander\u201d asked Locklear, looking around \u201cI have a certain feeling we should go to the right\u201d suggested Cole \u201cAgreed\u201d Mikaela and the troopers proceed right into the hallway, where eventually they came up on a hole in the wall with mass amounts of sharp metal sticking out, covered in blood; the same was with the other end. As they came to the end of the hallway, a giant door came into view, and was in their path \u201cThis must be it\u201d said Mikaela as she holstered her shotgun to her back As they entered, a voice rang inside their helmets \u201cEntering Zero Gravity\u201d \u201cThis ought to be interesting\u201d Mikaela said to herself She noticed that two pylons that were required to be attached to the centrifuge were not attached to it; she flew to the floor to push them together \u201cTroopers, make sure to hit that panel as soon as the centrifuge is connected\u201d Mikaela radioed to the troopers as she flew to the floor \u201cYes Ma\u2019am, What happens when it\u2019s connected?\u201d asked Locklear. \u201cThe gravity will be restored in here and all the air will be sucked out into space\u201d \u201cWell that\u2019s just great\u201d Stroms said to himself As soon as Mikaela hit the floor, she proceeded to the first pylon, and to the amazement of the troopers, she pushed the pylon with relative ease, as soon as it was connected, a sound of wires and metal clanging inside indicated that the pylon was connected. As Mikaela started to proceed to the second pylon, two infant creatures that they saw earlier were crawling and hissing toward Mikaela\u2019s position. \u201cStroms, up high!\u201d Yelled Locklear at the sight of the creatures \u201cGot it\u201d Stroms acknowledged with a flurry of bullets toward the advancing creatures. \u201cTroopers, what the hell is going on?!\u201d demanded Mikaela over the radio. \u201cMa\u2019am, look up\u201d said Locklear, with a quiet laugh Mikaela did so, and saw the floating dead bodies of the infant creatures directly above her \u201cAh, I see, good job\u201d said a surprised Mikaela. Mikaela push the second pylon back into place, and the pylons started to rotate with a loud humming noise \u201cOkay, Locklear, engage the centrifuge as soon as I hit the platform.\u201d \u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d Soon enough, Mikaela made her way back to the troopers; Locklear who was following orders, engaged the centrifuge. Giant panels on the floor started to open, revealing the open space between them and Aegis seven, all the air got sucked out just as Mikaela predicted. A voice came in their helmets \u201cEntering vacuum\u201d The troopers and Mikaela all watched as the centrifuged circled in clockwise motion \u201cTroopers, lets move\u201d Ordered Mikaela The group walked back through the door and started back down the hallway and into the decontamination room. \u201cAh crap, we gotta go through this shit again?\u201d complained Cole, who was distressed at the notion of entering the room again \u201cPrivate, did I give you permission to speak?\u201d Mikaela said sternly. \u201cNo Ma\u2019am\u201d \u201cGood, Next time you speak out of term, consider shutting your mouth a standing order\u201d \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am\u201d Everyone was suspicious at the fact that the decontamination cycle didn\u2019t engage for the second time. \u201cOkay\u2026..\u201d Said Mikaela suspiciously The group walked out of the decontamination room, and into the elevator. Chp 10: Back Topside As soon as Mikaela and the troopers reached the control room, immediately they noticed that something was wrong; Tori and Jahea were gone. Mikaela called Tori on the radio. \u201cCommander, come in, centrifuge is online, repeat, centrifuge is online\u201d Silence \u201cSomething is definitely wrong here\u201d Mikaela said with a stern tone, while readying her shotgun. They then noticed blood trails on the floor, purple blood, and mass amounts of it. Locklear knelt down to examine the blood trail, which was leading to the tram \u201cThat elite must have gotten himself into some shit\u201d \u201cWell looks like we got to find them now\u201d Stroms said sounding very concerned. \u201cTroopers, lets move!\u201d ordered Mikaela. Running toward the tram, the group entered and tried to contact Tori again on the radio \u201cCommander, come in, come in!\u201d Mikaela yelled Static, then \u201cMikaela, ugh, Where are you?\u201d Tori said, sounding way out of breath \u201cWe are leaving engineering, what\u2019s your location?\u201d \u201cCrew deck, there is weird shit going on in this ship, aside from the walking corpses\u201d Mikaela let out an inaudible huff \u201cOkay Commander, stay there, we\u2019ll come to you\u201d The radio cut off as soon Mikaela sent that message, sensing urgency, Mikaela had no idea what was waiting on the crew deck. \u201cCREW DECK\u201d Mikaela shouted to the computer The tram gave a forward jerking motion, a voice came over the tram radio \u201cNext stop, Crew deck\u201d Chp. 11: Kindness of strangers 10 minutes later \u201cWelcome to the crew deck\u201d Mikaela and the troopers disembarked the tram with weapons in hand, flashlights on their weapons set to their brightest setting, walking down the ramp and into the lobby, they encounter a horrific scene; bodies that have white masks around their heads, blood in the same spot on every single body. The lobby was dimly lit, being lit only by flickering candle light; floors and walls have been written on, all with strange symbols. A chill and shock ran down Mikaela\u2019s spine \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Mikaela said in shock Stroms examined the body closest to him then all the others \u201cThey all have the same stab entry, this wasn\u2019t murder, Lieutenant Commander, this was an execution\u201d \u201cWhat kind of Fucking psycho would do this to all these people?\u201d \u201cMy guess, the same person or group of people that drew these Symbols\u201d A voice came over the radio, contacting Mikaela \u201cLieutenant Commander Mikaela, this is Dr. Howard Finch, I have been monitoring your transmissions throughout the ship, and I was hoping to shed some light on Your Commander\u2019s disappearance, apparently she was ambushed by that alien that was accompanying you and your group, find her, here\u2019s her coordinates\u201d \u201cThank you doctor\u201d said Mikaela while examining the coordinates Finch gave her \u201cWhat\u2019s the word Ma\u2019am?\u201d Locklear asked he walked around the lobby \u201cSo much for Diplomacy\u201d Mikaela said to herself, she continued \u201cTroopers, the commander is Being held Hostage somewhere on this deck, normally splitting up would be good idea, but under the circumstances, that won\u2019t be an option\u201d She said with a very aggressive tone. \u201cWhere is she being held, Ma\u2019am? We are ready\u201d Locklear said, bravely stepping forward. \u201cShe\u2019s being held in the executive quarters, anyone who wants to back out now, speak now\u201d No one said a word \u201cGood, lets move\u201d The group moved toward the security door on the second level of the lobby, as it moved up, a strange noise suddenly surfaced: Music. The door toward the security station opened, and on the floor at the end of the hall, a corpse of a creature lay in front of the door. \u201cOh, this shit again?\u201d Mikaela said sounding aggravated. Mikaela pulled out her shotgun; the creature suddenly rose up from the floor and made a beeline for the closest kill: Mikaela. She fired her shotgun just as the creature had its blades in the air, ready for the kill. But the creature never laid a blade on her, its body falling backwards, landing with a thud, the group continued toward their goal, freeing the commander. Chp 12: A great Betrayal 15 minutes later, just out side the executive quarters \u201cOk, lets take a look\u201d Remarked Mikaela as she put two fingers on the right side of her Helmet, on her Command network module, switching on her helmets experimental thermal vision. Through the door, she saw the Commander up against a pillar, with Jahea\u2019s Energy sword placed just between the sides of her Tori\u2019s throat. Sensing Help approaching, Tori started to talk to her captor \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t trust you, you covie\u2019s all the same\u201d Tori said in a clam voice. \u201cQuiet!\u201d demanded Jahea Just as Jahea was reaching his sword, Mikaela and the ODSTs stormed the room, unleashing a flurry of rounds at the covenant traitor \u201cCommander!\u201d called Mikaela, tossing Tori\u2019s assault rifle to her. But much to Mikaela\u2019s surprise, Tori holstered her rifle. \u201cStand down everyone, this covie and I have unfinished business\u201d Tori said calmly, rolling her left hand into a fist and throwing it into her right. \u201cShe\u2019s right weaklings, we do have unfinished business\u201d Agreeing Jahea. As Jahea finished what he said, Tori came at him, throwing a flurry of punches, some of them being blocked, some landing, with excruciating force. Jahea matched the punches with powerful Kicks. Eventually, Tori, ducked down, swinging her left leg underneath Jahea\u2019s feet, knocking him down to floor, She hoisted him onto her shoulder\u2019s, and gave him upward thrust into the air, his head still in Tori\u2019s hands. Then the fight was over as Tori snapped Jahea\u2019s neck just before he hit the floor, his now dead body landing on the floor with a thunderous slam in front of her, Mikaela and The troopers looked on in awe of what they just witnessed. Mikaela approached her Commanding officer. \u201cAre you alright commander?\u201d Asked Mikaela \u201cNever better, aside form a few dents in my armor, I am fine, while he-\u201c she looked at jahea\u2019s dead body \u201disn\u2019t\u201d \u201cSo, Mikaela, is the centrifuge online?\u201d Tori asked while kneeling down, examining her knee guard. \u201cYes Ma\u2019am, The centrifuge is online and operating as we speak\u201d Tori put her palm on the top of her helmet \u201cWe should get back to the pelican, see what we can fix\u201d \u201cAlready ahead of you commander, the front landing gear is operable, but the ship herself is still in working order, all she needs is a new landing gear and new set of Navigation cards\u201d \u201cThere should be a set of nav cards down in the executive shuttle bay; it\u2019s just through that door and down the elevator\u201d The Spartans and ODST\u2019s made their way to the door and down to the elevator, where at the bottom of the elevator was the executive shuttle bay, the executive shuttle, and something\u2026.deadly. Chp. 13: A deadly encounter The door of the executive shuttle bay elevator opened, The Spartans and ODST\u2019s stepped out, weapons out. The door to the shuttle bay itself opened to the shuttle itself resting in the middle of the room, but all wasn\u2019t right as they would think. \u201cThere\u2019s the shuttle, before we get the cards, test the engines, make sure it works just in case there\u2019s any survivors.\u201d Tori said while looking around. \u201cThat must be the office to test the engines commander\u201d called out Locklear. \u201cGet your men in there Major; I don\u2019t want any more casualties\u201d \u201cM- Ma\u2019am?\u201d Locklear sounding Surprised at his sudden Promotion. \u201cThere A problem Major?\u201d \u201cNo Ma\u2019am\u201d Said Locklear \u201cGood\u201d She took her attention off Locklear and shifted it to Mikaela \u201cWhere we at with the Nav cards? This Bay is making me Uncomfortable\u201d \u201cFound them, they in a processor inside the shuttle\u201d Mikaela Called over the radio. \u201cOkay boys, we got the nav cards, we\u2019ll join you in the Control room\u201d But just as Tori said that, at the end of the bay, a monstrous figure dropped out the Bay ceiling, Letting out a roar unlike the other\u2019s have heard; the roar was thunderous and nerve racking in comparison to the other creature encountered on the ship; Its eyes glowed a deadly color of green, What appeared to be larva seeping in and out of its disfigured skin crawled, its very large blades had no evidence of hands, or any other human resemblance. It started making its way toward the Spartans, moving with a deadly purpose. This creature looked like he was sent by the devil himself. \u201cMy god, Mikaela, go, now!\u201d ordered Tori. The Creature drew closer, as Mikaela started in full sprint toward the control where the troopers watched, motionless with Horror spread across their faces, but their expression changed quickly from horror to shock as Tori Grabbed her rifle, firing multiple rounds at the creature\u2019s limbs, then to its legs, all of them completely severed off. \u201cThat ought to teach you\u201d said Tori as she put her boot in the creatures face. To her amazement and point of shock, she noticed that the creatures limbs and legs had begin to regenerate \u201cThis cant be happening\u201d Tori said with extreme anger \u201cMikaela!\u201d \u201cGo ahead commander!\u201d \u201cI think its time we tested the shuttle\u2019s engines\u201d \u201cRoger that Commander\u201d \u201cAlright you motherfucker, come and get me\u201d Tori said bravely as she rounded to the back of the shuttle. Now by that time, the creature was already standing back on its regenerated legs, growling in rage as it set its sights on the lone Spartan. \u201cNOW!\u201d shouted Tori Mikaela hit the switched, and a voice over the radio in the control sounded \u201cFiring main shuttle engines\u201d The Shuttle\u2019s engines fired with extreme, heat, speed, and magnitude; completely obliterating the creature. Mikaela watched in disbelief as the creature was disintegrated, but unsure about the commander as the creature disintegrated. Finally, the shuttle\u2019s engines shut off, the smoke settling, and through the smoke, Mikaela and the troopers saw a bright blue light in the middle of the platform where the creature once was. With a loud POP, They saw what the blue light was: It was Tori, releasing herself out of Armor lock \u201cCommander, you alright?!\u201d shouted Mikaela. \u201cYea, im fine, I kind of felt that heat through my armor lock though\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re okay, commander\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get sentimental on me Spartan, we have one last objective to complete, get the nav cards to the pelican, and get the hell out of here. The team\u2019s time on the ship was coming to an end Chp.14: Time to Leave 15 minutes later in the flight lounge. \u201cI never though we would end up here again\u201d said the newly promoted Major Locklear, with saddened tone in his voice \u201cI know trooper, but it doesn\u2019t even matter anymore, we are getting off this hell hole one way or another\u201d Tori said while reaching for her rifle. \u201cIm right behind you all the way commander\u201d said Mikaela while she too reached for her shotgun \u201cOkay everyone, let\u2019s finish this\u201d Ordered Tori. The group charged through the door to the flight deck, only to reveal that the deck was infested with the creatures they have encountered throughout the ship, Giving it all they had, they pushed forward toward the pelican, unleashing a firestorm of bullets and shells towards the creatures. The Army of Monsters may have had the numbers gain, but didn\u2019t stop the Spartan\u2019s and ODST\u2019s strong determination to get the hell off the ISHIMURA. Creatures of all shapes and sizes attacked the group of soldiers, Roars of creatures echoed through the entire ship, one by one, the monstrosities fell before the fearless soldiers, After all the of the creatures have wiped out from the immediate area, they started to walk toward the pelican, but then the pelican gave a violent lurch forward, the missing landing gear flying toward the group, nearly landing on top of Tori, Mikaela tackling Tori out of the way. One final Creature remained, big, monstrous in strength charged at Tori, but was suddenly stopped short by the loud sound of Mikaela\u2019s shotgun going off, severing the brute\u2019s arm, killing it instantly. \u201cEverybody get on board, let\u2019s get the fuck out of here\u201d Ordered Tori \u201cMikaela, take your seat and fly us out of here\u201d \u201cWith pleasure commander\u201d replied Mikaela. A roaring sound started grow louder as the pelican\u2019s engines started to fire up. With a loud final metallic screech, the Pelican ascended inside the Flight bay of the ship. With a touch of the throttle, Mikaela turned around the ship, and flew out of the hell sentenced ISHIMURA. Chp. 15: How do we get home? 2 days later, in the emptiness of space The Spartans gazed into the vast nothingness of space, realizing they now have no way to get back home. Stranded in a foreign universe \u201cWhat do we do now commander? We got out of there alive\u201d asked Mikaela \u201cNot all of us Mikaela, not all of us, for now, the only course we can take now is a course for home, something tells me that wont be the last of those damn things\u201d Said a saddened Tori, removing her recon helmet, setting it next to her leg. \u201cEarthgov\u201d said Tori softly. \u201cIm glad we got off that hell ship, but we lost a good friend today\u201d Said Locklear removing his helmet. \u201dThat we have Major, that we have\u201d Stroms agreeing A phrase kept ringing In Tori\u2019s head, repeating, slowly growing louder with every passing hour, a phrase she hasn\u2019t heard since she had been in training. Eventually it came to pass from her lips silently. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep the sky from me\u201dNecrohunter7/Necromorphs vs The Flood  I KNOW that this is a much debated topic, but what about having SPECIFIC Necromorphs against the flood.

Chp 7: Hell Re-emerges Chp 8: Visions Chp 9: Memories Chp 10: Old places, dead faces Chp 11: Push Chp 12: Something to be known Chp 13: Sharpshooter Chp 14: A haunting memory Chp 15: Roadblock Chp 16: Chp 17: Chp 18: Chp 19: Chp 20: Chp 1: A new day The alarm clock next to Jake\u2019s bed went off, so loud, he woke and accidently hit is head upon the headboard, his wife, Madalyn, was in the kitchen making breakfast when she heard the commotion. \u201cAh, Crap!\u201d Grunted Jake as he reached over to shut his annoying alarm clock off \u201cWish these things weren\u2019t so damn loud\u201d \u201cBaby, you okay?\u201d called out Madalyn. \u201cYea, sweetheart, I\u2019m fine\u201d He called out as rose out of bed, he muttered something else, not enough for his wife to here it \u201cUNSC alarm clocks weren\u2019t this loud\u201d Jake started for his closet, reaching for his brown coat, inside one of the pockets was his Security Badge; he looked down to the floor, there, next his shoes, laid his ODST helmet. That helmet brought back good and bad memories, memories that have been buried for three years. He walked into the kitchen, giving his wife a passionate hug followed by a kiss on the cheek \u201cI\u2019m going to work late again tonight Maddy, don\u2019t wait up\u201d Jake said as he reached for his cup of coffee. \u201cOkay Babe, will you at least be here tonight to watch Zoey?\u201d \u201cYou bet, speaking of which, ZOEY!\u201d he happily yelled, and through the sliding door to from a little baby\u2019s room, out came running 2 year old Zoey, who had a smile on her face. \u201cBecause tonight I have a Girl date with Amanda\u201d \u201cOkay, Okay\u201d Jake said with a chuckle. Jake walked out of the Door and on to a nearby elevator, during which time on the elevator, he video made a call on his newly installed civilian R.I.G. A video Screen suddenly popped up, and his best friend Mark Stroms appeared. \u201cHey Jake, how are you doing man? And how are your girls?\u201d Frank greeted his friend on the video link \u201cI am doing great, and of course, you know I have the best girls on this station\u201d \u201cGlad to hear it, so did you hear about this week\u2019s assignment roster?\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u201d Jake said with a cocked an eyebrow. \u201cWell it appears Cole, You, and I was picked\u2026. Again\u201d Mark said with slightly irritated tone \u201cI don\u2019t get why they always pick us for the rosters\u201d Sighed Jake. The elevator stopped and the door opened to reveal the bottom floor of his apartment complex busy as usual. \u201cWell it\u2019s packed tighter than a rat\u2019s nuts down here; we\u2019ll talk more once I get back to the office\u201d Chp 2: Upgrades Two technicians examining both suits of armor that stood before them on an opposite side of the glass, admiring their upgraded achievement \u201cOkay Ladies, tell us what you think\u201d said the first technician. Two tall women approached the window separating them from the armor on the other side. \u201cI think you boys did a better job than the other people that previously worked on them\u201d Said Tori, sounding satisfied at the sight of the suits. \u201cAs long as you kept the brace on mine, im telling you, my arm still feels funny after all this time\u201d Said Mikaela, who had her left hand on her right arm. \u201cAll the components from the previous armory diagram are still there, but we added two new R.I.G.S so you communicate with anyone, anything, refer to its map in case one of you stray off from one another. \u201c \u201cI\u2019m impressed, so when can we take them out?\u201d \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, but just a few more things, if ever when you come across a Zero-G environment, you can release the magnetic plating on the bottom of your boots to release yourself from the floor, or whatever it is your standing on, you can also maneuver using small air thrusters on your suits\u201d \u201cThank you, Professor Sykes\u201d said Tori grateful 30 minutes later \u201cIt feels good to be back\u201d Tori said. Mikaela gave out a sigh of relief \u201cThat feels much better\u201d \u201cOkay Tori, walk to the opposite end of the room, and open up a video link with Mikaela.\u201d Said Professor Sykes \u201cRoger that\u201d Tori proceeded to opposite end of the testing room. Then a Video screen popped up, on the feed, was Mikaela in her armor. \u201cHow am I coming commander?\u201d asked Mikaela through the feed. \u201cYour coming in loud and clear\u201d Said Tori. Professor Sykes\u2019 voice came over through the feed for both Spartans. \u201cOkay, we are going Zero-G\u201d Announced Sykes \u201cYou Ready Mikaela?\u201d asked Tori \u201cMore than ready commander\u201d Mikaela said eagerly. The room that was filled with crates, pallets, and barrels started to lift slowly into the air, signaling that the gravity in the room was now zero. As the Objects drew higher into the air, Tori was very amazed at the sight. \u201cOkay, Tori, your GPS on your wrist has been converted to a portable Scanner and Magnetic switch, just pres the button on the bottom left to deactivate your magnetic plating on your boots\u201d Instructed Sykes. \u201cCopy that\u201d Tori acknowledged With the press of that button, The Spartan was floating and flying around the room like bird in the sky, while Mikaela had no idea on how to get her self airbourn. \u201cAs for you Mikaela, your brace has customized to both heal your arm, and to also deactivate the magnetic plating, you just need rotate the brace 90 degrees in either direction, do it again to re-magnetize.\u201d \u201cThank you Professor\u201d said Mikaela 30 seconds later, and with the twist of the brace, Mikaela lept into the zero-g room with her commanding officer, Both the Professor and his assistant were happy to see both Spartans flying around the room. Soon he opened an audio link to Tori. \u201cWe are going to run some more tests on your armor in particular Tori, but we will do that tomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhat Kind of tests?\u201d asked Tori, re-magnetizing herself back to the floor. \u201cYou will see soon enough, Sykes out\u201d he said with a curious tone toward Tori. \u201cWhat was that all about Commander?\u201d asked Mikaela, who was silently hovering above Tori. \u201cI don\u2019t Know, I do not know\u201d Chp 3: Testing Stages 24 hours later, Sprawl fight deck A strange object was being hoisted by Kinesis equipped technicians, Its shape looking oddly familiar to Tori, Sykes explained \u201cYou recognize what that is Tori?\u201d asked Tori with a smug grin. \u201cHate to see that grin of yours get any smugger, I recognize the shape, is that\u2026. my jetpack?\u201d \u201cWe Stream lined it to fit you\u2019re armor, the previous design was, how can I put this? Dated, The Thrusters that propel you into the air now have a thrust 15 times greater than what it once had, which means not only can you hover, but you now fly around as did yesterday in the Zero-G room\u201d Sykes explained further. Tori looking at her newly upgraded Jetpack deeply satisfied at what the scientist\u2019s on the sprawl have done for her. \u201cSo you said the thrust was 15 times greater, will it work in space?\u201d \u201cGlad you asked\u201d Sykes said, holding a Holographic design of her jetpack \u201cSince the original design did not work in space, we decided to instead technology from our shuttles here on the sprawl.\u201d \u201cSo when can I Take the pack out?\u201d asked Tori, eagerly waiting. \u201cIn about 20 minutes, all we need to do is to get the wiring right and firing sequence ready, as soon as that\u2019s done, you can go on the flight deck\u201d \u201cAmazing Job Sykes, thank you\u201d Said Tori, with an outstretched hand. \u201cThe pleasure is mine\u201d Sykes said shaking her hand. Tori walked through the door on the opposite end of the room, as soon as Tori was out of earshot\u2026 \u201cGet Director Tiedmann and his engineering Staff up here, there is something that they may want to see\u201d 20 minutes, on the flight deck itself. \u201cStarting maneuver system run through\u201d Tori said over the comm. The thrusters moved out their housing, rotating in a full 360 degrees, flight adjustment flaps on the pack moved in upward and downward motions, finally, the run through was over, the true test was about to begin. The flight deck observation lounge was occupied by Director Tiedmann, his engineering staff, Sykes, and his personal assistant. \u201cSo tell me professor, what was was so important to pull my staff and I out of a meeting?\u201d asked Tiedmann impatiently. \u201cYou are about to see Director, there on the flight deck is Tori-619, she is part of a undisclosed program of super soldiers. We chose her to test a new maneuvering system, capable of giving any kind of one person the speed of one of our shuttles, but with the maneuverability of ancient earth fighter aircraft.\u201d Tiedmann gave out an annoyed sigh. But just as he sighed, Tori lifted off the flight deck, Thrusters on her pack burning bright. She gave a forward slant of her body and she was off the deck. \u201cOkay, now, I\u2019m Impressed\u201d Tiedmann remarked. Tori made a loop around the inactive solar array came back around the third station gravity panel, made it look like she was headed toward Saturn, but then out of nowhere, she pulled an ancient earth Fighter aircraft maneuver, a split S. she was now back heading toward the flight deck. Tiedmann and everyone watched in amazement at the speed and maneuverability of the space bourne Spartan as she raced past the observation lounge. \u201cYou said this was experimental Professor?\u201d asked Tiedmann \u201cYes Director, but only experimental, this is the very first prototype.\u201d Just before Tiedmann was going to say anything else, Tori landed back on the flight deck, both boots hitting the metal of the deck. \u201cFlight test complete, the pack handles like a dream Professor\u201d Said Tori over the comm. as she walked toward the airlock door. \u201cSo when can we expect more of these\u2026 packs?\u201d Tiedmann impatiently asked. \u201cI can\u2019t give you an exact date, but when-\u201c Sykes suddenly felt a bolt of electricity run up his spine \u201cSir, I feel like we are being watched all of a sudden\u201d \u201cSearch the room\u201d Tiedmann ordered to his staff. One of his staff members neared the door that was exiting the room, when he saw a shimmer. \u201cSir!\u201d called over the engineer. Once Tiedmann approached the door, the shimmer suddenly shifted toward the ceiling, a ceiling panel fell to the floor, nearly landing on the engineer. \u201cDamn!\u201d Tiedmann exclaimed. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this intruder get the best of us, Sykes, continue testing of the pack, and try to get it into full production\u201d \u201cYes Director\u201d Chp 4: Reunion \u201cExcuse me, Detective Locklear?\u201d \u201cWhat is it Mac?\u201d \u201cWe are getting confirmed reports of Mass suicides in multiple sectors throughout the station.\u201d Mac said nervously. \u201cSuicides? Must be those Unitologists I keep hearing about, where\u2019s the closest sector?\u201d Jake said with his palm over his face. \u201cYea, one of those ceremonial Suicides\u201d Jake gave a distressed sigh \u201cOkay, I will get a hold of Mark and Frank, tell them what\u2019s going on\u201d \u201cYou got it boss, oh, one more thing, it appears that we have a volunteer team on the mass suicide case\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s the team?\u201d asked Jake with a cocked eyebrow \u201cLet\u2026 Me\u2026.See Ah Ha\u201d said Mac while looking through the papers for the volunteer roster. \u201cTeam\u2026Sierra?\u201d Mac said, doing a double take on the paper. Jake thought of the only people that refer to them as Sierra. \u201cCommander\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhat did you say boss?\u201d \u201cNothing, where\u2019s the sector of the suicides? \u201cDelta Sector\u201d Mac said sounding unsure of himself. \u201cThat\u2019s about half a click away for the church, are you reading your R.I.G. right? \u201cI\u2019m sure sir\u201d \u201cGood, hold down the fort, I\u2019m rolling out\u201d Jake said grabbing his coat and Divet Pistol from his desk. 1 Hour later Jake was the first to arrive at the suicide scene, mass amounts dead bodies laid motionless around the courtyard. So much blood was covering the floor, the term bloodbath was appropriate. The second to Arrive was Mark Cole. \u201cWhat do we have Major?\u201d asked Cole looking around. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer Major, at least when I\u2019m not wearing my BDU, but its detective now. We got our run of the mill religious mass suicide rally.\u201d \u201cDo we have a Time of death?\u201d asked Mark, examining the closest body to him. \u201cWe can extract one of the logs from the R.I.G.S, that will give us the Time of death, or should I say, Deaths.\u201d Jake managed to pull up one of the logs of a dead woman that was lying in front of him. It showed a disturbing scene, much to a matter he had seen 3 years before. After going over that mental picture in his mind, Jake was able to make a Time of death for all the people lying around the courtyard. \u201cThese people committed suicide 3 hours ago\u201d Jake said with his hand running down his bearded face. \u201c3 hours ago, I was still asleep then\u201d a voice rang out, Both Jake and Mark looked to the right of them, it was Frank Stroms. \u201cI wish this reunion was under better circumstances.\u201d Frank said sadly. \u201cMe too man\u201d agreed Mark. \u201cAll these people\u2026 killing themselves for a worthless cause\u201d Jake said, looking around, taking in the mass suicide that lay before him. \u201cWhat cause do you think that was?\u201d asked Frank scratching his bald head. \u201cThe chance at Convergence\u201d A female voice called out, the team looked up, to see two tall armored Soldiers with very familiar armor arrangements. It was Tori and Mikaela. \u201cGlad to see you boys\u201d Tori said with an outstretched hand toward Jake. \u201cSame here Commander\u201d He said, shaking her hand. \u201cSo commander, what\u2019s this \u2018Convergence\u2019 about?\u201d asked Mark. \u201cI heard these people, who you called \u2018Unitologists\u2019 constantly talking about it, I guess It has to deal with this ancient artifact called a \u2018Marker\u2019, but then again, I could be wrong\u201d \u201cYou becoming one of these Unitologist\u2019s commander?\u201d joked Mark. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just stating what I heard.\u201d A video link suddenly opened up on Jake\u2019s R.I.G., it was Mac, Jakes assistant. \u201cBoss, we have a situation!\u201d He said sounding very alarmed. \u201cWhat is it Mac?\u201d \u201cWe got another Suicide rally, only this time its involving Earthgov Security along with civilians\u201d \u201cOkay, we will handle it from here\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018We\u2019?\u201d \u201cI will explain later, I just need to know where this rally is\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s in the Theta sector\u201d \u201cGood, Thanks Mac, be careful alright?\u201d \u201cSure thing Boss\u201d The link closed \u201cWe\u2019ll never get there in time, that\u2019s on the other side of the station\u201d said Mark \u201cYes we will\u201d Tori said confidently. \u201cBe back in ten\u201d Tori ran over to the nearby airlock, The Former Troopers watched in amazement as Tori took off like a missile. \u201cWow, did her Jetpack get an upgrade?\u201d asked Mark. \u201cIndeed it did, but not how you think\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jake asked \u201cThe Jetpack that she got upgraded, Tiedmann and Earthgov are planning to produce more for their soldiers, making us look like Covenant grunts.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s bad\u201d Before Mikaela had the Chance to respond, a bright beam of light shined upon the courtyard, light dimmed enough to reveal what is was, it was the very Pelican that got them off the ISHIMURA 3 years earlier, but it looked different. The pelican looked like she was brand new, as if it just came off the assembly line. \u201cMikaela, I\u2019m going to need you at your original position here. Boys, hope you still have your uniforms.\u201d Mikaela and All of the troopers were in unison \u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d Chp 5: Crazy people 30 minutes later en route to the theta sector Back in their faithful drop ship, The Spartans and troopers geared up for what could be a bloodbath in the theta sector. The Men now in their brown blood covered BDU\u2019s, R.I.G.\u2019s synced, they started for their new gear. The troopers grabbed new weapons that lined inside the weapon racks inside the troop carrier bay of the pelican, with some old weapons as well. SWS Motorized Pulse rifles and Seeker rifles now lined the inside the weapon carriers in the pelican, while the submachine guns the troopers once used now inside pullout compartments beneath the seats. Jake took a hold of a Pulse rifle. \u201cThis Gun feels good, lighter the assault rifles we had before\u201d Jake said with much delight with the rifle. \u201cI agree with you there Major.\u201d chimed in Mark. \u201cYou boys enjoying the tech back here?\u201d asked Tori as she walked through the door. \u201cVery much so commander, I think we will-\u201c Tori interrupted Jake. \u201cWell, get ready to enjoy the tech more, we\u2019re landing in 30 seconds\u201d \u201cWell this should be fun\u201d remarked Frank. The pelican touched down on the landing pad outside the airlock leading into the theta sector. The Doors of the pelican opened as the Troopers and Spartans stormed out of the drop ship. . The door entering the Theta sector opened to large, dimly lit room. Blood trails in multiple directions led around the room, large crate lying undisturbed in and around the room, making what appeared to be a maze. Lights on their Weapons, the squad proceeded slowly in and around the crates. \u201cSomething is not right here\u201d Jake whispered, enough to where Tori could hear him, but not to everyone else. Tori raised her assault rifle \u201cYour right about that Major\u201d Before either of them could say anything else, a very quick figure suddenly ran in front of the squad, with the sound of bones cracking and a barely audible chirp. The squad rounded a corner, what they thought a body laid in front of them turned out to their very grim surprise to what was left of a human body \u201cOh no\u201d Mark said with a fearful tone. Tori knelt down to examine the remains. \u201cThis person wasn\u2019t killed by what we encountered 3 years, at least not as gruesome, the\u2019 John Doe\u2019 we have here was shot in the head, but stabbed an uncountable amount of times in the torso, and the legs broken in 5 places from what I can tell, an his feet have been cleanly cut off.\u201d Tori deduced A loud voice suddenly echoed through the room, an extremely hostile and violent voice. \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?!\u201d A man suddenly rushed Frank, holding a plasma saw inches away from his throat. The rest of the squad aimed their weapons at the crazed man. \u201cTHEY KILLED HIM, YOU SEE? THEY KILLED HIM!\u201d yelled the lunatic. \u201cWhoa, calm down man, who killed this person?\u201d Groaned Frank \u201cshhh, you hear that? They are watching us. Me, you. All of us!\u201d Tori slowly moved her left boot forward, not enough to where the crazy would even know. \u201cThey are coming, for you, for me, for all of us!\u201d The psycho yelled just before slitting his own head off with the plasma saw. Blood splattered across Frank\u2019s visor. The crazy\u2019s body falling to the floor, followed by shell shocked Frank, who was caught in Midair by the commander. \u201cYou alright Stroms?\u201d asked a concerned Tori. \u201cA little shook up, but I\u2019ll live commander\u201d Frank said, shaking off the situation. Tori released Frank to let him pick up his dropped Pulse Rifle, now covered in blood, but not enough to get into the barrels. The Crazy\u2019s neck where his head once sizzled and steamed from the immense heat from the saw, his arm\u2019s twitched several times before finally stopping. \u201cNot how I pictured how my day would start.\u201d Mikaela said, with her shotgun lowered. \u201cme neither\u201d Tori said in her mind, flashing back to the images of what happened to them 3 years earlier, seeing all the blood on the floors. Seeing Glen Hanson\u2019s severed head on the floor, rolling toward her. \u201cYou okay Commander?\u201d asked a worried Mikaela. \u201cI\u2019m fine, let\u2019s go and find that suicide rally we were sent to find\u201d Said Tori, sounding distraught. Chp. 6: What\u2019s going on? 20 minutes later, in the theta sector Down the hall and through the corridors, the Squad proceeded to find the location of the recent suicide rally, but no avail. \u201cDoes anyone have the slightest clue to find the location of this rally?\u201d asked Tori, sounding irritated. \u201cIt should be beyond the door commander, at the end of this corridor\u201d Mikaela said while looking at her R.I.G.\u2019s map. \u201cGood\u201d Tori regretted saying that as soon as the door opened. The door opened to a very ugly scene, civilians and Earthgov security guards littered the floor, blood oozing out every single body in the room. What appeared to be hundreds of people with gunshots through their heads, all in the same position, through the bottom of the throat and holes on the top of the head. \u201cMy god\u201d Mark said, feeling as if all of the breath in his body was taken away. \u201cSplit up, Two Teams, see what corrupted these people to do this to themselves, Report to me on my R.I.G if you find anything.\u201d Ordered Tori Everyone responded in unison once again \u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d Jake, Frank and Mark headed in the opposite direction of the Spartans. \u201cSo what are expected to find here, Major\u201d asked Mark. \u201cI don\u2019t know man.\u201d Frank and Mark continued on, but stopped to see Jake kneeling over a pair of bodies. \u201cWhat do you got, Major?\u201d Jake didn\u2019t answer. \u201cSir, you okay?\u201d Mark asked again. Mark and Frank saw the motion of Jake\u2019s body language change; they could tell he was filled with rage as he walked away from the body. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into him?\u201d Frank asked curiously. They looked at the pair of bodies that Jake was previously kneeling over, they now felt a deep mutual pain for Jake; the bodies we\u2019re Jake\u2019s wife Madalyn, and 3 year old daughter Zoey. No gunshots were on the little girl, but abrasions on her neck signaled that was strangled to death. \u201cI-I just talked to Maddy just this morning, I was looking for Jake, but she said he just left when I called, and little Zoey was asleep in her arms.\u201d Mark said with deep sorrow in his voice. \u201cI think we should contact the commander about this ASAP\u201d Frank said with sadness in his voice. \u201cShe is not going to like this\u201d Mark repeated in his mind. He opened a rig link to Tori. \u201cCommander, I believe we found something\u201d \u201cWhat did you find Cole?\u201d \u201cBefore I tell you, just to give you a heads up, the major wont be in the best mood when you see him\u201d \u201cNoted, now, what did you find?\u201d Tori asked again. Mark took a deep breath before telling the commander the bad news. \u201cWe found Major Locklear\u2019s Wife and Daughter\u201d Mark said with a palm over his visor. Tori said with a saddened voice \u201cUnderstood.\u201d The link closed Mark was deep in thought as how Jake would act after his family\u2019s death. Mark knelt down to examine the bodies; both of them had their eyes open. Out of respect, Mark closed them. Chp 7: Hell Re-emerges \u201cMikaela, go find Locklear, If his family has been killed, he\u2019s going to have words of encouragement\u201d said a worried Tori. \u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d Mikaela walked way from the commander to go find Jake, who surprisingly on purposely bumped into her, she whipped around and grabbed him by the arm. \u201cListen, Major, I heard the news about the death of your family, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to get pissed off at the people around you-\u201c A furious Jake Locklear lashed out at Mikaela \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose the people you love, Lieutenant Commander, all you Spartans are the same!\u201d lashed Jake What Jake had just said caused something deep inside Mikaela to snap, and throw a powerful punch into His shoulder pressure point. Jake let out the loudest scream his lungs let out \u201cLet that be reminder Major, Not I all Spartans are the same, before you had ever joined the UNSC, I too lost someone close to me, another Spartan in fact, He sacrificed his life so I could live and serve under Commander Tori\u201d Jake grunted while getting up from the punch Mikaela threw at him, once he got up. \u201cOkay, I got the message Ma\u2019am\u201d Mark and Frank were not that far away from Jake and Mikaela, close enough to see the show. Frank let out a chuckle \u201cHe had that coming\u201d \u201cYea, he did\u201d Mark said. An audio link opened up on everyone\u2019s rig, it was the Commander. \u201cFall in everyone, repeat, Fall in\u201d Within 20 seconds the squad fell in \u201cGood, everyone is still here, Locklear, what did you find out?\u201d Almost in the form of a growl \u201cYou already know what we found, Commander\u201d \u201cI know, but what else did you find?\" Just as Jake was about to respond, a loud crash echoed through the room, several loud chirps were heard, what appeared to be footfalls suddenly surrounded the squad, followed by loud roars, all weapons of the squad were raised and armed. \u201cI have a feeling violence is about to ensue\u201d Frank said eerily. \u201cNot again\u201d Jake said quietly. A small figure peeked around the corner, what appeared to be a disfigured head popped out of the side of a crate. Jake slowly approached the dark figure; he got close when the figure vanished behind the crate. \u201cI guess it must be nothing\u201d \u201cJake... move away, now!\u201d Tori ordered The small figured turned out to be a giant creature standing 4 feet above Jake. A monstrously large claw flung out at Jake, knocking him down the floor. Almost as if by there was some sort of force around them, without Tori ever saying it, the squad unleashed a hailstorm of bullets and bolts of energy. The creature let out an antagonized roar at the fallen trooper and bolted to a blind spot of a nearby crate. \u201cFuck!\u201d Jake grunted as he pounded his fist into the metallic floor. Tori walked over with outstretched hand to pull him up. \u201cGet up Major\u201d Tori pulled up Jake. Just as head stood up, a loud, deadly, familiar roar now echoed through the room. \u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me\u201d Remarked Tori said, shocked at the fact that the creatures they had once encountered three years earlier had come back for round two. \u201cRequesting Permission to get the damn things commander\u201d asked Jake, with a sound in his voice of having a deep need for revenge. \u201cDenied Major, I don\u2019t want you getting killed the same way Hanson got killed\u201d \u201cUnderstood Ma\u2019am\u201d grunted Jake. A familiar figure jumped on top of the nearest crate, staring at the squad with deadly intentions. The quickest one to respond to the imminent threat at hand was Mikaela. The creature jumped down from the crate sprinted toward the Spartan, Blades flailing in all directions with the intent to decapitate, but it never got the chance to fulfill its deadly mission, with well placed shotgun rounds to both arms of the creature, it fell before Mikaela. \u201cFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\u201d said Mikaela. \u201cYou getting poetic on us Mikaela?\u201d aggressively asked Tori. \u201cNo Ma\u2019am!\u201d Shouted Mikaela, who just fired anther round into an infant creature that was shooting off organic barbs Mark gave out a useful suggestion \u201cMa\u2019am, I suggest we get back to the Pelican, and get out of here\u201d \u201cAgreed, everyone fall back to the pelican\u201d Just as the squad started back, three bat-like creatures suddenly burst through two nearby vents \u201cOh you have got to be fucking kidding me, they even look like bats?!\u201d Tori shouted furiously What they had expected to be an attack upon them, to much of their surprise and ultimate fear of Jake, two of the bat creatures latched onto two corpses, which turned out to be His Wife Madalyn, and 3 year old Zoey. Rapid flapping of their wings started as they spitting out strange yellow fluid from their apparent lobe into the Corpses of Jakes now undead family. Jake looked on in horror as his family become part of them; his wife rose from the ground, blades ejecting from her shoulders, an extra pair of hands burst from her midsection. Once the infection was complete, she let out the gruesome roar of the other creatures they had once fought. The other bat creature released its lobe from little Zoey\u2019s head, giant claws sprouted from her hands, her face becoming torn, disfigured and bloody, mostly around her mouth. \u201cThese are your kills Major! If you won\u2019t take the shot, I will!\u201d commanded Tori. Just before pulling the tripper on his pulse rifle, Jake let out a small whisper, hoping his undead family would hear him \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d With the creatures now resembling his family. Looking at Jake, they let out roars and screeches of attack. Both of them charged the Tear and Anger Driven trooper, who ultimately pulled the trigger on his family. The first to go down was Madalyn, both arms falling to the floor, her body falling backwards, landing with a loud thud against the metallic flooring. Zoey passed the rounds Jake had fired into his wife\u2019s creature infected corpse, and managed to jump onto Jake, clawing and scratching on his armor. The whole time Zoey\u2019s corpse was scratching on him, he remembered all the good and fun times he had with his daughter, but he never imagined the last time he would ever get to hold her would be trying to get her dead and deadly corpse to get off of him. With a final and deadly blow, Jake bashed his rifle against her head, beheading her. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d Jake said crying. With the fight over, Jake fell to his knees, also dropping his rifle next to his leg. He looked at his weapon, feeling the umentionable amount of sadness and guilt that have been brought over him.. Tori started toward him to help him up, but instead of offering to pull him up, she simply gave him a gentle hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou did what you had to do Jake.\u201d said Tori disheartened. \u201cYour right Ma\u2019am\u201d Jake said as he rose from the floor. \u201cAs for everyone else, fall back to the pelican, we need to go and tell someone about this.\" No one breathed a word as they headed back toward the airlock and pelican Chp 8: Visions The pelican took off from the platform in the silence of space, headed back toward the alpha sector, where Jake\u2019s office, Mark and Frank\u2019s Apartment, and the test lab for the Spartans were. Inside the pelican, the only thing inside that was making noise was the thrusters on the pelican; no one said a word, trooper or Spartan. Frank was the first to break the silence. \u201cJake, are you going to be alright?\u201d Even with his helmet on, Frank felt the \u201cIm going to kill you if you ask that again\u201d stare from Jake. \u201cForget I asked\u201d Jake said with audio off in his helmet \u201cGood Idea\u201d Tori\u2019s voice came over the speaker \u201cETA to alpha sector: 15 seconds\u201d A jolt went through the pelican as all of its landing gears hit the alpha sector platform. Nothing at all was right when the squad return to the alpha sector, spikes of metal rose from the floor, mostly caused by unknown explosions, Fires were going in several parts in the sectors exiting the airlock from the platform. Then the unmistakable blood trails and footprints lined the floor, in several directions. \u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d gasped Frank. \u201cSomething that\u2019s in worse mood than I am\u201d growled Jake. \u201cMajor, now is not the time\u201d Tori said quietly, but still with a stern tone. \u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d \u201cWhat I do need you to do is contact the last person who talked to you today\u201d \u201cRight, that would be my assistant, Mac\u201d \u201cGood, try and reach, we need to tell him what\u2019s happening\u201d Jake opened a R.I.G. link to Mac\u2019s R.I.G. he answer it but the sound of his voice indicated that he was in terrified state. \u201cJake? Jake man, things are hell down here, people are absolutely going crazy down here, and I mean crazy like people killing by Slicing off other people\u2019s arms and legs. Whose there? Oh My God! No! NOOOO!!!\u201d The R.I.G. link went to static, leaving the squad to one clear conclusion. \u201cIts spread\u201d Tori said dreadfully \u201cJeez, is there anywhere these things aren\u2019t?\u201d groaned Mark. \u201cI believe it should be our priority mission to reach Mac\u2019s last known location, see what we can find\u201d Tori shifted her gaze toward Jake, who was clenching his rifle so tight; blood was coming out his hands. \u201cMajor? I need you at 100% for this. Maybe this will shed some light on how you\u2019re family got into the state they are in\u201d He wiped his bloody hands on his helmet, in the pattern of a skull, then to his rifle. \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d Jake Growled. In his mind, finding out was the only thing that mattered to him to this point, and it kept repeating in his mind like an ancient earth record player, \u201cI\u2019m going to make them all pay, I don\u2019t care how I do it, I\u2019m going to make them all pay\u201d Tori opened up her R.I.G map for the location for Mac\u2019s rig. \u201cHis rig is in the C.e.C security offices\u201d \u201cTo get there, we are going to have to pass through tightly put spaces together\u201d Jake said \u201cIs that true Major, is that your way of getting payback?\u201d \u201cYes, commander, I traveled that route day in and day out since we arrived here on the Sprawl\u201d \u201cNoted Major\u201d Tori took a pause to think about her next order was going to be and what repercussions it would have \u201cMajor, take point, lead the way\u201d Jake\u2019s face curled to give a scary looking smile \u201cYes Ma\u2019am, with pleasure\u201d \u201cThis is not going to go well\u201d Mikaela said to Tori. \u201cYour Right Mikaela, with Locklear leading the way, violence is sure to ensue\u201d The whole time Tori was speaking to Mikaela, Jake and the others where ahead of them by 10 steps \u201cAre coming or what commander?\u201d \u201cRemember who you talking to next Major, I wont be afraid to pull rank the next time you talk to me like that, am I clear?\u201d Tori said, walking toward the trooper, with Mikaela tailing behind. \u201cGot it Commander\u201d Just as the squad entered the door starting the route to the C.e.C Security offices, Tori looked back; to see a dark figure strangely pointing at her, she shook her head only to see Fire burning. \u201cMust have been my imagination\u201d she said to herself. Chp 9: Memories \u201cWatch your step people\u201d Warned Jake, as they were passing through a dangerous Zero-G area. The other troopers were trying to conceal their happiness of flying through Zero-G through hardened tones and annoying jokes, but they temporary joy was shattered by Tori. \u201cYou guys having Fun?\u201d asked Tori sternly \u201cNo ma\u2019am\u201d moaned Frank. \u201cGood\u201d Tori shifted her voice toward Jake. \u201cOkay, How much farther?\u201d \u201cJust beyond this next Corner and we will have a straight shot to the C.e.C security offices. As the squad rounded the corner, a giant creature of monstrous size came out of what appeared to be a protective skin shield. \u201cGreat, we have to get through that?\u201d growled Jake. \u201cI will handle this\u201d Tori said confidently. The creature started to flail its three apparent arms, release brain looking projectiles as Tori Jetpack started to power up. Before any one of the squad could take another breath, Tori took off toward the creature like a rocket, armor lock engaged. Tori using herself as a missile against the creature, she plunged into the creature with great force. The creature let out a roar of pain and agony as Tori re-emerged on the other side of the Guardian, blood floating toward the Spartan. Tori moved around to the front of the creature to make a grotesque discovery. \u201cThis thing was human, female\u201d Tori said quietly over the radio. \u201cBitch had it coming\u201d Jake said insultingly. Even at a distance Tori\u2019s gaze met Jakes as she opened a rig video link to him \u201cOne more comment like that and its back to Sergeant Locklear, Do I make myself Clear Major?\u201d \u201cCrystal Ma\u2019am\u201d \u201cOkay, where\u2019s the door?\u201d Jake pulled up the schematic for the zero-g area, looking for the door, only to find an unwanted situation. \u201cThe door is on the other side of that thing\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just great\u201d Moaned Mark. \u201cI got this; I kind of borrowed this from a former friend of ours\u201d Tori said as she surprisingly pulled out Jahea\u2019s Energy Sword which she kept secret in her Tactical hard case. \u201cCommander, when did you tell us you had the Covie\u2019s sword?\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it using at all, wanted to keep it for personal reasons\u201d With a slight flicking motion of the sword, the duel energy blades of the sword came to light, but instead of the infamous blue color of the sword, it was a glowing, pulsating blood red color. \u201cDid you make adjustments to the sword\u201d Asked Mikaela. \u201cI did, if this thing touches anything, anything at all, it be vaporized to oblivion, but apparently not to our guest here\u201d Tori Said, while referring to the roadblock. \u201cTime to get to work\u201d Small air hissing sounds came from Tori as she started in circular flight path to vaporize the strong skin of the dead creature. Soon as the blades hit the skin of the dead creature, Tori all of a sudden flashed back to her time in training without any warning. Flash Back 18 years ago. \u201c619! Where there hell is that girl?\u201d shouted Colonel Davidson. \u201cSir, I think she is on that obstacle course.\u201d said a Mysterious woman. The woman\u2019s predictions were correct. Tori doing her best to complete the Obstacle course, all she left was a 100 foot rope climbing wall. \u201cShe is something isn\u2019t she?\u201d remarked Davidson. \u201cShe is perhaps the best Spartan I have seen in this planet\u2019s Spartan 3 Program\u201d Said the Mystery woman. \u201cThe only thing that Boggles my mind is why she puts herself through the harder training, I mean, the stress on her body already is enough, but too much will break her.\u201d \u201cShe will never be broken\u201d Said the woman, she continued. \u201cShe just wants to prove to us she has more than what it takes to be a Spartan.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you think that she has-\u201c The colonel stop to look at another Spartan standing next to him, A Spartan II in fact. \u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Colonel Davidson. \u201cLieutenant Mikaela-724, Sierra team\u201d \u201cSierra Team, I thought the team was wiped out when they faced 15 platoons of rebel forces\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the only one left, I\u2019m now just a Spartan waiting to get assigned to a another team\u201d As the Colonel and Mikaela finished Talking, Tori walked up, with a towel around her neck, giving out an outstretched hand. Mikaela just looked at her strangely. \u201cFine then, be that way\u201d snipped Tori. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name Spartan?\u201d Mikaela called out. \u201cTori-619\u201d \u201cColonel, requesting permission to have Tori accompany me on a flight training skirmish\u201d \u201cApproved\u201c Said the Colonel 1 Hour later in the flashback Mikaela\u2019s Longsword fighter shook and rattled through the air as she maneuvered through heavy amounts of Flak and Missiles from Fake enemy Longswords. \u201cIts getting really crowded up here in my sky\u201d said Mikaela. A violent shock went through the longsword. \u201cWe\u2019re Hit Lieutenant\u201d shouted Tori over the loud noise in the Longsowrd. The only thing that Mikaela said before the crash was a phrase Tori would remember for the rest of her life. \u201cThey can\u2019t take they sky from me\u201d Chp 10: Old places, dead faces 13 minutes later The door entering the C.e.C security offices opened to very dark room, only lit by a burning fire cause by a small explosion, which was evident. A dank, rotten smell filled the entire room, the smoke from the fire simply made it worse. \u201cAw crap, not again\u201d moaned Mark. Tori and Mikaela both reached for their hazop breathing apparatuses. \u201cThat smell is\u2026.. Familiar\u201d whispered Tori \u201cI remember it all too well\u201d agreed Mikaela. \u201cBe on your guard people, if those things are back; show them what we are capable of.\u201d Tori grunted Jake answered with both anger and rage in his voice \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d Flashlights from the squad\u2019s weapons swept the room, laser sights moved in synch with the lights. Blood and shell casings littered the floor; Tori swept her light over an extremely battered corpse. \u201cI have one!\u201d she called. With her light still on the body, and with the squad looking on, they watched a disbelief as the body was pulled into the darkness of the office. With no hesitation, She tossed a disintegration grenade, with a blinding red light, and a roar of mass pain, she knew she had hit her mark. \u201cLet\u2019s see you pull that body when you\u2019re nothing but bits\u201d Tori said with a slight grin. \u201cJake, where\u2019s Mac\u2019s rig? \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Jake said with a pause as he looked for the location on his Rig. With a flashing white light, his map pinpointed Mac\u2019s rig. \u201cHis rig is\u2026\u201d he paused again. \u201cWell?\u201d Tori asked. \u201cHis Rig is 40 beyond that door and another 50 feet bellow us\u201d He said sounding confused. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring metal saws Jake, are you looking at your map right?\u201d Tori asked with disapproving tone. \u201cThat\u2019s what it shows\u201d \u201cGreat\u201d Just before Tori was going to unload her fist into the nearest wall. \u201cHold on a sec, there\u2019s an elevator leading his location, which would explain the rig being 50 feet bellow us\u201d Jake said sounding relieved. \u201cWhich door did you say it was we got to go through?\u201d Jake pointed to his left. \u201cLet\u2019s move\u201d She ordered. The squad moved toward the door, just it opened, Tori once again saw the strange figure, this time, more identifiable. The figure appeared to be slightly taller than the Spartans, eyes glowing white, a strange kind liquid poured out its mouth, and it then let out a screech that only Tori could hear and make out \u201cYou can\u2019t run forever!\u201d the figure then disappeared in blind white light followed by a loud ringing in her ears. Everyone looked on in concern. \u201cYou okay commander?\u201d asked Mark. She shook head slightly \u201cI\u2019m fine. Jake, where\u2019s that elevator?\u201d \u201cJust beyond this hallway\u201d Jake said, still sounding concerned. \u201cOkay good, we should get moving\u201d Tori said, but sounding unnerved She shut off her helmets outward audio, having sometime to think. \u201cI can\u2019t hallucinate, Spartans can\u2019t hallucinate.\u201d She said to herself, still thinking about what she had seen. The squad reached the elevator. But had their weapons risen as if they were to expect something, in which they did. A creature that resembled a human being, but with a third leg, looking as if it was made out of the nerve string, long claws and a badly burned midsection. The creature\u2019s lower jaw appeared to have been burned away by the acid that was pouring from its mouth, it made a loud gurgling noise as it made the stance of attack. A firestorm of bullets and energy projectiles quickly dismembered and killed the creature. \u201cSomething tells me that if that thing puked on any of us, it would hurt\u2026. A lot\u201d Said Frank. \u201cWe should get our guest off of here\u201d Suggested Mikaela. \u201cDo it\u201d said Tori, but then turned around to see the figure again. Only this time when it appeared, all it did was stare at her, intimidatingly. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked. But the figure was no longer there when she asked. The squad looked at her, looking more concerned than before. \u201cCommander, I think you have been seeing things\u201d said Mikaela, sounding every bit concerned for Tori. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She said turning around, she something else, but the squad didn\u2019t hear what else she said \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t like what I have seen.\u201d 15 minutes later. The elevator door opened, with squad getting off the elevator, only be the witnesses to a horrible scene upon exit. Bodies of The People of the C.e.C Security offices; slaughtered, mauled, burned, and dismembered corpses littered the security office as the squad slowly waked over them. Mark cited female body that had been completely sliced in two down the middle, to which he quickly removed his helmet and vomited. \u201cUgh, god that\u2019s nasty\u201d he said as he wiped his mouth. \u201cI\u2019d hate to say this, and put this on everybody, but- \u201c Tori was interrupted by Mikaela. \u201cWe\u2019re on it Commander, you don\u2019t even have to say it.\u201d \u201cTroopers, start searching\u201d Mikaela ordered. Tori continued to walk on, amongst the dead. She removed her helmet, her dark brown hair falling out. Her eyes were staring at a particular body, was not dismembered but badly burned, with wounds to the left side of her face, and acid burns to her right side. The wounds on the female\u2019s body were dangerously familiar to a similar scene she had seen on her first live mission as a Spartan. Tori ran two of her fingers along the left side of her face, feeling the scars and indentations of her tough skin, remembering. Flashback 13 years ago \u201cGO GO GO!\u201d A marine shouted just before being blown away by a rebel frag. \u201cWhere is our Support?!\u201d yelled a second marine A female voice came over the radio, it was her. \u201cThis is SIERRA 619; you\u2019ll have your support in 40 seconds, sergeant. 619 out\u201d \u201cDude, are you serious, our support is a Spartan?\u201d said a marine Private. \u201cYou better believe it rook, but this Spartan, she is different that all the others, you soon see why\u201d That they did, with a loud roar from above, a SOEIV drop pod fell into the chaos of the battle that was raging. With a loud CRASH noise, all the shooting from both sides stopped firing to see the pod. Two of the rebel soldiers slowly walked to the pod. With a hiss, the door from the pod flew open hitting and killing the rebel soldiers. The Marines praying the person in there was their support. It was. \u201cWatch how its down boys\u201d Assault rifles, sniper rifles, and shotguns on the rebels began to fire, explosion from frags all directed to the pod. A blue glow surrounded the seat of the pod; real soon, silence fell once again upon the battlefield, which was followed by a female voice. \u201cMy turn\u201d In the span of 10 seconds, all the rebel forces fell, but the only sound that was heard were dull claps of a Silenced SMGS. \u201cWhoa\u201d said the private in amazement. \u201cYou\u2019re right on that private\u201d \u201cSomeone called for a Spartan?\u201d said Tori. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d asked the sergeant. \u201cOne word: Skill. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d \u201cWell before you showed up, we were pinned down, lost a lot of good men. Thank you for the help Chief\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Don\u2019t worry; you won\u2019t lose any more, what are your names marines?\u201d \u201cSergeant Paul Velasquez, this here is Private Bill Palmer\u201d \u201cI\u2019d noticed from my drop you just lost a man to frag, who was that?\u201d \u201cThat was corporal Heckler.\u201d Tori and two marines moved toward the body of their fallen comrade, Heckler, whom had scarring on his left face, and burns on his right. Tori closed the young corporal\u2019s eyes, just as his eyes were closed, a dangerous explosion knocked down Tori, also knocking off her helmet. Just then an enemy frag landed 5 feet away from Tori, causing the left side of her face to become bloody and scarred, with a loud scream; Tori clenched the left side of her face in pain. Bullets and frags from the rebels started pick up again. \u201cGet on the horn; we need to get medical VTOL out here now!\u201d shouted Sergeant Velasquez to Palmer. \u201cYes Sir!\u201d Palmer did what he was ordered to do. \u201cThis is Fire team Gamma, We have a Soldier down and we need Medical VTOL here Now!\u201d \u201cNegative on the VTOL Gamma, your zone is too hot, repeat too hot\u201d \u201cSIERRA 619 is down, Repeat, SIERRA 619 is down\u201d A long pause came over the radio \u201cCome on Damn it! \u201cDid you say SIERRA 619, Gamma?\u201d \u201cYes I did! Where is the damn VTOL?!\u201d \u201cIt will be there in 10 minutes, but we have a M808B less than 2 minutes out, try and hold out till then Gamma\u201d The radio then cut off. \u201cWhat\u2019s the word Private?\u201d asked Velasquez. \u201cWe have Scorpion inbound; VTOL will be here in 10\u201d \u201cWell at least they know we are still here\u201d Velasquez chuckled. The sound of a distant Rocket launcher being fired was heard by The Marines and Tori. \u201cRPG!, GET TO COVER!\u201d yelled Velasquez. \u201cI can handle this Sergeant\u201d said a wounded Tori. Tori quickly grabbed one of her SMGS and pointed it at the direction of the rocket. With the look of Anger and determination, Tori fired a three round burst at the rocket, which to the surprise of the Marines the rocket exploded 7 feet away from her, with the rush of wind from the blast moved her dark brown hair. Then a loud explosion followed the sound of rebels screaming from falling from their vantage points. The Marines surmised one fact that just happened. \u201cOur Tank is here!\u201d shouted Velasquez happily. \u201cOh thank god\u201d sighed Palmer. The Tank rumbled into the field, machine gun next to the cannon firing which was laying down heavy cover fire for the downed group of Marines and Tori. Velasquez noticed something got made him into a better mood. \u201cWe got those pussies on the run!\u201d shouted Velasquez while throwing down his helmet victoriously. 8 minutes later. A loud metallic roar was heard over head. The medical pelican touched down in the open courtyard of the battlefield, and several medical personnel came out expecting an injury from Tori. \u201cCan you get up Chief?\u201d asked Velasquez. \u201cMy face is messed up, my legs aren\u2019t broken Sergeant.\u201d \u201cOf course Ma\u2019am\u201d he said as gave out a small chuckle. Tori walked over to pick up her helmet from the ground, to which she noticed her Network module on her recon helmet had been blown off. She then walked over to the ramp of the pelican to be examined by the medical personnel. \u201cIts not that bad, a few stitches, and your face will be good as new, it will leave a permanent scar, but nonetheless\u201d \u201cGood, stitches are fine.\u201d She said as she ran her fingers down the scar. Chp 11: Push \u201cYou got anything over there, commander?\u201d asked Mikaela. \u201cNo, nothing over here\u201d Tori said as she put on her helmet. \u201cDamn it Mac, Where are you?\u201d grunted Jake as he tried his best to find him or his body. Tori eventually came up upon a locked door on the other side of the room, being lit by only holographic monitors gone to static and flickering lights. \u201cI got something over here people\u201d she called. The squad eventually regrouped. \u201cMikaela, what can you do about this?\u201d asked Tori. \u201cHmm, let me see\u201d Mikaela looked around the door, eventually her eyes fell upon an open electrical panel. \u201cLet me see what I can do\u201d she said just before a large electrical shock shorted out her shields. \u201cFuck! Someone must of have locked the door from the other side, can\u2019t be opened here\u201d \u201cLet me took a look\u201d said Mark \u201cBefore I joined the UNSC, I was quite the electrician in my home town.\u201d \u201cYou got 5 minutes Cole\u201d Tori said, reaching for her Assault rifle. A low whine echoed through the Office. Then the whine was followed by a nearby Vent being blown apart. Mark was steadily rearranging the wires to open the door. \u201cCole?\u201d said Tori. \u201cJust give me 2 more minutes\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have 2 Minutes\u201d Grunted Mikaela as she drew up her powerful shotgun. A baby like creature with a glowing, bloated midsection cooed as it crawled toward the Spartans. Tori gave an amused huff \u201cIs this the best they can do?\u201d Almost as if all the creatures around them heard her, more poured in through the damaged vent \u201cOh come on!\u201d growled the Spartan. The creature resembling an infant started to crawl as another creature came crashing through, a slim and ravaged creature with a giant glowing, distorted arm lumbered its way toward them. \u201cAlmost there\u201d Mark said calmly. \u201cWell could you hurry it up?\u201d yelled Tori. Both creatures were now within spitting distance between the Spartans and the door, which Tori gave the order to where everyone would be happy to follow. \u201cOPEN FIRE!\u201d'' With one shotgun round, Mikaela was able to take out both of the creatures with a round hitting the distorted glowing pustule, killing both creatures, and splattering blood all over the office. Frank gave a disgusted grunt \u201cMan that\u2019s nasty\u201d as he tried to get the remnant blood off his Seeker rifle. \u201cDoors open Ma\u2019am, I suggest we get through before more suicide monsters appear.\u201d said Mark. \u201cAgreed. Everyone, through the door\u201d The squad proceeded through the door to find even more bodies littering every corner, every cubicle, blood running along the floors. \u201cJesus\u201d gasped Frank. \u201cThese things show absolutely no mercy\u201d \u201cNeither will I\u201d Thought Jake. \u201cMajor, where\u2019s Mac\u2019s rig?\u201d asked Tori while kneeling down to examine a body. \u201cHis rig is at the other end of the room, it\u2019s a lot of close quarters, Id suggest that I take Mark and frank, we will cover more ground\u201d \u201cGo for it\u201d said Tori. \u201cAnd as always Mikaela, you\u2019re with me.\u201d \u201cReady to go commander\u201d Said Mikaela as she cocked a spent shell out of her shotgun. \u201cI would recommend everyone go to Night vision, it\u2019s more likely that whoever is here won\u2019t see us coming, Creature or psycho\u201d Said Tori. The ODSTs preceded down the left side other maze of cubicles, while Tori and Mikaela went down the right. The Spartans came up upon the first set of cubicles, only to see five dead and dismember corpses. \u201cClear\u201d Mikaela said over the radio. \u201cMajor, do you anything on your end?\u201d \u201cYes Ma\u2019am, a whole lot of dead around here, apparently these people over here committed suicide before they ever got turned into one of those things, what about you?\u201d \u201cBits and Pieces, nothing but bits and pieces\u201d murmured Tori. \u201cUnderstood\u201d Jake said calmly. \u201cCommander, Tori?\u201d said Mikaela with sound of a question in her voice. \u201cYes Mikaela?\u201d \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t seen you like this since you lost your C.O. Armando\u201d \u201cThat was 10 years ago Mikaela\u201d said Tori sadly. \u201cId rather not think about it again, his death got me sidelined for 5 months under the impression of intense stress.\u201d \u201cI understand Ma\u2019am\u201d said Mikaela. \u201cThe only thing that got me through all that was going on Solo missions, no help, no backup, and no one to rely on\u201d \u201cYou said enough, Commander\u201d Whispered Mikaela. Meanwhile, on the other side of the room. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that all these people would kill them selves just to keep from turning into those things.\u201d said Frank. \u201cWell believe it\u201d Said Jake, with anger in his voice. Mark purposely bumped his elbow into Frank. \u201cGo to an interior comm.,\u201d Mark whispered. Both troopers switched to interior comms, while Jake continued on ahead. \u201cHey frank, have you noticed that the Major has been\u2026 off lately?\u201d \u201cDude, he just lost his family, of course he\u2019s off, why would you bring up something that everyone knows?\u201d asked Frank with a small tone of irritation. \u201cNo I mean, when we lost Major Hanson\u201d Mark stuttered. \u201cNow that you mention it, ever since then, he\u2019s been more isolated, but now with the death of his family, his attitude is that close to a battle hardened Spartan.\u201d Both troopers accidentally bumped into Jake whose piercing stare made them go back to outward Mics. \u201cWhat were you two talking about?\u201d asked Jake. \u201cN-Nothing sir\u201d Mark stuttered. \u201cGood, pick up your weapons, I believe I found what we\u2019re looking for. And I just told the commander, they will be here in 30 seconds\u201d Within seconds, Tori and Mikaela peeked around a cubicle corner to find the troopers standing over a whimpering Mac. \u201cWho-Who are you?\u201d Mac asked, sounding extremely scared. Jake depolarized his visor, revealing his face. \u201cJake? Oh thank god, what\u2019s going on, there is these thing are everywhere, people committing suicide, its goddamn hell here, who are these other people?\u201d \u201cThey are my comrades, and people who can help.\u201d Mac gave out a big sigh of relief. \u201cCan you tell us what happened here, Mac?\u201d Asked Jake with a friendly hand to the shoulder \u201cWell, can you tell us what happened when your link was cutoff?\u201d \u201cOne of the people I work with, uhh, Harry. He charged at me with a plasma saw, trying to cut off my head, god what\u2019s gotten into these people?\u201d Mac said sounding terrified. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know Harry\u201d \u201cHe was the janitor, but I have no idea how he got hold of a plasma saw\u201d \u201cThis is the C.e.C security Offices right? There has to be some nearby weapon lockers\u201d Came in Tori. \u201cYour Friend is right; there are some weapon lockers down to the right and down the stairs, that\u2019s where we keep all the confiscated weapons and other stuff\u201d Mac said, still sounding afraid. \u201cTroopers, Keep watch out here, Mikaela and I will go down there and check it out\u201d Said Tori. \u201cNo. No! That\u2019s where most of them are, I barely got out of there alive when I was attacked\u201d \u201cWe will handle it\u201d she said \u201dMikaela lets go\u201d \u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d Chp 12: Something to be known. The two Spartans proceeded down the hall and descending the stairs, only to realize something was amiss. \u201cSomething is not right Commander\u201d Mikaela said, sounding suspicious. \u201cHow\u2019s that so?\u201d \u201cThere is no blood down on the floor down here, no bodies, no electrical failure, nothing.\u201d \u201cYour right, maybe we are being misled.\u201d \u201cCould be, but let\u2019s not jump to conclusions\u201d A loud wheezing was suddenly heard, it\u2019s raspy, sand like breathing echoed down through the basement leading to the weapons lockers. \u201cLooks like we have company\u201d whispered Tori. The Spartans rounded a corner to find the remainder of the hall pitch black, no lighting was present, but the breathing coming from the darkened hall. Tori gave the hand signal to Mikaela to quickly move the other wall adjacent to her. With the familiar look toward Mikaela, Tori\u2019s look told Mikaela to switch to cloak reconnaissance mode. Milliseconds later, Mikaela became invisible to Tori\u2019s eyes, but with a finger touch to her helmet, Tori switched to a low light night vision mode enabling her to see Mikaela\u2019s outline. With another hand signal, Tori told Mikaela to switch to interior comms. \u201cMikaela, what do you see?\u201d \u201cYou have to see this for yourself Ma\u2019am\u201d Gasped Mikaela A rig video link to Tori opened up, to reveal multiple human body parts scattered all around the floor. She then saw movement on the ceiling. \u201cYou see this commander?\u201d \u201cYes I do, and I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m seeing\u201d A human corpse hanged form the ceiling, its entire ribcage revealing itself, distorted Hands and feet helped cling to the ceiling. Almost as it happened instantly, the head of the creature twisted around quickly, with sounds of the neck bone cracking in multiple places, and then let out a loud roar toward unarmed Mikaela. A long tentacle came jetting out of the creatures mouth, latching onto Mikaela\u2019s CQC helmet. \u201cUGH CRAP!\u201d Mikaela yelled as she struggled to get free. Mikaela was now off her feet and with being pulled up toward the creature. \u201cNo, Not again\u201d sighed Tori. Tori could sense a strange string of panic coming from Mikaela. No longer holding onto the past and with deadly look in her eyes, Tori pulled out the blood red energy sword, its light shined upon her face, giving off an electrical hiss. \u201cI\u2019m coming for you Mikaela\u201d Tori said calmly over the radio. \u201cBetter hurry Commander!\u201d yelled Mikaela. The creature let out a roar of enjoyment as it set it sights on the second Spartan. Tori gave a full sprint toward the creature, racing to save her captured Comrade. With a front flip jump and extended arm, Tori sliced the creature\u2019s tentacle in 4 places. Having it releasing its grip, Mikaela hit the ground. \u201cThanks Tori, I owe you one\u201d Said Mikaela as she yanked the tentacle off her helmet. \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome\u201d Tori whispered, as she strangely looked at the sword. She felt a weight on her shoulders suddenly lift, as if something in the past that reminded her of a great loss was gone. \u201cA lot of strange things are happening out here in the black, Mikaela.\u201d \u201cNo Shit\u201d She said as she holstered her dropped shotgun. The two Spartans continued there search down in the basement, only to find mass amounts of corpses piled on top of each other, blood poured out every single body, forming close to a small stream. A closer look at the bodies led a disturbing discovery. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t commit suicide, they were murdered. Make a quick ballistic check, what kind of round it is and who it belongs too.\" \u201cOh my god\u201d gasped Mikaela. Tori looked at the ballistic, realizing only one person could have killed the people at the offices. \u201cWe need to back topside, the troopers are in danger!\u201d Chp 13: Sharpshooter The two Spartans raced through the basement and back up the stairs and back into the security offices, only to find the all but one of the troopers being held hostage by the insane psycho known as Mac. Tori and Mikaela drew both their weapons, but not quick enough before Mac put a divet pistol to Mark\u2019s throat. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer, if you do, I swear I will blow his brains all over the room!\u201d yelled Mac, who had a more than crazed look in his eyes. \u201cWhy are you doing this Mac?\u201d Asked Tori \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, the people that brought these divine creature to us, you can\u2019t stop them, none of you\u201d He said as his voice violently shook. \u201cDivine creatures? You have completely lost you\u2019re mind, Mac. Put the gun down\u201d \u201cHe will never see reason, commander, just shoot him!\u201d yelled Mark. \u201cDon\u2019t make me Mac!\u201d Tori said as she aimed her rifle at Mac, weapon reticule on her HUD aimed for his head. Before she even had the chance to pull the trigger, Jake quietly came up behind Mac, grabbed both of Mac\u2019s legs, having land on his back. He then put his left leg through both of Mac\u2019s spread legs on the floor, twisted him on to his stomach and bent both of Mac\u2019s bent legs till they broke. Mac let out a loud scream of pain as his now broken legs hit the hard, cold metallic floor. \u201cMajor, would you please shut him up?\u201d asked Tori \u201cWith Pleasure commander\u201d \u201cI know what you did Mac, You pulled my family to that suicide rally, you put a gun to my wife, you strangled my baby girl, you deserve a fate worse than death.\u201d Jake said as he put his pulse rifle to Mac\u2019s head. \u201cPlease Jake, I thought I was helping them\u201d Moaned Mac \u201cHave Mercy!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve Mercy from me you backstabbing son of a bitch\u201d Jake said as he pulled the trigger, releasing a three round pulse burst into Mac\u2019s skull, literally blowing his brains on the floor. \u201cThanks Major\u201d Mark saying with a relieved sigh. Jake didn\u2019t answer \u201cYou mind telling us what happened here Major? Or shall I pull your logs?\u201d \u201c2 minutes after you left, Mac started to babble on about convergence, a higher ascension after death, and a guy named Altman. He had a gun to Mark before I knew what was happening; I dove out the way once he fired upon me\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you return fire?\u201d \u201cI wanted a full audience when I slaughtered this Man\u201d \u201cJake\u2026.\u201d Mark sounding startled at what he just heard. \u201cGive me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t pile your ass into the ground like you did Mac\u201d Tori said, sounding Furious, her hand turning into a hard fist. \u201cI know what caused all this\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. a good reason\u201d Paused Tori \u201cCome on, what\u2019s causing all this is in the Government sector, but we have to go through the transport hub to get there.\" \"Lead the way\" Chp 14: A haunting memory The squad soon entered the transport hub, where the familiar scenes of blood trails on the floors have become to them: Common. However, since along the way, they became separated and arrived on to different levels. \u201cClear one\u201d Tori said looking around the hub. \u201cClear two\u201d Jake said, with the same motion. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re here Major\u201d Tori said, holstering her rifle \u201cWe now go through the C.e.c Main facility, from there, we\u2019ll take a tram to government sector\u201d \u201cRoger that\u201d said Tori, just before turning off the video link to the troopers and turning away. \u201cMikaela, jump down and join them, ill find my own way\u201d \u201cBut Commander\u201d She said hesitatingly Tori slightly turned her head \u201cThat\u2019s an order Mikaela, I need time to think\u201d \u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d Mikaela said quietly before jumping down t o the floor with Jake and the others. They all watched in confusion as Tori walked away in different direction. \u201cWhere is she going Ma\u2019am? We need everyone here to get to the tram to government sector. \u201cShe\u2026 took another way around\u201d Mikaela said, keeping the real reason away from the troopers. \u201cCome on, facility is through the door, which leads to an elevator\u201d Jake said walking in the direction of the door/elevator. Tori entered a long, angular hallway, instead of finding bodies of either human or creature, she instead found the reason why she had been acting so strangely, coupled with Hallucinations. A brightly lit figure appeared before Tori, it was her original Commanding officer Armando. \u201cWhat are you doing Tori?\u201d Armando asked. \u201cThinking\u201d \u201cThinking about what?\u201d \u201cThinking about how you died, it was hard to watch\u201d \u201cIndeed it was, but I\u2019m nothing more than memory now\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t say that, you were more than my C.O. you were the only friend I ever had in my life\u201d \u201cThat is true, I was. Even though I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m still your friend and C.O. and I have one last order for you to carry out\u201d \u201cName it\u201d \u201cYou remember that picture Colonel Davidson took of us?\u201d \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d she asked, sounding confused. \u201cDon\u2019t forget who your friends are, no matter who they are or where they are or where they\u2019re from. Just don\u2019t forget\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t forget\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my girl\u201d \u201cYou know, I always hated it when you called me that\u201d Tori said, letting out a small laugh. \u201cI know, but just don\u2019t forget\u201d Armando said, just before fading into the blackness of the hall way His voice echoed in her mind \u201cDon\u2019t forget\u201d With the encouraging words from her former friend, Tori set off toward the Tram housing station, full sprint. Once in full sprint, a door into the housing facility opened to be full of creatures, mostly the creatures with bladed hands, she quickly grabbed her rifle, and one by one, they fell before the powerful might of the Spartan, blood spattering all over the flooring, and on her armor, but none of the creatures could ever get a single blade strike on her, for she was too quick for them. Moving with much speed and agility, in the creature\u2019s mind\u2019s they thought they were dealing with a demon hell bent on killing them all. With the final creature falling to dust from her blood red sword, the tram roundhouse was clear. Tori pressed a button on the holographic screen releasing the tram, and closing the door. Taking off toward the tram, Tori gave a great jump toward the tram, nailing a perfect missile corkscrew jump, she was able enter the tram just before the door closed. \u201cNow that was fun\u201d she said happily, as if referring to a 15 hour mountain hike she previously took on Reach. The troopers and Mikaela were actually wondering what was wrong with the tram when it reached the platform \u201cCommander?\u201d said Mikaela with much surprise \u201cHow did you get here, and how did you get the tram to move\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just say I had some time to reflect on the past.\u201d Tori said happily \u201cOkay\u201d \u201cEveryone get onboard\u201d She ordered. With everyone onboard, the tram gave jolting downward motion, as the tram moved down the track, the squad\u2019s eyes suddenly fell upon a horrific and disturbing sight, one that hasn\u2019t been seen for 3 years. \u201cMy god, that\u2019s\u2026 The ISHIMURA\u201d said Tori, with a small amount of fear in her voice. \u201cI guess we all thought wrong, they must have that ship here for a reason\u201d Said Mikaela. \u201cWell, for what ever reason that damned deathtrap is here, it doesn\u2019t matter, all that matters is getting to the government sector.\u201d A downward jolt went through the tram car, followed by a forward motion, meaning the tram went from descending the track to traveling through the track headed for the government. Chp 15: Road block \u201cGame faces people\u201d said Tori, reaching for her rifle \u201cI have a feeling that Earthgov is on to our movement and going to attempt everything in their power to stop us\u201d A beam of light came flying downward ahead of the squad\u2019s moving tram quickly moving in the direction of the track ahead. \u201cShit, looks like they got they\u2019re hands on the solar array\u201d Pointed Mark. \u201cNO SHIT!\u201d yelled Jake as he laid a hard punch to Mark shoulder. The beam of light soon cut the track and the station in half, leaving them with one option. \u201cBack up the tram, I have an idea\u201d Suggested Tori \u201cWhat we are going to do now, Commander, the track has been completely-\u201cMikaela was saying before Tori cut her off \u201cMaybe not,\u201d she shifted her sights to the nearby ISHIMURA \u201cI bet her grav tethers are still functional, we can pull the station back.\u201d \u201cBut for how long? And who know what we will encounter on that godforsaken ship\u201d bitched Franked. \u201cNONE of you are coming with me, not even you Mikaela\u201d \u201cBut Commander\u201d Mikaela said sounding surprised and rising from her seat \u201cI\u2019m ordering all of you to stay put as I get this tub\u2019s tethers online, am I clear?\u201d \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d Mikaela and the others moaned. A backwards jerking motion made the tram stop as it pulled up to the ISHIMURA\u2019s airlock, where the lone wolf in the commander was about to be released. Thoughts of disturbing and disgusting proportions entered her mind like a flood as she stepped onto the deadly metal of the cursed ISHIMURA, and with a hand motion to her helmet, Tori turned off her comms and rig link, she was truly all alone aboard the ship, alone with the ship, and her deadly secrets waiting to be unleashed. A small horizontal lift appeared before her as she walked through the door, and with a simple hand press, the lift took off in opposite end of the track. Walking through another door, Tori found herself in some kind of quarantine tunnel leading to a small elevator. Stepping onto the elevator, she pushed a button and up went the elevator, and to a very dark, and familiar place, the ISHIMURA flight deck. \u201cIm back for round two\u201d Tori said quietly. Crates, plastic tape, and lamps littered the floor leading to the flight lounge. \u201cI guess this place was getting an overhaul\u201d She thought. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s check the status of this hell hole.\u201d Walking through the same door she walked through three years ago, she checked the status of the ship. The systems affected appeared they weren\u2019t that much of a surprise to her. \u201cCentrifuge, great\u201d she said before heading back the way she came. Standing amidst the clean, taped flight lounge, Tori, in her mind could still see the blood and severed head of former Major Glen Hanson. She knelt down in the exact spot where he was killed; rubbing the floor with her hand, and remembered the first time she ever met him. Flashback 5 years \u201cLieutenant Tori 619, thanks to honor, courage, bravery and heroism in the field, and saving the life of my 13 year old niece, Chelsea, I on behalf of the UNSC, here by promote you to the rank of Commander\u201d Smiled Admiral Davidson. \u201cThank you\u201c said Tori with gratefulness in her voice. Davidson\u2019s niece Chelsea came up to Tori with a wrapped present meant for the Spartan. \u201cOh sweetie, you don\u2019t have to do this\u201d \u201cOh don\u2019t listen to him, he\u2019s always like this when I\u2019m being nice to someone under his command, here I want you to have this\u201d Tori opened the top of the present, it was her recon helmet, polished, and a new look \u201cThank you Chelsea, you must have had a lot of time on your hands\u201d She said while holding the new helmet. \u201cI added an enhanced all color night vision mode, boosted the range of your radio in the helmet, I even had some one from my class whip up an extra thick, shatter, bullet,and plasma proof green visor, for extra protection, the previous workings of the helmet can I say? Sucked\u201d Chelsea explained. \u201cShe indeed has a lot of time on her hands\u201d said a voice Tori turned her head; a decorated marine in a white uniform came forward. \u201cGlen Hanson. Major Glen Hanson, 84th ODST Platoon Bravo Company, at your service.\u201d Glen said with an outstretched hand. \u201c\u201cGood to meet you Major\u201d Tori said, shaking his hand. \u201cLikewise Ma\u2019am\u201d Said Glen. A loud siren sounded throughout the base, signaling an attack. \u201cJesus, don\u2019t these guys ever give up? Outside the base. \u201cGo go go!\u201d ordered a rebel sergeant \u201cThose UNSC pigs won\u2019t know what hit them\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said Tori Sounding very amused, coming out of cloak. The rebel troops surrounding the destroyed entrance to the mountainside base entrance raised and fired their weapons at the lone Spartan. Her shields flickered, and unmoved. She let out an amused huff. The rebel looked on, stunned. \u201cMy turn\u201d She whispered. Tori leaped from her perch just above the rebels, into the brightness of the sunlight and onto the ground, she rose as if possessed, the rebels continued the onslaught, but to no avail. The 45 rebel personnel fell before the might of the female, while one final rebel tried to run away. \u201cYou boys definitely don\u2019t know how to show a girl a good time\u201d \u201cIt will be a good time when the UNSC has fallen and Rebels standing over pathetic corpses.\u201d \u201cOh well, time for you to sleep\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d said the scared rebel, who nearly wet himself. Breaking his arm, Tori hoisted the rebel onto her shoulders, gave him an upward thrust, just before both feet of the rebel hit the ground, She gave him a high knee to the bottom of his jaw, knocking him unconscious. \u201cSweet dreams dickhead\u201d Tori said before putting a bullet to the back of his head.Logan Taylor  \"Well. Looks like things just got a bit more interesting.\" -Logan upon seeing the Tormenter Logan Taylor is a high-ranking military officer. He is the main protagonist of Dead Space: Retribution.Early Life  \ufeffLogan was born to Elizabeth and Peter Taylor on June 14, 2492. With his father being in the military, and his mother a medic onboard the USG Ishimura, he was taken in by his Aunt Marie and her husband, Dale. When Logan turned 7, he got news that his father had died during a firefight on another planet. Logan didn't feel sad due to the fact that he never knew his father. His mother however would frequently call Logan and sometimes visit if possible.Career  \ufeffEDF Military  At 16 years, Logan decided to follow in his father's footsteps and join the EDF Military. At first he trained in smaller drills due to him being young, but his skill was noticed by even the best in the military. Logan quickly went on to train with the normal squads, who had laughed at the idea of a kid being in a military squadron. Logan showed them his skills in combat against the best of the best, and proved to be masterful in hand-to-hand and firearm combat against even the veterans. Logan was eventually assigned to the Angel Special Operations Unit, a group of the most elite marines in the entire EDF Military.The Sprawl  Logan served and lived aboard the Sprawl as added security to the task force aboard the station, serving with them for a few months.\u00a0He was present during the Sprawl incident, during which he first encountered the Necromorphs and the Marker, and in turn was imprinted with the Marker codes during the Convergence Event.Adonis IX  After the Sprawl Incident, Logan was captured by EarthGov forces still trying to replicate Markers for their own use. They figured that the reason why Isaac's Marker was \"flawed\" was because of his declining mental state, and that someone not suffering from dementia could make a \"perfect Marker\". Logan eventually breaks out and flees to Adonis IX, where he finds Marker test labs, as well as a dormant Brethren Moon (unbenownst to him at the time). He stayed in order to find out more about the Markers and their purposes so as to put a stop to them.Return to Earth  \ufeffAppearance  Logan is around 5'10\" in height, and weighs 123 lbs. He has hazel eyes and white hair, due to a genetic birth defect.Personality  \ufeffLogan is a caring person, and is an extremely loyal friend, easily willing to give his life for the sake of others. He is also a fierce fighter when need be. He is highly intelligent, and can figure out most problems in a practical way. The problems he can't, he solves in a more unpractical way. Despite his intelligence, he is sometimes impulsive and will sometimes act without thinking. Logan posesses a high sense of surrounding and intuition, and his reflexes are incredibly fast.Abilities  \ufeffLogan is extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat, as he had learned most forms of martial arts from multiple master on Earth. He is incredibly fast an agile, and also strong for his age and size. He is a master in firearms and firearm combat. He specialized mainly with assault rifles and machine guns, but he is also skilled with handguns and sniper rifles. During events on the Sprawl, as a result of Logan being so close to the Marker during the Convergence Event, Marker blueprints were imprinted into his mind, resulting in Logan being the only person other than Isaac able to create or destroy Markers, however he doesn't suffer from the dementia Isaac does, meaning his sanity will remain intact, however, creating or destroying Markers can take a toll on him, resulting in anywhere from minutes being taken from his lifespan to outright killing him, so there is\u00a0still\u00a0a big risk involved. Logan has some engineering skill due to some of his friends being engineers and teaching him certain things, such as how to hack and build things. He also learned medical skills from Rachel, since her mother was a CEC Medic.Equipment  Logan's main RIG is the MPMR-123 Adaptive RIG,\u00a0which he custom made to his specifications.\u00a0Logan also uses an arsenal of weapons. He uses a heavily customized Pulse Rifle, which he named the Surge Rifle, and also uses a custom Seeker Rifle. During the Necromorph outbreak on the Ishimura, Logan picked up a Plasma Cutter, and a Ripper, which he customized of course. All these weapons have increased damage, faster firerate, and improved accuracy. The most peculiar weapons in his arsenal however are two relics from the past. Twin Colt M1911s he picked up from an antique collector, which he customized heavily. He named the right, silver plated one 'Freedom' and the left black plated one 'Justice'. He usually only carries his Pulse Rifle as well as Freedom and Justice while on the job.Trivia Recent posts DS2117 Welcome  Hi, welcome to Dead Space Fanon Wiki!

Please tell me what you think of it and feel free to give me any advice, just please be nice about it. I hope you enjoy.\u00a0:DChapter One  A video screen blurs then clears, showing a blood stained room with a slightly twitching body of a strange creature on the floor. A boy, a teenager, wearing a Security R.I.G. with the helmet down, sits in a chair in front of the camera, dropping a white mining tool on the ground. He is shaking, his black hair stained with blood, and his right eye bleeding profusely, but his only blue eye was dull, as if losing life. The look on his face was full with fear and regret. His breathing heavy. \"I send this video hoping for anyone to know what really happened here on the Sprawl.\" He stopped, slightly crying, \"I know my friends have escaped the...horrors here. But I stayed behind to record this video.\" The body on the ground twitches violently, and makes a loud, gurgling noise. The boy jumps in his chair, grabs the tool he dropped earlier, and aims it at the body. The body, however, stops twitching all together. The boy sighs heavily, then cries quietly. \"I can't believe I had to kill him.\" He cries louder, then, after taking deep breathes, he sits back in the chair, \"my name is Ken Richardson, son of Bruce Richardson. And I after I tell you my story, I will not see tomorrow.\"Chapter Two  \"...testing for the new supersonic powered mining tool will begin next week. If this test is successful, we will revolutionize modern mining technology!\" The room filled with clapping. Ken sat in the back of the room, in a corner. His father was presenting a new tool he and his team were developing. They were calling it IJ-591 Supersonic Ore-Cracker prototype. Ken's father was a well respected systems technician of Timson Tools. But he was reassigned to a tool developing team within the company after he presented this supersonic tool idea to the president of Timson Tools. His father continued with his speech, talking about the safety features of the tool. And how certain sound frequencies could do tremendous damage to a potential mineral-rich asteroids, even more so than the Javelin Gun. Ken smiled. Ken's mother left them, but she still lives on the Sprawl. Ken still sees her every once in a while, but she doesn't care about him; mainly because Ken has had trouble staying out of trouble. He skips school, paints graffiti on the walls of the Unitology Church - where he is now forbidden to enter - and several other violations. His father, however, sees that Ken has the potential to become an engineer, so he tries to teach Ken as much as he can, and also tries to keep Ken out of trouble. \"Thus concludes this meeting,\" said Kens' father. Everyone in the boardroom began shuffling their papers and started to leave. Ken stood up and walked to his father,\" that was a great speech, dad. Everyone looked impressed with the tool.\" His father smiled and patted Ken's shoulder,\" thanks Ken. Honestly, I thought I lost everyone's interest.\" He chuckled. \"Lets go home. Could you grab the tool, Ken?\" Ken nodded and retrieved the tool. As soon as he grabbed the tool, Ken clutched his head, dropping the tool. \"Ken?!\" Ken collapsed on the ground, screaming. He then began mumbling. His father grabbed him, \"Ken! Snap out of it!\" Ken looked at his father, dazed. \"Dad? Wha...what happened?\" Ken stood up, but almost fell over. His father caught him. \"Ken, what was that about?\" \"I-I don't know.\" Ken's father thought for a moment, \"it sounds like whats been affecting many of the other citizens on the Sprawl lately. Let's get you to the hospital.\"Chapter Three  Bruce helped Ken to the tram station, taking Ken to the hospital. They arrived and waited for the tram to arrive. Ken, are you alright to walk,\" Bruce asked. Ken nodded, and his father let him go. Ken stood normally, as if nothing happened. Then a voice was heard from the crowd. \"Hey, Ken!\" Ken looked and saw his girlfriend, Lily. She walked closer to Ken, but saw Bruce. \"Oh, is Ken in trouble again, Mr.Richardson?\" Ken knew what that meant. Most of the time his father was with him, it meant Ken was in some type of trouble. Mr. Richardson shook his head,\" no. Something happened, and I'm taking Ken to the hospital.\" Suddenly, Mr. Richardson's R.I.G. started beeping. A R.I.G.link opened, showing Hans Tiedemann. \"Ah, Mr. Richardson. I'm glad I got a hold of you,\" Tiedemann began, \"I heard you have developed a tool that uses supersonic technology. I'm quite interested in this. I would request that you come to the Transport Hub immediately. I will have some of my men escort you to my office, so we can discuss on a project, based on your discovery.\" Ken knew what Tiedemann had in mind. He wanted to have his father use the same technology for government purposes; to make weapons. Before Mr. Richardson could refuse the offer, Tiedemann disconnected. \"Fuck,\" Mr. Richardson muttered. \"Lily, could you make sure Ken to the hospital safely for me? I don't think that was a suggestion.\" \"Of course, Mr. Richardson.\" Mr. Richardson nodded a thanks, then looked to Ken,\" Ken, reminder when I did those special adjustments to both our R.I.G.s?\" Ken nodded. He was about six years old. What the adjustments did was that whenever Ken and Mr. Richardson were separated, or Mr. Richardson had to leave suddenly for a unknown reason or a unknown period of time, both of R.I.G.s would ping when they are within a certain distance. Mr. Richardson turned to go to the Transport Hub. The Tram arrived, and Lily and Ken sat inside. Lily had a worried look on her face. \"Ken, what happened?\" \"I don't know. I was getting dad's tool for him when...\" Thats when he realized he still had the tool. \"Shit! I forgot to give this back to dad! He knew I still had it.\" Ken thought, then realized, that maybe he didn't want Tiedemann to reverse engineer his invention. He sighed and put it on the inside of his jacket. The tram suddenly came to a complete stop, causing several people, including Lily, to yell out in surpirse. The lights flickered, then went dark. \"What was that?\" It was quiet. The lights powered on, and the tram continued on its path. \"Lily, are you ok?\" Lily nodded, \" we should get off at the next stop though.\" Ken agreed, \"good idea. And my apartment is on the next stop. I have several things there that we can use in case of a complete blackout.\"Chapter Four  The tram finally arrived at the next station, where Ken and Lily exited to reach Ken's apartment. \"So, Lily,\" Ken began, as they walked down the corridors, \" why were you at the tram station back there?\" \"I was on my way to visit my mother at the hospital actually,\" she replied, in a concerned tone. Lily's mother has been having health problems lately, as Lily put it. But Ken saw Lily's mother when he visited, er, snuck into the hospital one day; Lily's mother was in the asylum. Lily's mother was in a straight jacket, muttering about symbols, the Marker, and, most disturbing of all, monsters. Ken didn't tell Lily this, only for her safety. Ken nodded. When they turned the corner, Ken recognized it. \"We're almost there.\" He checked the door numbers, then found his room. He took out his keycard and slid it through the scanner. The door opened. There was someone else inside, Kens' roommate. The young man had dark brown hair and teal eyes. He was taller than Ken, but only by three inches. He turned to face Ken,\" hey Ken. I was starting to worry about you.\" Ken went through the apartment searching for his emergency supplies. \"Jason, where is my stuff?\" \"I had to move it into your closet. Because that is my closet,\" Jason replied, with a obnoxious look on his face. Jason has been, ever since he moved in, a spoiled brat, thinking he owns the place, when Ken is the one who is paying most of the bills. \"Jason, now's not the-\" The lights when out, and Lily squeaked. The lights flickered, and resumed on. \"Lily, get into your R.I.G. suit\" Lily nodded, and rushed into Kens room. \"Hey! Whats going on here,\" Jason asked angrily. Ken sighed,\" you know how most of my hunches have been right?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Then trust me and get into your R.I.G. suit now. I have a bad feeling about this.\"Chapter Five  Ken finished putting on his Security R.I.G., which is a modified version of the standard issues. This Security R.I.G. was dull green, with brown under-armor, with four red shields; one on each shoulder, one on left forehead, and one on the R.I.G. meter. Lily's R.I.G. was an old R.I.G., the Vintage Suit. She could afford it because her grandfather left for her a small fortune. Jason's R.I.G. was a suit he made himself, what he calls a Hacker R.I.G., which leaves the back of his head exposed, along with his hands. The mask was painted with a Marker on it: as Jason was a Unitologist, as much to Ken's disgust. Jason was Invested ranked. \"Come on, lets go get my dad,\" Ken stated, opening the door and closing his helmet. \"Who died and made you leader,\" Jason yelled, \"I should be the leader!\" \"Do you know how to quickly navigate through the Sprawl? Do you know all the vent pathways?\" Jason looked at Ken angrily, \"you know I don't, since I'm not a convicted trouble maker.\" Before Ken could punch Jason in his face, Lily stepped between Ken and Jason,\" stop this you two! Quit acting like children!\" Ken sighed, knowing she was right. \"Besides, marker-head, I'm the only one with a make-shift weapon.\" Ken holds up the Prototype tool to show it. \"Fine, lead the way, oh great leader,\" Jason replied, saying the last part with sarcasm. Ken moved ahead, followed by Lily, then Jason. \"Where is your father anyway?\" \"He went to the Transport Hub, so he could be escorted to Tiedemann's office. We should hurry.\" The group picked up the pace, stopping only to wait for doors to open. They then came to an elevator, and while waiting for the elevator to arrive, Lily asked Ken in a worried voice,\" Ken, you said that you had a feeling that something bad is about to happen. What's going to happen Ken?\" \"I-I don't know Lil-\" Ken stopped, and again clutched his head, \"AHH!!\" He collapsed. Jason and Lily tired to help him up, but Ken swung his arm wildly and violently. \"Get away from me,\" Ken yelled, seeing two monsters in front of him. Jason, irritated, pressed a button so Ken's helmet would fold down, and smacked him across the face. Lily gasped, and Ken sat there, stunned. Ken looked at Jason, and nodded,\" thanks.\" \"Get up, leader, our elevator has arrived,\" Jason replied, and the elevator stopped at their floor, but the door didn't open. \"What the fuck? Open Goddammit!\" Lily gripped Jason's shoulder, \"relax! Power might be faulty, give it a minute.\" And sure enough, the door opened. The group stared into the elevator for a minute,\" what the fuck happened here?\" The elevator was covered in blood, and the blood trail led up the wall, and into a broken vent. Someone was in that elevator, and something slaughtered the person. A distant growl came from the broken vent. Ken looked at Jason and Lily, \"I think we should go to a security station, and grab some actual weapons.\"Chapter Six  The group entered the elevator, each keeping a cautious eye on the vents above them. They reached the bottom floor, and the door opened just as a loud explosion was heard. Ken looked around the corner, but reared back, almost being run over by fleeing civilians. The sound of something being kicked around is heard. Ken looked again, it was a Plasma Cutter. He waited for the civilians to go by, or at least for them to kick the Cutter closer. Fortunately, the mob of people kicked it closer, and Ken grabbed it. He handed it to Lily,\" know how to use one of these?\" Lily nodded. She took it. Jason, mad that he now doesn't have a weapon was about to yell at Ken, but several growls stopped him. Kim looked around the corner again, just to see a heavily maimed body, with blades coming out of its hands and two small arms protruding for its stomach, stands over him. And it was poised to strike. Ken was frozen in fear. He knew this person. It was Chris, a old childhood friend of his. Lily looked to see what was wrong, then pulled Ken out of the way of the things blades, just in time. Ken, now focused, pulled out the tool and shot at the thing twice. Two small, white darts attached to the creature, on on the shoulder, and one on it head. Ken then used the alt. fire, a low volume, but high pitched noise was heard, and the thing was violently shaking. The shaking ripped the things arm off, and the thing fell, dead. \"What the fuck was that thing,\" exclaimed Ken. He looked at Lily, who shook her head. Then at Jason, who, for once, was silent. \"Come on, lets keep moving.\" The group went into the actual lobby, dead bodies littered the floor. And the security gate was down. Before they could turn back, the other gate slammed shut. \"Fuck. We need a way out.\" Jason banged on the gate, in a futile attempt to break it down. Lily looked at Ken. \"Any ideas?\" Ken looked up. \"There,\" he pointed to the second story floor. \"We can climb up there.\" Both Lily and Jason nodded. Jason crutched down, and Ken placed a foot in Jason's hands, and was thrown up into the air. Ken just barely caught the railing, and climbed up. He hooked his feet to the railing and lowered himself down, reaching for Jason's hand. Jason jumped and grabbed Ken's hand, and climbed up. \"Ok Lily, come on.\" A loud roar was heard, coming from one of the apartments on the second floor. \"Hurry up Lily,\" Jason yelled. Lily backed up, and started to run, she jumped and grabbed Ken's hand. Jason grabbed Ken's feet, to anchor him down. Lily slowly climbed up, and grabbed the railing. \"Help me up! The blood is starting to rush to my head,\" Ken complained. Jason grabbed Ken's feet while Lily watched his back. The roar was heard again, coming closer. Jason just had Ken over the railing when another creature, same as before, crashed through a nearby apartment door. Lily aimed and fired four shots into the body, and no affect. \"That's not possible,\" yelled Lily. The thing growled in annoyance, and charged. Panicked, Lily aimed for the things leg, which was shot off in two shots. The thing fell, but kept coming. Jason ran over to it and stomped the creatures head. \"DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKER!\" The thing died, but Jason wasn't taking any chances. He stomped until his calve was covered in blood. Ken stood. \"Lily, you ok?\" Lily nodded. \"Check your ammo, Lily.\" She did, and shook her head. \"I have four shots left. We need to find more ammo.\" Ken nodded. Then looked at Jason, was was walking back, making a bloody trail. \"I need a weapon,\" Jason said, with a bit of fear in his voice. \"Come on,\" Ken said, looking around,\" we need to keep moving.\" The group walked down the corridor and opened the door that was at the end of it. Behind it was a Store. \"Finally,\" Jason exclaimed, running up to it. \"Jason, none of us have any money. We can't-\" \"Who said anything about buying,\" Jason replied. He tore off a panel just outside the Store, and began fiddling with wires. \"I'm gonna hack it, and make it give us free things.\" Several sparks came from the wires. Then a bright flash. \"There.\" Jason said, activating the store, them coming out with a Javelin Gun. \"Here Lily,\" Jason said, tossing her a few Plasma Energies. Lily caught them, and reloaded her Plasma Cutter. \"There's a problem which hacking Stores, however,\" Jason began, then the Store completely shut itself down,\" no one can use this Store anymore.\" Ken shook his head. \"No need. No one is heading for the stores anyway. They'd all be heading for ships; trying to get the hell off The Sprawl.\" Rattling was heard, coming from the vent overhead. Then is was silent. Lily aimed her Cutter at the vent. \"What was that?\" Suddenly, a R.I.G. link opened on Ken's R.I.G., the video showed something strange. It showed them- Lily, Jason and Ken- being watched through the vent. Something growled on the video, and from the vent. Lily panicked and shot at the vent. Banging was heard, and the R.I.G. link disconnected. The banging faded. \"We're being stalked,\" Jason said, \"and it can send R.I.G. logs.\"Chapter Seven  The group found a small apartment room that had only one vent inside, and decided to take a rest inside. The room's door was already in pieces, with the pieces scattered on the inside of the room. The bed was covered in blood, and a severed leg was all that remained on the bed. Ken sat down, as Lily watched the vent and Jason watched the doorway. Ken looked at the ammo count for his father's tool, it had only six shots left. He couldn't reload. All the access ammo was at Timson Tools, in his father's office. He sighed and stood up. \"I'm gonna run out of ammo soon,\" he told Jason and Lily, \"we'll have to find a another store.\" \"Why didn't you tell me that when I was hacking that store,\" Jason asked, a bit annoyed. \"Jason relax. We have to stay calm,\" Lily said. \"And be quiet, there could be more of those things around here,\" Ken said in a whisper. Faded growls were heard from a few close by apartments. \"Lets move.\" After an hour, the group has traveled through several corridors, all having blood splattered along the walls, floors and, most disturbing of all, the ceiling. A roar was heard, and a creature running on it's hands came charging around the corner. The creature leaped at Lily, pinning her to the floor. \"AH! Get this fucking thing off me!\" Ken kicked the thing off, and Jason shot a javelin at it, spearing it to the wall. The creature roared in pain and squirmed around trying to get free, and started lashing its bladed tail around at a futile attempt of attacking Ken, who was standing the closest to it. \"Oh my god,\" Lily gasped, sitting up,\" I-I know him! Thats my cousin!\" \"What,\" Jason asked. \"You mean, these things are human?\" Ken shook his head,\" used to be human. Whatever they are now, they don't die easily. Come on, let's keep moving.\" As Ken and Lily turned to leave, Jason stared at the thrashing creature. \"This is what Unitology promises? Fuck them.\" He aimed and shot the tail, killing the creature. He then caught up with Ken and Lily.Chapter Eight  The group arrived at the tram station, only to find that it was already leaving. Ken saw only a glimpse of who was inside. It was a engineer; Ken could tell because he saw the engineering R.I.G. the man was wearing. \"Shit, the tram left already,\" Jason yelled angrily. \"Jason, shut up,\" Ken yelled back. Before the argument could continue, a blood chilling roar came from one of the tram tunnels. A monster emerged from the dark tunnel. The legs were horridly lacerated, the right arm was a limbless corpse. The left arm had four bone blades on the side. It roared, and charged at Jason. Ken pushed Jason out of the way just in the nick of time. Lily began shooting the thing's legs, but it had little effect. The monster turned and spat a strange bile, but missed Lily. Lily looked at where the bile hit; nothing. No sizzling, no fumes. Nothing. She then looked back at the monster, which seemed to be listening for any sounds. Jason got up and began firing his Javelin Gun at the creatures shoulder. The monster screamed and charged at Jason, who dodged. Ken watched helplessly. He couldn't do anything, and if he did, he wouldn't be any help if something worse appeared. Ken then noticed something, the monster had no eyes. \"It attacks by listening for sounds,\" Ken said quietly. He waved to Jason and Lily, and gestured them to stand still. Lily nodded, but Jason shook his head, but stood still, thinking they're about to get killed anyway. The creature, much to everyones surprise, stopped thrashing around and began walking carefully, now relying on touch to find them. Ken picked up a piece of shattered glass and threw it near the entrance the tram tunnel. The creature snapped its head toward the direction and stomped to where the glass landed. Lily saw what Zen was doing, and since she had a better angle to the inside of the tram tunnel, she grabbed a small rock and threw inside the tunnel, making an echo throughout the dark tunnel. The monster roared and charged down the tunnel. The group waited for the sound of stomping to end. Once it did, they all sighed in relief. Jason reloaded his weapon. \"That was a close call,\" Jason said. \"How'd you figure that out Ken?\" \"It never focused on just attacking one of us, just the one who was making the most noise.\" Roars of other creature where coming closer. \"We gotta keep moving. Screw getting more ammo, let's just get off the Sprawl.\"Chapter Nine  With the tram gone, Jason started kicking the luggage around angrily. \"Goddammit!\" Ken, as Jason continued to curse and abuse the suitcases, was trying to find another way to the shuttle. He saw three options: Either hold out and wait for another tram, go back the way they came, or walk down the dark tram tunnel. With these monsters running around, that wasn't a good option. Suddenly, a R.I.G. log opened on Ken's, Lily's, and Jason's R.I.G. It showed the door that lead to the room that they were in. \"What the fuck,\" Jason said, annoyed. Then the view changed, to show monsters roaring and gurgling. \"Oh no,\" Lily exclaimed, horrorified. \"They can't open doors right?\" \"I don't think s-\" the video then showed the door, and two sets of clawed hands start to hack the panel, which then the video feed cuts out. \"Fuck, we need to go, now!\" \"Where to, genius!? The dark tunnel?\" \"Look! We could either sit and argue, or run and get a head start,\" Ken yelled back. \"Lily, lets go!\" Ken then runs down the tunnel opposite to the one the beast ran down. \"Fuck!\" Jason ran after them, just as the door opens, unleashing the horde of mangled, mutated bodies after them. The horde ran down the tunnel after them, gurgling and screaming at them. The trio could only see the silhouette's of the monsters. Lily, in front of everyone, led the way with the flashlight from her Plasma Cutter. She suddenly looked to the side of the tunnel, and saw an open door. \"Look! A way out!\" \"Inside, hurry,\" Ken yelled. The tunnel becomes more illuminated. \"Oh no. A tram's coming!\" The light got closer, and it didn't seem like they'd make it. \"BOOK IT!\" Lily leaps through the door, with Jason right behind her. Ken, just five feet from the door, sees the front of the tram. \"Hurry Ken,\" Lily screams, terrified and worried. Ken leaps. The tram rushs past the door, the sounds of bodies splattering against the metal hull of the tram fills the air. Then silence, and darkness.Chapter Ten  Ken shuts the door, and yanks some wires out of the panel in order to keep it locked. He heart is pumping loudly, he almost got hit by a tram, with monsters that were mutated from cropses behind them. He saw his life flash in front of him. But he made it. Jason stood by the other doorway, standing guard as Ken and Lily caught their breath. Lily smiled, and jokingly said, \"worst date ever.\" \"Yeah, and hopefully not the last,\" Ken replied. \"You two love birds need a minute alone,\" Jason asked. Ken and Lily shook their heads, and stood up. Ken looked around the room, using the flash light from his fathers prototype. And he saw something. An out dated PFM-100 Hydrazine Torch Flamethrower. It was better than what he had, and he could use it to help conserve what little ammo everyone had. Ken picks it up, and clips the other tool to his side. \"Found something useful.\" \"Just watch where you point that thing when you pull the trigger,\" Jason snorted. \"Come on, we should get moving.\" After leaving the room, the group walked quickly and quietly through the halls. Jason, who was in the lead, stopped. \"Why did you stop,\" Lily asked. \"Dead end,\" Jason sighed,\" unless you want to go through a maintenance vent.\" He steps aside to show an open vent, with a trail of blood leading to it. \"Those things use the vents. We shouldn't use them,\" Ken replied. \"We need to find another way.\" \"There isn't another way! The halls only led to here,\" Jason said. \"We have to use the vent, or we're sitting ducks!\" Lily stood between them, then looks at Ken,\" he's right. I don't like it either, but it's the only way out.\" \"Unless you want to go back through the tram tunnels,\" Jason laughed. Ken growled. He hated it when Jason was right. Because when Jason was right, he rubs it in his face. \"Fine. You go first, the Lily, and I'll cover our rear.\" Jason climbs into the vent, stopping at the first crossway. Then Lily climbs in. Ken, susicious of how quiet it has been, looks around the room with the flashlight on the flamethrower. He saw a flash of eyes, but not like the monsters from before. It screamed, and ran after him like a raptor. Ken jumps in the vent, and fires his flame thrower at the thing. \"GO! GO!\" Jason and Lily hurried down the vents, going as fast as they can, and Ken following behind. \"Take the next right, It should take us in the general direction to the shuttles!\" Jason turns, and Lily looks down the vent before the turn, and sees another monster with a bladed tail. She shoots at it, but with such tight quarters, has difficulty keeping her aim steady. The creature roars and rushes her. She shoots, severing an arm. It growls in pain and anger, and crawls toward her. \"MOVE,\" Ken yells. Lily lunges down the vent Jason went, and Ken blasts the thing with the flamethrower. The monster quirms as it burns, then lays still, dead. Ken rushes down the vent, and see the opening Jason and Lily went through. Ken climbs out of the vent. \"Ken, you might not want to make a lot of noise,\" Lily said quietly. \"Why,\" Ken asked before looking out the large window infront of them. Behind it, more than twenty of the creatures were draging bodies to the center of the room. \"What are they doing,\" Lily asked, horrified. \"I don't know,\" Jason said, \"but I don't want to stick around to find out. Come on.\" He walks out a door, leading away from the window, with Lily and Ken behind him.Chapter Eleven  Rounding a corner, the group finds a EarthGov security office. \"Finally,\" Jason exclaimed, \"maybe we can find some real weapons.\" \"Yeah,\" Ken said, \"or maybe a working shuttle.\" The three advance, finding bloody bodies of both the monsters and the security force dead on the ground. \"Oh my god,\" Lily gasped, looking at the blood and guts on the ground. She folded down her helmet, and puked off to the side. Ken went to her side. \"You ok,\" Ken asked, concerned. He knows how she feels. He's almost thrown up several times already, but fought to hold it down. \"Yeah, it's just that... How did this happen?\" \"I don't know\" Ken replied, a bit of fear in his voice. He then turned to shut the door. Jason, on the other hand, understood what was happening. After piecing everything that he heard: The teachings of Unitology, about transcending death; the rumors of people going crazy from hearing voices, muttering about the Marker and monsters. Somehow, the Marker, or some crazy zealots, is responsible for all this. \"We need to get off The Sprawl.\" Ken nodded, \"let's look for a working shuttle, or at least some Pulse Rifles.\" They looked at the bodies of the officers. Only one had a Pulse Rifle next to him. \"Seems that others already raided the office.\" \"Yeah,\" Lily said. \"I'll go in the back and see if I can find a shuttle.\" She goes to the back of the docking bay. Ken starts searching the cabinets for any ammo or, if he's lucky, another Pulse Rifle. Jason, while everyone was searching, stood guard at the door, just to be safe. Lily comes running back. \"There's a gunship here!\" \"Really,\" Jason asked, feeling hopeful. \"Yeah,\" Lily replied, feeling pround of herself. \"It needs to fuel up, but it's in working condition!\" Ken smiles. Finally, they can get away from this nightmare. \"Alright, let's get this fueled up and-\" He's cut off. His R.I.G. made a pinging noise. \"What was that,\" Jason asked, annoyed. \"My dad's close by,\" Ken exclaimed. He opened a vid to his dad, but got only static. \"Dad? Dad!\" A fuzzy voice was heard, \"Ken? I-is it really you?\" Ken almost cried. Not only out of joy, but also because he would have lost his only family. \"Yes dad. Where are you?\" A grunt of pain was heard, \"I don't know. I think I'm by the school.\" \"That's a few floors down from where we're at. Dad, find a place to hide, I'm coming to get you!\" Ken ended the vid, and set his locator to his fathers R.I.G. \"Are you crazy!? We just found a working shuttle, and you want us to leave it to find your father,\" Jason yelled. \"No,\" Ken replied. \"Lily, how long do you think it'll take to refuel the gunship?\" Lily hesiated, but reply, \"maybe twenty or thirty minutes.\" \"Alright,\" Ken nodded, and looked at Jason, \"if I'm not back by the time the ship's refueled, leave me.\" \"Ken, no. I'm not leaving you,\" Lily cried. \"Ken... It could be a trap,\" Jason said sadly. \"No, I'm not leaving my father to die! He saw me as his son! After all the trouble I've caused, he still saw some potential. And if it is a trap, I'll fight every monster to my last breath to get my father out of here!\" Ken turned to Lily and hugged her,\" I'm sorry, back I'm going alone. And I don't want you to worry about me. All I care about is that you get away from this nightmare.\" Lily, tears streaming down her face, shook her head,\" n-no. Ken, I love you. I'm not going to let you die here.\" \"I know, but I don't want you to die because of me. But I'll make it back before the gunship's refueled. I promise,\" Ken said, giving her a kiss on the forehead. He then picks up the Pulse Rifle and hands Jason the flamethrower,\" barricade everything, and lock the door when I leave.\" Jason nodded, \" I knew you were a crazy son of a bitch. But... Now you're sucidial.\" Ken smirks,\" and you were a stubborn bastard. So, I know you won't let any of those things get through the door.\" He reloads the rifle, opens the door, and walks outside. \"Remember,\" Jason started,\" thirty minutes.\" Ken gave him a thumbs up, and Jason shuts the door behind him.Chapter Twelve  Ken ran down the hall and reaches an elevator. \"I will make it back in time,\" he whispered to himself. The elevator opened up, Ken entered and pressed for the floor the school is on. The started to close, but the tracks for the door started to spark, making a loud grating noise, and the doors stopped. \"Fuck!\" Ken ripped off a panel and began to rewire the elevator. A roar was heard. Ken looked and it was another one of those monsters that he, Lily and Jason encoutered on the tram station. \"Oh no,\" his eyes were wide, and he hurried to rewire the elevator. The monster screamed and charged toward Ken. Ken's heart was racing. The pounding that the creature monster made as it was charging was distracting him. Ken put two wires together making sparks fly, and the door slamed shut just as the creatures head was past the doorway. The monster roared in annoyance and spat at Ken before the door decapiated the beast. Ken breathed a heavy sigh. \"Too close.\" Ken looked at the head, and kicked it lightly, and the head violently screamed. \"Fuck!\" Ken jumped in surprise, stomping the head. The head was silent. \"Scared the shit out of me.\" The door opened to show the hall to the elementary school, bodies of dead monsters and limbs cluttering the floor. \"Looks like someone was here.\" Ken looked around for ammo. He moved a body with the front of its chest melted away and found a some credits. \"What luck!\" He grabs the credit chip but a nearby body jumped up and lunged at Ken. \"Gauh,\" ken yelled, the thing tackling him to the ground. the monster was missing an arm. It growled, and swung at Ken. He rolled away from the attack, and pulled the trigger on the Pulse Rifle. It didn't take long for the creature to fall over dead. Ken, panting heavily, grabbed the credits and went to the store that was right next to the elevator he came from, restocked on some ammo for the Pulse Rifle, and bought a couple small packs. \"It's not much, but'll do,\" he said, using one for now. He turned around and headed for the blood stained door of the school. \"I hope the all the children were evacuated,\" he said, passing through the door after it opened.Maxxthewolf  Hi, I'm Maxxthewolf, or Maxxy for short, and I'm a fellow Dead Space fan who just wants to find out more about it, so, enjoy my profile! 1. The Bioshock and Dead Space series are my favorite games. 2. Wonders who would win, Isacc Clarke or Subject Delta? 3. Sometimes wishes he could eliminate his teachers with a Plasma Cutter. 4. Got his name from going to the max on video games and loving wolfs. 5. I have five favorite suits, the Advanced Hazard Engineer RIG, the Elite Engineering RIG, the Advanced Unitologist RIG, the Scorpion Level Engineering RIG, and the Triage Security RIG. 6. My all time favorite weapon is the Plasma cutter, with the Line gun in second place and the Rivet Gun in third. 7. My favorite Necromorph happens to be the head part of the Divider, considering it can kill Isacc Clarke by cutting off his head and replacing his original head with it's own, hijacking his body. 8. My favorite Death Scene is when Isacc is killed by the female Tripod. 9. My favorite character is Isacc Clarke, considering he's in his 40's and he can still kick Necromorph butt. 10. I love trying to invent new characters for the Bioshock Wiki and the Dead Space wiki.Images I've Added To The Wiki  WARNING!: Violence, Blood and Gore, Nudity, Sexual Themes, and possibly Ideologically Sensitive Material are present.

Thanks for your edit to the User blog:Spartan describer243 page. Please leave a message on my talk page if I can help with anything! -- Subtank (Talk) 02:28, April 29, 2011The Spartans.  Hi. I am also a major fan of halo as well as DS. Your story has a very good concept and the current version isnt bad but it seems more like a plan for it. You need to put more detail in and expand it more with longer chapters, imagery and interesting dialogue. U are doing something no one has done before which means you have a fair but of freedom. I found the storyline was like Pelican- Instant travelt to DS-Ishimura which isn;t the best way. It gets to the point but has no suspense. U should explore the planet, have the mysterious pedestal maybe, the hivemind? The Ishimura's discovery should be explored, have them maybe comb the colonies archives and find out what happened, they should also realise early on they arent in their univrse anymore, maybe find out about EarthGov and Earths current situation and the CEC and the planet crackers. Just some ideas for you but ignore them if you want, it's just to add adventure and suspense. Your FriendPowerSeeker 14:36, May 1, 2011 (UTC) Well, i dont want to gie out any spoilers in the stroy right now, by i will say that the spartans, O.D.S.Ts and Jahea, will eventually go down to Aegis Seven, not saying when, but they will go there, and i will try and be more in detail of whats going on, on what the scenery is like, on i hope the finished stroy (with your help) will be the best crossover story. And as far as Earthgov goes, those dickheads will come in a different version of this story when this one is finished, and who knows, i might throw some necromorph concepts, you never know. And im always up for sum new ideas. Spartan describer243 16:23, May 1, 2011 (UTC) I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but if you need help, try reading my first story, Betrayal. I have a lot of filler and detail implanted into it and it might give you a leg up. What I was suggesting was re doing the story by adding in the detail and imagery to build the suspense of arriving on the Ishimura instead of them going there straight away.Just a suggestion.PowerSeeker 16:44, May 1, 2011 (UTC) You know what, thats what i felt that was missing from my story, detail and imagery, im going to try my best at it, but like it said at top of the story page, im just an amatuer. Spartan describer243 16:59, May 1, 2011 (UTC) I am also an amateur at fanon but I like to think my stories are good. Message me if u need me to help u again PowerSeeker 19:17, May 1, 2011 (UTC) Believe me i will, and get ready to read a little more of chapter seven, i threw in a character from the DS game, ull find it intersting Spartan describer243 19:23, May 1, 2011 (UTC) Hiya!!!

Please leave a message on my talk page if I can help with anything! -- Haegemonia (Talk) 21:48, April 4, 2011Message  Dude, thank you for all of your help. You really know how to get an idea spread! If it weren't for you, this entire blog would still be empty and barren. Thank you, once again, for your great assistance. Captain Bradman 20:15, April 5, 2011 (UTC) Hey, thank you for your consideration and I understand. I have been reviewing the rules and settings. Scorpio 6, you'll never guess, was actually the name of wher eI placed the Marker of Treachery all along. This marker, can reallly get people demented, because it can trick them into betraying others among them, or believing that others will betray them. I really consider it one of the strongest Markers, rivaled only by the White Marker of Desire and the Great Marker of Infectology. Thor Vadamus 23:29, April 14, 2011 (UTC)Agrivated? Really?  Now, look, I've posted my chapter in the RP section titled Ordinary Day at the Office, as many others have already. And the page you were supposed to link on my talk page doesn't exist. Now how come you're supposed to get agrivated? What about everyone else who's posted their 'chapters' on that page? Be a little bit more considerate, or I won't continue this RP, and boycot it too. Tazio1 23:31, April 10, 2011 (UTC) The 'Content' page you've created is honestly badly formated, and I don't know how I'm supposed to add extra chapters. How do I space things out? Where do I start? The 'Ordinary Day at the Office' set up was cleaner, and that was the only reason I started there. Otherwise, if I knew where and how to post, I would have gladly. Tazio1 09:40, April 11, 2011 (UTC) Is that better? Cause' honestly, I don't know what you think anymore. You're making my experiance with this annoying, but I'm sticking with it because I want to have fun. Tazio1 10:53, April 11, 2011 (UTC) Okay, firstly, I asked how to write an RP in my last post, and I got squat. Now you answer my questions after I attempt to write the damned thing? You're an inconsistant fool, and a useless leader with this RP thing. I honestly don't care what you do with my post, but stop being an idiot. Tazio1 11:04, April 11, 2011 (UTC)Let's talk straight  Okay, now let's sort out what's wrong with the page. The RP idea is sound and exciting, and the character set-up page an introduction page were also well done. It's just the content page which is the problem. Firstly, there are little to no instructions as to how to format each Section, chapter, etc, etc. Any first time RP members would be confused, and the Ordinary Day at the Office page would have spread a bit of confution. I imagine C.B. (Captain Bradman) started the page so that you can copy the content and sort it appropriatly on the content page. I believe it's what he ment on the RP page by 'Nanosoldier will sort everything into novels'. (Paraphrasing). Just a little bit more of a 'tutorial' would really be appretiated. It might even get more content onto the page. Now, I know I've been angry before, but only because I haven't gotten a clear answer or help before. To be fair, maybe my questions weren't clear cut either. So let's but this debarkle behind us, and make a great RP, eh? Tazio1 11:17, April 11, 2011 (UTC) I'm glad my post hasn't been deleted, but a tutorial would be appretiated so I don't screw up later on. The message board you mentioned sounds like a good idea, too. Tazio1 11:32, April 11, 2011 (UTC) Yeah! That's more like it! Tazio1 11:42, April 11, 2011 (UTC)SICK!  You have outdone your self sir. Nice work. Really cool! Tazio1 00:08, April 12, 2011 (UTC)Template edit (parameters)  I made an edit to one of your templates, specifically Template:Reintegration Invite. I added </span></div> to prevent the \"retrieved from [...]\" message from popping up anywhere the template was posted. Auguststorm1945 20:31, June 1, 2011 (UTC) I see you've copied my \"Loosing Hope\"-styled RP format. It's cool. Only I don't appreciate how you didn't have the originality to write your own paragraphs.}}Asking  Hey Nano. I request that you resolve this matter with Pikapi as soon as possible. http://deadspacefanon.wikia.com/wiki/RP:_Dead_Space:_Reintegration has been cited as being copied from his RP on HF. I do note the similarities and I kindly ask that you change it ASAP or resolve the issue with Pika. He has told a Wikia Administrator about this action, which I think was overkill, since this could all have been done peacefully and without outside intervention. So other intervention may take place. Please. Do what I asked.

I think its pretty damn cool! Remember to come on the #deadspace channel, I hate posting messages like this. Nanosoldier  10:55, April 5, 2011 (UTC)Ready for duty SIR!  Captain Bradman sir, I wish to join your expedition into the Reintegration story, SIR! I will follow all rules laid out by you sir, and commit 110% of my writing talent to this endeavor sir! I also wish to know if there are any restrictions to character creation, and plot, sir! That is all sir, and I hope to see you soon! Tazio1 11:29, April 5, 2011 (UTC) Message to all DS:R members. Posting can start if you haven't noticed. It seems only I contribute to the RP. So post your post or lose hope! Nanosoldier  09:24, April 9, 2011 (UTC) Dear CPT Bradman, Here I would like to ask permission to join your Dead Space RP in the name of fanhoodness. But thats not the problem with me, the problem with me is that, I also have stories which in whole included the Dead Space Universe, tweaked to fit my universe called the Paradox Universe. In this Universe, there isn't 3 Markers, there are 11, each can make people hallucinate, but only on different topics or themes, Red Marker=anger, Black Marker=knowledge, etc. Another aspect in my universe is scientient Necromorphs, for my story says that the Necromorphs and Flood from halo and a whole bunch of other species just like them I made, were created in accordance to the Markers, with ten species in total (the eleventh marker is all ten combined so it has no 'Guardian Species') All ten of these species make up the race of Infectus and the believers of Infectology (which I based off of Unitology, except on the wider band of all 11 Markers) The second part of this species thing is that, the creatures encountered in these games are called Besitaries, the origional, primal form of the species, which in the present, is very advanced and intellectual. And so it is asked, if I could intergrat these into the RP when neccesary, (either yes or no, I wish to join, and will cooperate). I will be happy to explain more if the time arises and if you do decide to accept this. Thank you for your time. Thor Vadamus 20:06, April 10, 2011 (UTC) So, may I ask, Mr Captain Sir, how exactly this will go down? Do we post on the page that Nanosoldier has mentioned already (the one linked to on the Reintegration page) or what? Also, sir, if I may, I request to join this noble endevour, though I doubt it will be released as a novel at any time due to our set rates (two paragraphs), I will certainly read all posts. Anyway, may I join? Captain tweed 22:54, May 10, 2011 (UTC)Annoyed  Captain Bradman, I'm finding your 'collegue' uncoperative and very rude. I've attempted to follow his intructions, what little he's given, and he is still being very arrogant and tiresome towards my effort to help this RP project. Could you speak with him, or something? Cheers. Tazio1 10:55, April 11, 2011 (UTC)Sequel to Dead Space Meltdown is Complete  Hi this is BettyBoopKiss, i'm the creator of Meltdown, the one story you read, and I wanted to tell you that I finished the sequel not that long ago, it is full of dangerous government secrets and Cara is once again the main character, and it shows just how far the government will go to try to cover up the Ishimura incident, and show people that Necromorphs are fake and no one as anything to fear, and you'll see how Cara has become mentally because of her ordeal on the Ishimura, thanks for following and comment if you like.BettyBoopKiss  thumb|300px|right|This Video is hilarious, ttly watch it.Hey guys and ghouls, i'm Aaron, lots of people know me as the fun spunky Plasma Cutter babe....haha scratch that last part, but seriously I love Dead Space and lets just say the Plasma Cutter is my favorite weapon. I think that the Dead Space franchise is amazing and the movies and games are great. I own the 1st and 2nd games and have played them like a thousand times. (I mean who else do you know that can re-apply black lipstick and kill a slasher.) Anyway I love this game and I wanted to use my avaliable time to write my fan fictions....sooooo whoooooo. ^Y^ Aaron 18:31, June 14, 2011 (UTC)Welcome  Hi welcome to Dead Space Fanon Wiki!

Sorry i haven't mesaged you i ages. I was in London for the Easter holidays and school is getting heavy on me. I wanted to let you know, I have started the Cara Meets Nicole scene and the introduction scene is up so tell me what you think and stay as fab as always. Your friend, Olivia Hi Ally. Its me again. Thank you so much for your comments. The story will prob go on for another long time, so Cara will be popping in and out and I just read about Andy. Very interssting. I have an idea in my head. She goes to the hospital but is transported to the Shard and all the doctors look down on her because she is like a hooker but Nicole takes pity on her and they end up becoming friends. And a little teaser involving Nicole, coming very soon. She meets someone from her past but doesnt realise who it is until Cara helps her see who she was patching up. Dont want to give it away but I think it will be an OMG moment. And towards the end will be another, massive scene, involving the three girls uncovering a terrifying secret inside the Shard. OMG I'm so excited. And Sprawled Out is a fresh, unique and totally rocking story. Keep it going. Talk soon Ally Pally OliviaI'm Back  Hi Ally. So sorry for not being on the wiki. Thanks so much for your consideration to ask me if I'm ok. Personally i am but last Friday night.. Um My friend and i were at a nightclub in the city and we were walking down an alley when I realised I forgot my purse so I went to get it and when I came back I saw her on the ground being raped by some bastard. I was just rushed off my feet coz of police interviews and I stayed with her in the rape crisis centre on Saturday and she was terrified so I had to stay with her and today was the first day I could actually stop and breathe for a while. But thanks for making sure I was ok. Uh Healer is coming along nicely and I am hoping it will be finished by the middle of June coz I have exams in a few weeks and then I'm on holidays. WOOO. Cant wait to hear from you,\u00a0:-) OliviaThank You Again  Thank you so much for your regards and again, thanks for checking on me. Luckily my friend is clear of any physical harm or diseases but she is really messed up now. The whole experience was just traumatic for her. Good thing I got my purse coz there was prob more then one of them and I had my cell and MACE in it. I gave him a good spray into his scummy face and when he was blinded I got him to the ground and held him down til the cops came. Thank Jesus I took those self defence classes or else. Anyway, I hope you're doing ok in life and school. Work is getting serious for me now though. So much to do and all that. Can;t wait to hear from you. By the way, where abouts you live? I never asked before LOL Your friend FOEvA Olivia\u00a0?  Ok? Ummmm.... I..... I am just speechless. Oh my god. You were a guy this whole time and you didnt tell me? I have been nothing but honest and open with you. I'm not mad because my anger has been vented over the past week. But why lie? Are you a potential transgender? I am very open minded about things but I cannot stand lying, in any form. I 'm sorry Aaron or Ally but I cant be friends with someone who lied to me for I dont know how long. Your Friend Olivia Jane Cartier.92.251.134.122 14:33, May 13, 2011 (UTC)Speechless  You see, here's my problem. I never asked are you a girl because you personfied yourself as one. Right, I never asked you, but you had a number of oppurtunities to tell me. I have been lied to and bullied all my life. so much so, I have developed a kind of second sight. I can see the tears of sorrow run down a smiling face, see the anger behind the kindness and sense when something isnt right. I consider it a blessing and a curse, because sometimes I find out things I need to know, but dont really want to. And that's why I asked you where you are from, to start a kind of investigation into who you are and as much as my mind was screaming No You'll only find trouble, I did it because I sensed you weren't telling me everything. I have lost all trust and faith in you. And I know, rationally, you are technically still Ally, but to me you are just Aaron, the guy who led me on for weeks. And since you know who I really am, here goes. My name is Olivia Jane Cartier. I was born in Ireland but moved to New York last year for college. I am a 5 foot 9 inches tall girl, with blonde hair and green eyes. I am studying Physics and last month I was accepted into the FBI academy to train to be an agent for them. Admittedly, I am still unsure if I should finish college first or join them and do my course later. I am schedueled to start training in September. I like video games, shopping, the cinema, my friends, dancing in the club, Lady GaGa, travelling to London, Rome, Paris, Milan, Venice, Washington, Dublin. I hate liars, Sarah Rooney, Eminem, my primary school teachers, my brother. And my mom likes to call me Olive There. That's me in a nutshell. Reply if you want, or not. Wateva you want to do yourself. I'll still be here on the wiki. Olivia Jane CartierFrom Olive  Well. Certainly, a foundation is there but if we could start again, I need to know you like you know me. The reason I am so powerful and um.. how to put it.... that I have a presence about me is because of the following anecdote shall we say. In 2007, I was in 5th year. I had my friends and had some assholes around me too. I was very shy and would let someone walk all over me. But there was this guy. He had the most green green eyes you could imagine. And he had a presence about him too. If he walked into a room, you had to stop and stare. He could see things, like me. I used to smile alot, to project a false sense of happiness but one day, he sat beside me and I smiled and said Hello. He looked at me and said Whats wrong? And I knew then he knew I was sad. But, as good as I was with my abilty to see into others, I couldnt read him. But his eyes were full of war, fire and bullying. We became the firmest of friends and by just hanging around with him, I grew into Olivia. Me and him were dangerous. People would fear us basically and others would admire us. But one day, I came in late and saw he wasnt in class. I sent him a txt asking is he ok. I got no reply which was odd since he kept that phone bolted to him. Then, I and his friends, he had no siblings, were called to the front office. he was on his way to school when a guy on a cell phone was distracted. His mother slammed the brakes and the car spun around. As the car spun, the cell phone guy plunged into the car on the passengers side, instantly killing him. I broke down. I became surly, vindictive. Pure evil. At his wake, I saw him with his eyes wide open. He looked the exact same. No bruises or cuts. Just pure white and cold. But his eyes were still there. Alive and well. And I believe it was his spirit clinging to life but soon I saw his eyes dim and they went to regular green. I knew, that I was the only one who could carry on his spirt and I do today, never letting him die for real coz if I did then I have nothing. And this is the reason I am powerfull and ruthless. To keep him alive. And if I let that nature slip, even for an instant, I have failed so it has to be a pure clean slate. No Ally or gay 16 year old. Just Oliviia and Aaron. Hi. I;m Olivia. I'm kinda new to this wiki and could do with some friends around here. What's your name? And where are you from?Get Over It  I have no idea who you are, and if you were truly a friend to Olivia, you wouldn't trash her like that. She is gone. You may have lost a friend or wateva but I lost my sister because of some drunk driving hick. U know, words can hurt the dead. She never lied or cheated anyone. Does faking her death sound like Olivia to u? She went out yesterday to buy some new clothes for her training in September coz she was so excited, or so she told me over the fone( we may have hated each other but for our dead parents sake we call each other every week.) And then in an instant, like that young guy she was friends with, her life was taken from her. So excuse me if I find it sickening to believe some one is so insecure and paranoid that she would fake her death so she could 'escape' you. How dare you. You really never knew her at all? Did u?NO NO NO  OMG OMG OMG. Aaron. Do not believe any messages you have received from me in the past 2 days. That bastard of an inbreeded rapist I call a brother is playing a sick SICk joke. I am obviously not dead. He hacked my account here and is using it to get back at me for telling his boss at McDonalds he steals from the register. I CANT BELIEVE HIM UHHHHHHHHH. I'm here for real, ok? Its me.I;m Sorry  Aaron. I have to level with you. You are a 16 yr old boy. I am a 21 year old woman. I think the age is a bit much. And further more, to be honest, you are very, very emotionally clingy for want of a better word. You constantly are saying things that creep me out. My fiery eyes, my passion, and that you would die with out me. I have spoken to you for only 5 weeks. I dont even let my friends say that when I know them for 7 years. I'm sorry if this is blunt and soul crushing but I have to be honest. And, on a side note, I really think, if you havent done so already, talk to someone about the issues you have in your life with your dad and step mother. And I believe, may be very wrong, that you can only find friends here on the Internet. That is not a good thing Aaron. Here's an idea. Log off for a while after you read this, take a walk and stop in at a local youth club or sports team, watever and reach out to people. It will be slow and long to make new friends but Rome Wasn't Built In A Day moya zvezda. And in school, just say hi to someone, smile to them and be yourself. Not Ally or Abby, just Aaron. And you will be stunned by the reaction. I hope you havent been completely shot by what i have said. Feel free to talk to me if you need help or want me to listen, I have a year of pschology behind me. And I have taken the FBI positon. I'll be an agent someday. But if youu ever feel low or down, just talk to me and I will help you but I don't think we can be very close friends as you're hoping. Bye Olivia Jane Cartierhalseymj  How many articals have you wrote? halseymj 16:29, June 6, 2011 (UTC)Question concerning fan fiction  Hey, I read your fan-fic Dead Space: Shockpoint and I really liked it. I was wondering if you could consider making a tie-in with my next fan fiction by, for example, having our characters meet or affect eachother? Shadow Hunter XT 22:16, June 11, 2011 (UTC) Hey, just replying to your message. The USG Beagle is something of my own conception, well when I say that the title and the information about it are mine. The technology I did attempt to keep in line with what that present in the Dead Space universe. Also the same type of ship can is kind of present in Battlestar Galatica in the form of Cloud 9, however the USG Beagle is designed to be far more functional. It is a multi-purpose station. - The type of ship was initially designed to quell any political backlash on the alien environments that the C.E.C were destroying, thus they are mainly large ecological platforms, possessing both flora and fauna from earth and some from other planets. - The C.E.C once having realised the stations could be more then just interstellar greenhouses, decided to incorporate a large science and medical deck to the station's design so as to exploit the ecology of alien planets as well as their mineral wealth. - To maximise the financial return on the station, the C.E.C also had extra accommodation built. This was to house tourists and space-weary employees. Both visiting the station to relieve the stresses of an existence in space by planting their feet on the ground, one reminiscent to that on Earth. - The station is permanantly parked in the orbit of a sun, sitting in the sun's 'Goldilocks' orbit. This cuts the energy required to create artificial light, it also provides the plants with the energy they require to photosynthesize. - Due to the quality of both the station's medical/science deck and the personnel that are employed to man it, the station receives a great many visitors seeking expert medical attention. Yeah that is all I have at the moment but I am bound to think about something else aboard the ship during the course of the story. Thanks for the interest.Thank you!  Thank you for the warning, I really appreciate it. I will follow your advice and, again, thanks.I'm tired of this  All these rumors are not true, I could get these things published and all credit would go to the users. But I'm getting tired of this so I will not send them in for the sake of my own dignity. Halseymj 06:28, June 15, 2011 (UTC) one more thing, your meltdown story was in the top five.Fan-fiction answer  In response to your question, yes, I am planning to use your character and the story will be uploaded on the DSF-wikia. I would love to have you with me in this project and you are also allowed to use my characters as well. (If you're wondering anything about them, just ask.) Sincerely, Shadow Hunter XT 12:14, June 15, 2011 (UTC)Fan-fiction answer (follow-up)  I was planning on putting a note at the beginning saying: \"A Shadow Hunter XT and BettyBoopKiss production\" or something. And since you are now a part of the project, feel free to bring along any ideas you may think of. And just as a reminder: This project has just started... It may take some time for me to think of a good story. So return to my talk-page any time to submit your ideas... Shadow Hunter XT 16:16, June 15, 2011 (UTC)Another Fan-fic comment  I'm thinking of naming my character Kyle Denton, and the story was going to pick up where your DS: Shockpoint left of... If you agree on these ideas, or have anything to add, just leave a message... Shadow Hunter XT 18:40, June 15, 2011 (UTC) Sorry for all the trouble, but you people should have some trust. Halseymj 16:25, June 16, 2011 (UTC) Listen, I said I was sorry and the contest was not a shame. I have gotten peoples things published before. If I were here to steal I woulden't even tell people about it. Sorry. Halseymj 16:35, June 16, 2011 (UTC) I don't work for the compony, I have a friend that works with them. But I won't bother you anymore. Halseymj 16:48, June 16, 2011 (UTC)Further Conversation.  Sorry for the belatedness of my reply, assessments at school have been coming with greater frequency and limiting the amount of time I have for recreation. Again I\u2019d like to thank you for your interest in my imaginings, also I\u2019d like to compliment your own ideas; however I would take this opportunity to further clarify some design details of the USG Beagle. I had envisaged the Beagle and all other stations of its class to be a sort of plateau style, life on the surface (On the upper deck) and the ships inner mechanisms beneath. Following this idea, I expanded my initially narrow and long craft into that of a sprawl, a massive upper deck on which the sole bio-dome is located. I had thought that the dimensions I imagined would be unsupported in the canonicity of the Dead Space universe, however when I read the hypothetical statistics of the USG Ishimura I noted the astronomical weight that it\u2019s engines were capable of moving. Thus I allowed myself the freedom to create a ship larger then I had initially set out to, so the dimension of the biological deck is around about four-five square miles (still haven\u2019t completely worked out the exact dimensions) with the decks below receding in size, similar to a pyramid. Also I noted your stations need for holographic systems to maintain an artificial sunlight, this would be a useful system if the ships were being designed for deep-space travel, however stations like the Beagle once commissioned maintain their location within the orbit of a sun, thus they have enough sunlight to feed the plants and power some the auxiliary systems. Alleviating some of the stress placed on the power source. As to my thoughts on the decks below the biological deck... Well immediately below the bio-dome is the administration/crew/bio-dome maintenance deck. This is perhaps the most ambiguous area of the ship at the moment as I have yet to go there in the story and it was not at all the interesting part of the ship. Although the last part, bio-dome maintenance, simply refers to the control centres and access points to the systems required to operate a habitation in space (This will probably be elaborated on later). Below this is Medical/Research deck, this is perhaps the area of the ship with the greatest amount of detail at the moment due to it being the current setting in Necrosis. As you may be aware from reading the minute amount of Necrosis that I have posted here, this deck is equipped with quarters for professionals that are required to be close to their work stations. There is also a monorail upon this deck (and all others, I forgot to mention this), the same can be said for the vending machines that litter the deck. Upon this deck we can see a range of medical facilities and apparatuses, ranging from the most intensive surgical wards equipped with science-fiction tools, to paediatric psychiatry wards. The lighting upon this deck is far more florescent, aligning itself with the hospital motif of sterility. This deck is also equipped with sealable decontamination showers that sterilise both people and their accoutrements. ((There are some gaps in this, I do plan to elaborate later, however I will most likely do this when I write the entire ships description up)) As you can see I have a rudimentary idea of the ships structure, unfortunately I do not possess the artistic flare to create a visual for you. Sorry if any of this appeared to be put across as self-indulgent or elitist, this was not my intention, however when reading it over I noticed some points that could be construed in that way. Once again thank you for your interest in something I had originally considered an ends to boredom. Doctor Grayson. Again I find myself responding to your questions with great delay, this is due to a hefty amount of assessments that have disposed of a large portion of my free time. In answer to your question as to whether the USG Beagle flew horizontally or vertically, the craft sits on a forty-five degree angle so as to maximise the amount of sunlight it will receive. However the ship was launched horizontally from a shipyard orbiting one of Jupiter's moons. As to your drawing of the ship, feel free to post a rendition of the Beagle if you feel so inclined, I'd love to see what you perceive the ship to look like. Doctor Grayson.Sorry it took me so long to get back  He said he isn't allowed to give out a number for publicity reasons. But you can submit your story to them and have them check it out.

Happy editing!Captain tweed/Dead Space: After The End, Chapter 2  Author's Note: This is quite horror-inclined, so don't read alone, in a stormy castle at night, and while I probably give myself too much credit, it's still creepy and a bit dark, so read at your own exspense. Also, all the things that are normally missing from the games and stories will be explained, so don't go jumping on my back because some of the things here don't exist in-game. With that said, let's begin. Cold? No, it was hot today. Hotter than England should be... So why the cold...? \u2026 There was a flash of light \u2013 blinding, practically. Was it the Sun? No, there was a black rim. Like a four-leafed clover... Come to think of it, there were four lights, too. Or maybe it was just vision fading and shifting, screwing with perception? No, no, it was real, damn it. An arm just touched one of them. \u201cSir? Sir, can you hear me?\u201d A brighter light eclipsed the four-leaf clover. Closer or brighter? Seemed to be closer... \u201cI think he's waking up! Get the doctor!\u201d God damn it, why won't she just shut up...!? Leave me to my sleep... God I'm tired. Feel like I kissed a freight train. What's a freight train? Hell if I know. It was something my dad said? \u201cMr, please wake up... we need you to wake up...\u201d A little girl? What's she doing here? She should leave, I'm not nice when I'm sleepy. Vision became less fogged-up. The image cleared. Good God... CORPSES! THEY'RE ALL CORPSES! \u201cWake up, mister... we need you to wake up...\u201d Run! Run! God... they're getting closer! Stay back! No! Jesus Christ! \u2026 Consciousness flicked back on like a switch \u2013 snapping Alistair's mental bones in a whirlwind of buggered perceptions. The pain seemed all too real. His bones may as well have really been snapped \u2013 who was to say they weren't? \u201cDoctor, he's waking up!\u201d Oh, God... It was real! It was happening again! He had to get out of here! He threw his fists into the air \u2013 he struck someone! They let out a yelp before hitting the ground. His other fist didn't raise as expected... it must have been bound. Blinking and clearing out the fog, he could see he was in a pristine \u2013 and blindingly white \u2013 bedroom. There weren't any windows, so no easy escape \u2013 looks like the main route. Looking down to his arm, it was in a cast. Strange, those were pretty uncommon these days. Why were they using this? Unless it was to restrain him and his arm was perfectly fine... but he remembered hitting a building... Oh God. Those people. Those mutilated, feral people... were they still loose!? He had to get out of here, before they showed up again! Out of nowhere, pain jabbed straight into his neck \u2013 was it the corpse-person he had knocked down? Had they shown up to drag him into Hell and beyond? He was twisted, leaving a grotesque snap in the air, to reveal a gaping wide maw, filled with rotting, yellow teeth, pieces of flesh lodged between them, and the rotting stench of death vomiting forth into his nose... \u201cWelcome to Hell, Alistair...\u201d It grinned. Alistair began to scream and shut his eyes. He began to thrash about, landing a glancing blow on something made of plastic-y cloth. \u201cHold him down! He needs to calm down!\u201d A strong male voice thundered \u2013 it was different from the corpse-person's voice... he opened his eyes... OH DEAR GOD! He slammed the shut and forgot about opening them ever again \u2013 this was it. He was in Hell. What use was sight when all there was... was pain? Unless seeing the physical manifestation of pain, suffering and horror grew to pique his attention over the years, he would claw his eyes out the first chance he got, assuming these Hellish people didn't get to them first. Something touched his eye \u2013 it seemed he would be spared the trouble. It wrenched it open \u2013 what was he seeing!? Something was breaking through the misery... something white, something clean. Not bloodied, doused in terror and screaming, but something celestial, there to help him- It was a needle.

Find out more here.About  This wiki is about Eden World Builder, a block-based building game for the iPod, iPad, and iPhone, where you can build amazing worlds and share them. This game was created by an Ari Ronen, and now by Kingly Software Inc, better known as Kingly Games. The app has become very popular among iOS users, and since its release, has risen to the top 50 on the App Store charts multiple times and sold over three million copies. The game was open sourced in January 2018 and is now being developed by the community.Version History  Eden World Builder has gone through many updates which add new features or modify the game in other ways. This page is a list of the changes and the features in each version of Eden - World Builder.Future Updates  Here are a list of features that may be added in future updates:Sources Blocks Portal  The\u00a0Portal\u00a0is a block added in the 2.0 Update. Portals allow you to travel from one place to another fast. If you place a portal in one place and another in a second place with the same color, they will link.Trivia Bedrock  The Bedrock Block is naturally occurring and appears in both Normal Worlds and Flat Worlds. Bedrock is rocky in appearance and is a gray/black color by default. The location of Bedrock is at the farthest possible depth in the World, 25 blocks from ground level. Ari Ronen created the block to act as a border between the void and the world. Bedrock is not place-able or even destructible with TNT. Vuenctools has the ability to remove the entire bedrock layer. This provides builders with an increased height limit. Utilizing this, builders are able to produce buildings one block taller than normal.Natural generation Current Before 1.6 Building examples  Many people use Bedrock to create underground cities using it as a floor or street.Trivia See also Ice  The Ice block is one of the most used blocks in Eden. Ice has the effect of acceleration (e.g. when you move on it, you continue to move and your velocity grows, handsfree). It is often used as a material in building slides, especially in its triangle form, and roller coasters. These blocks are not found naturally except for in 2.0 terrain, and cannot be burned.Uses  The Ice block can be used for building ice rinks, Winter-themed worlds, means of transportation, roller coasters, and slides and for the \"Human Cannonball\". When holding the Joystick, the Avatar speeds up, and if an ice ramp is present, the momentum will carry the avatar from there. This block is extremely popular when building slides or roller coasters because it is usually handsfree, and the speed is similar to that of roller coasters. Another popular use for this block is as a road, or a method of transportation. An Ice rink is common for this block, as it functions in a structure it blends well with.Trivia Creatures The Hidden Galaxy Series  The Hidden Galaxy Series is a series of worlds that are proving to be somewhat of a legend among Eden players. Depending on what version you have downloaded you will spawn in: the planetarium (RPG version), the octogenarian building (version 2.5) or the mouth of the dragon (v2.8). When you go out (Warp home), you will lose the galaxy in a few seconds (But due to worlds massive size, the warp can take anywhere between 5-15 seconds depending on what device you have). When you have warped, you'll find yourself in a very detailed world which is of good quality with lots to see if you walk around and explore. \"Home\" is the sky compass. The one drawback to this map is that is was created before colors and effect blocks existed, therefore its water is not real and you can only explore it. (Update: The Hidden Galaxy V2 has real water and colors.) The latest update is The Hidden Galaxy V3, dated 04/04/2015Maps  Here is a top-down \"satellite photograph\": The warp-home location, \"sky compass\" is close to the center if this map, between a dark green area and some water. It has big letters \"N\", \"E\", \"S\" and \"W\" for north, east, south and west. The \"North\" direction is to the left in this map and all the maps below. Unseen in this photo, there is a very long (5000 blocks) strip leading to the \"north\" which appears to contain nothing except the normal rock, grass and trees. However, upon closer inspection, the strip contains two structures. They are both too far away to accurately locate and are tiny, no more than 20 blocks big and show up as tiny red dots on the structures map which is too big to upload. (Note from Steve: The strip mentioned above was actually made by mistake. I had just learned about the \"Ice Launch\" glitch, and wanted to try it for myself. After making a small ramp and holding down the forward button for way too long, I was launched into the air. I managed to find the ground only after the map had rendered dozens of new terrain sections during my flight. The structures noted above are just abandoned ice ramps that I had made in an attempt to find my way home. I realized I could've just warped home, but where's the fun in that?) The Hidden Galaxy is a fairly old world and has many Caves. This map shows the caves in blue, and \"man-made\" structures in red and yellow: This map shows all excavations, but color-coded by depth. Red is the deepest, green is medium, and blue is near the surface. The insides of buildings also show up blue: This gallery shows horizontal \"slices\" through the world starting 8 blocks up from the bedrock and going up by 8 blocks per slice:Trivia Notes  The snow observatory is the location of you know what... - Falc. Steve Bruce, our own Wiki member has created this world - RUS Somewhere inside the sand biome there are stairs going into a turtle room. Somewhere in there, there is a red slide. When you go in that it will take you to a room of 4 slides. Go in the white one and you will end up in you know what... -Bnm This world is amazing. 5 stars! - TTWLight  This blocks have been labelled as \"glowblocks\" and \"light blocks\". The light block looks like a Medieval oil lantern, and before this was introduced, users often mistook Tile Blocks for lights which don't light up. These blocks\u00a0do light up, and if painted, they make for colored lighting. There isn't a night time in Eden, but the user can color the sky, which includes black which makes it darker, making Light Blocks much more useful.Trivia Glitches  This is a list of various glitches and bugs that were found in the Eden application. Each glitch has a description of what it is and how to reproduce the bug.Lava Cannon Bug  Dig down, place some ice ramps going down into some vertically flowing lava. Then jump in, wait for a few seconds/minutes/hours if you are mad, then hit jump and fly away into the unloaded chunks. While charging, going left or right will sort of teleport you to the opposite block.No-Flow  Placing lava directly above you will stop it flowing.The Jump glitch  If you play Direct City you will land in a old glitch that can make you fly up in the air.Video(s)  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is the video for The Elevator Glitch. (see above) There are other glitches out there, but some have been patched. Please add to this list if you know any more. Thanks!Steel  Steel\u00a0is a block that was released in the 2.0 Update. It is most notable for its immunity to TNT blasts.Trivia Block  To add Blocks to this category, put Block in the article.Update 2.0  Update 2.0\u00a0(formerly named Update 1.8) is the largest\u00a0Eden World Builder\u00a0update to date. It added several features that are listed below. The update was released on February 16, 2015.New Features Blocks: Other Features: Trivia Leaves  Leaves are flammable and can be found naturally on trees. In normal worlds, they can be found in green, red, yellow, or orange colors, but they can also be painted to any of the preset colors.Natural generation Building examples Trivia See also Crystal  The Crystal Block could be the least used block in Eden. They aren't actually \"Crystals,\" but blocks with crystal designs on them. They aren't animated and can only be destroyed by pickaxe/TNT. The color ability makes these blocks a nice touch, though as a user can have a collection of various \"precious gems.\" Also crystals look really good when you make a giant under ground mine and place them in random spots on the walls. These blocks are mostly used for decorations in hotels or mansions. Crystals can also be colored using\u00a0Painting and look like diamonds, gold, etc.Trivia TNT  TNT is a non-naturally occurring block that is flammable and explodes when lit on fire. TNT has a blast radius of 13 blocks (from side to side). TNT is one of the most popular and commonly used blocks. The blast will destroy the same amount of blocks regardless of the type of blocks in range. From the topmost section, it blows up 6 blocks down. Another thing to note is that every explosion has the same pattern. TNT is a quick way to demolish a big structure or just to make a big hole or crater in the ground. In Update 2.0, if you color TNT, it will turn into a paint bomb. Instead of destroying blocks, it will splash them with the color you painted the TNT.Uses  The TNT block is an extremely useful and entertaining block to use. They are used almost entirely for this purpose of destruction. It creates huge craters when dug down to 6 blocks. It is most useful when clearing terrain for structures. It immediately sets fire to anything flammable, though it does not destroy it instantly. If TNT is colored, it will explode and color the blocks it exploded on.Trivia Ice Ramp  Ice Ramp is one of the most highly used blocks when creating worlds. Most users use the ice block to create ice slides/roller coasters. When a user goes over the Ice Ramp, It will move the user in the same direction as the Ramp Slope at the same velocity. These are not naturally found and can NOT be burnedUses  The Ice Ramp block is commonly used for/as: Ice rinks, Slides, roller coasters, and roads. It's also used for slides, as it projects the Avatar into the air to another location, and the velocity downwards is also quick. For, roads, it is used to turn the Avatar, as it keeps momentum, and has been progammed to turn the player according to the path.Trivia Wood Planks  The Wood Plank is a block that is not naturally occurring as of version 1.7, but will most likely be in Version 2.0. It appears to be a group of wooden planks or boards put into a block. It is a highly used building material, often used as flooring or walls. Wood Plank blocks are closely related to the Trunk block, which is naturally occurring. Both of these materials are flammable, as they are woodenTrivia Grass  This article is about the Grass block. For its variants, see Flowers or Weeds. Grass is a solid block\u00a0that appears naturally in both the Flat World\u00a0and\u00a0Normal World templates. It is commonly found directly above the uppermost layer of dirt, but can also be found directly above Stone, or even floating (unattached to anything).\u00a0There are two variations of the grass block: the Flower Block and the Weeds Block. These two Blocks appear less frequently per chunk than the Grass Block, and the Flower Block was removed with Update 2.0.Natural Generation Trivia See also Lava  Lava is an animated block on Eden. It is very similar to water in the sense of animation, as it appears to flow. It reacts the same as water when you delete a block: when you delete a block of lava, anything directly under it or anything downstream from it will disappear with it. The only difference from water that it has is that it isn't translucent or intangable, so you cannot swim in it. If you do touch it, however, it will act as a lesser Trampoline block and the user will bounce. The screen will also temporarily go red as if the user was getting hurt.Trivia Video Game Museum  The Video Game Museum is the stuff of legends. Only old time Edeners will have the (original) video game museum, when worlds didn't get any preview pictures. This massive world came to be when only normal worlds were available, and caves were still in the game, naturally generated. On starting, you go down a staircase, to enter a cave range with tons of pixel art avatars from the popular games that were considered new in the 80's and 90's await your viewing. Also on the outside, there are three truly massive monuments depicting Mario, Yoshi, and a\u00a0? Item Box from the Super Mario games.Trivia  Bnm786: This was my first world I viewed. I was like 8, and I walked around getting lost.Weeds  The Weeds Block\u00a0is a natural block that cannot be placed.Trivia See also Caves  Caves were a place of interest before they were deleted in Update 1.6 that could be found in the normal world template. They were naturally spawning underground caves that could be found anywhere by digging deep. They were often used as places to build massive structures and were made of Stone and dark stone (Dark Stone is one of the blocks in 1.6 not deleted and replaced by the painting option in 1.5). Caves could be toggled on or off, like everything else, in the settings. They also had narrow openings to other caves. The average height range of these caves was about 26 blocks high, and they would, like the rest of the world, keep generating until you got bored. Caves sometimes have bumpy bedrock. Panoramic view of a cave in \"Video game museum with additions\" from 2013 Feb 11thTrivia Dark Stone  The Dark Stone Block is a block in Eden that is similar to Stone, but with a different texture and it is obviously darker. It does not spawn naturally, but in previous updates, it would spawn in caves, which were removed in v 1.6. Dark Stone is used for creating roads and rock housesTrivia Glass  Glass is a transparent block that was updated in Ver. 1.5. Before that, it was not translucent, thus earning itself the nickname of \"the stripe block\". Glass is used to make windows and other transparent objectsTrivia ", "Minecraft buildcraft Wiki": "Minecraft buildcraft Wiki Minecraft Buildcraft Wiki  This wiki is unsupported by the mod's developers.Engines  As of Buildcraft 2.0.1 there is the option to use pneumatic engines to power the various machines in BuildCraft. Engines may be picked up by breaking them with a stone pick or better. The energy output from an engine only occurs on the top side. Engines can be rotated if they are not facing the right way using a wrench. When right clicked with a wrench, an engine will automatically face towards something it can power. If there is nothing to power, it will not change. Engines must be switched on by a lever or redstone current to function. Each has various strengths and requirements to function.MJ (Minecraft Joules)  In previous versions of Buildcraft, engines output power in terms of MJ/t (Minecraft Joules per tick). One second is equivalent to 20 ticks (assuming no lag). Knowing how much MJ/t an engine generates or a machine uses is key in creating the best energy network.RF (Redstone Flux)  This was an energy system, provided in Thermal Expansion 4, that is essentially a decimal to MJ plus a few optimizations. Buildcraft was switched to the RF API in BC7. All suggestions on optimizing networks still apply though.Temperature  The temperature of the engine can be easily determined by the color of its core: Combustion engines only go to orange mode if they are starting to overheat, as they have run out of an internal supply of water or they are heating up faster than water is being supplied, so keeping them in the green stage is recommended.\u00a0 In SMP for beta 2.2.1 of Buildcraft, the energy folder should be installed last or the engines won't work properly.Redstone Engine  Redstone engines are the most basic engine. When applied with redstone current, it will be powered forever until you turn it off. As of version 3.2 they can no longer be used to allow transfer of power through\u00a0wooden conductive pipes. They also can not power any machine (e.g. quarry). The only exception to this is the Pump.Steam/Stirling Engine  This mid-range engine is significantly more powerful than the Redstone Engine but uses burnable fuel, such as wood or coal.Combustion Engine  The highest tier of engine. You can attach a conductive pipe or kinesis pipe (same thing, different versions and APIs) to transport the energy elsewhere. Combustion engines are expensive. A Combustion Engine can be fueled by pumping oil or fuel into it For a more specific view on different engines and their energy consumption, see engines - in depth.Creative Engine  Creative engines are only spawnable in creative, and were added after the switch to the RF API. These provide infinite power to a system. The power of these can be selected by ducking/sneaking and right-clicking with the wrench.Pipes  Pipes are a fundamental part of Buildcraft, and once set up allow items to be transported around the world without the player being required to carry them. Pipes can be utilized to carry items, liquids, and the Redstone Flux power. These pipes interact with blocks that possess inventories. Prime examples of such blocks are Chests, Furnaces, Hopperand even Brewing Stand. When connecting to a block, pipe placement is important. If you want to remove items from a furnace, for example, then a wooden pipe needs to be attached to the bottom of the furnace. A pipe connected to the top of a furnace places items into the top spot, and a pipe connected to the side of a furnace puts items into the bottom spot.Pipes (overview) Video Tutorials Quarry  'For the quarry in buildcraft 1 - see this.' 'For the quarry in buildcraft 2 - see this.' A Quarry is a machine that automatically mines a large area. This area, by default, is 9x9 blocks, but it can be defined by landmarks to a maximum of 64x64. It rarely requires any manual work, and only needs a supply of energy (RF).Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Quarry See: Crafting GuideProcess  The Quarry will start by removing any obstructing blocks in the way of its frame. IMPORTANT: Items in chests and blocks in the area will NOT be dropped. This frame is 5 meters tall. They seem to support a moving structure with a diamond-like object at the bottom, likely a laser or drill of some kind. This \"miner\" moves around, excavating each layer block by block. The speed at which it mines a block is determined by how much power is being supplied. During excavation, each block mined will be ejected from the top. These items will be ejected with extreme kinetic energy, unless a pipe is connected. There is no need for a wood pipe to fetch the items, the Quarry will place the items into a connected stone, cobblestone, gold, iron,  or diamond pipe on its own. In the event that the quarry encounters lava, the rest of the blocks located under the lava will not be mined. If the lava is converted to obsidian or cobblestone, the quarry will start re-mining those blocks.Underground Operation  A Quarry can function at any level. Simply placing it against a shaft wall and powering it is all that is required to start the default 9x9 area. The blocks in the frame area will be destroyed. It is possible to create a landmark-drawn frame as per above ground, use a redstone torch next to a landmarker to see where to place the next markers. Using this method it becomes possible to save time and fuel by placing your Quarry right above the gold/diamond levels.Power  The Quarry must be powered by one or more engines. Quarries have an internal buffer of energy, and require a few seconds to charge. The lowest the power must be at is 5 RF/tick (it may be lower, hasn't been tested).Tips Notes Setup Demonstration  A short video guide on how to use the Quarry. More\u00a0 information can be found at Tutorials/Getting StartedAutomatic Mining  These machines will dig holes in the ground or move liquid automatically, so you can do other things while they work.Pump  This will pump out liquid and place it in adjoining buildcraft compatible pipes.Mining Well  The Mining Well will dig a hole straight down until it reaches bedrock or lava, replacing the blocks below it with Mining Pipe.Quarry  The Quarry will excavate a 9x9 block area by default, unless defined otherwise using landmarks. The Quarry will continue until it reaches bedrock or lava.Landmarks  Used to define areas up to 64x64x64 blocks for machines to operate in when the default area just isn't right.Redstone Engine/Buildcraft 2  This article discusses the redstone engine in Buildcraft version 2.\u00a0For the version in Buildcraft 3, see\u00a0here\u00a0.  Redstone engines are the cheapest of the type of Engine. They use wood instead of stone or iron in their crafting and are the least powerful of the three types of engine. Redstone engines, like all other engines, gain speed as they heat up, which increases their energy output per second. Unlike Combustion engines, they will never explode on running hot, except when not powering anything (see below). In fact, they produce more power when becoming orange-blinking-red and it is not advised to turn them off unless needed (again, see below). Break with pickaxe to get your engine back. In the current Buildcraft versions for Minecraft 1.4+ redstone engines are no longer able to be chained to other engine types, nor output their power into wooden conductive pipes. As part of this change pumps are now better able to accept power from redstone engines directly (requires 2 or more engines), however it is impossible to use a redstone engine to power more advanced machines.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Redstone EngineSetup Demonstration  A short video guide on how to use Redstone Engine.Power Source  Redstone engines get all their power from redstone/levers and do not need refueling. They require a direct link to any powered redstone component on the same elevation (or one block above) in order to function.Power Output  The Redstone Engine has 4 different power outputs, depending on how hot it is, it will eventually heat up and reach the last (better) output. Blue: Makes 1 Energy Pulse every 5 seconds (0.01MJ/t). Green: Makes 1 Energy Pulse every 2.5 seconds (0.02MJ/t). Orange: Makes 1 Energy Pulse every 1.25 seconds (0.04MJ/t). Orange-blinking-Red: Makes 1 Energy Pulse every second (0.05MJ/t). This is the max safe power output.Uses  Redstone engines are most often used for powering things like wooden pipes  when it's not necessary to move many items at once because they are cheap to produce and maintain. Redstone engines are at their best used as powering for wooden pipes, for solid items or liquids. They are sufficient to execute this task and don't need a significant installation to function. The minimum configuration takes only two blocks: the engine itself and a lever or redstone torch. Redstone engines are only able to power more advanced machines, like quarries, when combined into great arrays. Quarries run at full speed with around 100 hot redstone engines, although will run (albeit more slowly) with 50-ish engines as well, so you can build more as it gathers more materials. Powering an engine with another will have both power the target of the former one. It is possible to set them up in a chain (daisy-chaining). This isn't recommended though, see below.Overheating  All engines in Buildcraft will explode if allowed to overheat. The redstone engine however can only overheat if not connected to anything at all. Being connected even to a single wooden conductive pipe (even if leading nowhere) will allow it to run indefinetly without any risk of exploding. It will go from blue to green and then orange and when running at full power it will start blinking red-orange and will remain red-orange till swithched off or the load removed. When in danger of exploding the engine will be fully red. They take a while to explode even when fully red. While it's possible to connect any engines in a chain (daisy-chaining), this makes the lead redstone engine much more prone to overheating and eventually exploding even if connected to something. The explosion of an overheated redstone engine is relatively weak, anything at more than 2 blocks from it is usually safe. Damage to the player is limited as well. This is somewhat annoying in big arrays, as one builder error can escalate and destroy half of them if left unchecked. Always double check the wiring.Pump  Pumps are devices in BuildCraft that are capable of gathering liquids. They were first introduced in Buildcraft version 2.2.0. Pumps actually take more than just directly around them, so when pumping oil that is surrounded by water, it is wise to have two tanks, (one for oil, one for water) or the water will get stuck in the pipe and no more oil will be able to be pumped. Another method of separating the water and oil involves building a wall of gravel/sand. Use a Lily Pad to drop sand/gravel around the main oil spout, cutting off the water. This method is perhaps best for oil deposits at sea as without doing so the pump will extract a very large quantity of water (likely filling any secondary water tanks, stopping oil extraction) and leave a big hole in the sea.Recipe  Note: This recipe is for the newest version of Buildcraft. The recipe was changed from the old recipe (1 x Mining Well with 1 x Tank on top of it in a crafting table) Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Pump See: Crafting Guide Crafting Guide (An External Page) and the Setup Demonstration use the old recipe.Setup Demonstration  A short video guide on how to use Pump.Power usage and outputs  A pump uses 10 MJ per pumped block. Max filling rate is 20 buckets / sec, on 10 MJ/tick, from 2 Combustion engines running on fuel (fuel equals 6 MJ when used in a Combustion engine, so 2 Combustion engines will actually provide 12 MJ). (Information may not be accurate) Note that a single pipe won't hold the load of a maxed out pump, nor will 4 Gold Waterproof Pipes as they all provide 4x1.6=6.4 buckets / sec, a little more than a third of the capacity needed. Therefore it is advised to place a tank directly next to the pump.Filling rate  Steam Engines will fill a block of Stone Waterproof Pipe per revolution. Combustion Engines will fill a single block of Gold Waterproof Pipe per revolution. A pump can take up to 4 Steam Engines or 2 Combustion Engines burning oil or 1 Combustion Engine burning fuel without causing an explosion. If you are using redstone engines, 10 running at max heat will fill a stone waterproof pipe.Draining lava  A pump working on lava will empty it because lava does not replenish blocks the way water does.Infinite Water  Place a pump above a 3 x 3 x 1 deep pool of water for infinite water. The pump must go above one of the four corners of this pool and can be powered by any set of engines you like - the pool will refill itself faster than it will drain, even at maximum pumping speed to empty Gold Waterproof Pipes. A 2 x 2 x 1 deep pool will not work, as the pump will occasionally remove more water than the pool can generate. Larger non-square pools will run out as the pump will eventually take water from a block that won't refill itself properly, and this cycle will repeat until the pool is empty. Pumps will not take water from unconnected sources. Make sure two sources of water are not connected nor touching diagonally to prevent remote-drainage.Water Supply for Combustion Engines  NOTE: The following information may be outdated, unreliable and/or inconsistent. (See the Comments section of this wiki page for player accounts.) Refer to the next section for further precautions you can take to protect your Combustion Engines from explosive overheating.Further Precautions to Avoid Explosive Overheating  Monitor the water supply in your Combustion Engines after your setup has had time to run. If the water supply is falling while the engines are operating, they are not receiving sufficient water, and will explosively overheat if left unattended. Consider one or more of the following: As a final precaution, consider placing your Combustion Engines behind an Obsidian wall, to protect the expensive equipment they are powering in the event of an explosion.Stirling Engine  Stirling engines (formerly referred to as steam engines) are the second tier of engine. They use cobblestone instead of wood or iron so are still cheaper than the Combustion Engine. Previously, it had been stated that Stirling Engines would not blow up and would simply stop operating when heated too much. In recent versions, the Stirling Engine will only explode if energy produced is not being removed from the engine. Stirling engines will explode at 250.0C. Note that the flame gauge on the Steam/Stirling Engine GUI does NOT indicate if it has any energy to run or not, but rather if there is still fuel being added to build up heat. In other words, the stirling engine continues to run quite a while after the instant the flame gauge empties and there is no more fuel in the slot to burn (unlike Vanilla machines).\u00a0 Prior to Buildcraft 3.2.0, Stirling Engines were known as Steam Engines.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Stirling Engine See: Crafting GuideSet Up Demonstration Power Source  Stirling engines output 1MJ/t (20 MJ/s) while on (given a constant redstone signal). The stirling engine runs on burning items and so needs refuelling to continue operation. Burnable items include lava buckets (which are consumed in 2.2.10), coal, charcoal, wood, planks, sticks, saplings, crafting tables, chests and bookcases--basically it will burn everything a normal furnace will burn, including Cactus and Sugar Cane (Though from 4.1.2 on, cactus and sugar canes will not work within this engine). The stirling engine also needs a redstone signal or pulse to run. Fuel items can be pumped in via a transport pipe for convenience.Usage  Stirling engines can be used as a power supply for mining machines. Stirling engines can be connected to each other, or they can transfer power through conductive pipes. Though it doesn't run much faster than the Redstone Engine, it provides a great deal more power per stroke. They are your best choice for powering a pump with 3 or 4 stirling engines, while if you are using more, a combustion engine will be needed for the water supply.Mining Well  The Mining Well will dig a hole straight down underneath it. It requires an alternating redstone current (1.7.3.x) e (2.x) in order to function. The Mining Well will stop drilling down once\u00a0it hits lava or bedrock. Destroying the Mining Well with a pickaxe will result in the Mining Well being dropped as an item able to be picked up and placed again. The Mining Well leaves Mining Pipe down the hole it drills, which can be left in place or punched away. If you destroy the Mining Well without first punching away the Mining Pipe directly below it, all the Mining Pipe will disappear, leaving a deep hole. (3.2.0). Blocks that the Mining Well digs out pop out of the Mining Well, unless there is a pipe attached, or a chest next to the mining well. It essentially is a 1x1 digging quarry, except it is less expensive. Power requirements: max speed with 10 (hot) redstone engines, two stirling engines burning coal or one burning lava. You can reach even higher speeds using Combustion engines though you run the risk of said engines exploding. One or two stirling engines are recommended. Uses: The Mining Well has two major uses being: 1 Making a fast path to the bedrock. 2 Mining ore and cobble. Caution: The piping left behind by the Mining Well will not fill up the entire block beneath it. Use caution when breaking your Mining Well as it may fall down the hole you created.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Mining Well See: Crafting GuideNotes Combustion Engine  The Combustion Engine is the highest tier of buildcraft\u00a0engine. It can convert\u00a0oil\u00a0or\u00a0fuel\u00a0into MJ at a rate of 3MJ/t and 6MJ/t respectively, making it the most powerful of the three buildcraft engines. However, unlike engines from the lower tiers a combustion engine requires water\u00a0to maintain a safe temperature and will continuously drain its internal water tank once it reaches the maximum safe operating temperature. If a combustion engine runs out of water, it will begin to heat up and breakdown. Combustion engines provide enough power to draw full stacks when used on a Wooden Pipe\u00a0and\u00a0move a Quarry without delays between each action. In versions of buildcraft prior to 4.1.0, combustion engines were also able to convert\u00a0lava\u00a0into MJ at a rate of 1MJ/t. In further versions you can still use lava as fuel in Stirling Engines. However, the ability to use lava as fuel was removed. You may use a wrench to fix it when it is broken. Just shift right-click it.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Combustion Engine See Also: Crafting GuideTutorial / Demonstrative Video's Overheating  Combustion engines can overheat, leading to a large explosion, if they are not properly cooled with water. Initially the engine will be blue. After being powered for\u00a0several minutes, the engine will change color depending on whether it is being cooled or not. The engine can be 1 of 4 colors: An uncooled combustion engine running on fuel will burn out in 9 minutes and 15 seconds. It will go from blue, to green, to yellow, to red, every 4 minutes. Engines powered by oil will heat up much more slowly.Cooling  Buildcraft version 2.2.0 introduced the need to cool combustion engines. combustion engines can be powered for a long time without overheating, provided you keep them cooled with water. A combustion engine that has become yellow/red for even a few minutes will require two buckets of water to regain \"green\" status. Water can be pumped into them to fill this need. Alternatively, buckets of water can be placed into the engine to keep it filled up. While active, the engine will consume the water stored inside it. The current water level can be seen in the engine's GUI. Pumping water into an engine is preferable to manually filling it with buckets because provided the supply is adequate and set up correctly it is guaranteed that the engines will not overheat. If a combustion engine is shut off, it will not turn back on until it cools to 20\u00ba C (or 0\u00ba C in earlier versions). When switched off after running, a combustion engine it will drain its internal water tank to initiate a rapid cooldown. When the internal tank is empty, it can take several minutes to cool down from maximum temperature, at which point it will resume normal operation. To avoid waiting for the engine to cool before turning it back on, which can take some time if it gets really hot, provided you don't mind losing the contained fuel it can be broken and immediately replaced which will enable it to start right away. As from Buildcraft 3.5.2, the temperature at which the engines start to consume water is 510\u00b0C and explosion temperature is just a little over 1000\u00b0C.Operation Without Cooling  Combustion engines build up heat per stroke. \u00a0In the current build the combustion engine will not start again after its power has been cut until its temperature has reached 20\u00ba C\u00a0(or 0\u00ba C in earlier versions). In the past, combustion engines could run forever without the need of water cooling by connecting the engine(s) to a redstone repeater 4/5 clock. \u00a0Having a continuous cycle of running/resting would keep the engine running at near zero heat, eliminating the need for the expensive pumping systems and the space-consuming piping that went with it. \u00a0This technique also eliminated the explosion hazards that buggy pipes often caused (It should be noted that on slower machines this procedure would produce lag with each switching cycle, which increased as more engines were added. \u00a0However, sitting your engine array at the bedrock level will allow the game to run smoothly).Power Source  The combustion engine runs on oil, fuel, or (prior to version 4.1.0) lava, which can be either deposited into the machine via waterproof pipes, or through putting a bucket  of your fuel of choice in the fuel slot one at a time. It is recommended to refine the oil into fuel using a refinery, as it is more efficient. A combustion engine also produces power at different rates based on the type of fuel: These values are currently being tweaked so will be different depending on BC version however fuel is always superior to oil, which is in turn superior to lava. So, even if your version is lower than 4.1.0, it is still not recommended to use lava. A combustion engine will run approximately 21 minutes with 1 bucket of fuel.Usage  Combustion engines need to be cooled by water, which can be pumped in with waterproof pipes, or added in with buckets. For this reason they are normally used in generation plants connected to machinery via conductive pipes, these generation plants can use space efficent designs that allow a redstone current, water, electrical pipes and fuel to access the engine. See the Pump page for information on tapping water sources.Energy  A Wooden Conductive Pipe can be used to draw energy from the engine to various machines, such as a Quarry. Making a loop with the Conductive Pipes will make a giant square of power. If you accidentally placed too much Fuel in an combustion engine, Conductive Pipes can be used to transfer the power over instead of wasting the Fuel. (Prior to BC 3.6, using Conductive Pipes resulted in a bit of energy loss: 1% per Stone pipe or just 0.01% per Gold pipe.)Troubleshooting Guide Auto Workbench  The Auto Workbench, previously called the Automatic Crafting Table, automates crafting.Setup Demonstration Usage  To start the automation, a pipe leading to the Automatic Crafting Table should provide the items necessary to the recipe. A wooden pipe connected to the table can then, when being powered by an engine (as of version 2.x, earlier versions use redstone charges), extract the newly crafted item. The crafting table will provide newly crafted items so long as it is supplied with ingredients. The crafting table can also be used as a vanilla crafting table, and is useful because you can put some of the items in and come back later with the ingredients not popping out of the table.Interaction with Chests  When an Automatic Crafting Table is placed directly next to a chest, it becomes capable of using the inventory of the chest as ingredients for crafting. This is slightly different than using a pipe in that the items never appear to enter into the table itself until the output is piped out of the table. For example, if crafting Planks from a single Wood, then one could put a chest next to the table filled with Wood (possibly piped into the chest) and the Wood would remain in the chest. Then, when a wooden pipe next to the table was powered, it would pump Planks out of the table, using the Wood in the chest as the source of the craft. This works with any item and any crafting recipe, and placement of the items in the chest does not matter as long as they are all present. If not all items are present either in the chest or in the crafting table itself, then the craft will not be done and the pipe will not get an output item. Note: Tables can only receive items from chests directly next to them, they cannot place output into chests. A pipe must be used to extract items. Chest inventory can not be used when using the table as a normal crafting table, it will only be used when piping output out of the table. In addition, the Automatic Crafting Table is unable to draw the resources it needs if they come from more than one chest (for example, placing sticks in one chest and iron in a different chest will NOT allow the table to create iron pickaxes); all recipe resources must be contained in the same chest.Non-used items  If an item is not consumed in the recipe, for example the philosopher's stone in equivalent exchange, another of the item in an adjacent chest will allow the recipe to work, without consuming the item.Oil Refinery  For setting up an oil refinery - see this.\nFor Oil Refineries in buildcraft 2 - see this. Oil Refineries are machines used to convert oil into fuel. Oil can be pumped into the machine using waterproof pipes or be placed inside with buckets. Fuel produced by the machine must be pumped out with a powered wooden waterproof pipe. The conversion rate of oil to fuel is 1:1, however considerably more energy (19x in BC2.2.14) can be extracted from fuel so refining is highly recommended. A refinery has three small internal tanks: the rear two are for oil and hold up to 8 buckets; the front one is for fuel (the output of the refinery) and holds up to 4 buckets. Ocasionally you may find water in the back tanks if your pump has drawn in water. This will stop the refinery working, and it will need to be picked up and replaced wasting any stored fuel. Simply connecting two tanks to the output of your pump, and putting one bucket of water into one tank and oil in the other will cause unwanted water to be removed into the tank. Pump the oil from the oil tank into the refinery with a redstone engine and wooden waterproof pipe. Breaking a refinery with your hands will destroy it. Use a stone pickaxe or better to get it back.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Refinery See: Crafting GuideSet Up Demonstration Energy usage  Refineries use a lot of energy, so it is probably best to supply it using Conductive Pipes. They require several Combustion Engines powering them at the same time to run at a reasonable rate. Information on engines energy production can be found on the Energy Quick Reference page.Efficiency indicator  As a refinery is running, two small pistons on its left and right will move up and down. The faster they move, the faster oil is being converted into fuel. The pistons will be of different colours depending on the refinery's speed and effeciency; red being the slowest and green being the fastest setting.Conductive Pipes  Transport Pipes can be combined with redstone to create conductive pipes. These pipes are the only type of pipes that can carry the energy produced by engines to machines that can normally be powered by engines (See: Automatic Building and Automatic Mining) The behavior of conductive pipes has changed drastically in version 3.70. Pipes can no longer explode, and have no loss. Instead various pipes can handle different power levels, e.g. cobblestone can only handle 8 MJ/t, while diamond can handle 1024 MJ/t, enough to carry power from 170 Combustion engines. As of BC 4, the pipes are called Kinesis Pipes.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1x Conductive Pipe See: Crafting GuideConductive Pipes in 3.70 and later versions Wooden Conductive Pipes  Wooden conductive pipes are used to extract the power from stirling and combustion engines (prior to BC 3.2 redstone engines were able to be used as well) and transfer the power into other conductive pipes. The engines must be facing the wooden conductive pipe to transfer power into it. Wooden conductive pipes are needed to transfer power into the other conductive pipes, as the other types of conductive pipe will not take the power out of the engines. Multiple engines can be connected to a single pipe, producing energy up to 32 MJ/t without capping the output power. Wooden pipes cannot connect to further wooden pipes; a normal conductive pipe must be used instead.Cobblestone Conductive Pipes  Cobblestone conductive pipes are used to transport the energy after it has been extracted by a wooden conductive pipe. The power capacity of the pipe is 8 MJ/t (80 RF/t).Stone Conductive Pipes  Stone conductive pipes are used to transport the energy after it has been extracted by a wooden conductive pipe. The power capacity of the pipe is 16 MJ/t (160 RF/t).Quartz Conductive Pipes  Quartz conductive pipes are used to transport the energy after it has been extracted by a wooden conductive pipe. The power capacity of the pipe is 64 MJ/t (640 RF/t).Iron Conductive Pipes  Iron conductive pipes are used to limit the amount of energy that flows through them to 2 MJ/t, 4 MJ/t , 8 MJ/t, 16 MJ/t, 32MJ/t. 64 MJ/t, or 128 MJ/t (20/40/80/160/320/640/1280 RF/t respectively). The capacity can be changed by right clicking with a wrench.Gold Conductive Pipes  Gold conductive pipes are used to transport the energy after it has been extracted by a wooden conductive pipe. The power capacity of the pipe is 256 MJ/t (2560 RF/t).Diamond Conductive Pipes  Diamond conductive pipes are used to transport the energy after it has been extracted by a wooden conductive pipe. The power capacity of the pipe is 1024 MJ/t (10240 RF/t).Note  When a pipe's power capacity is exceeded the power link turns red, indicating that the power traversing after the pipe is limited to the maximum capacity of the pipe in question. This does allow for energy storage, as Kenetic/Conductive pipes do not explode.Conductive Pipes in version 3.60 and earlier Wooden Conductive Pipes  Wooden conductive pipes are used to extract the power from stirling and combustion engines (prior to BC 3.2 redstone engines were able to be used as well) and places the power into the conductive pipes. The engines must be facing the wooden conductive pipe to transfer power into it. Wooden conductive pipes are needed to transfer power into the other conductive pipes, as the other types of conductive pipe will not take the power out of the engines. Wooden pipes cannot connect to further wooden pipes; a normal stone or gold conductive pipe must be used instead.Stone Conductive Pipes  Stone conductive pipes are used to transport the energy after it has been extracted by the wooden conductive pipes. These pipes lose 5% of their energy for each block travelled.Gold Conductive Pipes  Gold conductive pipes are more efficient at transporting energy. These pipes only lose 0.5% of their energy for every block traveled. Note: Gold conductive pipes have an energy limit of 10,000 MJ, exceeding this limit causes the pipe to explode. This limit is very hard to reach except if there is a loop in the circuit, which happens if gold conductive pipes form a square shape, and the energy builds up over a period of time.Gears  Gears are necessarry to craft Buildcraft Engines  and machines, like the Quarry. The gears must be constructed sequentially. The five tiers of gears are: Each tier requires four of its material, plus the previous gear.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Gear See: Crafting GuideTutorials  Whether you're a seasoned pro or a player who just started out and is wondering what the heck is that... thing walking around in front of you, you need a tutorial.Beginner Tutorials  Buildcraft Installation\u00a0- Step by step process for installing Buildcraft manually.

Click on the image to see it in a larger scale.Landmarks  Landmarks define the areas in which the Quarry, Filler and Template Drawing Table operate in. Depending on the shape required, more than one may be necessary (such as a three-dimensional shape for the builder). Landmarks can be placed on glass blocks.Recipe:  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Landmark See: Crafting GuideUsage  Placing a machine next to an activated landmark will cause all connected landmarks to pop off the ground. Be sure to pick them up again. (placing it on, or inside the red lines will do nothing.) Note: If using landmarks to define an area for a quarry, care must be taken as placing the quarry on or within the boundary will result in the loss of your quarry. Aside from defining the operational area for machines, landmarks can be useful for marking reference lines within the world for when you are building a structure by hand or trying to connect a tunnel to an exact location. Likewise, the blue beam that rises from the top of a redstone-powered landmark can be seen from a great distance, marking important locations that otherwise might be difficult to find again.Automatic Building  NOTE:Since BC 3.4.2 the builder is currently disabled due to major bugs (This is enabled in BC 7). The filler is therefore the only useful machine mentioned. These machines are needed to automatically build structures. Whether you want a large box, or a monument to pixel art, one of these will do it for you.Template Drawing Table  Builders require templates, and the Template Drawing Table is needed to fill in the templates with building instructions. Buildcraft 2.x onlyTemplate  A Template will store block position information only, so builders can recreate simple structures again and again.Architect Table  The architect table creates Blueprints and Templates for the Builder. Blueprints can place exact blocks instead of whatever the builder is given. Buildcraft 3.x onlyBlueprint  A Blueprint will store block type and position information, so builders can recreate complex structures again and again.Filler  The filler can clear areas, fill them in, or box them in, depending on the pattern you set it to.Builder  Given some power and materials, the builder will recreate any structure from a template or blueprint.\u00a0Disabled due to bugs in Buildcraft 3.4.2Assembly Table  Assembly tables are required to produce late-game items including\u00a0Redstone Chipsets,\u00a0Pipe Wires\u00a0and\u00a0Gates.Fluid Pipes  \u00a0 Fluid/Waterproof pipes were introduced in BuildCraft 2.2.0, originally named waterproof pipes, but as of BC4 they are called Fluid Pipes. Fluid pipes can be used to transport oil, fuel, water and lava to different locations. These pipes allow liquids to be transported into engines, tanks and oil refineries (Since it's obviously called a waterproof pipe).\u00a0When a pipe is not connected to anything, it will fill itself up instead of pouring the contents on the floor. Pipe Waterproof\u00a0is crafted by placing cactus green into the middle space on a crafting bench. This is used to create Fluid Pipes. Fluid pipes, depending on material can transport more or less fluid than other fluid pipes. This is represented as \"mb/t\" in game, which stands for millibucket per tick. 1000 mb = 1 bucket.Wooden Fluid Pipe (10 mb/t)  Wooden Fluid Pipes allow any buildcraft compatible liquids to be extracted from a buildcraft compatible liquid storage container and into an adjoining buildcraft compatible pipe network. This is done by placing a running buildcraft compatible engine next to the wooden fluid pipe. Also allows you to connect Cobblestone Fluid Pipes to Stone Fluid Pipes and vice versa. Wooden pipes can interconnect different type of pipes, but cannot connect to further wooden pipes; a normal cobblestone or gold fluid pipe must be used instead. Note that it is unnecessary to use a wooden fluid pipe to extract liquids from pumps.Cobblestone Fluid Pipe (10 mb/t)  Cobblestone Fluid pipe is a basic fluid pipe. It has a regular capacity for liquids, and it can transfer buildcraft compatible liquids along a network of fluid pipes. This pipe will not connect to any stone fluid pipes, similar to stone and cobblestone transport pipes not connecting.Stone Fluid Pipe (10 mb/t)  Stone Fluid pipe is a basic fluid pipe. It has a regular capacity for liquids, and it can transfer buildcraft compatible liquids along a network of fluid pipes. This pipe will not connect to any cobblestone fluid pipes, similar to stone and cobblestone transport pipes not connecting.Iron Fluid Pipe (10 mb/t)  The iron fluid pipe has up to five inputs and one output. It will send all incoming liquids in one direction. The direction can be changed by right-clicking the pipe with a Wrench in 2.0.x. The output direction can also be changed by redstone current. Every time it either loses or gains redstone power, it will cycle to a different output. However, it will never output to a Wooden Fluid Pipe. This combination of properties allows for players to accurately control its output direction from afar, via redstone wiring. In addition, this can be used to distribute liquids among multiple pipes by using a redstone clock. Players who have not mined enough redstone can simply use a Wrench.Gold Fluid Pipe (40 mb/t)  Gold fluid pipes will transport more liquid than stone or cobblestone waterproof pipes. They do not need a redstone current to operate, although a powered wooden waterproof pipe is still needed to extract liquids from tanks and some\u00a0machines (e.g. not the pump).Emerald Fluid Pipe (40 mb/t)  First available in BC 3.4.2 (for MC 1.4.7) Emerald fluid pipes will drain 4 times more liquid at once than wooden fluid pipes.Sandstone Fluid Pipe (10 mb/t)  First available in BC 3.2.0 (for MC 1.3.2) Sandstone fluid pipes connect to other kinds of transport pipes, allowing stone and cobblestone fluid pipes to connect, but will not connect to machines or any other blocks, allowing more compact piping around machines.Void Fluid Pipe (10 mb/t) *'BuildCraft Transport' Mod  As of this writing, it is unknown when first available. Void fluid pipes dispose of fluid.Buildcraft 3  Recipes from Buildcraft 4. Now updated with Buildcraft 4.x new items and blocks. You can watch a video which shows most of the new features here.Oil  Oil is a dark, viscous fluid that can be found floating in oceans and rivers around the world, from oil geysers or oil pools. Its primary use is to be refined into fuel to power combustion engines. Pumps and waterproof pipes or buckets can be used to transport oil around.Oil Spawns  Finding oil can be difficult due to its rarity. Oil deposits come in small, medium and large sizes: Medium deposits contain between 100 and 1,000 buckets of oil, large deposits between 2,000 and 17,000 buckets. As well, in Buildcraft v. 3.70+, there are oil fields. They are a separate biome, and have a chance of generating Ocean oil fields, as well as Desert oil fields. Ocean oil fields produce numerous large springs. Deserts hold less oil, but are more common.Extraction of Oil  Once you find oil, you may use a bucket to pick it up, but it is recommended to use a pump to continuously extract the oil, especially from medium and large deposits. Waterproof pipes must then be connected from the pump to a fluid storage block(e.g. tank, refinery or combustion engine). Combustion engines can run off oil, but the process is very inefficient.Refining Oil  To refine oil into fuel, it must first be piped or transported into a refinery. The refinery must then be powered by an engine or from connected conductive pipes. From the refinery, fuel must be ejected via waterproof pipes before it can be placed into storage in a tank.Flammability  Oil is highly flammable and can therefore, catch on fire. Unlike other flammable materials like wood, when oil catches fire from a nearby fire source, it does not disintegrate(i.e. disappear).  Within the config files, the flammability of oil is configurable.Notes Filler  The Filler is a machine added in version 1.6.5 to fill whole areas with blocks. It needs to be placed in front of a landmark to fill the area the landmarks are describing. (See the landmark page for how to use landmarks). It needs to be powered by a stirling engine or above. Fillers consume power (up to 100MJ/t in increments of 25MJ/block) whether they are activated or not.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Filler see: Crafting GuideVideo Tutorial Usage  Right-clicking on a filler brings up the filler interface. The top 3x3 area is for a filler pattern, and the resources area is where you place the materials to build with. There are 6 patterns that can be used. Patterns are made by placing Bricks and/or Glass in the top 3x3 area. When there is a valid pattern in the filler, the pattern icon will be visible in the small space in the top of the interface, and on the sides of the filler. The lights on top of the filler will also have turned green. A filler will fill in water blocks, but will not fill in lava or oil blocks at all. Sand or gravel can be used in the filler to fill in lava or oil, due to gravity affecting them. When the filler has finished its task, the lights will turn red again to indicate that it is finished. To start it working again on the same area, just remove and replace one of the bricks or glass from the pattern. A pickaxe is needed to retrieve a filler once placed.Filler Patterns  ! NOTE\u00a0! In 1.7.2 + filler patterns are not needed Note: clearing areas using the Flatten or Clear patterns version - 3.3.x: Clearing is done bottom layer to top layer. Items dropped can be collected version 3.4.x+: Clearing is done from top to bottom layer, items cannot be picked up in the first 1/2 second and vanish after a further half second. This change was made to stop the filler being used as a cheap quarry alternative. This can be disabled in the Buildcraft config file by setting the variable 'B:filler.destroy' to false.Tank  Tanks are liquid storage blocks capable of storing up to 16 buckets of any liquid, such as oil, fuel, water, or lava.Storing liquids  Tanks can be stacked by placing one above the other, increasing the overall capacity. Note that tanks will not connect when placed adjacent to each other. Liquids can be transported with waterproof pipes and deposited into tanks by connecting the pipe directly to the tank. When tanks are destroyed, regardless of method, they will lose all the stored liquid in them. Hence, making it mandatory to empty the tank first before removing it.Withdrawing liquids  Liquids can be withdrawn from tanks using buckets, or wooden waterproof pipes powered by an engine. The engine must be connected to the wooden waterproof pipe in order for the liquid to be extracted.Recipe Ingredients:  - 8 x Glass Block\nProduces: 1 x TankSetup Demonstration  A short video guide on how to use Tanks. More information can be found at Tutorials/Getting StartedBuilder  For the builder in buildcraft 3 - see this. The Builder was disabled from version 3.4.2 until Beta Release 6.0.8 due to major bugs. A builder is a machine that, when powered, will automatically build a structure based off a template, using resources supplied by the player. As a note, the template does not include the types of blocks in the original template, so that it will use whatever you put in the builder, and not in any pattern. If, however, a blueprint is used in place of a template, the types of blocks are recorded. Once placed, a stone pick or greater is required to retrieve the builder.Recipe  Ingredients: Produces: 1 x Builder see: Crafting GuideSetup Demonstration Usage  Place the builder in your world, and right click on it to display the builder interface. Place a template or blueprint into the template slot.The area that the\u00a0template\u00a0uses will be displayed in the world so you can adjust the position of the builder if needed. Put some resources into the builder, and supply some power, and the builder will automatically build the structure from the template. A steam engine or greater can power a Builder. 2 green status combustion engines burning fuel are required to fully power the builder. At this power level, the builder will place approximately 350 blocks a minute, or 5 and a half full stacks. If there is something in the area already, the builder will either remove it if it is not part of the template, or leave it there if it is. Blocks removed this way will remain on the ground, they will not pop out of the builder.Template Drawing Table Usage ", "Rebuild Wiki": "Rebuild Wiki Rebuild 2 Buildings Objective Locations City Hall  Needed for the \"Draft a Constitution\" Ending If you reclaim this building and you have got a certain number of squares (the amount depends on the map size) you can write a constitution to win the game.

The constant number of spaces is settled by the selected difficulty at the beginning.Minor recovery  Suburbs can sometimes be used by survivors to regain strength and heal completely in case that there is no available hospital. The recovery will take a day longer. However lots of diseases, bites from zombies and sickness cannot be treated. If serious health problems has attacked one of your survivors you'll be needing the anti-venom research at the lab and/or a HospitalRebuild  A suburb houses less survivors than an apartment does.

They are utilized by the factions of the Star Wars universe for the purpose of supporting infantry and troopers through transportation, defense, attacking, and ground, air, and space supremacy.Reboots Star Wars Battlefront  Vehicles are an element in DICE's 2015 reboot of the Star Wars Battlefront series, Star Wars Battlefront, though they operate differently from the original games. As Star Wars Battlefront only takes place in the setting of the Star Wars original trilogy, vehicles are less prevalent then before, though they continue to be powerful tools for supporting infantry and ground forces. Certain vehicles are only available on certain maps. Unlike in the previous titles, vehicles are spawned in game by using blue tokens scattered around the maps. Once picked up, these tokens can be activated to spawn in either ground vehicles for the Galactic Empire or starfighters for the Galactic Empire or Rebel Alliance. Larger vehicles, such as the AT-AT walker, as well as gunships such as the U-Wing introduced in the Star Wars Battlefront: Rogue One: Scarif expansion, are on rails, meaning the player cannot control the movement of the vehicle but instead its weapons system, while the AT-ST is fully controllable. In addition to these vehicles, Star Wars Battlefront introduces hero vehicles based on iconic ships that appear in the Star Wars original trilogy movies. At launch, these vehicles were the Millennium Falcon and Slave I; the Star Wars Battlefront: Death Star expansion added in Red Five and the TIE Advanced X1.Star Wars Battlefront II  Vehicles return in DICE's 2017 sequel to their reboot of the Star Wars Battlefront series, Star Wars Battlefront II. Vehicles have a much larger role in Star Wars Battlefront II and are purchased in-game using Battle Points, which are earned by completing objectives, accumulating eliminations, and play time. Once a player gains enough Battle Points to spawn into a vehicle, they select from available vehicles in the spawn menu of the match. Battle Points are reset every match, and thus do not carry over. Unlike most previous games, vehicles, like infantry, are tied to classes. Like the previous game, certain vehicles are tied to certain maps depending on the map's design and the setting in which the map takes place; thus, not all vehicles are available on all maps.Starfighters  Starfighters are vehicles that are used for flight in space and skies. They are tied to the Fighter, Interceptor, and Bomber classes. They are primarily played in Starfighter Assault but can also provide support to infantry and control the skies in Galactic Assault. Galactic Republic Separatists Rebel Alliance Galactic Empire Resistance First OrderAtmospheric Vehicles  Atmospheric vehicles are vehicles that are controlled on the ground in Galactic Assault, though some are also capable of flight at low altitudes in skies. Atmospheric vehicles are tied to the Armor class, which includes tanks and walkers, Artillery, the largest vehicles which are on rails and sometimes act as objectives, and Speeders, which either hover above the ground or are flown at low altitudes. Galactic Republic Separatists Rebel Alliance Galactic Empire Resistance First OrderHero Vehicles  Hero Vehicles, introduced in Star Wars Battlefront, return in Star Wars Battlefront II. They are only playable in Starfighter Assault and, like other vehicles and heroes and villains, they are purchased with battle points. Most pilots of the hero vehicles have an equivalent hero that can be played in the ground based game modes. Like ground heroes in Galactic Assault, hero vehicles are \"cross-era,\" meaning that they all can be played on any map regardless of the era that the map takes place in. Light Side Dark SideOriginals Overview Land Vehicles  Land Vehicles typically are suited for dealing with infantry, and are useful when contending with Heroes. Land Vehicles have decent mobility and has weapons capable of eliminating infantry quickly. However, most land vehicles are vulnerable to Rocket Launchers and other explosives, and they do not fare well against other vehicles. It should be noted that Heroes cannot use these vehicles. Land Vehicles can be found around Command PostsTypes of Land Vehicles Space Vehicles  Space vehicles are specially-outfitted aircraft meant to engage in battles in space. They can fly at high speeds, and possess firepower in the form of laser cannons and proton bombs/torpedoes. Some Heroes have a unique Space Vehicle to use in the battle, while others use the default Fighter. Space Vehicles can be found inside Battleships or in Hangar Command Posts (Elite Squadron only).Types of Space Vehicles Types of Land Vehicles  Galactic Empire Galactic Republic Separatist Alliance Rebel Alliance Other VehiclesTypes of Air Vehicles (BFI only)  Galactic Empire Galactic Republic Separatist Alliance Rebel AllianceSpace Vehicles (BFII only)  Galactic Empire Galactic Republic Separatist Alliance Rebel AllianceCapital Ships (BFII only)  Galactic Empire Galactic Republic Separatist Alliance Rebel AllianceVehicles added from Renegade Squadronand Elite Squadron  Galactic Empire Rebel AllianceScenery Vehicles  These Vehicles can only be seen, and have no impact on the battle.Cut Vehicles  Key: (?) = UnconfirmedLinks Heroes and Villains Overview  In the Star Wars: Battlefront Series, major heroes and villains are unlockable during matches by attaining a certain kill or point total. Only one player per team may control the hero (usually the best, unless the distribution is set on random), except for those playing on Assault Mode on Mos Eisley. The heroes have very powerful weapons (e.g. Lightsabers) and are harder to kill than normal enemies. The majority of heroes and villains carry a lightsaber for primary weapon, however some will carry powerful blaster variants. In Battlefront 1, this weapon is a one strike kill while in Battlefront 2, it requires on average two strikes to kill a unit. Instead of having a health bar like normal infantry, the heroes have a lightsaber of health that slowly goes down, but can be recharged by killing adversaries. When a hero is on the battlefield,\u00a0the music will change to a hero-specific song that plays\u00a0until the hero is defeated. Most heroes have a theme song, with the exception of heroes like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Darth Vader.\u00a0All in all, heroes and villains are very effective to have in battle as they can tip the balance in your favor, and one may feel very powerful when playing as one. Unfortunately, they may not always be useful for an unbalanced map. For example, when\u00a0Rebels have Chewbacca  as their hero whist the Empire has Darth Vader, which could make the map far more challenging for the player and their team. Despite this they can be extremely useful in the game.Fighting (Battlefront II)  There are two ways of fighting jedi in Battlefront II-fighting against them and fighting as them.Fighting against Jedi Playing as a Jedi Galactic Republic Heroes Galactic Empire Villains CIS Villains Rebel Alliance Heroes Non-playable Weapons  The following are weapons found in the Star Wars: Battlefront Series:Primary Attacks Blaster Rifles Blaster Pistols Commando Pistols Rocket Launchers Sniper Rifles Shotguns/Bolt Caster Grenade Launchers Others Secondary Attacks Grenades Others Buffs Award Weapons Links Glitches  Please submit glitches by map.

Elite Squadron follows the story of X2, a clone of a Jedi, struggle against his clone brother, X1, throughout both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War and into the New Republic era.Star Wars Battlefront (DICE Reboot)  Electronic Arts presentation at E3 2013, a teaser was released along with a confirmation of Battlefront release. This Battlefront is not meant to be a sequel, but rather a reboot to the franchise. The game was developed by DICE and published under Electronic Arts and was released on November 17th, 2015 in America and November 19th in Europe and Australia.Base Command  Base Command is a free turn-based strategy game that serves as a tie-in to Star Wars Battlefront. Players can log in and earn credits and experience for playing the game, and can use their Star-Cards unlocked in Battlefront in this game. It can be played from Star Wars Battlefront's website and companion app.Star Wars Battlefront II (DICE)  Shortly after the reveal, Bernd Diemer, Creative Director of Battlefront II, revealed the game will not feature a Season Pass, sighting a desire to keep the community whole. In regards to what will replace the Season Pass, Diemer stated that DICE will have \"something different in mind that will allow you to play longer.\" This was later revealed to be post-launch content seasons, where all players would get access to new DLC's. Mark Webster, executive producer of Battlefront II, announced on April 15th, 2017, at Star Wars Celebration in Orlando, Florida, that the worldwide release of the game would be November 17th, 2017, with those who pre-order getting the game three days early, and those with EA Access on November 9th. On the 5th of October, it was announced that Battlefront players on the PC, Xbox and PS4 would get a chance to test out the game in Star Wars Battlefront II\u2019s official Beta. The Beta was downloadable from the 6th of October, and was intended to end on the 9th of October, but so many people were playing it and giving feedback that EA extended the end date to the 11th of October. At EA Play 2017, the first multiplayer gameplay trailer for the game was unveiled, along with a livestream featuring the Galactic Assault on Naboo: Theed. It was also confirmed that the post-release content would be free, starting with the first season including heroes Finn and Captain Phasma and the planet Crait from The Last Jedi.Cancelled entries Star Wars: Battlefront III  Star Wars: Battlefront III was set to be the fifth game in the Star Wars: Battlefront video game series. (After Battlefront I, II, and Renegade Squadron and Elite Squadron) but officially a third installation of the baseline series including the original Battlefront and Battlefront 2. Although Lucasarts never officially claimed that the third installment would be made; as it was a leaked Pre-Alpha footage from Free Radical that made the claim public in 2008. But soon, Free Radical's shift their focus on finishing their other games, the \"Battlefront 3\" project was canceled. In 2009, the rumors of Battlefront III development shifted over to Rebellion Developments. However, the outcome turned out to be Elite Squadron. A small preview was shown on GameSpy and the game was thought to be presented at E3 2010, but - to the dismay of many players, it was not. Spark Unlimited became the focus over the next few months due to the video analysis by a YouTuber named \"Tuggiegamesreview\" and their website's subsequent match-up with Lucasarts own website concerning an \"Unannounced Game\" which states: \"We are in FULL PRODUCTION of a high-profile, popular game property for a major publishing partner. With the public disclosure expected sometime in 2012, we are looking for innovative and creative professionals to bring to life a Triple-A game for an awaiting, highly critical audience. Employing agile techniques (SCRUM) we are developing this product utilizing our experiences with the Unreal engine.\" But, again, this ends with disappointed fans as the game was revealed to be Lost Planet 3.Star Wars: Battlefront Online  In 2010, it was rumored that an online-only Battlefront title was in development by Slant Six Games. However, it was later revealed that this game was canceled after the developer missed its 2010 release deadline.Star Wars: First Assault  In 2012, Lucasfilm ltd. purchased the domain name starwarsfirstassault.com. Soon after, leaked concept art and gameplay surfaced, revealing it to be a multiplayer shooter by Lucasarts downloadable in the X-Box Live Arcade. However, the game was never released before Lucasarts was shut down in early 2013. It would have featured infantry combat between Rebel Soldiers and Stormtroopers, and many viewed it as a prototype to a future version of Battlefront III. It would have included microtransactions.External links Star Wars: Battlefront II  Star Wars: Battlefront II, also shortened to \"Battlefront II\", and alternatively abbreviated as \"SW:BF2\" or \"SWBF2\" is a first-/third-person shooter video game developed by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts, and was released in North America on November 1, 2005, for the Xbox, Playstation Portable, PC, and the PlayStation 2. The PC variant comes in two type of disks: CD-ROM, which comes with four discs, and DVD-ROM, which has only one disc. It is the second game of the highly successful Star Wars: Battlefront Series and a sequel to the original Star Wars: Battlefront. There are several differences between Battlefront II and the original Battlefront, such as playable Jedi characters, two new unit classes, space battles, and story-based campaigns. The release date coincided with the release of Revenge of the Sith on DVD. Battlefront II expands upon the original game's single-player experience with mission-based objectives drawn from Attack of the Clones' Battle of Geonosis to The Empire Strikes Back's Battle of Hoth. It is a story-based campaign told from the view of an unidentified 501st clone trooper; it revolves around the 501st Legion as the unit evolves from the Galactic Republic's Clone Troopers to Imperial Stormtroopers. The plot spans more than 16 new locations, many from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. Many maps that came from the original Battlefront were edited to fit more accordingly in the storyline, such as the Naboo battlefield, which was originally Plains, but due the clones' lack of action upon the Invasion of Naboo conflict between droids and Gungans, the setting is shifted to Theed. Also included are battles from the original trilogy, such as fights aboard the Tantive IV, Princess Leia's blockade runner shown immediately at the beginning of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. On May 31, 2014, GameSpy (the online service that was hosting Battlefront II's multiplayer at the time) was shut down, and with it went the game's online functionality. However, three years later on October 4, 2017, Disney announced that online multiplayer has been restored as well as crossplay between the Steam and GOG versions of the game. Being a successful hit, the game are now considered on the following: Xbox Platinum Hits, a Sony Greatest Hits, Xbox Classics, a Lucasarts Fan Favorite, and Playstation Platinum.Gameplay Basics and changes  There are several differences in overall gameplay between the first and second Battlefront installments. The first is an attempt to add realism to missions by adding objectives and changing the way orders are issued. The second group of changes revolves around a point system, which determines which units can be used, special abilities for players, and rank. In campaign mode, in addition to the basic tasks of capturing command posts and killing enemy troops, certain objectives must be met for a mission to be successful. These missions may include destroying a specific target, recovering an item, or keeping the opposing force from overrunning a position. In these situations, enemy reinforcements are unlimited and will continue to be deployed until the objective is completed. While controlling troops, one of the most striking differences between the original and the sequel is the method of issuing orders. Unlike the original Battlefront, in which up, down, left, and right on the directional pad each issued a specific command to nearby groups, commands are now issued by using the targeting reticule to select a specific soldier and pressing the up button. The system chooses which command seems appropriate; for infantry troops, the up button toggles between follow me and move out. In vehicles, the commands are either get in or get out. An infantry trooper targeting a vehicle can order it to stop. Although the variety of commands is much more limited and issuing them is more complicated, the new aiming feature allows users to select the exact class of trooper they want to help them, as well as order vehicles to stop from a considerable distance. The number of troops at the player\u00b4s command is based on the player\u00b4s rank (see squad leader ranks below). There is a new feature in Battlefront II called the Point System. The point system is vital to being able to play special unit types, such as advanced unit classes as well as heroes and villains. Points can be earned by killing enemies, capturing command posts, or destroying vehicles; they can also be deducted by doing negative actions such as harming teammates. Before the advanced units are unlocked, they will be marked by silhouettes; Heroes and Villains will not be on the unit selection table unless if the player does not choose if they want to be the hero/villain or not. By accomplishing certain objectives, players will earn medals during gameplay. These medals can assist the player by giving them upgraded weapons and gameplay traits. There are four levels in which the players medals are ranked; Green, Elite, Veteran, and Legendary. Once the player gets a certain medal to Legendary status, the effect will be permanent.Third Factions  On certain levels, there are three-way battles between the two normal factions and a third, neutral group. Although neutral sides are not controlled by the players outside of Hunt Mode, some of these forces will shift their neutrality in certain game modes.Units  Battlefront II features a total of nine units for each playable faction, with four regular units, two space units, two advanced units, and one hero or villain.Basic Units Special units Space units  These units are only available in space battles, each having their own useful trait.Jedi or Sith Heroes  Heroes and Villains are playable in Battlefront II after achieving a certain amount of points. Unlike regular units' health, the heroes and villains' health will slowly drain if they do not find enemies to kill. Dying will cause the hero or villain to retreat and depending on the game mode will be selectable again after a peroid of time has passed.Vehicles  Battlefront II features three classifications of ships: planetary vehicles, starfighters, and capital ships. For ground vehicles, the four factions come equipped with various models of scout vehicles, medium assault vehicles, assault walkers, command transports, and mounts. Scout vehicles are quick and have little armor, whereas medium assault vehicles have superior armor and firepower. Assault walkers are more powerful than the medium assault vehicles, but slower. The command transports, however, are the most powerful vehicles in the game (only available as the Republic\u00b4s AT-TE and the Empire\u00b4s AT-AT). Additionally, players may use mounts and special craft, such as the tauntaun and the snowspeeder. All vehicles except the Tauntaun and scout vehicles have a critical hit area. A hit in that area will much more damage than a normal shot. Each faction (Rebels, Empire, Republic, CIS) features four different types of starfighter; bombers, fighters, scout craft, and transports. In space battles, capital ships such as Star Destroyers are present. Each faction has one capital ship. The capital ships can be attacked from the outside and the inside by destroying several vital points throughout the inside of the ship. Capital ships of the Galactic Civil War era are larger than those of the Clone War era. There are smaller ships around capital ships (how many depending on the map) called frigates. Frigates of the Clone War era are larger than those of the Galactic Civil War era.Gametypes  There are many game modes in which players can play offline and online.Conquest  The most basic game mode. The objective is to capture all command posts or deplete the enemy until all of their numbers are gone. Whichever team accomplishes this first wins the round. This was the most popular mode.1 Flag CTF  This is Capture the Flag, but with one flag and both teams fighting for it. Whoever captures the flag and returns it to their command post for a certain amount of times wins.2 Flag CTF  This is Capture the Flag, but with two flags: one in each base. The players must take the enemy flag and bring it back to their respective base a certain amount of times to win the battle, whilst simultaniously defending their own flag.Assault  It is essentially like Conquest, but the main objective is gaining points. Whoever gains the most points available first wins the round. This game type is seen more during space battles, as Conquest usually rules it out on land battles. There is a special type of Assault mode on Mos Eisley, where the player can battle it out with Heroes versus Villains. Each kill counts as a point towards their team.Hunt  Hunt is a game mode where players can battle with factions that aren't normally playable, but played a major part in the Star Wars movies. Some factions that are playable in normal game modes are playable in Hunt, but only allow specific units.XL  XL is a game mode similar to Assault except you have to kill 350 units to win the game with a lot of units spread throughout the map. XL is only available on Geonosis, Hoth and Kashyyyk due to their larger size. XL is mostly available on custom maps made by modders, although it's only available on PC by default.Game modes Campaign  The 501st Legion is an elite Clone Trooper/Stormtrooper unit who worked under the command of Darth Vader. They can be seen marching into the Jedi Temple as part of Order 66 in Revenge of the Sith. They soon become known as \"Vader's Fist\". The campaign portion of the game puts players in control of the 501st, from their second battle on Mygeeto through the Battle of Hoth. (The 501st's first battle on Geonosis is the subject of the game's tutorial.)Clone Wars Missions  Chapter 1: Fall of the Old Republic - This chapter takes place during the Clone Wars, as the 501st Legion attempts to defeat the Separatist droid armies and strengthen the Republic's hold on the galaxy.Galactic Civil Wars Missions  Chapter 2: Rise of the Empire - The Galactic Republic has fallen. Emperor Palpatine has created a new Galactic Empire to rule in its place, and Darth Vader has taken command of the 501st, replacing Republic uniforms and equipment with Stormtrooper armor and weapons.Cross-era story missions  The missions Preventive Measures and Tying up Loose Ends are Empire vs. CIS. In these two missions a rogue Geonosian called Gizor Delso has reactivated the Droid control beacon on Mustafar, and the 501st must go to the planet, shut down the droids, and kill the Geonosian engineer. These are the only missions that are Empire vs. CIS The mission Changing of the Guard is Empire vs. Clones. In this storyline Kamino has been secretly growing a new Clone Army to help the Rebels fight back against the Empire. Darth Vader hires Boba Fett for his knowledge of the inner workings of the Clone Facility, and sends the 501st to Kamino to destroy the Cloning Facility and growing cylinders.PSP missions  The PSP has 3 exclusive campaigns focusing on different areas of combat. The player has no allies on the battlefield but has unlimited lives. Each campaign has 4 missions, in which heroes can be used.Galactic Conquest  The player will start off as any main faction in the game and will have to progress around the galaxy claiming planets by winning battles. Along the way, the player can buy units to deploy on the battlefield, as well as bonuses, such as deploying a hero or enhancing blasters. The player will have to conquer every planet to win and will face an AI, if not another player.Training  The Training mission is the tutorial on how to play Battlefront II. It is the unofficial first level to the Rise of the Empire campaign, but can be skipped without taking anything away from the Rise of the Empire story. It is played on Geonosis and is displaying the Battle of Geonosis, the first battle of the Clone Wars. Doing this will have no effect whatsoever and can be played any time.Downloadable content  On December 19, 2005, LucasArts introduced a new downloadable level for the Xbox version of Star Wars Battlefront II through Xbox Live. The upgrade adds a Hero Assault Mode to Kashyyyk, which provides a new alternative to Mos Eisley for the Hero Assault mode. Another Xbox Live download was made available on January 31, 2006, with two new playable hero characters (Kit Fisto and Asajj Ventress) as well as four maps from the original Star Wars: Battlefront. Each of the new boards (Yavin 4: Arena, Bespin: Cloud City, Rhen Var Harbor and Rhen Var Citadel) has Conquest, Capture-the-Flag, and Hero Assault modes (including the two new characters). Rhen Var Harbor also has a Hunt mode where the native species are Wampas. In addition, Hero Assault modes were also added to the following maps: Coruscant, Mygeeto, and Naboo. In late March 2006, the game was added to the Backwards Compatibility List for the Xbox 360, and is now playable on both the original Xbox and the Xbox 360. [1] Lucasarts released a Patch on February 15, 2006. [2]. The patch also included support for additional maps, and the modding tools were subsequently released on February 21. [3] October 2, 2017 saw the release of an Official Patch released for the Steam & GOG versions of the game. This patch included GOG Galaxy integration, effectively restoring the game's multiplayer aspect.[4]Critical response  IGN claimed that the game suffers from problems remaining from the original Battlefront, such as a lack of challenging AI characters in single player mode. Computer-controlled opponents and allies tend to run headlong into gunfire, wander off ledges, and walk into walls. IGN felt that this, along with redundant use of planets featured in previous \"Star Wars\" settings, were problems carried over from the original \u00b4\u00b4Battlefront\u00b4\u00b4.[5] IGN also noted that the complex controls and graphics of space battles and all-hero battles can make online multiplayer games virtually unplayable. Moreover, IGN felt that Lag times and high ping rates can cause the action to become choppy, objects and players to disappear, and weapons to become ineffective. [6] A related criticism from Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) is the longer load time needed between boards, which is also caused by more detailed graphics and larger maps than the original Battlefront.[7] For the Playstation 2 version, many have complained about the lack of a patch to resolve most gameplay issues, as well as having a server with large amounts of AI without crashing. In addition the omission of fan favorite maps (e.g. Cloud City, Bespin Platforms) from the original Battlefront, and the subsequent XBOX Live-only addition of these maps have caused great disappointment among fervent fans of the game with other systems. However, many of the original Battlefront maps are available to download on some fansites. Minor fan complaints also mention the abrupt and inconclusive story ending of the campaign which stops at the Battle of Hoth without at least concluding with Return of the Jedi. A possible explanation, however, could be that since the Imperials historically lose the Battle of Endor, the player would have to also lose in order to conclude the war as it happened. An argument also has been made about the age of the 501st's men around that time, because clones age twice as fast as humans. Official criticism of the PSP version revolves mainly around the platform\u00b4s ability to handle the game, rather than the game itself. Although the graphics were slightly stripped down to improve load times, EGM found \u00b4\u00b4Battlefront\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4s controls to be too complex for the PSP\u00b4s simple controls. EGM cited further problems with the game\u00b4s slowdown in multiplayer mode.[8]. Many players also cited dislike for the PSP version due to its ommitence of the story-line mode from the console versions depicting the Rise of the Empire, and the ability to enter large enemy ships like the Star Destroyer and damage them from the inside, probably due to the technical limitations of the PSP system. A list of differences between the PSP version and others can be found here. Battlefront 2 was also criticized for its bland textures, lack of popular battlefields from the first game such as Bespin: Platforms, and the AI unit count, which was decreased dramatically.Trivia External links Things we want in future Battlefront games \u00a0Dear DICE:\u00a0  As you know, all hardcore Star Wars gamers and fans alike feel the need of future Star Wars Battlefront titles. Please do not make it into a disappointment. So thus, as a behalf of Battlefront Wiki, I, Anakin Skyobiliviator, will list the opinion of my own and others of this wiki, what we expect from the future of Battlefront. I know some ideas sound unreasonable, and others seem to take too much memory, but know that we are just die-hard fans that would like to see things actually happen and not just some rumor. Despite of our differences, we all have similar expectations, the most prominent being a request for a massive ground to sky to space map. For more info on the need of the game, please look on Facebook, where an identical listings are liked by users. Link: [1]By: Hulk628  Keep all maps from the first 2 games Escort ships that were cut from battle front 2 (see this link [2]) New heroes for the republic: New heroes for the for the CIS: New heroes for the Rebel alliance: New heroes for the empire: When vehicles destroyed the remains of them stay there for the rest of the battle New maps When life supports are destroyed in space battles people aboard the flagship get health drainage until its repaired NO CUSTOMIZED CLASSES! The soldier class style was better in the first 2 games! (the soldier class, heavy class, special class, ect) Add galactic conquest or I will shoot you. Add all instant action modes from battlefront 2 and maybe a few more. Like maybe these: Add hero ships that spawn when a certain hero spawns on some maps. Like Darth Vader spawns the tie advanced and Han Solo or Chewbacca or Lando could spawn the millennium falcon.By: Death  Personally, I am a fan of Call of Duty, however knowing how Dice is all about the slow soldier progression as it was in Battlefield Series (which is why i never got into it), Can you do a token system where the player gets tokens for a kill and depending on how the kill was executed(headshot, accuracy, etc), could that go towards your soldiers tier for unlocking a new tier? Also, How about \"kill streaks\"? Killstreaks that are more oriented to how long timewise the people get to play as a jedi. And the jedi gets to sever limbs and there is blood. What is a battle when there is no blood? Mobile spawn units Dynamic Maps where when you set off a satchel charge, there is a crater, however the crater cant get any deeper and it would be a great way to make instant cover. In the Hoth Map, I felt the turrets were way too.. under powered? I want to have my game to be chock full of screen shaking explosions. I WANT TO SEE MY CHARACTERS FEET! I also want to have ERA's where you can fight in. So when you say \"Find a game\", you can go ahead and play in the rebel/empire era or the clone wars era. You know, that stuff. I want to have changable retcles. The circle was too screen covering. I would want my recon droid to change every map. On the empire, you had a spherclce looking droid and when im on a ship I would want it to be able to be the droid that can be deployed on the ground and can go into vents in the walls so it can escape. Minigames: Ship races, shooting range, Deathstar Planet explosions. The ability to pilot a huge star destroyer and take it around the map. In between maps, instead of a loading screen, at the end of a battle, if your in a ship your screen becomes 3rd person of the ship your on and the victorious player get to see there ship go into hyperspace between maps.By: Anakin Skyobiliviator By: King Of All 42 By: Chance.purvis By: Obi wan masterexxx10 By: EternalBlaze  This basically sums up everything I want in a nutshell.By: Sam2011 By: Haldir By: Darth Plagueis By: Clank By: Darth Xren  It should be more realistic, and the environment should be destructible. XL mode should basically be the normal mode. Real battles have heaps and heaps of soldiers, firing nonstop. There should be a \"realistic mode\", where its basically one shot one kill (unless you get shot in the leg or arm). It really doesn't take 5 shots in the chest to kill someone. And these are lasers, not plain old bullets. DMM and Euphoria should be integrated into BFIII. Battlefield texture and detail should be greatly improved. Jedi moves should be enhanced. There should be something called \"Jedi Mode\" which in short means that when you are a Jedi (or Sith) the game utilizes the controls from Episode III, which will give extremely better moves.By: Boba fett 32  Well i am hoping for some new and old troopers such a:By: TuggieGameReviews By: shocktrooper11 By: Endordude  {C}This is just some things that would make this game cooler, i know you can't add everyone's ideas in it, but i hope this gave you some insite on what we want if your makeing it Spark. Thanx for reading! And May the force be with you all.By: TI154th  I would like Star Wars Battlefront 3 to have the following features. I would love to be playing a Space Assault match and have face the Alliance Navy and the Black Sun or the Zann Consortium Navy at the same time. The tactical options available to players would go up greatly, you could fight defensively and let the A.I. kill the other player, or if the other players are good enough kill the A.I. at the right time to deny the other players points, OR let them over stretch there bounds and take there territory/capital ships from them while they were trying to fight the A.I.By:8-Bit Legacy By: Theta-192  Yah, I know a game like this would be expensive, time consuming, and a bit much really. But, if lucasarts had spent that 300 million on a game like this instead of ToR!!

But, in the new game, can DICE please remove or fix these issues?: More to add!By: Anonymous  Note: If you are not signed up, write in this list and must share this list with other users. Do NOT delete or add to another user's list. Most people ask for things that they want. I am first asking for things personally I DON'T Want. Also, the things I do want are things few have even thought of. DON'TS: -No protected spawns. YOU MUST FIGHT. YOU MUST PLAY TO WIN. If you don't, then you deserve to be spawn killed over and over again. Protected Spawns in Battlefield caused more harm than good, allowing players to sit at spawn with a sniper and not play the objective, resulting in many boring matches where about only 2-3 people are actually playing on each team. -No weapon unlocks. This ruined Halo 4 when it tried it. Do you honestly think it won't harm Battlefront? PLEASE. Gimme a break. Everyone would immediately be complaining about weapon balance. Let's just skip the headache and keep the static load outs. To make everyone happy, why can't there be custom heroes instead, and perhaps even make a special gamemode that is all-heroes for it? (More on that later.) -No custom skins for regular troops. The last thing we need is rainbow-colored Stormtroopers, and graffitied Battle Droids. Again, delegate this feature to a custom hero. -No spawn on teammate. The last thing you need is for an enemy to multiply like a virus on your position. It makes defending a post or clearing out a strong position nearly impossible, which has been made clear by the Battlefield games. Mobile spawn points are fine, so long as they are NOT every single vehicle in the game. -No heavy-class point unlock shenanigans. Whadda know, something that isn't from Battlefield! Also, these classes shouldn't be 'balanced' to fit with the standard soldiers. More on that in the 'Do's' section. DO'S: -Custom Heroes (Yeah, I've mentioned it several times by now). You can earn experience and unlocks much in the same way as the Battlefield games BUT it is only to create custom hero classes which are only available when certain criteria is met, which usually means you have to be the match MVP. However, I do not want it to be a 'killstreak' like it was in SW Battlefront II. More on that in the next topic. -Dynamic Control Points. What this means is that I would like it if Control Points were made even MORE IMPORTANT than ever, by adding certain 'perks' that come with capturing them. These perks include the ability to use a set number of 'special' units or weapons. Remember how I said heavy classes shouldn't have point unlocks? Well, I think instead they should be linked directly to the post, much in the same way a Vehicle is. For example, if you are CIS and capture a certain point, either a few Super Battle Droids or Droidekas should be available to spawn into (which you can get through the 'Change Class' mechanic). Conversely, if the Republic captures that same point, there should be a few mini-gun laser cannons or jet-packs to pick up or equip to your character on the spot. Other special units that might spawn out of certain command posts besides the heavy classes is Commando units or native units. Commandos are a no-brainer, but native units include Geonosians, Midget Spider Droids, Probe Droids, Wookies and the like. These are unique to the planet the battle takes place on, and are determined by the faction that controls the point that spawns them. -Dynamic Control Points TWO. Yep, there wasn't enough room in one bullet point, so this topic gets two. Remember 'Levelotion' in BattleField 4? To be honest, it was kinda gimmicky. However, this can become something far more important in the new SW Battlefront. Remember that scene in the Battle of Geonosis in the movie 'Attack of the Clones'? The one where several artillery lasers take down a capital ship core trying to escape? What if that wasn't just for special effects and eye candy, but a HUGE FACTOR in the game? Let's say that the capital ship core is a destructible command post for the CIS. But the CIS have a decision to make. While on the ground it functions as a normal command post, but with obviously a lot of vehicles to choose from and an assortment of special units to deploy. HOWEVER, if the CIS decide to, they can send that post into space. Why would they want to do that? Well, if the capital ship core escapes the map, the CIS get a large reinforcement bonus, much in the same way the 'garrison' bonus affected play in previous titles. In a pinch, it can keep the match going. But there is a driving factor that forces the CIS to make a decision: the Republic is trying to destroy these posts, and they start out with more reinforcements than the CIS does in this particular battle. If the Republic manages to destroy these posts before they make it to space, then the CIS no longer has either option of having the bonus units and vehicles OR the extra reinforcements. Also, then it plays out exactly like the movie and the capitol ship core crashes to the ground, covering the battlefield in a dust cloud for awhile, allowing the Republic to push forward in the thick blanket of dust that makes it hard for CIS fighters to strafe them (this is provided the capital core was in the air). How's that for some Levelution? This same concept can happen in other battles like the Battle of Hoth, where if transport ships get away the Rebals get more reinforcements at the expense of fighters and special units.\u00a0Sincerely Yours,\u00a0  And various other gamers.See Also: Clone Sharpshooter  The Clone Sharpshooter is the sniper unit for the Galactic Republic. Used to pick off enemies from long-range, their gun has increased zoom, allowing for accurate shots at longer ranges. Generally you will have to aim slightly ahead of the enemy unit to make sure you hit it. You have to always aim for the head, otherwise, you may not be able to kill him which allows him to see the tracer that your shots leave behind which will give away your position to the enemy and he can easily evade you or find cover, preventing you from killing/destroying him. In Star Wars Battlefront 2, the Clone Sharpshooter and his fellow sniper classes will not be able to use the targeting reticule if not zoomed in-- but this is no hindrance to experienced players, who often become quite good at 'hipfiring'. An effective combo is to fire the rifle at a unit to knock down his health to a critical level, then switch to the pistol and fire rapidly to finish him of. It can be challenging to get a head shot on any unit other than the Super Battle Droid, as the heads of most other droids are quite thin. An easy way to do it is to get up close to one, though this also puts your life at risk, given the Clone Sharpshooter's below-average health. The best planets to use him are: Geonosis, because there are few hiding places and the map is very open, Mos Eisley, as there are lots of hiding places and elevated positions perfect for snipers but there is also a lot of cover for your enemies to use, Kamino, as there are lots of elevated and lower platforms and many turrets that display only the head, and Kashyyyk, as there is a whole elevated module and, like Geonosis, the map is very open. Unlike a traditional army, where snipers are picked from the best shooters, the clone troopers all possess the same characteristics regarding eyesight, accuracy, steadiness, and patience. However, the clone sharpshooters have received special \u201cflash training,\u201d teaching them the intricacies of being a good sniper. They have also trained exclusively with the modified DC-15x Sniper Rifle. On the battlefield, the Clone Sharpshooter is primarily responsible for one task: disrupting enemy activity by picking off crucial infantry. His specialized conditioning provides him with the ability to gather intelligence, sit, wait, and methodically pick off enemy units one by one. In the Star Wars: Battlefront 2 Geonosis map, and all the Star Wars: Battlefront maps that feature the Grand Army of the Republic, the Sharpshooter wears Phase I armor with red markings. In the Star Wars Battlefront 2 maps, excluding Geonosis, the Sharpshooter is the only class to have different armor on different maps in this game, aside from the Stormtroopers on Hoth. On some maps, such as Utapau, Mygeeto, and Coruscant, the Sharpshooters wear the paratrooper suit like in the picture above, with the special helmet and the kama they wear on their waist. On other maps, like Kashyyk and Felucia, the Sharpshooters instead wear camouflaged armor resembling the Imperial Scout Troopers' armor. (Equivalents- Assassin Droid, Rebel Marksman, Scout Trooper)Award Weapons Trivia Links Clone Trooper  Clone Troopers are the main infantry force of the Grand Army of the Republic, and the elite 501st Legion. Clone Troopers are armed with the powerful and accurate\u00a0but short ranged DC-15 Blaster Rifle to destroy the enemies of the Republic. In previous campaigns on Geonosis and planets like Bespin they were equipped with Phase I Clone Armor\u00a0but have more recently upgraded to the Phase II Armor. The elite Clone Troopers made up the majority of the Galactic Republic's Military and served on many different planets. The Clone Trooper is the equivalent to the slower but more heavily armored Super Battle Droid, as well as the Rebel Soldier. Their successors are the Stormtroopers.Award Weapons Trivia Links Star Wars Battlefront Strategies  Please submit strategies by either faction or map.

Thank you for contributing.Reboots Originals LA-AT Gunship  The Low Altitude Assault Transport (LAAT) Gunship, also known as the Republic Assault Gunship, is an aerial gunship and infantry transport for the Galactic Republic. It was later recommissioned as part of the Rebel Alliance's meagre forces as the Alliance Assault Craft. The ship in both Battlefront games is used as a troop transport. It has many different slots that can each hold one person. This means that the ship will re-heal very quickly if it is full of pilot class units. It has a lot of health in the first place, making it a force to be reckoned with. Almost every unit has a gun, making this ship very deadly to foes. The best feature of this ship, however, is the fact that it acts as a spawn point if parked in the enemy hangar. This is very nice, but you will need a lot of pilots to heal the ship with their fusion cutters while it is in the enemy hangar. (Equivalent- Sentinel-class Landing Craft, Droid Gunship)Maps Trivia Links Galactic Republic  The Galactic Republic is a playable faction in Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II.

If you're one of the app users, then you know: Before, it was just a more convenient way to view your articles and content on mobile. But we've added something more! For the past month or so, app users have also been able to talk about the game directly in the app, via Discussions. Activity has been light, but new users have even signed up to your community just so they can participate in Discussions. Many of them pay return visits to the app, and even though they've previously only been reading the articles you\u2019ve written, they now have the option to talk about the show and contributing to your community. Some of them might go on to add content to your articles and stick around as valuable editors. You can read and post to Discussions on the web as well: Battlefront Discussions on the web. This web version isn\u2019t \"discoverable\" right now, meaning it isn't linked anywhere on your wikia. You can only find it through a URL shared from the app, or by following the link here. So you can use it to discuss Battlefront even if you don't use the app. Moderation features: The Wikia Community team has been handling the (very few) problematic posts and users so far (you can see deleted posts indicated by the red triangle and grayed-out text), but we've now added features to Discussions that allow your mods and admins to delete/restore posts, in the app as well as on the desktop version. Very soon, we'll also add the option to view all posts by a user. In addition, admins and mods will be able to delete all posts by a user (very useful, of course, if you're dealing with a spammer). This will at first only be possible on the desktop version - but that's where most moderation happens, anyway. We're also planning to add a \"close thread\" option for mods, and an option for regular users to flag a post as inappropriate. That last one will be exciting, because it's something we currently don't even have on Wikia's regular forums! If you're not using Discussions yourselves, and won't be there to moderate, you can pick promising discussion participants who might want to to take on that role. Admins will be able to assign those users to the Discussion Moderator group. Right now, it's a bit challenging to message app moderation candidates directly. The app users don\u2019t always confirm their email addresses, and so won\u2019t get notified about talk page posts. But if you've spotted someone you'd like to contact about the moderator role, let Wikia staff know, and we'll help you contact them! All of that is still in the future of course, since there is not much activity yet. Would you be open to having us try some experiments on this wiki to see which ways of linking to Discussions generate the most click-through? Things like adding a link on the main navigation, or at the bottom of article pages, etc. As part of that, we would also like to disable the current Forum feature which Discussions will eventually replace. Let us know what you think! We're still working on adding more features to make discussions more fun and convenient to use (such as thread categorization, search, link previews, etc.) For that, we can really use your opinion. How do you like Discussions? What are you missing? What should be different? Please share your thoughts here, and if you have questions, I'm happy to answer them! Note: I am posting this same message to Kingofall42 and Commander Awesome -BertH   19:56, January 27, 2016 (UTC) A few updates! This week we released: These tools should help with moderation and with getting a sense of an individual user's history.

How do you feel about that? --Commander Awesome (AKA TheCrazyWeirdo)  02:50, June 22, 2016 (UTC) It's not that you don't qualify, especially with a good intention like yourself, but rather the duration of time that you have spent with the wiki isn't long enough to verify said intentions. Hope you can understand, and until then keep up what you've been doing and perhaps the result will be more positive next time.

I have a couple of new ideas for the wiki:1. A third tab for mod content.  I think this would improve the quality of both our coverage of mods and the mainspace articles. I never really liked mod content being mixed in with articles about base game content. So, for example, instead of Battle Droid\u00a0containing stuff about SWBF2 mods, there would be a new article at Battle Droid/Mods solely about how they're used in mods, and the main article covering only their appearence in the SWBF1 campain. It may take a lot of work to implement properly, but I think it would be well worth it. Also, Wookieepedia has recently decided to add a third tab for Lego content, so we could borrow some of thier code.2. Game version banners for articles without counterparts.  This would help newcomers to the series and/or wiki not be confused by some of our old series articles with currently no couterpart in the reboot. So it's clear what game(s) everything appears in. So people won't come across, say, Z-6 Chaingun, and think it's a new weapon being added to DICE's Battlefront. They could look similar to the canon/legends banners on Wook next to the era symbols, and could be made part of the GameVersion template. Tell me what you think! --  04:33, September 1, 2016 (UTC)Spiritbar11 and Scout Trooper 164  As I haven't been very active lately (and do not foresee me becoming more active any time soon) i'd like to make Spiritbar11 and/or Scout Trooper 164 admin(s). As you may know, I am a SWBF2 modder, and I am also a wannabe indie game designer, and\u00a0there are quite a few projects I want to work on, which guarantees a lot less time spent here. With that in mind, and since you and the other current admins aren't very active either, and with info about the next SWBF fast approaching, and the game itself coming this fall, I think we need some fresh faces on the staff. I think those two have what it takes, and they've been very active since day one. I may still check in once and a while and help, but I think my days of being a regular contributor are over. I am the hero the wiki deserves, but not the one it needs right now.\u00a0:P --  06:44, February 9, 2017 (UTC)Battlefront II  Hey!

He should be ashamed about what he said.Background image  Hope you don't mind, but I just redid your background image. The latest revision had the majority of the image hiding behind the main page. The picture was too low rez to enlarge, or I would have just done that instead. I'll be around for the launch to help out as I was for the previous game, but if you need help with anything else before then, please let me know. Pinkachu  (talk) 22:14, July 14, 2017 (UTC)Jedi Interceptors and Trade Federation  Vulture asked Commander Awesome why he said the article Jedi Interceptor is speculation since Yoda's Jedi Interceptor that will appear in game is one of those type of craft and I want to say the same about the Trade Federation. I think and it's obvious that the Federation will appear in the game in the form of the Trade Federation cruisers and since we should make a DICE article about this organization. What do you think? Let me know on my talk page.SwtorPlayer (talk) 18:51, September 7, 2017 (UTC)Trade Federation DICE  I thought that since we got the Trade Federation Landing Craft and Trade Federation cruisers we need to make an article with the esential in-game content like so: the Trade Federation was a mega corporation that built battle droids and cruisers used by the CIS; and that's all we need to say like not too much Canon just what is needed. Or we could make a little headline titled Trade Federation on the Confederacy of Independent Systems/DICE\u00a0article and I think the latter option is better. Have a nice day, sir!SwtorPlayer (talk) 20:07, September 9, 2017 (UTC)\u00a0New\u00a0 Main Page Design for Battlefront II  Hey Anakin! As promised, I am back to help out with Battlefront II. I have some awesome news for you as well. We have partnered with EA for graphic assets from Battlefront II and will be using them in a re-design of the Main Page to be completed by our Design Team. We would work directly with you and your community on the project and once a new design is mutually approved, we do the work.\u00a0It's likely that we will also want to create an \"Instant Expert\" page for Battlefront II. Kind of a 'fast track' article. We can get back to that a little later tho. To help us get started, I need your input on the overall design of the main (home) page. What features do you currently use that you would need to keep and are there additional features you would like to see? To give you an idea of what a re-desgin could look like, here are two for gaming that we did in the last year. Prey Wiki and Mass Effect Wiki.\u00a0If there are things you like from either, or both, let me know. Once we have your input, we would begin drafting a mock version of a new main page for you to see, including a new background and possibly a new wordmark (if applicable). Once approved, we would refine it and schedule the work to be done on your community. I will most likely be the one to keep you up to date and let you know when to expect completion. That aside, how is the content doing? I have beta access but I haven't jumped in yet. Do you feel like the community is staying current still? If you need any help with content, please let me know and I will set aside some time to help out. I looked around the site and I noticed the tabs on articles for both versions of the game. This is similar to the way Wookiepedia does it I believe. Will articles for characters, weapons, etc., that are not included in any previous game still have the /DICE attached to it? I'm assuming this will be the case. Hope to hear from you soon! Pinkachu  (talk) 20:26, October 5, 2017 (UTC)Request for Adminship  Hi Anakin, I was wondering if I could become an admin for the wiki. I've done numerous edits to improve the organization, look, and content of the wiki overall, and I hope as an admin I can do that job better. I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to list all the changes I've done, so I'll just link to my contribs page. Some major changes I'm especially proud of since starting in June are: You may also differ to User:Commander Awesome and User:Scout Trooper 164, who are my unofficial admin rec's, but are familiar with my work. I also made major changes to another wiki before editing at BF Wiki, Battle Nations Wiki, if you would like to check that out. Best regards,  Lamosq1027 23:22, October 23, 2017 (UTC)Wow  Wow, yes it has been a wile. Sorry about that. I have been getting emails notifying me of changes and edits regularly but the last year has been hectic. I'm not sure what specifically we'd like for the front page. I like the pictorial category link on the prey homepage and a space for a featured article and some links to official sites. I went ahead and made Lamosq1027 an admin based on what I've seen on their history (and also to reminding myself how to use admin tools\u00a0:) ) At some point I'll probably muck in a bit occasionally here again. Fingers crossed . 18:30, October 24, 2017 (UTC).Unrelated wow.  This amused me briefly. I typed my username in and it gives a break down of overall contribution to the wiki. Apparently I've contributed 55.28% of this wikis main page space. . 18:54, October 24, 2017 (UTC).Much thanks  Hey Anakin, Thanks for putting your faith in me, despite not as closely monitoring my edits as Commander or Scout. I aim to put that faith to good use, especially with the new game just on the horizon! Thanks again, and I look forward working with you sometime in the future as a fellow admin. Best regards,  Lamosq1027 00:22, October 25, 2017 (UTC)Possible to change wiki name  Hey Anakin, In light of the addition of meta pages like Battlefront Wiki:Community Guidelines, Commander and I were wondering if there was a way to change the wiki's name from 'Star Wars Battlefront' to 'Battlefront Wiki' so that the preceding name 'Battlefront Wiki' is not considered a main page article. Of course, the name that would display at the top next to the wiki wordmark would still show as 'Star Wars Battlefront Wiki' (that name is independent from the site wide name). I'm asking you because neither I or Commander have an option to change the site wide name. With you being a bureaucrat, you might have the option to do so. Thanks, and I hope all is well,  Lamosq1027 00:48, November 12, 2017 (UTC)RE:RE:Possible to change wiki name  Hey Anakin, My apologies. Commander shared your same concerns and it was I who misinformed you. We actually wanted to change the wiki name to 'Star Wars Battlefront Wiki' from simply 'Star Wars Battlefront.' You and Commander's concerns are well placed, as I can see how it can easily be confused. Let me know if you have concerns about this possible new name. Best,  Lamosq1027 00:48, November 13, 2017 (UTC)Re: Site Name Change  Hello!\u00a0 I changed the SITENAME from Star Wars Battlefront to Star Wars Battlefront Wiki in our system. Hope this resolves your issue. Please let me know if it doesn't. The name change may take a while to show in Google search due to caching and web crawl delays. Thanks! Pinkachu  (talk) 17:11, November 13, 2017 (UTC)Re: Main Page Redesign  Hello! Here is a look at our current re-design for the main page. Since this needs to be implemented asap, please take a look and give us any last-minute feedback before we bring it to the community. (CC-ing this on the other admin's talk walls) Thanks! Pinkachu  (talk) 17:47, November 13, 2017 (UTC) Mock of New Main PageDiscussion regarding categories for Star Wars Battlefront II  Hello! Please read my new Discussions thread regarding categories and reply if you have a moment. Thanks!

So I created my own! Template:Star Cards (Star Wars Battlefront II/DICE) It obviously needs some work but what do you think? With regards AdmiralSupreme (talk) 03:45, January 6, 2018 (UTC)Cas'ika  Long time, no see, Ani. Not got anything important to say, just wanted to say hi after a few years of absence. So uh...hi! Your friendly neighbourhood Legacyofhades. --Saighdear (talk) 22:20, February 21, 2018 (UTC) Ryan120202 (talk) 13:15, March 23, 2018 (UTC)Redirect help  Dear Anankin Skyobilviator I need some help renaming an article. I was trying to get rid of the italic on the Venator-class Star Destroyer page and instead I made a bunch of redirected pages. I'm sorry about it but I have no idea how this whole renaming thing works. Hello, I am new tribute of this wiki!Star Wars: Battlefront  Star Wars: Battlefront is a first and third person shooter video game based around battles featured in the Star Wars films, as well as in the Expanded Universe. It is the first game of the highly successful Star Wars: Battlefront Series. It was developed by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts, and released on September 21, 2004 for Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Microsoft Windows, the same day as the release of the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set. Aspyr released a Mac port in July 2005. People can either play Battlefront online with up to 32 players on PC, Mac and Xbox, and 16 players on PlayStation 2, or offline with up to 2 players. The Xbox version is compatible with the Xbox 360. A sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront II, was released on November 1, 2005 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. In late 2004, LucasArts released the Star Wars Battlefront BFBuilder, an unsupported mod that allowed fans to create new battlefields for Battlefront I. A spin off game, Star Wars: Battlefront Renegade Squadron, was released on October 9, 2007. A reboot, respectively called Star Wars Battlefront, was announced at E3 2013. It was developed by EA DICE and released on November 17, 2015.Gameplay  Battlefront centers around battles between four main factions from both the prequel and the Classic trilogies. They are the following: the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS aka Separatists) of the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire of the classic trilogy. However, factions can only play their historical adversary; there can't be any Rebel vs. Separatist fights, for example. Within each unit, five different classes of characters become available. Four of the classes are fairly similar for each faction: a basic infantry soldier (a Super Battle Droid for the Separatists), a heavy weapons soldier, a pilot, and a sniper. Each faction also has a special fifth unit with unique abilities and weapons. Jedi heroes are featured in the game: Luke Skywalker for the Rebellion, Darth Vader for the Empire, Mace Windu for the Republic, and Count Dooku for the CIS. Jedi characters appear but are not playable; they may only be allies in battle, under certain circumstances. They cannot be killed with direct fire, but can be knocked off of ledges or crushed by vehicles. When the reinforcement meter reaches 10% of its original number the Jedi hero dies and does not return. There are also non-playable characters (NPCs): Tusken Raiders in the Dune Sea of Tatooine, Jawas on the streets of Mos Eisley. Ewoks aid the Rebellion on the forest moon of Endor, Gungans aid the Republic on the Naboo Plains, Geonosians help the CIS in battle at Geonosis, and Wookiees aid the Rebellion and Republic on Kashyyyk.Playable classes  Click the links below to view each category of units.Planet battlefields Critical response  Although receiving very good reviews, there were some criticisms for the gameFactions  Some players were disappointed that the factions from different time periods couldn\u00b4t play each other (E.G: CIS Vs. Rebels). Although this is understandable from a chronological point of view, many players thought that the enjoyment of having such battles would balance out the historical inaccuracy.Maps  Many players complained that the maps were bias, i.e. designed for one side to win. Even on the easy setting, some players couldn't complete various missions. The infantry orientated maps (I.E maps with no vehicles) were also criticized for being unimaginatively designed, and containing obvious choke points, which were confining and prevent many players from enjoying those particular maps.Vehicles  Many of the vehicles in Star Wars Battlefront were deemed to be overpowered. This is because it would usually take infantry from many different classes to bring down one vehicle, something which the AI were criticized for not being able to do. This was shown particularly on the AT-AT vehicle, on which infantry weapons did negligible damage. As the AT-AT acts as a mobile command point, this caused maps with AT-ATs very hard to win as the Rebel forces.Infantry  The infantry in the game were criticized for their blandness, I.E every race had a blanket infantry selection (Basic Trooper, Rocket Trooper, Pilot & Sniper), thought this was balanced out a little by the addition of special units (Jetpack Troopers for both the Imperials and Clone Troopers, Wookie Smugglers for the Rebels and Droideka for the Federation). Also, many players complained that the Federation special unit (The Droideka) was overpowered compared to the other races special units.PlayStation 2 version  The PlayStation 2 version was criticized as the weakest version of Battlefront. It had limited multiplayer support, the textures were blurrier and the models had no shading whatsoever. The multiplayer was the most criticized part of the PlayStation 2 experience. The PlayStation 2 version could only support 16 players, but that was via a PC using special software. If such software wasn't used, then the PlayStation 2 could only have 4 human players with 6 AI-controlled bots, which on larger maps, proved to be inadequate and unsatisfactory to many players. However, the PlayStation 2 version for single-player still remained just as fun as the other versions.Cast Voice cast Archive footage appearances  All scenes are taken from Episodes I, II, IV, V, and VI.External links Jet Trooper  The Jet Trooper is one of the two special units that only the Galactic Republic can access. The jetpack they possess lets them fly for a short period of time allowing them to cross maps with ease. The Jet Trooper's EMP Launcher is a deadly weapon, against both droids and humans. The Commando Pistol they also are equipped with has a much faster firing rate than the original Galactic Republic blaster pistol. If the Precision Pistol is achieved, this unit can be very formidable. Overall this class can change the tide of any battle, if played right. Also, unlike most other units, the Jet Troopers, along with Dark Troopers of the empire, can survive a long fall without taking any damage.Award Weapons Tactical Analysis Trivia Links Clone Commander  The Clone Commander (officially named the Galactic Marine in the Star Wars universe) is one of the two special units available only to the Galactic Republic, and serves as the Officer Class unit for the Republic. \ufeffClone Commanders are equipped with a large, shoulder-worn Z-6 Chaingun, and even though they take a moment to charge up and will overheat after prolonged firing, they release a dense stream of blaster bolts that few enemies can withstand. The amount of time it takes for the weapon to charge up, however, makes it difficult for the Clone Commander to survive an ambush, (for which reason they are equipped also with a standard Republic issue DC-15s blaster pistol for self-defense) but does afford him superiority over enemy infantry in normal combat. The commander is very useful against Droidekas as the Chaingun can make short work of both the shield and the Droideka itself. Other weapons include a recon droid, allowing surveillance of the battlefield from a safe distance. They can self destruct to harm or destroy nearby droids, clearing the way for clones. The ability to rally nearby units and empower them with a temporary defense increase, is an invaluable asset in a heated firefight. The Clone Commander class also has a limit of four units in-game at any one time. This is consistent with all Commander and Special classes in the game.You have to get 8 points before playing as this unit.Award Weapons Skins  Like most Officers the Clone Commander does not change his skin on any map. However, there was originally supposed to be a phase 1 variant on Geonosis, but this was cut out of the game.Tactical Analysis Trivia Links Factions  Factions that are found in either Pandemic Studios' or Rebellion Developments' Star Wars: Battlefront games.Playable factions Indigenous factions Neutral factions Stormtrooper  The Stormtrooper is the new soldier unit of the 501st Legion. Evolving from the battle hardened Clone Troopers of the Galactic Republic, the Stormtrooper is armed with the powerful but inaccurate E-11 Blaster Rifle to destroy the enemies of the Empire. For the campaigns on Hoth and on Rhen Var, the Stormtroopers of the 501st are equipped with Snowtrooper Armour. The fearsome Stormtrooper makes up the majority of the Imperial army and usually takes the brunt of the fighting. The Stormtrooper is the equivalent to the Super Battle Droid, Rebel Soldier and Clone Trooper.Award Weapons Trivia Links Glitches: Mos Eisley Dark Trooper  Dark Troopers are a special infantry unit available exclusively to the Empire. The loadout of a Dark Trooper in Battlefront I gives them access to a Blast Cannon as their primary weapon, a Blaster Pistol as their secondary weapon, or \"sidearm\", and Thermal Detonators for use as anti-infantry and anti-vehicle explosives. Dark Troopers, as a result of their loadout, play with a close-range combat style, as their pistol is more effective at long ranges than their blast cannon. In Battlefront II, Dark Troopers have a slightly different loadout: Their blast cannon has been replaced with the ARC Caster, a gun that fires electric bolts as a weapon. Their Blaster Pistol has been exchanged for a Commando Pistol as their preferred sidearm, and they still carry Thermal Detonators as well. The Dark Trooper is unique for its Jumpack, a special piece of equipment used by these units to propel themselves high into the air and fly far distances with a short, powerful burst from the pack. This item allows Dark Troopers to perform a \"jump in, fight, jump back out\" strategy that can help them to recuperate after a fight with Rebel troops. Dark Troopers are a unit that adds to the diverse set of tactics that the Galactic Empire can use in battle with Rebel soldiers.Award Weapons Skins  Like the Imperial Officer the Dark Trooper does not change his skin on any map.Tactical Analysis Trivia Links ", "SWRPEDIA - Second Life Star Wars Roleplay Wiki": "SWRPEDIA - Second Life Star Wars Roleplay Wiki Second Life Star Wars Roleplay Wiki Welcome to the Second Life Star Wars Roleplay wiki!

All those involved hope you will enjoy visiting these planets and enjoy yourself in the SWRP community.See Also Star Wars Role-play  Star Wars roleplay in Second Life is usually referred to as SWRP, but also SWSL, SL-SWRP. Roleplaying is the central point, but it also covers many other activities, such as building items and sims (creating inmersive and functional environments), welcoming newcomers, managing groups or organizing events.Combat system What are Combat Systems?  Combat systems are scripted avatar attachments, which track the health, stamina, and possibly other factors for each player in metered fights. In such fights, all combatants must each be wearing the same combat system for the fight to be properly metered. Usualy, sim rules require roleplayers to wear a particular combat system, but a few sims don't enforce a single one, leaving it up to the roleplayers to decide amongst themselves whenever the need might arise. Some combat systems also keep track of experience points, character levels, and character stats (strength, constitution, agility, etc.); provide regulated force powers and special abilities; provide a pseudo-currency; provide a customizable, floating title above the avatar's head; provide a health gauge above the avatar; include a HUD attachment for quick access to functions and to provide information on ones state whilst one is in mouselook; etc. Combat systems (CSs) simply provide the ability for people to engage in combat within Second Life. (This is necessary because Second Life's included \"health\" system is unable to be customized in a rational way and is far too easy to grief.) This is a great aid to Star Wars roleplay since, obviously, Star 'Wars' involves warfare, which usually involves combat. But like actual warfare, SWRP also involves healing and medical treatment, which can be provided by scripted combat systems but are not provided by default in SL]. Prior to the advent of combat meters, duelling with a push saber was considered the norm; however this too was open to abuse and was rendered obsolete in roleplay by the advent of RCS.What aren't Combat Systems?  Combat systems are not inherently related to RP nor SWRP. They do not usually involve typing out ones actions (aka \"emoting\" them by typing \"/me does such and such\"), but rather, more frequently involve simply doing the action. Oppositely, another form of combat has arisen called free-form combat (FFC), which does not directly involve combat systems, necessarily, but rather involves typing ones actions. Combat systems are not things that perform well in high-lag or for users with underpowered computers. They are also not able to be used in non-script-enabled lands.List of Combat Systems used in SWRP  Here is a alphabetically ordered list of combat systems used of having been used in SWRP.DCS2 (Dynamic Combat System)  Versatile system, it allows many configuration but the settings are not always compatible from a sim to another unless configured otherwise.FCRS (Force Combat Roleplaying System)  FCRS, Force Combat Roleplaying System was created by Cindy Kellner in 2007 in with a view to limit the griefing and to sort unaddressed issues from other Combat Systrems. The System was server based and pulled information via server. Core Features: Modes - Training Mode - Changed the System to Basic mode were stats and effects were equal. Roleplay Mode - Normal operation mode of the FCRS. Universal Mode - Discontinued after Public release of FCRS. Same as Training Mode. Ranks - Determined the strength of a character. Ranks although similiar were allowed to be named for a specific group using it. Health Bar Hover-Text Display - Showed health in color based on percentage left. Force HUD - Status display in mouse look also provided the user with an array of powers. Enforcers - Balls that forced the system into the Modes based on sensor radius. Free during the first times, it became a paying system in march 2009. Shortly after that time the system was discontinued for use due to a opensource HUD release that almost immeditaely turned into griefing weapon against the system.FCS/FRS (Force Combat System / Force Roleplaying System)  Predecessors of FCRS, these were the beta versions. FCS was designed to be used by non-force sensitives and FRS was designed to be use by force sensitives. Opensource of the FCS and FRS beta code do exist but by a limited number of residents.HCS  HCS is the only major combat system to never have been used in any sim. It was the successor to DCS. It featured a sophisticated graphic HUD with moving bars for health, stamina, and armor; and rezzable health packs which could be dropped on the ground and then ran through with your avatar to pick up the extra health.KCS (Kamino Combat System)  Built by Veteran Star Wars role players. The idea of the KCS was to build a new combat system that would be low lag, user friendly, usable anywhere and built specifically for SWRP. Combat is fast paced, the intention is to make use of cover and fight strategically.Orb  Orb is a free combat system designed by Furia Freeloader. Some of its unique features include: a color changing orb that shows your approximate health to others but not your exact health, penalties for automatic weapons, different block animations for different character types. It is free of charge and available in Taris, The Forest Moon of Endor, and at Furious Star Wars Avatars.RHCS (R34l1ty H4ck3r5 Combat System)  RHCS is offered by the same team that created Fusion lightsabers. It is a free combat system for SWRP. Its main focuses are high performance, engaging melee combat, natural-feeling Force powers, and a diverse set of internally-balanced capabilites that makes each fight unique. Originally concieved by its creator as a response to the feeling that the melee combat in other popular combat systems favored button-mashing, feeling more like whack-a-mole than anything resembling combat. RHCS works anywhere, and has no classes, ranks, or titles. RHCS works with all standard (LMB+WASD) melee weapons and collision-based ranged weapons. A free meter (force powers included) can be obtained on Mos Espa SWRP SIM.SCS (Somnium Combat System)  Used on The Rogue Planet by the Potentium and others sims, is a very good and free meter dedicated for sw roleplay game. Is still under construction, also it is operative, and soon will have force power too integrated in the meter.ZCS  Free combat system originally designed to work on low performance sim, but with a complete set of features. It has no level or central database and can be used everywhere.Space ship and vehicles combat systems  The combats system for space and vehicle combats work differently than the the ones designed for ground fights. Melee is pointless and, as the space has obstacle to hide behind, they can rely on scanners rather than physical bullet.CCC (Calahan Combat System)  CCC is the more universal combat system used in dogfights on SWRP.SCS-V (Somnium Combat System-Vehicle)  For ships/vehicles coordinating with the SCS (Somnium Combat System)VCS  VCS, or Vehicle Combat System is a physical vehicle-based combat system developed for the Star Wars RP community.Controversy  The issue of which combat system(s) to use has been the center of several controversies within SWRP, due to the way in which certain systems provide or deny enhanced statistics and/or combat dynamics to particular players or classes of players based on arbitrary factors or experience points, for example. There have been many other factors related to these controversies.See Also Grand Army of the Republic Background  On the remote planet of Polis Massa, it would be simple to start up another cloning facility for research. The first generation of clones only started with 100. These clones would be bought by a coalition of minor houses within the Talpir sector. These highly trained soldiers would be used to assist in the overthrowing of the major houses. However, but the time the clones were mature enough to fight, the coup was over. This left the Kaminoans with a batch of clones, but no buyer. They bided their time, looking for an opportunity to utilise this asset in a way that would allow for further research. They came to realise that the New Republic had destroyed the clones on Kamino due to their involvement in the Stormtrooper program, and determined that a republic supported by their clones would be more sympathetic to their independent research than any Empire, as the previous one had historically subjugated, restricted, and controlled it with an iron fist. This would further encourage a sub-culture of nostalgia for the times of the old Republic, where they regularly received the funds and freedom to conduct their experiments with perceived impunity. The army would leave Polis Massas and start to travel. The new Grand Army of the Republic was self controlled by two new Commanders who would share equal power throughout he Army. No longer would the clone troopers be led strictly by any government or that of the Jedi Order. They would be only governed by their own in the form of their Clone Council. They would search for many years for a cause to fight in, and people to call their allies. Long had the Grand Army traveled through the Galaxy to finally ally itself with the RLF (Republic Liberation Forces), a guerilla group freedom-fighters against the New Galactic Empire. they assisted them during the Two Battles of the Imperial Palace, which they won both. Now, since the rebels one the battle, they take most of Coruscant and become known as the PGA, or the People's Galactic Alliance. Since then, the GAR, or Grand Army of the Republic, traveled through the Galaxy in search of a home, though they weren't welcome else where, until one day, they found what they were looking for, Bakura. Since the BSF lost the massacre, they fled from the planet's system, going to different worlds in the Outer Rim or other territories. The politicians also did the same thing, which has left Bakura in utter chaos, especially its capital Salis D'aar. The ruins became a haven for crime, gun racketeering, spice smuggling, murder, and other inexplicable things. That is, not till GAR moved in, they cleansed the corruption of the Government there that was under control by evil Crime Lords and other underground syndicates. Soon, the Clones defeated the criminals and other villains of tyranny or just detained them, then the Engineers started to rebuild. As soon as the Galaxy heard about the remarkable deeds of the Clones, they immediately came back, maybe even some of the old BSF Former politicians ventured back to the city Salis D'aar that was being rebuilt by the Clone Army and the Republic, attempting to make a stable legislative branch once more, though there is still crime active in the city, but with the Clones and Civilian Security Force's men and women, nothing can be invincible or impossible to handle. The Clones in the Grand Army would call Salis D'aar and the world of Bakura home.Organization and structure Rank structure Officers Enlisted Order of Battle See Also External Links Kimmie Aeon  Kimmie Aeon is a 35 year old Morganian/Human female and was a former Jedi Master of the New Order of the Jedi. She has two children from a previous marriage named Sera and Saya. In her days as a Jedi she was a reknown sentinel, cartographer, and explorer, but all of that changed when she fell to the darkside and became Darth Vulcanus, the powerful Headmistress of the Korriban Sith Academy. After years in service to the Darkside, Kimmie Aeon was able to break free of its hold upon her and return to the light. Exiled by the NOJ Council due to her defiance towards their constant inaction, the war against the Empire and her turning to the dark side, Kimmie began to clear her name of all the wrong she did as a Sith, and in the process forged new relationships and ties with the Jedi Covenant and Old Order of the Jedi. After numerous assassination attempts on her life and her former Mistress Dark Lady Malacia gaining the location of her daughters, Kimmie traveled with her children far beyond the outer rim into wild space, to train them in the ways of the force. In doing this she disappeared into the galaxy, where she now watches from afar, waiting for the moment when the galaxy should need heroes again.Biography Early life Childhood  Kimmie did not find out about her true heritage until she was a padawan in the NOJ, but she is proud of what little she knows. She was born on a small planet beyond the outer rim, the only child of her Father Owen, a Corellian Spice Merchant, and her mother, a Morganian Princess named Aurora. While she does not have a pale skin tone due to her father's genes, she does however have the large point ears of her mother. Kimmie was only ten days old, when a large group of Sith invaded the planet to test a powerful weapon that siphoned the force energy from the planet's core, draining the world of its life force. Kimmie's parents instructed their adviser, an older man named Lars Aeon and his wife Anita to take their daughter and keep her safe from the Sith while their people fought to save their planet. Lars and Anita escaped with the infant as the planet crumbled and imploded upon itself. Knowing that Kimmie's parents were presumed dead, Lars plotted a course to Corellia, and started a new life there as a small docking bay owner in the capital city of Coronet. When Kimmie was about 6 years old, she wandered off from her father Lars in a busy market place and soon came upon a wounded Shaak from Naboo in a cage. Sensing the creature was in pain she reached out with her hand towards the Shaak's wounded leg and a slight blue aura appeared. She drew back her hand in fright, and a look of astonishment was upon her face as the wound slowly healed and disappeared. Lars, who had seen the entire incident took her quickly by the hand and led her away, telling her to never let anyone see anything like that, fearing that it may bring the Sith upon them.Rogue Squadron Pilot & New Republic Spy  Kimmie learned much about the vast universe she was apart of by listening to the stories of the spice merchants and New Republic military who came to refuel at the station. She longed to get out of the tiny spaceport and explore the galaxy. When she was 17 years old, with the permission of her adoptive parents, she falsified her age and joined Rogue Squadron. Sadly, she did not make it out of basic training. Her superiors called her a reckless pilot, due to the fact that she flew at extremely fast speeds that made even the most seasoned instructors black out in their cockpits. Kimmie possessed other skills as well, not only in tech healing but also in slicing. At the age of 18 she was approached by the New Republic to serve as an undercover spy on Tatooine. Kimmie accepted the offer and took on the disguise of a local doctor and began monitoring the local Imperial garrison.Her First Love and Journey to become a Jedi  While serving as a spy on Tatooine, Kimmie met a man she would later marry, Vilda Kazyanenko. The two worked together to track down a sith assassin and foil her attempt to kill high ranking members of the New Republic. As Kimmie and Vilda's relationship and friendship grew, the two decided to marry and a few months later, Kimmie gave birth to their first child, a baby girl named Sera. One year after Sera's birth, Kimmie was returning to Tatooine after visiting her daughter and her adoptive parents when her navicomputer on her X-Wing went out. She quickly came out of hyperspace unknowingly arrived at the Sith world known as Ziost. Before she could get her sense of direction, a missile ripped through the hull of her X-Wing, and she came hurtling towards the planet's surface blacking out as she hit the tree-line. It was the handiwork of Dark Lady Ptas. When she was awoke she was surprised to find herself alive floating in a bacta tank, and also that her husband Vilda was there. Vilda had sensed Kimmie was in danger and had flown to the planet to look for her, where he also had been struck down by Ptas. Upon being captured, he made a deal with Ptas to turn to the Dark Side so that Kimmie's life would be saved. While recovering, the Sith performed a Midichlorian count on Kimmie and discovered her count was higher than an average force sensitive person. The Sith then hatched a scheme to forcibly train her as one of their own as she recovered and Kimmie became an instant prisoner. Kimmie spent much of her time recovering in the library of Ziost. In her heart, she knew that the Dark Side was wrong, and that if she gave into its temptation, she would lose everything she cherished. She refused to give in, and was punished harshly at times for resisting. Eventually Kimmie learned of the Jedi on Yavin IV from a text within the library. Hoping she would change her mind, the Sith allowed her to leave Ziost to see how \"weak\" the Jedi were for herself, on the condition that she come back within 24 hours -- or they would kill Vilda. Kimmie rushed to Yavin IV and found her way to the archives. It was here that she first learned the Jedi Code. While she didn't know what it meant at the time, she felt comfort in the words and flew back to Ziost, to tell the Sith of her choice. Upon landing Kimmie felt called to a nearby tomb and inside found a lightsaber belonging to a fallen Jedi Knight. After taking this saber and tucking it under her cloak she made her way to the Citadel, and was escorted to her husband and other Sith in the library. They asked Kimmie what choice she made and the only thing that came to her lips was the code she learned on Yavin IV. Enraged at the utterance of those words in the citadel Vilda attacked Kimmie, but was no match for her speed. Kimmie fled the citadel with the Sith in hot pursuit, and sought sanctuary with the Jedi on Yavin IV. Vilda quickly followed and in time was able to find the path of light again with the help of the local Jedi and Kimmie.Padawanship Under Sir Oceanlane  Shortly after her arrival on Yavin IV, Ptas took her revenge for Vilda's betrayal. Using Force Cloak, Ptas ambushed and struck down Kimmie as she was holding her daughter Sera on top of the temple. Sera was unharmed, but Kimmie was badly wounded from the incident. In the hospital, she learned that it was possible the assassin was looking for a sword inside the Tomb of Exar Kun, deep within the swamps of Yavin IV. Still recovering from her attack, Kimmie and Vilda, along with a few other Padawans journeyed to the tomb and found the sword, which they then turned over to the council. Impressed by Kimmie's performance, the newly knighted Sir Undala Oceanlane approached Kimmie and extended an offer for her to be his first Padawan learner, which she happily accepted. Under Master Undala's mentorship, Kimmie was able to work past her anger she had towards the injustices the Sith caused her and her family. She chose the path of the Jedi Sentinel mainly due to her background as a New Republic spy. When she was not meditating in her favorite spot behind the lecture hall on Yavin IV, she was frequently seen helping others, especially younger padawans and adepts around the academy. When she was halfway finished with her training Kimmie sensed that she was pregnant with a baby boy, but unfortunately miscarried the baby within the first two weeks of the pregnancy. She never told anyone of the incident for over three years and it was never documented on record. When Kimmie was a Padawan IV she found out she was pregnant with a second child. Her master not wanting to jeopardize her health placed her training on hold until the baby was born. Ironically, baby Saya was born on the same exact day, Coruscant fell to an alliance of Sith and Imperials. After recovering, Kimmie began to put her skills as a Sentinel to use. With her master's permission, Kimmie infiltrated the ranks of the Imperial Navy for a short time, and began gathering intelligence on captured Jedi leaders and their whereabouts. Her most notable mission was when she snuck into the heavily guarded Jedi Temple and made a copy of the entire Jedi Archives in case the empire destroyed them. As she copied the last log, her cover was blown, but she managed to evade her Imperial pursuers by escaping through the catacombs of the Jedi Academy and sewers before she snuck aboard an Imperial Shuttle bound for Kashyyyk. Kimmie went on more missions to aid the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Empire. Eventually due to sith encroachment on the Jedi training grounds, NOJ relocated to Kashyyyk. After that a series of unfortunate events began to unfold. Thinking it posed to much of a danger to be married, Vilda decided to end their marriage. If things could not get worse, Kimmie suffered a terrible injury to her eyes due to hazardous gases on the planet Mustafar and began to lose her eyesight. Her fellow Jedi rallied around her and found a cure, when Argynis Criss, a Padawan to Sir Don Gaton, discovered a shard of the legendary Kaiburr crystal in the swamps of Dagobah. The last of the shard's power was used to restore Kimmie's sight but not fully. Her vision is still slightly blurred and from time to time she can be seen wearing glasses.Life as a Jedi Knight  When her eyesight returned, Kimmie's dear friend Archangel Zhangsun was the first person she was able to see again. The two had gone on quite a few missions together and were very close friends. Ironically the two were knighted on the same day, on the planet Mon Calamari. Shortly after their knighting, Sir Arch and Lady Kimmie were paired up to gather intelligence and information on various planets in the galaxy. Both of the two new knights were assigned some of the galaxy's most hostile planets, including Vjun and Ord Mantell and most troubling to Lady Kimmie, Ziost. Although unnerved by going to Ziost again, the duo completed their missions and on the way home Sir Arch took a slight detour. He piloted their ship down to a beautiful waterfall on the planet Naboo and led Lady Kimmie to a small bridge where he proposed to her. A few weeks later, the two were married and Kimmie Aeon became Kimme Zhangsun The NOJ soon found a new home on Ruusan and Kimmie also took her first padawan learner when Colby Colbyson approached Kimmie and asked if she would guide her to knighthood after her master left the order. While on Kashyyyk Kimmie met a very humorous but wise man known as Musashi and despite being 20 years younger than him, Kimmie became his mentor as well. Lady Kimmie also began instructing Githa Breda after her master took a leave of absence and later on Sue Veliz, after Vilda fell to the darkside. Sue, Githa and Musashi have completed their training under Lady Kimmie and became knights in NOJ. Colby is still in training at the moment. Lady Kimmie also came to know the very powerful Sith Lord known as Darth Rowe during this time. Kimmie Due to the quick thinking of Sir Zephan, Kimmie was able to help thwart a plot by Darth Rowe that poisoned Ruusan's Bacta supply with a deadly acid. In retribution Lady Kimmie was captured by Darth Rowe and taken to Korriban, where she underwent a brutal torturing. After resisting for hours, Kimmie was sent back to Ruusan and recovered in due time. While recovering in the hospital she came under attack by a new threat. Her former husband Vilda was slowly falling to the darkside mainly due to the influence of Darth Dolor. As hard as she tried Kimmie could not stop Vilda's inevitable fall, and Vilda tried to assassinate Kimmie in her hospital bed. Vilda and Kimmie soone had it out on the streets of Ruusan in a very long and drawn out street fight that attracted the attention of the NOJ and AoD. Realizng there was no way to stop Vilda, Kimmie did the only thing that came to her mind. In desperation she pulled her head back, and delivered a massive headbutt to Vilda which knocked both of them out. After the duel Vilda renounced his title as a Jedi Knight and vowed to kill Kimmie one day. After this incident and other circumstances, Kimmie thought that the path of the Sentinel was not one for her, and changed to the path of a Jedi Consular for a brief time to regain a sense of harmony and peace she had felt like she lost.Tragedy  Life continued as normal at the academy. One day Sir Arch approached Kimmie and said that he would be leaving for a month long intelligence mission on Coruscant. Kimmie bid her husband farewell and began waiting for his return. Two months passed and Kimmie heard no word from him. In his absence she took another Padawan named Amy, who was very enthusiastic but also extremely impatient with her training. Wanting to take a quick and easy path, Amy renounced the NOJ and fell to the Dark Side. In her place, Kimmie took the Twi'lek Atty Yokosuka as her new Padawan. Around the same time, Kimmie's mentor, Master Oceanlane, decided to take his leave of NOJ and help with the Praxeum academy on Coruscant. Although he would only be a few lightyears apart, Kimmie felt as if she lost a great mentor and friend. One night as she lay asleep, she woke up feeling a heavy weight upon her heart and rushed to her Delta 7. By following her feelings she arrived back at the planet Ziost and landed deep in the forest outside the citadel. After wandering for hours, she came upon her husband's wrecked Delta 7. She rushed to the cockpit to find him dead, having been killed on impact. Kimmie was devastated by her loss, but at the same time, rejoiced that Sir Arch had become one with the force. After leaving the planet, Kimmie went back to Corellia to assist the New Republic Intelligence Agency in an investigation concerning a Sith insurgent in the Senate, and soon returned to Ruusan.The Jedi Explorer  During her days as a knight, Lady Kimmie began to assist Masters Brihan Takacs and Zoffa Morico in finding artifacts for the Ruusan Museum of Art. She has procured many artifacts in her travels, some of which are not only very rare but very dangerous, with the most notable being the Sword of Ajunta Pall. After becoming a Master in NOJ, Kimmie was made Assistant Curator of Darkside Antiquities due to her knowledge in the field. She fiercely protective of all the artifacts in the museum, especially the Sword of Ajunta Pall. As time passed since her husband's death, Kimmie thought it would be best to take a leave of absense from Ruusan and explore the galaxy. As she visited different worlds she kept an active log of each planet she visited with information on the planet's terrain, climate and locals. She also kept a watchful eye out for artifacts that the Ruusan Museum could use. During her travels on Korriban, she discovered an unknown tomb, and after hours of careful navigation and dodging traps she found a chalice that Emperor Palpatine himself had possessed. Upon taking the chalice she triggered a swinging axe trap that cut her above the left eye. The blood she left behind at the scene, allowed The Assembly of Darkness to determine who the culprit was, and they tracked Kimmie to Ruusan. After several hours of negotiating, Kimmie agreed to return the chalice and stay out of the tombs of Korriban in exchange for another artifact and an agreement that the AoD would not kidnap anymore NOJ members. Surprisingly, both sides have held up both ends of their agreement. As her travels came to an end, Kimmie brought several artifacts to the Ruusan Museum, one being a Holocron that belonged to Darth Talon, which was found by her padawan Githa on Dromund Kaas.Life as a Jedi Master Civil War  The council found much quality in Lady Kimmie and her dedication to the order, and bestowed upon her the rank of Jedi Master. After her ceremony, she was approached by Commander Selkisto, of the Republic Liberation Front. He asked several of the Jedi gathered around if they would aid the RLF in their plight to overthrow the Empire and restore the Republic. Many of the Jedi jumped at the chance to join, but Kimmie refused, seeing as how a dear friend and fellow Jedi, Master Azlum Grimlock, was the advisor for the Empress. She also felt this broke the Vow of Loyalty a Jedi takes to the council. Despite her long past with the Republic, Kimmie decided to remain neutral, until one fateful day. Early one morning Kimmie awoke to hear her numerous distress signal on her comlink. Several of the Jedi in the RLF were wounded on the streets of Coruscant and needed an extraction. She rushed to Coruscant and found Sir Zack Vel barelly alive in an alley. With the assistance of Master Zephan's Padawan Marcus Forte they rushed Sir Zack back to Ruusan where Kimmie learned the Empire was responsible for the attack. Realizing her beloved order was in danger made her choice to get involved in the war. She contacted Commander Selk and Commander Talot and joined the RLF to protect the NOJ and to restore the Republic.Starfire  Kimmie knew that they council had not yet chosen a side in the war and were currently neutral. There was also the looming fact that some jedi still had Imperial ties and she was an easily recognized person. For these reasons, she entered the RLF under the alias Starfire. With the help of her friend Lady Breanna Pomeray, Kimmie created a disguise for her new persona. Only Commander Selk, Talot, and Breanna knew of Kimmie's secret, and she did an excellent job in hiding it from her friends and family. Kimmie's first major engagement did not go as well as all had hoped when the RLF assaulted an Imperial outpost base in the Jungles of Onderon. A week later Kimmie was offered a position as a pilot in Crimson Squadron, but remembering her past in Rogue Squadron declinded and took a position as a Gunnery Sargeant aboard the Gavel-class Assault Cruiser, Devi. During a meeting of the RLF Constitutional Convention, the Devi was attacked by Imperial forces. She narrowly escaped her turret as it was shot out by an Imperial trifighter during the assault. As the ship began to sustain heavy damage the abandon ship order was sent over the comm system. Her escape pod was shot towards the surface of Onderon right as the Devi exploded. She landed safely on a vast plains area Kimmie quickly ran towards the jungles as Imperial Troops scoured the planet looking for survivors. She was soon rescued by General Selkisto and taken to the Moon Dxun, where she worked as a medic, helping to comfort and heal the sick and the wounded.Liberty  As the war between the Empire and the RLF waged on, a bold plan was formulated to overthrow the Imperial forces on Coruscant, and restablish the Republic in its place. RLF personnel were sent to all corners of the Galaxy to rally support. Kimmie, in her disguise as Starfire, came to Ruusan and rallied the support of a few of her friends in NOJ. Kimmie and her friends met up with an unlikely alliance of other Jedi, exchange thugs, mercenaries, GAR and RLF landed on the outskirts of the Imperial Palace. The large liberation force fought their way into the Imperial Palace, and defeated the Imperial forces, freeing Coruscant and the Galaxy from the grip of the Empire, but this was not the end. After the battle, the Imperial Executor was imprisoned on Onderon, and a group of Storm Commandos launched a surprise assault rescue him. Kimmie was among those that arrived to help, but in the process was badly wounded and fell unconcious. She was found hours later by Sir Zen and Lady Saltheena of the NOJ, who upon removing her mask, discovered Starfire's real identity. Master Kimmie was rushed immediately to the hospital in critical condition where she remained for several days. Eventually she made a full recovery and was very happy that the hopes and dreams of a New Republic had finally been made into a reality.Fall to the Darkside The Emperor's Holocron  The allure to the Darkside was something that all Jedi struggle with and Master Kimmie was no exception to this. As time passed she developed a mistrust with the Jedi Council and began to withdraw more from the order. One day while giving a tour to some visitors in the museum, Kimmie found a horrifying discovering. An artifact known as the Emperor\u2019s Holocron had been tampered with and its original red color was now green. Master Kimmie began to worry and since she did not know much about it, went with a team of Jedi to Korriban to derive more information from the Assembly of Darkness. Unfortunately their plans went foul when the discussion turned violent and the Jedi beat a hasty retreat. Kimmie took shelter in one of the tombs, where she discovered two identical holocrons one of which was linked to the Holocron on Ruusan. She emerged hours later and attempted to rescue a captured Jedi Healer named Dakota, with the help of fellow Master Owyn Graves. As she was surrendering to overwhelming odds to save Owyn and Dakota\u2019s life, she was rescued by Chancellor Selkisto Horten and a large group of Covenant Jedi, who took the trio to Coruscant for Medical Treatment. The Jedi worked quickly to solve the mystery of the holocron, while Sith spies began attempts to break into the museum and steal the holocron. In time Kimmie discovered that the holocron network was using an ancient Jedi encryption code to send out a signal to an unknown source, and she sought for a way to set everything in balance again.Chimera  Strange events began to unfold on the planet of Onderon. Shortly after the mysterious kidnapping of the Queen and the Princess, an unknown Duchess of Onderon contacted Kimmie and requested a meeting. Unbeknownst to Kimmie, the Duchess was actually the powerful Sith Master, Chimera in Disguise. After discussing the current events on Onderon with the Duchess and seeing the maddened King holding court in a throne room covered in blood, Kimmie thought it would be best to take the Duchess into hiding. She disguised the Duchess as a padawan and brought her to Ruusan for her safety. The two moved to discuss the matters at hand in the basement of the Ruusan Museum, or so they thought. The Duchess began to exhibit strange behavior in their discussion, and before Master Kimmie knew what was happening, she found herself blacked out from a sleeping drug. The Duchess disappeared and two hours later Kimmie was found unconscious in the museum basement. Chimera began to use the infomation from their conversation, to plot a way to turn the Jedi Master.Capture and Fall  Kimmie soon became consumed with her work to unravel the mystery of the Emperor\u2019s Holocron. On Ruusan\u2019s New Years Eve, as all her Jedi friends were drunk and partying in the local cantina down the street from her home, Kimmie was nose deep into her work trying her hardest to find the missing holocron. Suddenly the High Dark Lady Darth Dolor, and her Shadowhand Darth Imida appeared from the shadows and knocked Kimmie unconscious. Kimmie was dragged from her home leaving behind a trail of blood to the shuttle docks and was taken to Korriban. When she awoke, Dolor began an extensive psychological torture of the Jedi Master for information on the Emperor\u2019s Holocron. Kimmie eventually freed herself from her bonds and began a desperate fight with Dolor and Imida, but was defeated. She was then handed over to Chimera, who stripped her of her Jedi garments and made Kimmie her own personal slave, and a slave to the Sith Empire. Since their previous visit, Chimera had taken all the knowledge she had of Kimmie, and created a holocron that was attuned to her. As she hung chained alone in the dungeon, the holocron spoke incessantly into her mind, filling it with the cries of her daughters and other maddening thoughts. After days listening to the holocron, Kimmie developed a dual personality, and entity known as Vulcanus, that began to take over her mind. Chimera also had Kimmie under go a series of brainwashings, to ensure her new darker personality had total control and her old self was suppressed. The Sith devised many tests for her, which not only tested her loyalty, but also made her question her beliefs as a Jedi. She was attacked by a Jedi Master who sought to redeem her to the lightside again and killed the woman out of anger and self defense. A fellow Jedi Knight named Breanna Pomeray came in search of Kimmie on Korriban, but ended up being brutally attacked and temporarily blinded by the very friend she sought to find. As the Sith continued to train Kimmie in the their ways she was eventually freed of her slave status and sent back to Ruusan, to steal the Emperor\u2019s holocron as an act of loyalty. With the aid of Darth Dolor, Kimmie completed her task and returned to Korriban. There she renounced her Jedi ways and swore allegiance to the Sith. She was also given the new name, Vulcanus, as a final act of separating her from her past. Fearing for the safety of her children, Master Don Gaton, a close and personal friend of Kimmie\u2019s took her daughters into hiding, to be kept safe from the influence of their now fallen mother. Whether she will return to the lightside or not is anyone\u2019s guess, but for now, the Kimmie Aeon so many came to know and love, is gone and a new woman known as Vulcanus has taken her place.Life as a Sith A Chance for Redemption  Due to her experience and prowess as a former Jedi Master, Kimmie was inducted into Sith Dynasty by Chimera and Darth Dolor. Unbeknownst to her, an agent of the PGA, named Atticus, was present as a spy during Kimmie\u2019s turning. He alerted the PGA and together with Imperial forces under Imperial Knight Captain Christopher Novastar, set a trap for Kimmie, and called her to Imperial Coruscant for a meeting. Upon arrival Kimmie, who was wavering towards returning to the light, was rushed by a large force of PGA and Imperial troops and a few Jedi Covenant members as well. She was publically stripped of her PGA citizenship and numerous awards she received in the service of the RLF in the war against the Empire, before she was imprisoned without a trial. In her eyes, the Republic she once fought so hard to protect had betrayed her. In her cell she was shot repeatedly by stormtroopers under Novastar\u2019s command which only helped to fuel her hatred. As sith from her order began to look for her, she was moved to a remote Imperial Outpost off planet somewhere in the Outer Rim, where the Imperial Executor Ardonis and Atticus tried to persuade her to return back to the light. She refused and was later returned to Korriban by Atticus himself. Atticus believed there is still good somewhere inside Kimmie and that perhaps with time her eyes would be opened once again.Sopranis and Amunet  Upon returning to Korriban Kimmie took up residence in a small home in the Valley of the Dark Lords. She spent most of her days studying with other apprentices at the academy, specifically a former adversary of hers, a changeling known as Sopranis. Unfortunately for Sopranis, her lust for power led her to her downfall, and she was imprisoned inside of a holocron she stole from Jedi Knight Breanna Pomeray, which set into motion a chain of events that would intertwine both Breanna and Kimmie\u2019s futures. Kimmie confronted her old Jedi comrade inside the tomb of Marka Ragnos and played on her unstable emotions concerning Kimmie\u2019s fall. Breanna became enraged and was able to get the best of Kimmie, or so she thought. As she was about to deal the final blow, Darth Andraste, a Shadow Hand to the Emperor stepped in and defeated Breanna, who renounced her ways as a Jedi and joined Kimmie in the ranks of Sith Dynasty. Like Kimmie, Breanna also adopted a new name, Amunet.Erasing Her Past: Darth Vulcanus is Born  At Chimera and Dolor\u2019s request, Kimmie began to erase all traces of her past life as a Jedi. She constructed a new lightsaber she dubbed nemesis, adopted a new style of dress and new outlook on life. To further server herself from her past, and prove her loyalty to the Sith, Kimmie decided attack her former teacher, Council Master Undala Oceanlane of the Praxeum Academy. She encountered her old Master in the Jedi Archives of Coruscant, where she lured him into a false sense of security and then struck. As hard as he tried to convince her to turn, Kimmie would not listen to reason and in the end defeated Undala by dropping one of the academy archive shelves on him after a very long fight. Believing he was dead, Kimmie returned to Korriban to a very impressed Darth Dolor. After numerous other battles and proving herself in combat on many occasions, Darth Dolor promoted Kimmie to the rank of Darth. While she never officially underwent apprenticeship, Darth Dolor and Chimera were key figures in fostering her rise in power. Upon taking the name, Darth Vulcanus, Kimmie chose Amunet to be her first apprentice, and the two began to prepare for what would become a civil war within the Sith Ranks.The Korriban Academy  Shortly after Emperor Arzjah returned to Korriban, disaster struck the Sith. The High Dark Lady, Darth Dolor, was presumably killed in action after her former mentor crashed a large freighter into her. Her body was never found after the incident and Dolor\u2019s Shadow Hand Darth Imida stepped up and became the new High Dark Lady. Darth Imida had long respect Kimmie, even when she was a Jedi and was impressed with her work in Cartography and Sith Artifacts. Upon witnessing Kimmie effortlessly defeat three Jedi Knights who were robbing tombs on Korriban Darth Imida promoted her to the rank of Sith Master. Due to her reknown teaching style and dedication to her apprentices as well, Kimmie was also made the Headmistress of the Korriban Sith Academy. She was greatly delighted and jumped into her new roles, quickly establishing a curriculum and appointing instructors for various fields.The Nightsister Debacle  As the Sith Dynasty grew stronger in the galaxy, dark siders from across the vast reaches of the galaxy flocked to Korriban, seeking out new allies amongst the sith. Ironically, one of these groups were the Nightsisters of the planet Dathomir. While Darth Vulcanus was away from the academy, the Nightsister Queen along with several of her witches marched into the Korriban Academy and confronted a group of adepts, demanding they fetch a master. The adepts, who were in the midst of their studies, couldn\u2019t care less about the Nightsisters\u2019 demands. Enraged her demands were not being met, the Nightsister Queen flew into a rage and struck down several of the adepts, causing them to scatter in confusion. At this time Vulcanus was returning from her duties off world and could sense the chaos brewing in the academy\u2019s main hall. As she stepped into the main hall, the Nightsister Queen turned upon her, not realizing who she was, and found herself outmatched by the sith master. The Queen and her followers beat a hasty retreat to the spaceport, where they climb in their ancient ships and appeared to take off. Vulcanus then headed into the Valley of the Dark Lords, searching for a pack of Tu\u2019Kata hounds that had made a den to close to the academy as some students reported. Hours later the Nightsisters returned and confronted Darth Malacia, the Shadowhand to Dark Lady Dolor at the time. They began to related their \u201calledged\u201d poor treatment to Malacia when Vulcanus arrived from her hunt. Vulcanus became enraged at the fact the Nightsisters had the audacity to return after their lack of respect, and as she stepped forward, the Queen and her witches began to run towards the spaceport again, to repeat the same action they tried earlier. This time however, Vulcanus was more than prepared. As the Queen\u2019s ship lifted off the ground, Vulcanus took hold of it by reaching out with the force, and then slammed it into the Academy bridge, causing it to crash. The Queen crawled out of her smoking cockpit to be confronted by Vulcanus, holding her Lightsaber at the ready. Vulcanus took a Makashi stances an issued a florish to the Queen and challenged her to a one on one fight to the death, to which the queen gladly accepted, under the conditions that no force powers would be employed. The two combatants faced off as activity on Korriban seemed to stand still, watching the battle between the two. Even a scouting detachment of GAR clones ventured up to the academy bridge to view the spectacle. Unfortunately for the Queen, the battle did not go well for her, and she was quickly struck down. As her followers gathered up her body, Vulcanus declared the Nightsisters and their allies enemies of the Sith Empire and banished them from Korriban, as Darth Malacia took note of the rising Sith Master\u2019s progress only hinting at her thoughts with a slight smile upon her face.Gaining a Handmaiden  While enroute to the planet Malachor V, Kimmie\u2019s Xesh was disabled and pulled aboard a Trandoshian Slave ship via a tractor beam. Although she could have easily of defeated the slave crew, Kimmie felt as if the force was guiding her to something, and allowed herself to be captured. She was taken to a cell and it was there she met a young Cathar girl who she affectionately named Kitten. Kitten related her story to Kimmie, about how her village had refused to give up there land to a large mining company, and they asked for Jedi Intervention. Her tribe had taken up arms against the Jedi but were unsuccessful. In her escape she was apprehended by the same Trandoshians that had captured Kimmie and taken aboard the ship they were now upon. Kimmie burned with rage hearing Kitten\u2019s tale, and revealed her real identity to the girl as a Sith Master. Unafraid Kitten vowed to serve Kimmie with her life if she would seek revenge against the Jedi who scattered her tribe. Kimmie easily broke the walls to her cell with a powerful force repulse technique, and proceeded to slaughter the Trandoshian Slaver\u2019s aboard the ship in revenge. After boarding her Xesh the two travelled back to Korriban, where Kitten became the handmaiden and pet to Kimmie, helping her with administrative tasks in the Korriban Academy.Rise to Shadowhand Building a Navy  As time passed on Korriban, Darth Vulcanus began to slowly consolidate power through various means. On one of her frequent trips beyond the outer rim into Wild Space, Vulcanus discovered an ancient civilization long forgotten from the days of the old republic. After adopting their technology and integrating it with ship designs and parts from today\u2019s era, Vulcanus commissioned the ships that became the backbone of Korriban small naval armada: The A-15 Corsair. In additions to the Corsair, a large capital ship known as the Vengeance was produced as well. Vulcanus also knew she would need troops to man these vessels and establish the Korriban Sith Trooper Guard to do so. The Guard always stayed very small, with many mercenaries fearing repercussions from the Republic if they were to leave and serve the Sith Empire.Destruction of the Korriban Academy  In time Darth Dolor returned to Korriban but her body was severely damaged from the attack by her former master. On one fateful day, Vulcanus discovered a slave from crashed Hutt Sailing Barge, starving and barely alive on the surface of Korriban and brought her back to the Academy. As she was activating the slave ID tag on the woman\u2019s thigh, Dolor burst into the room and claimed ownership of the girl, exerting her authority as the new Empress. A scuffle ensued between the two, and soon turned into an all out battle as each of the two wanted ownership of the woman. Unbeknownst to either of the two, Vulcanus\u2019s apprentice, Layla, quickly stole away the girl during the middle of her fight, and soon claimed her for her own. The duel between the two powerful sith escalated as Vulcanus unveiled a powerful telekinetic Lightsaber combat technique. In order to cease the oncoming sabers, Dolor opened up a force storm in the middle of the Korriban Academy where the two were fighting, which began to suck anything around it into a void. Dolor and numerous students escaped, but as the Academy disintegrated into the void, Vulcanus was no where to be found. As Dolor boasted her victory over the Headmistress, Vulcanus emerged behind her barely able to stand after being buried under rubble for the Academy, and climbing out of the large crater it made. Seeing the headmistress alive the students rushed to support her, until it was evident there was an apparent line drawn between the Sith. Vulcanus laughed as she stepped forward, kneeling in Dolor\u2019s presence, revealing that all along she had hope for a battle like this, to test her true strength. The now newly self anointed Darth Dolor and her apprentice Dark Lady Malicia, pleased with Vulcanus\u2019s display of power, appointed her as Malicia\u2019s Shadowhand. Her first acting duty as Shadowhand, ironically, was to assist in procurement of slaves to rebuild the Korriban Academy she had helped accidentally destroy. During the destruction of the Korriban Academy, Vulcanus's handmaiden Kitten was one of the casualties, due to the fact she was not able to escape in time. In addition to losing much of her work and her pet, Vulcanus gained more with her new rank as Shadowhand. Immediately after her apppointment to Shadowhand, Vulcanus took an apprentice known as Layla, a young girl who had come to the academy by stowing away on a freighter on Tantooine. Unlike previous apprentices Layla strived hard to attain true power and is the only Sith Apprentice of Vulcanus ever took that made it to the rank of Darth.The Shadows of Primus Forming a New Order  As construction began on the new Korriban Academy it became evident to many that a spy had was within the ranks of the Sith Dynasty. Outraged that sensitive information was being fed to the republic and that the Sith Dynasty was being turned against their new allies, the Assembly of Darkness, Empress Dolor began a purge if all Sith who she perceived as unloyal to her Sith Empire. The purge destroyed what was left of the Sith Dynasty, and a new order known as the Shadows of Primus emerged. Vulcanus played a major role in the creation of this new order, by tracking down members still loyal to the Empress, and disposing of one\u2019s who were not. In addition to this she played a major role as a liaison between the SoP and the Assembly of Darkness, making sure their new allies settled in comfortably on Korriban.A Spy In Their Midst  Tensions continued to rise as a spy began to tear apart all the work the Shadows of Primus had begun. Notes began to surface in the academy with fake orders for assassinations on Vulcanus\u2019s life, and a bombing occurred in the hospital area of the Korriban Academy, completely destroying it. Enraged the spy was still at large, Vulcanus and Dark Lady Imida devised a plan they hoped would draw her out in the open. Imida openly admitted to Vulcanus she had plans to assassinate Vulcanus, when in reality she did not, and the two staged a mock fight in the presence of the Empress and a few of the students. As Imida took her planned dive, Vulcanus took the injured Dark Lady to Dolor\u2019s Lab, and encased her in a cryogenic freeze to keep her alive. Almost immediately another note from the spy surfaced in the academy claiming Imida was the traitor everyone sought for, showing the spy was still at large. The sith began a desperate search knowing that Imida and the other masters where no longer part of the conspiracy. Vulcanus located a new adept, a purple twi\u2019lek she had never seen skulking about the Empress\u2019s throne room. As she confronted the adept, the twi\u2019lek lost her patience in Vulcanus\u2019s presence and turned upon her. Vulcanus then realize the twi\u2019lek was not a student of the academy, but Darth Dolor\u2019s former Master Evu, a member of a secretive organization known as the Teras Kasi. The two began to exchange blows but their fight was short lived as Evu incapacitated Vulcanus by striking her hard in the back with her palm. Evu was able to escape but not before sending a virus through the Academy\u2019s computer systems.The Shadowhand\u2019s Wrath  In time, Vulcanus recovered from her wounds and resumed her daily duties at the academy. The Assembly of Darkness had embarked upon a massive campaign to purge the Jedi of Ruusan, and the Shadows of Primus had sent many of their best Sith to various places in the galaxy to gather intelligence, leaving Korriban relatively undefended. It was because of this fateful event, a Jedi Order from Tantooine, known as The Force, came to Korriban. Unbeknownst to the Vulcanus and two students that were with her, one of their members snuck into the Korriban Academy and within moments their entire order showed up, quickly surrounding the Academy, claiming that the Sith had kidnapped her. Outraged and faced with overwhelming odds, Vulcanus put out an urgent cry to the Assembly, who sent three of their members as fast as they could back to Korriban to assist. When they arrived the Shadows of Primus, under Vulcanus\u2019s order, flew into a frenzy and caught the Jedi off guard. A massive battle ensued between the extremely outnumbered Shadows of Primus and the Jedi. When the battle was over only one sith out of the six was wounded, the other five including Vulcanus had minor wounds. The Jedi however were not so lucky. Their bodies littered the floors halls of the academy and left a trail throughout the valley leading to the spaceport. Vulcanus claimed the fight was a decisive victory for the Sith against their Jedi adversaries and celebrated by creating a massive funeral pyre in the Valley of the Dark Lords, that stayed burned for weeks.Redemption The Awakening  With Layla\u2019s training under her now complete, Vulcanus decided to seek out another apprentice in her old padawan Githa\u2019breda. Vulcanus devised a plan in which she lured Githa to Korriban under the guise she had returned back to the light side and was to be executed. Githa, fearing for her old mentors safety, rushed to Korriban and made her way to the academy\u2019s torture room, where Vulcanus had staged a mock torture session to send Githa into a rage. Her plan worked and Githa attacked Darth Layla and Serena and Vulcanus had planned, but then something happened that she did not expect. Githa was able to over power both of the Sith and in doing so Kimmie took a heavy blow to the head which knocked her unconscious. The blow had other affects as well, that would become evident to Githa later on. The strike to the head was able to allow Kimmie\u2019s old self who had been long suppressed for years gain an upper hand over the force spirit controlling her and resurface. Githa quickly gathered up her old master and fled the academy taking her back to Coruscant. On Coruscant was treated in the civilian medical bay, as a nervous crowd of on lookers watched anxiously. Some Jedi felt she was to dangers to be left alive, but it was thanks to Githa that she was kept alive. While in the bacta tank, Kimmie\u2019s datapad was left on her and fell out. The datapad revealed sensitive information pertaining to the slave trade on Korriban before shorting out and angered Githa, who quickly flew into a rage and started to choke Kimmie as she awoke in the tank. Githa soon realized Kimmie was suffering from Amnesia and had no recollection of her time as a sith and let her go. On Coruscant Kimmie was reunited with several Jedi previously affiliated with the NOJ, that had left for one reason or another. Kimmie was also introduce to Master Eva or the Jedi Covenant and Master Kalu and her padawan Yoshimo of the Old Order of the Jedi, who took her into protective custody and began to rehabilitate her back to the light. Meanwhile, the Sith had no idea of the events transpiring upon Coruscant and under the order of Dark Lady Imida, scouts were sent out to search for the Headmistress. Kimmie\u2019s whereabouts on Corsucant were soon discovered by an adept who quickly reported her findings to Darth Layla, Kimmie\u2019s former apprentice. While Kimmie underwent tests with the Jedi Covenant, under the supervision of Master Lucas Atlantis and Atticus, the Sith began plotting for a way to bring Vulcanus back to Korriban.Freedom  As Kimmie lay in the care of the Jedi Covenant the Holocron reactivated, attempting to call her back to the Darkside, but this time she resisted. Days passed and then came the inevitable day when the sith launched their surprise. Kimmie was alone in the Covenant office on Coruscant as the Jedi attended their weekly Senate meeting across the Galaxy on Rhen Var when the sith led by Darth Layla, entered the building and abducted her. As they were escaping, Master Eva returned and trapped one of them inside while the rest flew back to Korriban with an unconscious Kimmie. Kimmie awoke hours later to find herself laying on an operating table, with Malacia and Layla standing over her. They were concerned about Kimmie\u2019s strange behavior on Coruscant, and Kimmie realized that had no clue she had betrayed them. Unarmed and seeking a way out, Kimmie began to pretend she had resumed the role of Vulcanus again, but it did not last for long. Malacia had taken note that Kimmie\u2019s eyes had changed back to their original appearance and began to taunt her claiming her children were dead, seeking to turn Kimmie back to the Sith. An enraged Kimmie wrestled Layla\u2019s sabers from her grasp and turned upon Malacia. The two fought fiercely inside the medical bay until Kimmie began to hear the cries of her daughters echoing throughout the academy. After out foxing the Dark Lady by sealing her and Layla inside the Medical Area, Kimmie searched throughout the depths of the academy, following the sound of the voices. Kimmie found her way to the library where she discovered the holocron encased in a museum display. Malacia and Layla charged in the room hot on her heels and a desperate struggle ensued over the holocron. As Layla attempted to pull the holocron to her, Kimmie lunged forward, and plucked it out of the air. Upon grasping hold it, Vulcanus\u2019s spirit seized the opportunity to attempt to take Kimmie\u2019s mind again by force. The holocron began to glow a bright green and Malacia and Layla stood back as Kimmie resisted the pull of the darkside. Kimmie began to focus all of her energy upon the internal conflict over her soul and was able to channel Vulcanus\u2019s spirit out of her mind and into the Holocron. As the holocron lit up the room in a bright green light, Vulcanus screamed through the force that she would return, as she was sealed within the holocron. The holocron began to shake and overheat, which caused Kimmie to drop it upon the floor, causing it to shatter into shatter into Jades shards as it hit. Kimmie, now free of the hold Vulcanus had over her, breathed a sigh of relief, but it was short lived as Malacia and Layla flew into a rage and charged Kimmie, to avenge Vulcanus. Kimmie faced what she thought was certain death when suddenly a smoke bomb had exploded in the room and an unseen presence snatched her away. It was only later that Kimmie realized that it was Master Kalu who had rescued her from certain death, having followed Kimmie after her abduction, and witnessed her rejection of the Darkside.Confronting Imida  Kimmie continued to stay with the Jedi Covenant upon Coruscant, searching for clues to her daughters whereabouts when a strange message came from an unknown woman, claiming to have seen her daughters, and to meet her at the hedge gardens near the Covenant office. When she arrived Kimmie was startled to see Darth Imida sitting upon one of the benches in front of her. Imida revealed she was the one who had called Kimmie to her in hopes that she would return to the dark side, but undeterred, Kimmie stepped forward stating she still sensed good in Imida and tried to sway her towards the light. Imida grew angry, seeing that Kimmie was incapable of returning to them and attacked her. Their duel lasted only minutes before Imperial forces began to swarm towards the area and Imida taunted Kimmie, saying she had her daughters on Korriban, and would kill them if she did not come. Kimmie then followed Imida back to Korriban, in hopes of rescuing her daughters, but knew in her heart she was just merely walking into a trap. Imida surrounded herself with Kimmie\u2019s former apprentice Layla, and Serena who was now apprenticed to Darth Dolor. After a long trek through the Valley of the Dark Lords and sneaking in through the academy through the hanger on the roof, Kimmie was able to lure Imida outside the Academy\u2019s main hall and back into the valley, sealing the two apprentices inside. Imida and Kimmie fought savagely as the apprentice quickly cut through the heavy stone door of the academy, which ended up falling upon Imida. Kimmie began to beat a hasty retreat but was cut off when Serena and Layla attacked her. She engaged the two adepts, displaying incredible usages of the force, long since suppressed in her time as a Sith and soon over powered them both by utilizing Malacia, an incapacitating force skill that induces disorientation in those it affects. Imida and Kimmie\u2019s battle soon turned into a fist fight when Atticus arrived, having sensed Kimmie\u2019s struggle through the force, and was cut off by Imida\u2019s apprentice, Darth Andromeda, who had also arrived on the scene. In a last ditch effort to end Kimmie\u2019s life, Imida grasped Kimmie around the neck in a headlock and attempted to choke her to death. Unable to breath Kimmie extended her hand, calling one of her shoto blades she carried into the fight with her, and pressed it to her back. As she did she activated the emitter, which ignited the blade through her, and up into Imida\u2019s chest. As Kimmie screamed in agony, the Sith were threw into disarray as Imida blacked out, allowing Atticus a chance to rescue Kimmie. Knowing her safety was now compromised upon Coruscant, Atticus took Kimmie to the one place he thought she would be safe, the Jedi Temple upon Talus.The Search  In time Kimmie recovered and with the aid of the Jedi renewed her search for her daughters. Through the help of slicers, Kimmie was able to uncover information revealing her daughters were travelling on a transport ship that had crashed in the Rancor lowlands of the planet Dathomir. Fearing her daughters may be lost on the Dark World, Kimmie travelled to Dathomir and began her search. As she roamed the forests and rugged terrain, she was confronted by a large Rancor that drove her deep into the highlands, where she unexpectedly ran into Master Don Gaton and Lady Spec Bailey from her old Jedi Order, who were on a mission to Dathomir. Overjoyed to see their old friend had returned to the light Kimmie led the two to a nearby Jedi camp where she related her time as a sith to them. After seeing first hand that Kimmie\u2019s conversion was true, Gaton revealed that Kimmie\u2019s daughters were alive upon the water world of Mon Calamari, where he had kept them safe for the years Kimmie embraced the Darkside. Over joyed at the news, Kimmie embraced her friends who wished her well and then watched her depart from the planet.Final Confrontation  Before Kimmie embarked to Mon Calamari, she landed upon Talus again to gather her things and refuel her ship. As she was embarking to leave, a shadowy figure confronted her in the doorway and drew her sabers. Kimmie was stunned to learn her location had once again been compromised and her former Master she served as a Shadowhand, Dark Lady Malacia, had come after her for revenge. Kimmie took the full brunt of Malacia\u2019s attacks as she attempted to save two Padawans who had entered the room and had gotten caught up in the battle. Despite efforts from Master Azlum Grimlocks apprentice, Talmerith, nothing could stop Malacia and her rage to kill Kimmie. Kimmie was able lure Malacia outside and with the aid of her telekinesis, halt her at the doorway. Malacia then began a mental assault of Kimmie\u2019s mind as the Jedi looked on, and was able to rip the location of Kimmie\u2019s daughters from her. As she laughed, vowing to kill them, a man by the name of Riley West unloaded a tranquilizer dart into Malacia\u2019s back, dropping her where she stood. Knowing her daughters were now in danger, Kimmie boarded her ship and headed to Mon Calamari, to reunite with them both.Epilogue Reunion With Sera and Saya  Upon landing on Mon Calamari, Kimmie was able to quickly locate her daughters with the aid of a native Mon Calamarian known as Socari Ven. The joy of their reunion was short lived however, as Sith fighters broke through the planetary defenses and began an assault of the world. Realizing that she and her family were not hunted by the Sith Empire itself, Kimmie and her daughters left the planet at the urgings of Socari, and went far beyond the outer rim, into Wild Space, where the Sith could no longer find them.The Heroine's Legacy & A New Threat  And thus it was, that the time of Kimmie Aeon upon this galaxy, came to a close, but her legacy would live on. Many would remember her as a hero; someone who was willing to lay down her life to see to it that freedom, justice, and equality, for all beings was a reality in the universe. They would also remember her as someone who was always willing to act out against injustice, who would not sit silently as many of her Jedi former companions did, while innocent beings suffered across the galaxy. But many would also remember her for what she was; a villain, a scourge, amalevolent force of the dark side. To her former Jedi Order, who could not forgive, she would forever be labeled a traitor. Kimmie would remain far beyond the outer rim with her daughters, exploring unknown worlds, discovering new civilizations for the first time, and of course training her daughters in the ways of the force. She would wait in secret, watching the galaxy she once protected from afar knowing that one day, when need was dire, she may very well return to it. But for now, after so many years of chaos and strife she as once again found peace and serenity. For now, the tale of Kimmie Aeon yet another Jedi in Exile has come to a happy end. While Kimmie Aeon\u2019s tale ends, another one begins. Darkness falls upon the planet Korriban and out of it thunder and lightning emerge from a powerful electromagnetic storm. The power of the darkside begins to grow stronger and can be felt from by numerous force sensitives in the galaxy. In the depths of the Korriban Academy, a green light erupts from the floor in the main hall as a hand like mark is burnt into the time. A familiar voice can be heard by those looking on in disbelief, echoing through the force. For out of the ashes and the embrace of death steps an old foe now reborn. The time of Vulcanus has passed. The time of Saturnalia, has come.Personality and traits  Phyiscally Kimmie's most defining feature are her pointy elflike ears, which are the Morganian traits passed onto her from her mother. These ears do give her some amplified hearing. Originally Kimmie was a very kind gentle soul, who loved life and was always seen smiling and laughing. As a Jedi she was brave and courageous, and always put others, especially her Padawans, before herself. Sadly this Kimmie lies dormant inside the woman known as Vulcanus now. A fire of hatred burns inside of her for the Jedi and the republic she believes has betrayed her. She is cunning, shrewd, and overall cruel as a Sith. Perhaps her greatest strength lay in the fact she was able to control her emotions and not let them get the best of her in times of conflict. Mastery of her emotions is probably one of her greatest strengths. Vulcanus was also known to punish adepts and apprentices severely for not meeting her expectations in the academy. In her earlier career as a New Republic Spy, Kimmie under went special training to resist different forms of torture and mental manipulation and in doing so, is unable to be affected by mind tricks or mental manipulations. A very powerful Sith Master, such as Darth Dolor or Darth Malacia however, could still probe into her mind but find it very difficult to do so. Another strength lies in the fact her force powers are centered around stealth and evasion. Kimmie was also a master Cartographer and knew many planets, including Sith worlds like the back of her hand. As a Sith, Kimmie under went an ancient Sith ritual at the hand of Darth Dolor, in which twelve red crystals infused with Dolor's essence with stabbed into various joints in her body. This was to ensure Kimmie would never return to the light but was still able to be over come. The crystals heightened Kimmie's natural force abilities significantly while also allowing her to feel Dolor's presence at all times. Along with her strengths, Kimmie has several weaknesses. One is that her body is very susceptible to foreign toxins, due to a genetic defect in her immune system. Some toxins and poisons work twice as fast in her body. In addition to this, the holocron created by Chimera was also telepathically attuned to her before it was destroyed. If Kimmie\u2019s thoughts begin to waver towards feelings of doubt in her abilities or fear, the holocron began to mentally torture her with maddening sounds and the desperate cries for help from her two children, which can incapacitate her or cause her concentration to waver greatly.Powers and Abilites  Kimmie possesses minor technical skills from her past history as a New Republic Spy. These include first aid and tech healing skills, piloting skills, computer slicing, and endurance training to resist torture and interrogation.Lightsaber Training  Kimmie's chosen lightsaber form was originally Makashi, but she dropped this form entirely for Ataru, after the lack of speed nearly got her killed by Darth Rowe. She also applies principles of Sokan into her fighting style, taking advantage of her surroundings to use in the fight against her opponent. Occasionally, she practices a bit of Jar Kai but this is not her strongest form and she rarely uses it outside the sparring arena. Kimmie's saber stance is similar to that of Darth Talon, and this stance is unique to her from the stances of her fellow Jedi.Force Abilities  As for her Force Powers, Kimmie possesses some minor force healing, just enough to comfort a being or to heal very minor wounds. She has remarkable telekinetic powers which give her heightened senses and also allow her to move very large objects with very minimal effort. During the destruction of the first Ruusan, Kimmie moved a large piece of a ruined apartment building to seal off the entrance to the Valley of the Jedi. The rest of her powers are centered around stealth and evasion. She shows strong abilities in force speed and also force empathy. Kimmie is also a practitioner of the force illusion technique, and is discovering more ways to utilize the ability. Lady Kimmie is also known to use a powerful \"Force\" headbutt, in times of extreme desperation again a superior foe. Upon hitting, the headbutt incapacitates Kimmie and her opponent, rendering them unconcious and in severe pain. Master Zephan has described the move as \"epic.\" During her fall to the Darkside, Kimmie displayed use of several dark force powers but on a weak unrefined scale. In her fights with her former Jedi friends she used force choke, force lightning and even a weak but still effect force repulse technique. Under Darth Dolor Kimmie learned the force concealment technique and used this to project a false Lightside aura, which tricked several clones and Jedi as she stole the Emperor\u2019s Holocron. During her duel with Darth Dolor inside the Korriban Academy, Kimmie, as Darth Vulcanus, displayed an incredible mastery of the Telekinetic lightsaber combat technique. After her redemption Kimmie utilized many abilites that showed her skills had significantly increased in her time on Korriban. In her duel against Dark Lady Imida, Kimmie utilized the force skill Malacia, to induce disorientation, nausea, and even vomitting in Serena and Darth Layla, and incapacitate them from the fight. In her final battle on Talus against Dark Lady Malacia, Kimmie was noted using the technique known as plant surge, by causing the roots in a potter near Malacia to grow and wrap around her ankles.Equipment Apparel  While on Ruusan Kimmie either wears traditional Jedi robes, usually in the shade of a blood red color. Since her promotion to master, Kimmie also wears a red and gold colored outfit quite frequently in addition to traditional Jedi apparel. Kimmie can always be seen wearing a necklace in the shape of an Angel with a pink crystal in the center. The crystal is actually a small shard of the legendary Kaiburr crystal. When out traveling the galaxy for extended periods of time, Kimmie usually wears a explorer's outfit, complete with a backpack and fedora. The backpack contains survival and navigation gear, including a tent, torch, and archeological pick. While undercover for the order on hostile Sith worlds, Kimmie wears a black trench-coat-like outfit and white cosmetics to help her blend in. In her RLF disguise as Starfire, Kimmie wear solid black Rebel Assault armor and a black face mask to cover her mouth. Her gaunlets are red and black and have a built in computer, programmed with navigation charts of various planets, and a health monitoring system in case she is injured in the field. One may also notice that while Kimmie is in this disguise, her hair is dyed black, and her eyes are red. The red eyes are not the taint of the darkside on her, but are actually red contact lenses used to confuse any retenal scanning devices. As a Sith Kimmie's outfit is primarily a set of traiditional robes. At times when travelling abroad she will dawn a heavy black cloak to conceal her face. She has also been seen wearing an assassin's outfit, complete with a glider jetpack for maneuvering in urban cityscapes. Towards the end of her days as a Sith, Kimmie wore a Sith Alchemy Amulet, along with a strange Darkside artifact upon her wrist. The artifact fed off of her emotions but gave her no special abilities. Kimmie also wore a special headband that was remotely linked to her computer found in her office on Korriban. The headband contained a tiny video camera that recorded images from her point of view. One can surmise she possibly used this for spying or was planning to.Lightsabers  Kimmie has built several different lightsabers throughout her lifetime, mainly to replaced ones that were destroyed.Justicar and Executor (Padawan Sabers)  These two sabers were the first ones Kimmie created during her padawanship under Master Undala Oceanlane. They were dubbed the nickname: \"The Ice Picks\" by several sith, due to the fact that the hilt guards made the sabers look like two ice picks when unlit. When lit, the two swords both glowed with a yellow blade. When Kimmie was a Padawan IV, her ship crashed hard into the swamps of dagobah and upon impact, the Executor Saber was severely damaged. Kimmie resorted to using Justicar only until she built another saber as a knight.Centurion  Kimmie completed the Centurion saber when she was a knight. She wanted a saber that could go undercover with her, if she visited a hostile sith planet. The Centurion had three intimidating prongs at the front, modelled after sith lightsabers. Despite looking so sithy in appearance the Centurion had a yellow blade. The saber met its end when Darth Rowe took it from Kimmie upon her captivity on Korriban.Chane  To replace the Centurion, Kimmie made a small elegant saber she called Chane. Its small design allowed her to have very fast movements, which fit her Ataru style perfectly. The blade contained a Viridian crystal which she found hidden in a cave on Korriban. Kimmie still posseses this saber today and uses it mainly in training practices with her padawans.Aurora's Legacy  Aurora's Legacy is a massive elegantly crafted saber Kimmie named in memory of her mother. The saber has an elongated hilt and is meant to be gripped by two hansds. Inside the blade is a rare ice blue crystal called the Aurora Crystal, a crystal discovered by Kimmie on Hoth. The saber and the crystal are named in memory of Kimmie's mother.Aurora's Dark Legacy  After finding design flaws in a previous saber, Kimmie recreated the saber Aurora's Legacy. The only difference between the first version and the second is the name and the crystal found inside. Aurora's Dark Legacy contained a special red crystal she collected on Dromund Kass. It also had a special emitter button that could increase or decrease the size of the blade according to the user's wish.Ravager  Upon her return to the light side, Kimmie constructed two elegantly crafted shotos she named Ravager. The blades contained peices of the Aurora crystal which she was able to recover from the Imperial Knights. Like her previous saber, both hilts for the shotos contained a special emitter that could increase or decrease the length of the blade, a feature that would save her life in her duel with Dark Lady Imida.Starships  Kimmie has flown a wide variety of ships over the years, from X-Wings, to A-Wings, even a few Imperial craft. In the RLF she was seen a few times flying a PGA Xesh against the empire. As a Sith she contracted the A-15 Corsairs for the Shadows of Primus and the Korriban Sith guard. The A-15 Corsairs are based upon the design of the Sith Intercerptors used by Darth Malek and Darth Nihilius's armadas.Accomplishments and Positions Held IC  -Former Padawan to Master Undala Oceanlane -Jedi Master of the New Order of the Jedi -Jedi General of the 75th Galactic Marines -Honorary Member of the Wroshyr Tribe of Kashyyyk -Cartographed over 36 planets in the SWRP Universe -Trained 4 Padawans to Knighthood in the NOJ -Curator of Darkside Antiquities at the Ruusan Museum of Art -Headmistress of the Korriban Sith Academy -Sith Master of the Sith Dynasty -Shadowhand to Dark Lady Malicia of the Sith Dynasty and then Shadows of Primus -Founder of the Korriban Sith Trooper Guard -Founder of the Korriban Sith Slaves Group -One of the founders of the Shadows of PrimusOOC  -Former Senior GM of Ruusan Sim -Senior GM of Galactic Primus (Korriban) Sim -Administrator for the Galactic UnityQuotes  \"Master Undala always said to use your head.\" The Sith may have taught me the very basics of the Force, but it was the Jedi who taught me how to utilize it properly, and that is by helping others.

Above all else, always remember these words that Kreia said to the Jedi Exile so long ago: It is not the destination that matters. It is the journey.\"Dark Lords of the Sith  Dark Lords of the Sith (DLoTS) is one of the oldest SWRP groups in Second Life, originally founded by Darth Padar in 2005.History Origins  Back in the mists of time, there was a Sith Lord of great power and prominence. His name was Darth Padar, and he formed the first of the modern Sith Orders, The Dark Lords of the Sith (DLoTS). This is the Order, therefore, from which - whether they acknowledge it or not - most of the major Sith Orders today have arisen or been influenced by in some manner.The Reign of Darth Padar  Darth Padar brought life back to the ancient homeworld of Korriban and it became a name of terror for the Jedi again. Once more, the Sith were united and ordered as they had not been since the times of Emperor Krayt, and once more the Dark Side permeated all. The reign of Darth Padar on Korriban was long and terrible, and only ended when he ended it himself in a rage at being questioned by his supporters, and drove all from Korriban, vanishing once more into the ether...Stabilization  The first of many Apprentices of Padar was Darth Mortis ((Omega Groshomme)) and he became the heir to the original Dark Lord, and has since taken on a role of spiritual guardian of the Order, rarely being in direct control but wielding great influence from a shadowy distance as the kingmaker. For a short period after the departure from Korriban, he took over control of the Order and then searched for a suitable leader, leaving it eventually to Dark Lady Malice who also known as Malificient, before vanishing himself into the shadows. It was she who brought the Order to a place on the planet Orion, and her influence was to stabilise and rebuild the Order from its traumas. Her contribution to the survival of the Order was key, for without this stability that she offered, the Order could very well have disintegrated from Darth Padar's rage. Unfortunately, Dark Lady Malice fell under the Light sided influence of Jedi Master Marymac Dougall and departed to serve the New Order of the Jedi, and rule of the Dark Lords fell to Darth Zen ((Zip Paz)) and Darth Vega ((Andriste Nesiote)), again granted by the brief return of Darth Mortis. Annointing the new Dark Lords, it was rumoured that Darth Mortis was one of few who could still directly commune with Darth Padar himself. Darth Zen and Darth Vega's rule brought a return to prosperity to the Sith who still followed only the DLoTS banner, and with Darth Mortis' assistance they even managed to persuade Darth Padar to allow the Order to base itself on Korriban again. For a time, there was great success in this arrangement and the Jedi trembled again at the power and majesty of the Dark Lords of the Sith.The Return of Darth Padar and the Schism  As is often the case with the Sith, however, harmony can be shortlasting. Darth Padar saw the fortunes of his old Order rising again and made a grab for power once more. There was a terrible internal war, and the Sith split into several factions for the first time since Darth Padar created his Order. Dark Lords Zen and Vega managed to keep Darth Padar from retaking his old Order but at terrible cost. Exhausted by their endeavours, they could no longer lead the Sith and dwindled into shadows of their former selves, and the Homeworld of Korriban was devastated, becoming uninhabitable for many decades. Yet again, Darth Padar vanished into the ether. Some said he had perished in the war, others said he had not and yet others said he had split himself into numerous personas, walking unseen amongst the Sith and wielding just as much influence as he had done, but in a more subtle way.The First Rule of Emperor Validus  Darth Mortis still stood by the ashes of the Order, supporting it in these uncertain times and keeping it alive for its next leader. The survivors of the war settled on the planet of Dantooine and found themselves in direct conflict with Jedi, the Senate and their military enforcement. Into this strife, emerged the Sith Lord who would become the next Dark Lord, Darth Validus ((Mortious Darragh)), who eventually led the Sith to a new planet, Byss in the Deep Core. This was again a time of great power and prosperity, most of the factions which had fled from Padar's rage returned, not necessarily back to DLoTS but in a coalition of a Sith Empire on this dark planet. It was a fortress world, guarded by the 7th Legion of Imperial Stormtroopers and ruled by the new Emperor Validus, and it was great and powerful indeed, regarded as the Sith Capital by all. Many of the other factions like Sith Legends, Sith Legacy (which later became the New Order of the Sith), Sith Ancients and Dark Ancients also prospered during this time and all regarded Validus' reign as a great success. Eventually though, the strain of the years of leading the often fractious Sith took its toll on Emperor Validus and he devastated Byss with the superweapon of his massive Super Star Destroyer \"SSD Ravager\", and departed into the Unknown Regions. Many compared this to the rage of Darth Padar when the latter devastated Korriban but it was later shown that Validus had other motives and that his part in the Sith story was not over by a long stretch...The Silent Years: Hibernation  With Darth Mortis also nowhere to be found at this time, leadership of the Order passed to Validus' second-in-command, a former Jedi Master known as Devarii ((Rickin Gorilla)). He had been the leader of Sith Legacy which became the New Order of the Sith, and this had eventually merged into the Dark Lords of the Sith. Under the time of Emperor Validus, Devarii had served as the Imperial Executor, second only to the Emperor himself. However, by now the Dark Lords were a shadow of their former strength, the handful of survivors of Validus' attack were no longer enough to keep the Order pre-eminent amongst the Sith and some of the other Orders began to dominate. After the dust had settled, the capital of the Sith moved from Byss to Ziost and this was predominantly controlled by the Sith Legends. Dark Lord Devarii spent much time voyaging out from Ziost to look for other scattered survivors of DLoTS and in these increasingly length absences (( caused in fact by RL )), there began a time of slow decay for the Dark Lords of the Sith. One of Darth Devarii's Shadow Hands, Darth Destius (( Torsteinn Elvehjem )), watched over the Order as it slept, standing guard tirelessly much as Darth Mortis once had done, and waiting for the return of his Master. He keeping up the Order alive, if barely, and maintained the temple and its all-important archives, building them up to safeguard the history of the Sith. Somewhere along the line, a Sith Lord from Ziost decided to form his own Order - the Assembly of Darkness - on the long-abandoned planet of Vjun. Darth Kestrel (( RR Almodovar )) gathered together Sith from many places, including from fallen Orders and built Vjun into a powerful world, eventually eclipsing the fading capital world of Ziost. His power grew to the extent that he declared himself the new Emperor of the Sith and started gathering the Sith Orders to him on Vjun, much as Emperor Validus had once done on Byss. At this time, Dark Lord Devarii resurfaced and on advice of Darth Destius, relocated DLoTS to the new Sith Capital on Vjun. A temple was built there, and the Order was set to grow again and to rise to prominence among the various Orders of the Sith once more. Yet again, however, Darth Devarii vanished, searching for lost members of the Order, and leaving the Order decaying with his Apprentice struggling to keep it alive.  Despite the Order having a temple on Vjun, Darth Destius was struck by sudden foresight that they were uniquely vulnerable being in the midst of Sith of other orders and that there might well be in the manner of the Sith sudden treachery designed to destroy them. Therefore he sallied forth in secret and came to the little known planet of Dromund Kaas, once home to an ancient Sith Empire and later the Prophets of the Dark Side. Steeped in the Dark Side, it seemed to be the ideal place to build a secret temple to be a place of refuge in case of treachery from within the Empire.The Return of the Dark Lords  Many years later, Darths Mortis and Validus eventually returned, hearing the calls through the Force of Darth Destius for his Master. They came back to take the fallen Order from Darth Devarii's absent grasp. Both Dark Lords were rejuvenated and, aided by a resurgent Destius, they combined to begin the long task of rebuilding the Dark Lords of the Sith to be once again the most powerful and feared Order it had been years before. Such was the effect of their return that the local Sith of Vjun began to fear their renewal and attacked the DLoTS temple on Vjun when it was unguarded, destroying it utterly and forcing the Order to decamp to the secret temple on Dromund Kaas. After many years of regrowth on this remote planet, the Order became strong enough once again to stand firm against all who would undo it and sallied forth to lay claim upon Dark Lord Validus' old seat of power on Byss. By this time, the Empire on Vjun had fallen and Validus set about reforming his old Empire once again.The Second Rule of Emperor Validus  The planet of Byss was greater and stronger than it had ever been and Dark Lord Validus chose to form his fortress around ancient once-buried towers which had been uncovered by the Ravager's superweapon all those years ago. Once he was ready, he declared himself Sith Emperor once more and stretched forth his will across many worlds, enforced by his dreaded Hands. Many Sith, both old and new, flocked to the resurgent Dark Lords of the Sith, including many of the Sith who were in the Order of Rowe including Darth Rowe herself. Together they became much as the Order had been in Padar's time, the scourge of the Galaxy, defeating many enemies including: the Jedi of Ruusan and their allies whose homeworld was occupied for a time, the Jedi of Ossus which became part of the Sith Empire, an alliance of various Jedi at Christophsis, the false Dark Siders Sith X / [[<(Dark Order)>]], the Mandalorians under Mand'alor Niv Dralshy'a and the Tetan Empire. The Empire stretched across worlds, and the Hands and the Emperor's new superweapon LEGION enforced Imperial Will in these territories and beyond in a time of great prosperity. As the Emperor himself turned away from the day to day matters of running his Empire, it was perhaps inevitable that he would face a challenge from within, from one of his own Hands...The ill-fated challenge of Darth Gevecht  The oldest of the Emperor's Hands, Darth Gevecht (( Khyle Foley )), grew impatient at what he saw as a relaxation, a slackening in the Empire due to its great security and stability. Seemingly content to rest on his considerable accomplishments, Validus seemed to the Hand to be looking not to the future but only to the past and at best the present, becoming more of a political leader than a Dark Lord of the Sith. In a spectacular show-down at an Empire meeting, Darth Gevecht challenged Emperor Validus for the right to rule the Empire. The response of the Emperor was scornful and disdainful, forcing Darth Gevecht to attack. Seemingly with great ease, the Shistavenan Hand overcame the Emperor, publicly dismembering the ancient Sith Lord with his lightwhip and claiming the titles of Dark Lords of the Sith and Emperor of the Sith Empire. Not all seemed quite so confident as the new Emperor however, for it seemed to them too easy a victory, and one which the old Emperor seemingly embraced with gusto... ...it turned out that Gevecht had been deceived and used. Over millennia, the old Emperor's body had disintegrated with constant use of the Dark Side until it barely hung together by the force of his will. Even so, it was soon to be his doom, trapping and yet suffocating him in its festering decay. The old Emperor had made plans to renew his spirit in the body of a Red Sith crafted by his Imperial Executor the Underlord. Goading Gevecht to slay his old shattered body only freed Validus' spirit to escape its chains and to fly to where the new host awaited for just this precise moment. After only a week, the reborn Validus returned and confronted Emperor Gevecht, easily destroying the latter with sorcery far superior to anything the Shistavanen knew. And so it was that Validus II became the next Sith Emperor, no doubt seeking to rule for eternity. This was a source of disquiet to many of the other Sith who had supported Emperor Gevecht, and chief amongst these was Darth Destius, one of Validus' other Hands. He confronted the new Emperor to declare himself a Hand no longer, but a Dark Lord of the Sith in his own right to take over the role of Darth Mortis. Sensing the support of the Order as a whole, the new Emperor had no choice but to agree, but watched Destius closely in case he would seek to overthrow him as Gevecht had once done.The Rise of Emperor Novo  This apparently threat from Dark Lord Destius was but a feint however, designed to keep Emperor Validus II's attention away from the truth. Unknown to any, Gevecht had left a clone of himself on Uvena Prime and in spirit form, he led his former Apprentice, Darth Nyx, to it. Enlisting Darth Destius' aid, the Emperor's superweapon LEGION was critically damaged and the spirit of Gevecht entered the new, more powerful clone body and returned to Byss to confront the Emperor. The confrontation between the reborn Gevecht and Validus II could have been every bit as violent and destructive as when Darth Padar had tried to displace Dark Lords Zen and Vega. Perhaps Gevecht had some sort of power against his old Master, perhaps Validus II sensed the disablement of LEGION or perhaps it was as Validus II claimed that he had sensed the return to the Galaxy of the original Sith Species and that he must venture out to welcome them back...but a devastating war was avoided. Emperor Validus II abdicated and left his Empire in the hands of the reborn Gevecht who took Emperor Novo to be his Imperial name. Under the new Emperor, much of the slackness that had begun to creep into the Empire towards the end of Validus' reign was burned away. New entities flocked to the Sith Empire's cause, new worlds like Manaan, Lehon and Xagobah were brought into the fold. The stagnation within both the Order and the Empire was purged away and brought up to new heights under Emperor Novo's banner. Unfortunately this iron-fisted reign would only have a short lifespan in comparison to some of Novo's predecessors.The destruction of the SSD Devastator  Emperor Novo's reign came to a sudden end when, shortly after the Sith Empire re-obtained Xagobah as an Imperial holding, the Shistavanen Dark Lord left to inspect the facilities on the planet. Upon his return trip home his SSD, the Devastator, was attacked without warning and destroyed. The Dark Council called for an immediate and extensive search of the wreckage and surrounding system but no trace of the missing Emperor was found. Emperor Novo was presumed dead. Even Darth Nyx with her special bond to her former Master was unable to sense any sign of life from the missing Emperor, and after a time the search was finally called off. It was not until more than a year after the destruction of the Devastator that an escape pod quite suddenly crash landed before the Jedi Temple on Onderon bearing, the severely malnourished and nearly dead form of the missing Dark Lord Novo. Luck was apparently still with the Shistavanen Sith as Darth Nyx was once again on hand to intervene and spare him a second trip to the Void, and he was brought back to health from his protective Force Trance. She was able to ensure her former Master both avoided imprisonment by the local Jedi Order and was nursed back to full health before making his return to the Imperial Capital. Novo thus returned to the Dark Lords of the Sith to retake his place as a Dark Lord and bring renewed strength the Order once more, this time under the new Emperor Destius.The new Emperor Destius and the Imperial City of Khayal  Almost immediately after the destruction of the SSD Devastator and the failed search for the former Emperor, rather than allow the Empire to crumble leaderless, Dark Lord Destius stepped up to claim the throne and take the mantle of Emperor himself. Having played the role of steward, and later Hand and Dark Lord to the Dark Lords of the Sith, for so long there were few others whom could have been better suited to head the Empire in Novo's stead. Amongst his first official acts as Emperor was to promote the Order's Hand, Darth Rowe, to the rank of Dark Lady to fill the gap after his ascension. At the same time, the new Dark Lady was also granted the title of Imperial Executor after the previous Executors of the Empire departed or disappeared into the shadows. For a time the Order melted into the shadows, keeping ever-watchful eyes on the Galaxy and the Empire, while large changes occurred on their homeworld. Through various sanctions and decrees issued by the Emperor, Byss underwent reconstruction on a planetary scale under the supervision of Darth Infestus, evolving its once templar landscape to a thriving metropolis worthy of the Imperial Centre. Once the construction was complete Emperor Destius christened the newly built Imperial City of Khayal which became not only Capital of the Empire but a new home to the Dark Lords of the Sith. Where Emperor Novo had forged strength under his iron-fisted rule, the new Emperor Destius brought the Order renewed stability after a time of turmoil. Further stability was won with the modernisation of the Imperial Armada, which had fallen into disrepair without LEGION continually modifying and improving its progress. With new challenges coming from new Sith Orders and old Jedi foes, the Emperor took on the task of seeing the Armada rebuilt to strength to ensure the security of the new Capital City. This change-over also came at a time when Dark Lord Destius discovered that it was the General of the Imperial Sith Military who was responsible for the attack on Dark Lord Novo and the destruction of the SSD Devastator. Swift action was taken to remove the traitor from his control of the ISM immediately to serve punishment for his attempt on the life of the former Emperor. Though swamped with competing 'would be' Empires, Dark Lord Destius has guided the Imperium through, preserving his Empire as a whole where pretenders failed - such as he did eons ago for the Order alone, an apparently eternal guardian ensuring the Dark Lords of the Sith's permanent authority in the Galaxy. Emperor Destius' rule continues to this day and the Dark Lords of the Sith are undisputedly the oldest, most powerful Sith Order that still exists, unparallelled in its history and lineage.Dark Lords  Dark Lords of the Dark Lords of the Sith in chronological order:Past locations  Past locations of the Dark Lords of the Sith in chronological order:Behind the scenes Zajah Adetera  Zajah Adetera is a male Human raised on Onderon and a resident of Zonama Sekot. He is a pilot of the Potentium Fighter Squadron and a former soldier of the PGAF, the military branch of the People's Galactic Alliance. Prior to military service and introduction to toxic warfare in the Galactic Core, Zajah trained within the Potentium Order and adopted their philosophy for years.Zavarah Zabelin  Zavarah joined the Kalway Order of Jedi after her parents were killed by the Vjun Sith. The Jedi took her in to save her. She was the only one left there; her sisters escaped. She went to learn the Jedis' peaceful ways: \"Peace needs to be. War is not an option.\" Princess Leia and Zavarah's great, great, great grandmother Queen Amidala are thought to be her ancestors. She followed in her family's heritage of becoming a Jedi Knight with the the KOJ (Kalway Order of Jedi). Zavarah was thought to have the genetic coding of the Skywalker bloodline. Later Zavarah started the OJO (Onderon Jedi Order]) and became it's Grand Master. There she ran the order with her husband Master and the help of her many other Masters and assorted knights that grew from it's beginnings.Biography Family History  Zavarah was the middle-child of a family of three daughters \u2013 Taffeta, the oldest, Zavarah, and the youngest sister, Ciji. Their father was Corran Zabelin, a minister in the government of Naboo. Their mother, Mara, was thought to be the youngest daughter of Jacen Solo that was after the stories were told of. It was a name that meant little more to the three sisters than that of their maternal grandfather. While Mara had often beguiled her daughters with stories of the exploits of their grandfather, his twin sister, Jaina, and younger brother, Anakin, she never told them the entire story. But early in their adolescence, when Ciji was old enough to understand, and Zavarah asked repeatedly why she felt things that no one else seemed to feel, Mara sat them down and explained the entire story of their family heritage. Their grandfather Jacen Solo, along with his sister Jaina and brother Anakin, were the children of Leia Organa-Solo, Princess of Alderaan, and Han Solo, hero of the rebellion, so many years ago. Leia had a twin brother as well. His name was Luke Skywalker, a Jedi Master. Their great grandmother and great uncle had been born during a very difficult time. So much so that they did not even know they were brother and sister until they were near adulthood. Great grandmother Leia and great uncle Luke were the twin children of Padme Amidala, then Senator from Naboo, and formerly elected Queen of Naboo, and Anakin Skywalker, Jedi knight and apprentice to Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. From that day on the sisters learned more about their mother\u2019s ancient family heritage, and their ties to Naboo, Tatooine, Alderaan, and Corellia, and its link to all the worlds of the galaxy through the Force. While Taffeta and Ciji were mesmerized by the titles and the history, Zavarah wished to learn more of this \u201cForce\u201d, and the Jedi knights who understood its meaning so well. The sisters had reached their mid-to-late teens when their mother and father announced that they might be moving to Coruscant. Corran was considering a consular posting at the Naboo embassy in the capital, and he and Mara were invited to experience the lifestyle of the planet city. Predictably, the sisters pleaded to join them, but they were told to stay and care for each other, with Taffeta in charge, while their parents were away. \u201cIt would only be a few days,\u201d Mara told them. But the girls were not to see them again \u2013 or at least for Zavarah, not in the form she had seen them before. Two days after leaving for Coruscant, Zavarah\u2019s parents appeared to her. They explained to her that, while on their way to Coruscant, their ship was attacked by those of the dark side of the Force \u2013 the Sith. The Sith were in search of the children of Skywalker. Mara, as one of those children, was recognized, taken, and later killed along with Corran. Zavarah could not fully understand, but then clearly heard her mother\u2019s warning: The sisters were to go, flee the Sith, and disappear into the galaxy. While Taffeta and Ciji berated their sister for the \u201cdream\u201d she had, their parents were gone. So they left Naboo, each headed in a different direction, but with a commitment to remain near to each other for the rest of their mortal lives.The Rogue Jedi  The three Zabelin sisters went their separate ways \u2013 ways as different as they were as individuals. But for Zavarah the knowledge of her parents death by the hands of the Sith seemed impossible to put behind her. Reflecting on the stories her mother had told her about the family and the Force, she began to recognize more and more the presence of the Force within her; \"Force Sensitive\" was the phrase her mother used to describe those of the Skywalker lineage. She befriended a group of young entrepreneurs who had found a financial future in arms dealing. It fascinated her, and over the months of kinship, Zavarah learned much about weaponry and more deadly tools of war. Having shared her story with her friends, she was introduced to members of the Jedi Peacekeepers, order of knights and master that looked to ease if not end the continuing strife between Jedi and Sith and bring full balance to the Force. Recognizing her \"Force Sensitivity\", as well as her energy and drive, they welcomed her to become one of them. And she did. It was a time when the Vjun Sith were actively plotting the take-over Yavin IV and the destruction of the Jedi Order there. Being young, beautiful, and not known to anyone, the peacekeepers convinced her to go undercover and infiltrate the Vjuns \u2013 as the girlfriend of a well-placed Dark Lord. Turning to her arms dealer friends, Zavarah asked for help. Their idea was to place her at an upcoming exhibition, where she would \u201caccidentally\u201d meet this special Darth Aran. The group would fake an attack and Zavarah would ask for his help, which he would give. It worked, and Zavarah and Dark Lord Master Darth Aran began to spend a great deal of time together. This Dark Lord even took Zavarah on the tour of the Vjun empire, where she saw first hand the dark underbelly of the Sith world and the deadly nature of Dark Lord. One evening the two attended a formal dance. Zavarah, wearing a beautiful red gown, diamonds and all, was enjoying Darth Aran company. Suddenly he stopped and, Zavarah in hand, teleported to a viewing location high above what she believed was Yavin. There, before her eyes she saw dozens of Sith attacking a small band of Jedi. She watched in horror as the Sith killed and brutalized them all. Looking around, she realized there were 15 Dark Lords around her. But Zavarah, no longer able to view the carnage, jumped from the platform and began to run. The Sith Lords called out to stop her, but this special Dark Lord Master Darth Aran she knew commanded, \u201cNo!\u201d She was just his girlfriend...and most likely a spy. She did not stop until she reached the arms dealers, who introduced her to a small type of bomb. Seeing it, she knew what she had to do. They would go back to Yavin, place the explosive near the viewing platform and string trip wires. Then Zavarah, as the bait, would draw the Sith off the platform and let the bomb explode in their faces. With great stealth, they placed the bomb and wires without being noticed. Zavarah called out to the Dark Lord Darth Aran , who immediately ordered his Sith off the platform to capture her as she began to run. The explosion behind her was fierce, throwing Zavarah far forward. A she moved she felt something slam into her from behind. The Dark Lord Master Darth Aran,though injured, had raised himself from the ground and shot her in the back. Bleeding profusely and losing consciousness, she used the Force to call out to Taffeta, her older sister, for help then fainted away. Zavarah woke up, not knowing where she was or for how long she had been asleep. Yet she was safe, away from the field where she had fallen, and in a comfortable bed. Taffeta heard Zavarah call for help, and finding her near death, summoned friends who took her to safety. She began healing; her strength returning. And she would need it, because the Dark Lord Master Darth Aran and the Vjun Sith had put a price on her head.A New Life: Luvbutton Moonsoo and the KOJ  It had been just two months, but it seemed like years to Zavarah Zabelin. Her eldest sister Taffeta, now a Baroness by her marriage to a Baron Nightfire, had arranged for Zavarah\u2019s transport back in time to the kingdom of the King of Calavan. There she could heal and regain her strength in total seclusion, far away in distance and time from the Dark Lord Darth Aran of the Vjun Sith and his minions. But Zavarah, being Zavarah, was anxious and bored, a combination not fit for one so up for the next challenge. As beautiful and comfortable as Calavan was, it had little excitement. Taffeta had often visited her recovering younger sister, bringing her news of the present in the form of newsprint and electronic notices. One such notice told of a group of Jedi \u2013 the Kalway Order of Jedi (KOJ) that had recently made its home on Yavin 4. Yes, the same Yavin 4 where that Dark Lord Master Darth Aran had tried to kill her. Yet Zavarah also recalled that one of her mother\u2019s stories mentioned Yavin 4. Oh, yes; it was a rebel base from which great grandmother Leia and great uncle Luke led the attack on the first Death Star. And Yavin 4 was also where Luke started an academy to rebuild the Jedi order for the New Republic. So much of her family history was tied to Yavin 4, she wondered if it was to be the site for her new beginning\u2026 A Jedi Knight like her father\u2026 A Jedi Master like her great uncle\u2026 Bidding farewell to the king and thanking him for all he had done, she began a trip ahead in time\u2026 to Yavin 4. The picture of Yavin she had kept in her mind from the day she destroyed the Sith Lords was far different from the one she now saw. This was not an embattled landscape pocked with bomb craters, but a pastoral scene, green and lush. A stately temple stood not far away and there were other buildings under construction. No Kingdom of Calavan, but certainly not a war zone. \u201cGreetings,\u201d she heard from behind her. Zavarah turned to see a woman all in white smiling at her. She introduced herself: Luvbutton Moonsoo, Grand Master of the KOJ. Zavarah introduced herself, and, having been invited to sit in the meditation circle and talk with Master Moonsoo, shared her recent past and most of her exploits. Moonsoo, sensing strength in the Force emanating from Zavarah, asked why she had come to Yavin. Zavarah spoke clearly, \u201cTo become a Jedi, Master. Will you teach me?\u201d Zavarah\u2019s smile quickly changed as she heard a familiar, yet frightening sound from above. Looking up she recognized a Vjun Sith aircraft surveying the area. Did they see her? Was she recognized? Quickly, Zavarah recited the untold portion of her recent past and explained with emphasis that the Vjun Sith had placed a price on her head. Assuring Zavarah that she would be protected, Moonsoo whisked her to cover. And there, the Jedi Grand Master said exactly what Zavarah hoped to hear: \u201cI will teach you. You will be my Padawan.\u201d The story continues.... Zavarah worked hard her path and eventually was knighted and then later was made a Master Sentinel she then concentrated on finding intel for Master Moonsoo and the KOJ Jedi order she loved so much. Then one day she met her later to be husband is a another sentinel knight. But back to how the planet she is on now happened for her to live on...Childhood  Her childhood was of a peaceful existence. One day her family was taken from their home and executed in front of her eyes...she fainted, to find on recovering consciousness that she was the only one left, and thought to be the last survivor of the Skywalker blood line. She roamed the streets scrounging for food, hiding in the shadows, when one day a Jedi Master discovered Zavarah and persuaded her to come away so the Jedi could take care of her. Knowing there was something special about Zavrah, she took her in to protect her from the very Sith who executed her family.Apprenticeship  An unusual apprenticeship because of her background.Knighthood  She was knighted by Master Moonsoo but her Master knew even then she had unusual tracking power that she could find anyone and find out information very easily. This Master Moonsoo was happy with and let her investigative abilities rise, even though she was not a Sentinel, but only a Counselor/Healer Jedi. Zavarah was sent on assignments which were normally reserved for Sentinels. Zavrah thrived on those assignments more than the healer position she was being trained for.Construction of the Onderon Jedi Order  The year 200ABY. Knowing her family heritage and the secret Jedi base on the planet Onderon. Jedi Master Zav went to Onderon foreseeing events in the future that will happen. But she felt that it was to soon to leave behind the one she begin to love as their was one who she had a strong connection with who was in serious trouble. Jedi Master Zav came back to save Sir from his darkside with her love for him. Once Sir was saved he went home to the planet of Telos V as he went in to exile. Sir knew that he could never return to the KOJ so Master Zav came to him and showed him her family heritage of Onderon and a secret base where he could start a new Jedi order. Master Zav with her love instructed Sir in the lightest of Jedi ways and Sir Became a Grand Master and founded the Onderon Jedi Order and rebuilt the city of Iziz that was in ruins. Now Council Master Zav and Grand Master Sir fell in love as Zav got pregnant with twins and the two decided to raise their family on the planet of Onderon.

Little Mos Eisley is owned and operated by Helga Eusebio.Timeline  About 249 years ABY (After the Battle of Yavin) - follows the timeline of the Post-Legacy Era.History  By the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the \"Galactic\" Empire had actually become a member state of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. This also eventually allowed Gilad Pellaeon to succeed Sien Sovv as Supreme Commander of the Galactic Alliance Defense Force, signifying the level of cooperation and integration of the former galactic government with the new one, at least at that time period. The appointment of former Imperial General Turr Phennir, however, as the Supreme Commander of the combined Confederation military may indicate the existence of secessionist sympathizers within the semi-autonomous Empire. At some point, following the Second Galactic Civil War, the Imperial Remnant once again began to gain strength. Under Fel I, who retook the title of Emperor, the Imperial Remnant started the Victory Without War program. The capital, Bastion, became one of the most fortified planets in the galaxy.The Sith-Imperial War  At some point, the new Sith Order sabotaged reconstruction efforts on Yuuzhan Vong-terraformed worlds, to the detriment of the planets' inhabitants and killing millions in the process. The Galactic Alliance soon found itself facing a secession movement mirroring that of the Separatists during the Clone Wars. The Empire used this situation to entice Alliance member worlds to secede and become part of Imperial space. But the Empire wanted all of the Alliance worlds, including its capital. Eventually, the Moff Council invoked the Treaty of Anaxes against the will of Emperor Roan Fel, and in 127 ABY, the Sith-Imperial War broke out, and the new Sith Order allied with the Empire. The war resulted in the fall of the Alliance and the reestablishment of the Empire as the primary galactic government. The remnants of the Alliance were absorbed into the Empire, but the Galactic Alliance Core Forces remained, and continued to fight the resurgent Empire. Shortly after the fall of the Alliance the Emperor called upon the entire New Jedi Order to surrender and subject their will to the Empire. Some of them did becoming Imperial Knights, while the others held to the will of the Force and retreated to Ossus.Currently...  The Tatooine Government supports Emperor Fel's Empire; Bastion has deployed an Imperial Stormtrooper Corps to the Mos Eisley Garrison and a fleet to protect the newly constructed Space Station in orbit around Tatooine as well as patrolling the sectors along the Corellian Trade route. Representatives of The Galactic Alliance, and the Jedi Order of Refuge have made very loose treaties with the Imperial Forces, at least for the time being, in order to deal with the Sith and the Sith controlled Empire. The political atmosphere in the Mos Eisley Council of Ambassador's is heating up to say the least, with further suspicions forming on the Bastion Imperial side as to the Sith Empire's involvement in a string of recent events...Groups  The following groups and/or factions are represented on Little Mos Eisley, alphabetically ordered:Black Sun Crime Syndicate Galactic Alliance Remnant (Brigade) Imperial Embassy/Bastion Imperial Government Imperial Stormtrooper Corps/Command Little Mos Eisley/Little Mos Eisley *RP Group* LME Gardulla Oola Hotel & Casino/Obsidian Shadow LME New Galactic Imperial Navy/Cmd Jedi Order of Light Mandalorian Clan- Shysa Mandalorian Clan - Tal'galar Spice Smugglers Mercantile Association Tatooine Government The Formation Of The Dark The Galactic Trade Fleet Tusken Raiders of the Dune Sea Government  OOC: The sim is operated by the sim owner, Helga Eusebio, with the support of several administrative personnel.

She was a female human, master of the Potentium followers.Biography  Note: This is a novelized version of the life of this character. The beginning is the background and has not been roleplayed in the world. Parts of the rest may have been slightly changed to ensure a global consistence.Early Life  Born in Altyr 5 in a farming town, she was working as mechanic in her family workshop. She was secretly fixing items she found in a ship which crashed few years ago. During a bandit raid, she decided to use some of these items to fight them off. For this occasion, she discovered she can use the Force. The defense was successful, but the inhabitant (as well as the brigands) were scared by the use of such powers and never viewed her in the same light as before. She thought her place was no more on her birth planet and decided to leave it forever.Roving  Leaving her home world with very few resources, she put forward her skills in mechanic to be hired in several cargos across the galaxy. She visited many worlds, resting some time and getting hired on another ship for another planet. Many of these worlds were hostile and she had to dash off as stowaway on the first ship more than once. After some of these events, she decided to slow down the travels and to settle on the next peaceful world she was, it was Yavin IV.Apprenticeship  On Yavin IV, Salene was attracted by the Academy of the New Order of the Jedi. Her propensity to chatter certainly made her meditation non efficient. She was more interested by the prodigious weapon that is a lightsaber. She made few spars with a lent saber, meeting a rogue Jedi, Snow, who became her trainer and mentor. He taught her not only how to handle the lightsaber but also how to behave as a warrior, which was something new for her. As mechanically inclined as she was, she decided to build her own lightsaber. As she used second hand materials and was in a hurry to finish, the saber would eventually break after a few days. Continuing her training, she was thinking about a better way to do it. Then, one day, she isolated herself near a pond and a river, meditated a long time and assembled the part to build the hilt. After another long period, tired and hungry, she was pleased with her work, a hilt she nicknamed \"Prune\".Meeting the Potentium Order  During her stay on Yavin IV, she was contacted by Linkin Tomsen, who was looking for new members for the Potentium Order. Her master and she talked with him, but the first interview was inconclusive. On the second one, in the ruins New Holstice, Linkin Tomsen explained the situation of the galaxy, with enemies of the peace ravaging planets, while the Jedi were entrenched on their stronghold. They decided to join the order, thinking their skill would be of best use here.Arrival on Zonama Sekot  After a long and tiring trip, the group finally arrived at glade on Zonama Sekot. A camp was installed there, while main buildings for a new base were growing nearby, built with the help of the engineers. She helped to take care of the camp, slowly familiarizing with the Potentium ideology. Even if she became more self-assured, she was not enough to make trips alone in the jungle and the main of Zonama Sekot, missed her at this time. She preferred to take benefit of the ships running in and out to view the Galaxy under another scope.Knighting  One day, her master, after a discussion with the other masters, proposed her to become a knight. As she was still learning, she first declined, but eventually accepted, facing the insistence of her master. The day after, she slipped into one of her best dresses and walked to the ceremony. The knights were waiting for her. After a short speech, they made a circle and turned on their sabers around her. She was about to faint, but found enough force to hug them all before sitting on a fallen trunk to recover.Teachings  Another reason Salene was reluctant to become a Knight was that she would have to teach new students. When the council gave her a Padawan to instruct, she almost panicked. Would she be able to be a good teacher and awake his interest with her newly acquired knowledge? The answer was \"no.\" Jarl, her first student, as smart as he looked, was more interested by commerce and 'small talk'. He was surprisingly skilled at escaping any lessons and training. This first Padawan learner did not raise Salene's self-confidence in her ability to instruct others. Having free time, Salene started to teach the basics of lightsaber construction to students having to build their own. These classes lasted months and when completed, were compiled in a holocron for future use. She also spent a great deal of time teaching new students how to wield a lightsaber.On Zonama Sekot  With her activities leaving her less time to travel, she wasn't able to explore the universe as she used to. She spent a lot of time with the students and visitors, but most importantly on Zonama Sekot, she improved the facilities, visited the vicinity and got a much better feeling for the planet. In recognition of her great skill and work, the Potentium Council eventually rewarded Salene with the Master title. Accompanied by boisterous cheering from the crowd, she expressed that the title that would make here even more proud is Magister.A Jawa  Therefore, she continued her explorations, sometimes bringing apprentices with her. Once on Ziost, disguised as a merchant, she met a Jawa, apparently force sensitive. As the environment was rather hostile, she was worried about a trap, but the ambience relaxed when they started to talk about mechanics with the help of a translator. For this Jawa, scavenging droid parts was the primary reason to visit Ziost. She revealed to the Jawa the location of Zonama Sekot before leaving, worried to stay too long on such a planet. Short time after, she had the pleasant surprise to meet the Jawa on Zonama Sekot, waiting near a meditation pool, with speeder parts nearby. Despite being wary at the beginning, suspecting him to be a spy of the Sith, she eventually trusted him after talking with him about mechanics again, and he looked like to understand the Potentium. He later trained under the mastership of Linkin Tomsen and became the librarian and master of the Order of the Potentium under the nickname \"Netto\".Lost droids  Once, a droid was spotted and caught on Zonama Sekot, scanning the area around the base. It was just able, first, to tell its ID, pushing forward the interrogation it eventually confessed to come from Telos IV, looking for the defensive capability of Zonama. Salene didn't know this remote planet very well, but was suspicious about a threat and decided to carry out an investigation of Telos IV. She prepared herself, with Netto, disguised as mechanic and... jawa, being fond of droids, then headed towards Telos IV, looking for the source of the captured droid. At this time, the upper levels of this planet were a sort of inextricable mazes and many of the people they met near the space port were, like them, looking for the town entrance. They wandered through the corridors, used their grappling hooks and broke into a window, eventually reaching the floor. Netto, tired by these incidents, had to rest. In the town, she visited the buildings, searching for a droid workshop and asked people about them as she didn't find anything noticable. She especially spent much time with a charming young man. She noticed him first when he was looking for a way on the upper level and they congratulated each other for making it up to it. Together they searched for informations about droids and talked about many things, and she almost forgot her mission. When the time came when they had to leave, she didn't find anything dangerous about the droids, but was sad to see the young man going away.A new apprentice  Some days after her trip on Telos IV, once she was working on the temple of Zonama Sekot, she was visited by the young man. She felt wobbly but successful enough to present him their installations, trying to hide the glitches of their base and looking sorry for having lied at him about her position on Telos IV. She was glad when he left with an application, but still anxious until he returned it filled out the next day. During the delay he was hopeful and she asked, in the most innocent way possible, the council for approval of his apprenticeship. She obtained it and accepted him. She then had a new apprentice named Flint Mokeev. Salene and Flint, often along with Netto, travelled through the galaxy, seeking for information about the evil forces threatening its peace.From the rainforest to the island  The First Potentium Order facilities were installer in a glare in the northern hemisphere rainforest. They used a lot of imported technologies which revealed to be inaccurate for this climate. The jungle, day after day took its right and more or less well known creatures wandered closer of the camps, disturbing the activities.   To anticipate further issues, Salene was spotting different possible locations, and agreed with Master Tomsen and the Council to the move on a small island near the shore of the equatorial sea. This had the advantages to be naturally defended form the assaults of the wild life and easier to be located from the sky. On the other hand, the island was more vulnerable from outsider attacks and to be easier to spot is was not always an advantage...Conflicts  The new base location cheered the knights and, the order grew but the warlike side gained influence. Taking profit of an absence of the council, and of the retirement of Master Tomsen, a young master, formerly a sith, managed to be named at the newly created rank of Grand Master. He promised many thing, but Salene didn't appreciate the circumstances of his promotion, and using her influence, Salene worked for restoring the Council authority then started to gather regular assemblies of the Order, in the home to balance The so called Grand Master, worked on his side to the warlike side of the group, attracting all sort of enemies on Zonama Sekot ground and forcing the group to defend before anything. He also tried to gain influence giving promotion or privileges to people for personal reasons, some of them not even a part of the Order. However his fast promoted friend lacked of motivation in acting for the group and were unable to hold any authority. On the opposite, their promotions discredited the one having pronouncing them at the eyes of the most motivated knights as well as the council, which progressively regained authority. After few months, the battles even reduced in intensity leaving place for a reorganisation, more and more obvious as the \"Grand master\" activities appeared openly turned to himself and not the community. Before one of those late battles, he argued with the defenders of his own side, up to insulting them because the enemy didn't showed up and he had nothing to kill. Angry he left Zonama Sekot with the worshippers he brought from another planet, few minutes before the attackers appear on the scanners. The next day, Salene convened a meeting of the Council, with all members present except the \"Grand Master\", refusing to assist. He also declined the composition offered remotely by the council to resign his rank by himself but still being a council member like the others, pretending the council had no authority and only him can decide of his own rank. Out of challenge, he stated the council as dissolved and he'll be the only ruler. His arrogant attitude convinced the council to unanimously demote him from his rank and title. The announce of his dismissal was celebrated across the whole order, even if some regretted later the \"good old time\" of the war.Wedding with Flint  Along time, her former apprentice, Flint, raised to the master rank and his bound with Salene never lowered. They continued to share the same interest, helping each ones and stayed long time to speech together. They eventually decided to marry and prepared an event where the whole group as well as friends from other planets were invited. Salene spent a long time to find an outfit suitable for the event. The preparation was disturbed by a sith raid, which were still common at this period. However, after the first assault, the defenders withdrew waiting for reinforcement. Because of the planed event, they tried to lower the casualties as most as possible, and shortened the fights, leaving the enemy alone, without anything to conquest or to pillage. Having nothing to do, they eventually left the planet and the wedding could occurs, even if delayed After Salene and Flint exchanged their vows in public, a party started until very late in the night.Traits  Salene Lusch was a small sized female human. She had medium-length hair, usually tied to a bun, ponytail or long hairs. She was a force user, but she didn't like to show it up and reserved it for special occasions. Her power resided more in the understanding and feeling of others. She had good mechanic skills, but only had few occasions to practice on Zonama Sekot. She was not always of good faith, thus she could be very confused when she was improvising a lie. With time, she became more and more altruist, motherly protecting her new home planet and order, but still with the negative side of prying into other's business. (...)Equipment  Salene owned a lightsaber of little weight, \"Prune\", which she made herself after several failed attempts. During her free time, she restored ancient weapons, especially a S-5 Heavy Blaster, a couple of ELG-3A and a Bola carbine. She wielded them occasionally. She was the seed partner of a Sekotan Starship, one of the fastest ships to travel across the galaxy. She also adopted an Amphistaff she found alone in the Tampasi. These living weapons were able to vie with lightsabers. She was usually dressed according to the circumstances, and preferred to wear a weapon only when she knew she would fight. She wore a tool belt when tinkering, a gardening dress when taking care of the plants and... any kind of disguise when she operated undercover behind the enemy lines.Behind the scene  This character was created in July 2007. Her name doesn't mean anything special, I just find it sounds good (in french). I'm pronouncing her name /sal\u025bn l\u0153\u0283/ (close of the british english \"sa lane\"), but it's me, do your best.Sim  Sims are Second Life areas where role players can move their avatar. Roleplaying Sims usualy represent a part of a Star wars planet. The name come from Simulators which is another name for regions.New Order of the Jedi  The New Order of the Jedi (NOJ) is one of the oldest and most enduring of all the Jedi Orders in Second Life.History  The New Order or the Jedi (NOJ) was originally founded in early 2006 by Marymac Dougall, Christopher Black, Perwin Rambler, Tydus Agnon, MindBender Vox, and Abbra Erato as a break-away from the original The Jedi Order (2004) group in SecondLife. They established the Order on the mainland sim Burnott and decided that it was on an unknown planetoid in the Arkanis Sector, though the land area also sat adjacent to a small area that represented Tatooine which was owned by MindBender Vox. Later on, they expanded, renting land in the region Hope Island, increasing the land area from 1/8th of a sim to 1/4th and relocated the Academy as being on Yavin IV where they resided for quite a long time. Eventually a full sim was provided by Luvbutton Moonsoo as Yavin IV and the NOJ was located there for a short while until a dispute between several NOJ Council Members occurred, causing NOJ to choose to leave Yavin IV. They temporarily moved to Kashyyyk, provided courtesy of the United Galaxies group until they could acquire a new simulator of their own. The NOJ currently resides on the Chandrila sim, provided by donations from many loyal members of the Order. The sim has been owned by Kaliwillo Lane since May 2008 but managed and supported by the NOJ as a whole.\u00a0 NOJ has been extremely influential to SWRP on SL. NOJ was also the first order to successfully create a structured training program for Jedi and even offered college credit for their training.Jedi Code  Many teachings come from these few lines of quote, so many teachings in fact, that no one can know all of its meaning. But there are many who know much of the teachings these few lines stand for, some more than others. Though of this, just because you are granted the rank of Master does not mean you are superior over others. Many Jedi Knights know as much and more as some of the Jedi Masters do, and some Jedi Knights do not receive the rank of Master because they wish not to. Their reasons are known to themselves and those who wish to listen. Wisdom does not come with age, nor bravery, nor confidence. Wisdom comes with knowledge. This is only a small fraction of what these lines stand for.See Also Daana Kira  Daana Kira is a SWRP character. She was a female Togruta, reporter at the Galaxy News, often in partnership with Rakiko Lowtide.Biography Early Life  Daana was born on Shili, in a large Togruta tribe having frequent contacts with outsiders.

A former member of The Dark Lords of the Sith\u00a0and once a Jedi Knight and Ambassador on Telos IV. His existence began because of renegade Sith from Byss and despite the path he took, his destiny was always the dark side of the force. His current whereabouts are unknown, but Sith agents have unconfirmed reports that he has returned to the system,Dark Beginnings  On Byss, a group of Sith Lords, led by Darth Ptas became aware of a young woman so strong in the force that she must become a Sith or would be a threat to all as a Jedi. They also felt she was the one to use for experiments that had been discussed for many years...an experiment which could seal their rise to power in a new Sith Order. Many believed there should be a generation of Sith bred from dna of long dead lords, it was seen as a faster option compared to research into Darth Plageous\u2019s methods and harnessing his power on a large level. After the woman was taken over to the dark side by one of these sith lords, they saw to it that a blood sample would be taken from her and they planned to extract DNA from an honored Sith master to create their new Sith. The young woman, her name Jitt Baumer, had her memory erased of these events as they believed she would see her offspring as a threat to her and want revenge on those that used her. Kaminoan scientists were employed to carry out the experiment, their discretion and expertise has proved to be legendary... In the 'first generation' there would be 2 sith bred, a male and a female. The new sith had a high midi-chlorian count. They would have advanced aging genes activated and their intelligence programmed gradually. Within weeks, the 2 were intelligent 18 years old (physical age)and from that point on they would develop naturally. Using the DNA from Jitt Baumer and from a long dead sith they found on Korriban, the experiment could begin. The Sith 'creators' were pursued by assassins, seeking to kill them and possess their clones. The female clone was killed in a raid on Kamino, but the male was safely transported away. Knowing that they could not continue their experiments, the creators had their surviving creation programmed one last time - to erase information about their creators and any knowledge of the experiments. These sith creators believed that the destiny of their creation would lead him back to them. It would perhaps cause a confrontation of who he would choose as master. Little is known of the fate of these creators, but sith history records that [[Darth Ptas had many 'traitors' executed around this time. The male was placed with the Grand Army of the Republic where he would serve as any other member of the army, but with his personality not so subservient as other clones...how long he would remain was unclear but an excellent cover for the time being. Not long after rising to the rank of Colonel in the GAR, the 'Sith Clone' decided it was time to depart, so he quietly left and arrived on Rakata Prime. No longer constrained by clone armor and just a number as identity, he took the name Morten Hassanov. He found the name in a war journal he read on a transport. Morten, strong from his time in the clone army and strong in the force, it was not long until he was noticed by Darth Devarii, who persued Morten when sensing his strong presence. Morten was interested by the offer from the Dark Side and agreed to be trained. Morten did not complete his training with Devarii, he saught to harness his growing power alone. It is not known why Deveraii did not pursue Hassanov. Hassanov was studying the dark side closely..but not all to his teachings...discovering a sith holocron on a moon in the outer rim, he studied the ability of becoming invisible in the force...something he learnt to do very quickly and soon believed his power would be greater then that of Devarii, but he knew he could not yet challenge one like him. Fate lent a hand when Rakata Prime was attacked from space. Hassanov hid his presence in the force and isolated himself in a disused military base under the sea. The underwater base had active computers and he found that the attack was focused on the city and the best the computer could do was find the word 'Mandalorian' in the transmission that was sent before the attack began. A Mandalorian was the target?, or were the ones attacking?....he could not know....but he did not care....this was the chance to escape on his own...stay invisible in the force and find a new challenge. The \u2018mother\u2019 of the engineered Sith became a strong sith herself, taking the name Lady Sage and proved to those on Byss how powerful she was destined to become.Mandalorian Dala Clan  Morten found an operable ship and flew it to the planet known as Dxun and was recruited to the ranks of the Mandalorian Dala Clan where he would be known as Kovac Dala. Here he felt he belonged to a group where he could make a difference, his membership of the Dala Clan reflected his need for order. In time however, he became increasingly sidelined by the Mandalorian need for increased security for which he believed was too much and would spell the end of the Dxun clans in time. Seeing many of the clans disperse leaving their home largely unprotected, Kovacs role became insignificant. Seeking a place where he could find order again, Kovac decided to leave Dxun behind to find a new challenge. He noticed his time on Dxun had focused him and the sense of honor in all his actions, so he took that with him as he drifted in space.Jedi  Information from Bothans led Morten to the knowledge of a Jedi Order on Endor. He left the Mandalorians and arrived on Endor to become a Jedi. Endor was just as he had seen it in his vision, but the female presense he felt in those visions continued to puzzle him. He became the Padawan to the Jedi Knight... Lady Sage... who had turned from the dark side but felt she could no longer use her old name. Morten felt a bond very quickly to his Master, which he believed was the normal attachment a Master should form with a student. The deeper feeling of connection was confusing, having known her a short time, however he believed the strength of the visions colored his perceptions, it could just be that he merely foresaw becoming a Jedi under the teachings of Lady Sage. The downfall of the Jedi Unity order led him to wander the galaxy, spending some time at Anoth to study and he visited places such as Ossus in a bid to continue his Jedi path. Losing contact with his Master left an empty feeling that he was sure was not right, it took much meditation on Ossus to put these feelings aside and maintain his control again. While deep in study on Anoth, he received a communication from Shadow Jedi Master Delcon, inviting him to his orders secret enclave. On meeting the honoured Master Diakonos Delcon, he joined the order and began training as a Jedi Sentinel with Master Atticus Jetaime. Seeing his former master Lady Sage turned again to the dark side was a surprise to him, but on another level it appeared right..something he could not explain. Soon after moving to Telos IV, the order changed. The Telos Jedi Order was formed, its members were the bulk of what was the Shadow Jedi Order. Master Jerico Yost took his Shadow Jedi Order away from Telos, back to the secrecy from where it came. On becoming a Jedi Knight, Master Delcon gave Morten the duties of being an investigator and to persue justice on the orders new home of Telos IV. Later, after working with Master Pandora Regent, he decided to persue ambassador work as a Consular Jedi. The reward for his achievements was when he was made Telos IV Minister, an Ambassador for the Jedi order. In his Ambassador role he helped to negotiate an alliance between Jedi Orders. After negotiating an agreement with the Orders, the Jedi High Council was formed. These orders were - The Aegian Order of Peace, the Telos Jedi Order, Knights of the Old Republic and the New Order of the Jedi. While continuing as Ambassador to the High Council, Morten realised he needed to move on and Jedi life on Telos was no longer as fulfilling as it once was. He left Telos behind for Yavin IV to begin again, where he began training with Master Evelyn Syaka. However the burning need to be more than he was began to trouble Jedi Hassanov...he did not feel like the Jedi he had been in the past. Then the bond with his first Jedi Master - Lady Sage......would soon, finally became clear...Origins Uncovered  One day on Telos IV, Morten became aware of a call from Lady Sage in his mind needing his help. Drawn to her, he found out she had been hurt when her ship crashed on the planets surface. In seeking to offer any assistance he could to his former Jedi Master, Morten took a blood test to see if he was a suitable donor. The DNA from the blood was too close a match...Lady Sage was Mortens mother. Much meditation was needed for Morten, his emotions almost overflowing with the knowledge of his former master being his mother. Lady Sage returned to full health, but what proved more significant was the path Morten was now destined to followReturning to the Dark Side  While continuing training, the growing discomfort that Morten felt began to express itself...as he began to see weakness within the Jedi Order, he believed that strength and control were what was required to call the jedi to order...and why should he wait...it should be him to lead the jedi, it was what he was born for. Resentment built up, but meditation kept the dark feelings supressed. Researching the sith to discover truths of his origin, Morten began to admire the order and strength a Sith Lord could command. The Jedi on Yavin IV became concerned about Jedi Morten Hassanov, seeing that he was falling to the dark side and the presence of Lady Sage could bring those two to power as sith....this was too dangerous....however they did not know how to proceed... After much discussion the Jedi believed that the death of Lady Sage was the only way to end this threat and to then retrieve Hassanov. Unsure if this was in keeping with the Jedi code..the jedi stalled...allies of the Jedi \u2013 The Silver Jedi...secretly sent 2 of their Jedi to kill Lady Sage and return Hassanov. They found Hassanov meditating with Lady Sage...seeing it as Sith training...they warned Hassanov off and ordered him to leave for Yavin. Lady Sage told Hassanov to do what they said...and he began to leave for his ship.....he felt the danger his mother was in and he returned...to see her weakened and the silver jedi changing his grip to plunge his saber into her heart. Morten ignites his saber and warned them off....responding to him with a warning of his own safety...Morten launches an attack on them... severing the arm of one...and using the force to push the other away. This rush of anger and power tasted good...the silver jedi told Morten that his mother must die for the future of the jedi order. That was a mistake....Morten would not allow this...and removes the armless jedi head in one slice of his saber and full of hate...he reaches out a hand to force choke the other...watching the life drain out of his face and his body go limp. Mortens journey to the dark side was complete...he decided to go to Ziost... a Sith order has returned to the ancient Sith homeworld.... Lady Sage's whereabouts are unknown. The fighter she had been using was later discovered on the surface of the planet Tatooine in the area of the Dune Sea.Magnus  Fallen Jedi Morten Hassanov joined the Sith on Ziost and began his rise....on becoming Sith Acolyte under his master Lord Vitae...he became Magnus. Acolyte Magnus now saw the wisdom of the dark side, yearning for more power and determined that death would befall any that stood in his way. An active member of the empire, Acolyte Magnus was made a Sith Lord by Dark Lord Summanus. Lord Magnus vowed to ensure his rise to power within the order, the death of their enemies and expansion of the sith empire. Lord Magnus was made part of the Sith Legends Royal Guard, protecting Dark Lord Summanus and Dark Lady Melanchol on a mission to Coruscant. Despite his complete loyalty to his superiors, Magnus began to become suspicious of the sith empire he has fought for and curious of the motives of some of its key members. He could not foresee what would happen to his order but every fibre of his being told him a change was coming. Sith are not allowed to be exiled...they are killed...however Lord Magnus, betrayed by his order and cast out has been allowed to survive. He has not known a sith order be this reckless before and will observe his former masters from the shadows to see what their plans may be.Dark Lords of the Sith  While in the shadows, the sith exile Magnus was drawn to someone familier in the force... When he found the source of this powerful presence calling out to him, he found it to be the Darth Ptas. She came to Lord Magnus with the offer to join her in the legendary sith order - The Dark Lords of the Sith on Dromund Kaas. Ptas had found the Sith she had helped create and would now have this powerful one as her apprentice. Seeing a new path to glory away from the traitors that turned their backs on the Sith Legends, Magnus accepted. Restored to his positon of Sith Lord, he saw his path was back to where it must be, towards a position of influence in a great Sith order. He will stop at nothing to become Darth Magnus and sit on the Dark Council.Return to Byss  The rumours were true, our Dark Lord Validus has returned to Byss and rebuilt our home. On hearing of the Ravager now in orbit, Magnus set out to return to Byss from where the sith that had him created had come and where he got some of his earliest sith training. This is not the same Byss that he left but already the dark power the place had over him before is intoxicating now. Where will this take Lord Magnus from here...time will tell.Darth Magnus  As with all Sith, Magnus always manifested a lust for power but as many wise ones before him was intelligent and careful in his actions to fulfil his desire but not bring himself an early end as going headlong into a power struggle of a mighty sith order would bring him. The challenge that faced him of taking an apprentice was an interesting one, she chose the name Enigma and while she was young and lacked experience, she had great potential. She completed her training but Magnus believed she needed to prove herself worthy, first by challenging her Master..while she did not succeed in besting him she performed well as a Sith. An invasion of Allied Jedi forces to retrieve one of their own gave Enigma a taste of battle and a chance for the order to show how powerful it had become again. The Jedi were no match for the Sith forces and with the battle over and Jedi corpses strewn around their feet, Jen'ari Validus anointed Magnus's apprentice Lady Engima and Lord Magnus was finally made Darth Magnus. With the order seeking new direction he was granted a position on the Dark Council. From this position Magnus would have power and influence over the Dark Lords of the Sith and the world of Byss. Despite his position of authority, in secret from most within the order, he committed himself to the teachings of Darth Ptas. Magnus then established a new base within proximity of his Master.A New Path  With the Dark Lords of the Sith established in the galaxy again, Jen'ari Validus saw this time as the opportunity to restore the once great Sith Empire. This was something Magnus was pleased to see happen and what his role could be within it. However, despite the ambition of an Empire seeming to be becoming reality, Darth Magnus increasingly felt little part in what was preceeding. The order had re-organised, abolished the Dark Council, removing him from his position of power and despite its potential..the order became increasingly insular despite its big plans. Magnus saw nothing but weakness around him, the powerful Sith Ptas also taking a lesser role in the order confirmed his suspicions that the order was not worthy of its name. The greatness he found in this order when he arrived on Dromund Kaas was no longer there and it was time to begin again, something he had waited too long to do. Leaving the order behind, again an exile he found it amusing how this has happened again and he didnt have a scratch on him...how times change in this galaxy... Now wandering the galaxy looking for a challenge, Darth Magnus would find order again and without doubt that would lie with Darth Ptas, his master's draw on him would bring him back.DCS2  DCS2 is a Combat System created by Dimentox Travanti.

War on that planet drove them underground and forced them to blend in with the population. This is why they still do not wear generic Jedi clothing. After most members of the order were hunted down and killed they were forced to find a new home for the order. Yavin IV had a great history and had been abandoned by the previous Order, New Order of the Jedi due to some unforeseen forces.History  Kalway is a grassy and mountainous planet in the Core region near the planet Chandrila. The planet is well-known throughout the galaxy for being a popular tourist destination. The warm, mineral-rich hot springs that flow from the world\u2019s many rocky peaks are reputed to have special healing powers. It is also widely known for its advanced cities, the greatest example of which is the capital city of New Hadax, built to replace the ancient city of Old Hadax after the latter had been destroyed by a cataclysmic earthquake in the 300's BBY. The planet is a major crossroads for interplanetary space travel and the planet\u2019s spaceport is among the largest and most advanced in the galaxy. During the Clone Wars, the Separatist leaders saw the importance of holding such a great prize as the Kalway spaceport. Near the end of the war, the Separatists laid siege to Kalway and attempted to overtake the planet by force. The Separatists were repelled in one of their most humiliating defeats of the war; the majority of the casualties on the planet came from the space cruisers that had been shot out of the sky falling to the ground. During the Galactic Civil War, the Emperor made great use of the planet and its spaceport was a major hub of the Imperial Starfleet. Following the death of the Emperor, the Imperial Governor on Kalway attempted to take complete control of the planet by doing away with the military leadership. The result was one of the bloodiest instances of Imperial infighting to take place following the Emperor's death. More than eighty percent of the cities on the planet were damaged by bombardment and more than sixty percent of the Imperial fleet stationed at the planet were shot down. The planet eventually joined the New Republic, but was overrun during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. The cities and population of Kalway were decimated. During the last of the conflict, four last surviving members of the Jedi Order manage to escape the ravaged planet and go into hiding, blending in with locals as they travel, while looking for a new home and a new hope.Organisation Council Masters Knights  Jedi Knights are given more responsibilities and decide what sub-path/field (Weapons Master, Scholar, Apothecary, Watchman, Investigator, Force Warrior.) they wish to specialise in.Apprentices  KOJ Apprentices go through a training in four stages. At stage three they choose their primary Jedi path (Consular, Sentinel, Guardian) and train towards it.Wanted By KOJ Authorities See Also White Ragu  Often going by the name White Ragu, Shiek Ragu was a half breed of human and Miraluka. She originated at a young age from a lost planet called Bakura 4. She joined the Kalway Order of Jedi after roaming the galaxy for a few years of teaching beings a rare kind of understanding of life. Only after joining the Jedi order did she find out her background through a set of two crystals she always wore around her neck. The people on Bakura IV were a tribal society hiding most of their knowledge, technology and understanding from outsiders. This is where White Ragu inherited her great wisdom and understanding of how things and beings behave. White Ragu was a Consular Scholar who had a very extensive knowledge base in the force and it's abilities on the body and mind. The second crystal on her necklace told her where to find her brother named Metus Bawhe (He ended up not remembering his Ragu name and later kept the new one) who she had lost in a crowd while escaping a horrible war on their home planet. This war had a mysterious err about it and was the last event before the entire planet disappeared. Her people were not the Miralukas on Katarr and they didn't naturally possess the strong gifts unless trained fully probably because they were only half breeds.Biography Early life Childhood  At an early stage of a child's life on Bakura IV, the society had a practicing tradition where they would add one of four colors to the front of the name. These colors represented one thing and that thing would describe the personality of that holder. This is the reason why Shiek Ragu went by the name White Ragu. The four colors were Red, Blue and yellow. These three colors make up the whole spectrum. Then the remaining ones black and white in which are all colors and the abstraction of colors. Shiek received the color White representing Winter; a time when every thing is blanketed and the world is made clear and more visible as well as mixed. It is easy to belong to this world and it draws people together. Winter comes and goes when it does not being influenced by many things. Shiek continued her people's traditions.First War on Bakura IV  The child White Ragu was awoken one early morning when dawn had not yet set to the shouts of people outside and her mother frantically trying to get her to her feet meanwhile collecting important items and stuffing them in a sack. Shiek was told to wake her younger brother and to take the first shuttle off the planet Bakura IV. Something terrible was happening and there was so much commotion. Shiek did as she was told still confused and a bit frightened. Only when she saw her father out on the front lines using abilities unknown to the society's children did she stop and made her way towards him. As they approached their father the front lines were forced to push back and they found themselves trapped in a corner. They were protected by their father who came to they rescue and shoved on board the next shuttle. White Ragu watched out the window with her brother by her side as the planet's surface became smaller and smaller. Never being off her home planet she soon didn't recognize anything and felt a wave of distress she had ever experienced before. The shuttle eventually arrived on Bakura after a few days. White Ragu and Metus had fallen asleep against each other and the station master had to gently wake them up. He asked them where their parents were. White Ragu had trouble finding words as she looked over her brother who was now crying. The station master took them to a chair in the lobby and urged them to stay there. White Ragu did as she was told but Metus thought he heard his name being called and took of trying to find out. White immediately had to go after him and at first had him insight but as soon as he made his way out of the space port and into a larger his small body disappeared. After searching frantically for hours White came to realize that she had lost her little brother. She blamed herself for letting go of his hand in the lobby. White who was now crying herself found an isolated alley and dug through the contents of the sack that her mother gave her. Inside was a data pad with more the a million kredits on it. White knew to hide this some place safe right away. Next she found her necklace that she always wore but there seemed to be a more priceless set of crystals on it then there were before. There was also some food and a note written on a scroll. White Ragu read over the scroll which told her to look over her little brother and that her parents loved her very much but there was something happening to not only to their community but also the planet. They wanted to save their children from an uncertain fate. Reading the note made White feel more ashamed for losing her brother. A door opened to one of the buildings Shiek was in between and she could hear joy and laughter. She could her music and singing. White was pulled into the cantina by an odd looking being who was speaking in another language that she couldn't understand. She was brought in front of another drunk male human. After asking White a few questions she asked him if she asked if she could return to her home on Bakura IV. The whole cantina seemed to hear this and a hush silence filled the air after which was a roar of laughter. The drunk man smiled and replied don't school children know their homework today?? The fourth planet in the Bakura system is Arden and it's a gas planet meaning it's uninhabitable, you foolish girl. The man grabbed a hold of White's arm and pulled her out of the cantina and once again she was alone with her sack in the alley. Over the next few months she lived on the streets and saved her hidden kredits for emergencies. She slept in alleys that had some type of shelter above.Childhood Friend Petro Suntracker  One morning White Ragu was roaming the streets looking for anyone who had any information about her home planet when she ran into a small skinny boy fleeing from one of the shops. The both fell to the ground and Shiek could hear someone yelling after the boy to stop. Shiek was still sitting on the ground when the boy got up and started to take off running again however White unconsciously used the force power stasis on the boy and caused him to stop dead in his tracks. At this point the shop owner was able to catch up to them and realizing that it was her that was preventing the boy from awareness she let go of her ability. The owner was unaware of what had happened but was now talking with the child as Shiek approached them both. The shop owner quickly searched the boy and took back the food that the boy had stolen and was about to call the authorities on him. Shiek came up with an idea fast and told the shop owner that she thought she saw some others taking his merchandise and asked who was watching the shop. The shop owner had a twisted face as he realized there was no one watching the store. He turned back and rushed as quick as he could. Shiek took the boy's hand as he blushed and lead him to a quiet place. He shortly began to struggle to pull away. He managed to break free when Shiek went to turn around. She asked him what he thought he was doing. The boy replied what does it look like?? After a while the boy introduced himself as Petro and that he was only trying to feed his cousins who also lived out on the streets and had no home, food or credits. He told White to follow him to the place where they were all hiding. They entered a small abandoned building that was out of the area. Petro beamed with happiness and pride as he told Shiek that you have to venture into a new area so that it would be less likely that you would be recognized. White asked him if he could have gotten a job. Petro admitted he had one before but he didn't like it. Petro yelled out I'm blind, I can't see. One by one a number of children appeared from hiding spaces. Petro noticed that one of the children was missing right that one of the children was missing. He quickly asked where is Zash? One of the little girls younger then White said that he was in his usual hiding spot. Petro went over to a small whole in the wall. Shiek knelt down beside Petro to just barely be able to see the shilouette of a child in the wall who was hunched in a ball crying. At first White had forgotten the name of the boy in the wall and he looked awfully a lot like Metus. She called out her brother's name but stopped when she noticed the look Petro was giving her. As the boy in the wall slowly began to come Shiek could see that it was not Metus. The boy was in tears crying about his family. Petro comfort him and it took a little while before the boy could calm his nerves. Perhaps it was a new friend, the child who looked like Metus, or that White thought she might find her brother in the area that made her decide to join the group of children for a while. She refrained Petro from stealing and they used the kredits that Shiek was given to by nourishment for everyone. She told him that if he continued it may cost him more then a slap on the wrist one day. The two of them went out some days to buy the things they needed and search for any clues of Metus or knowledge on the her lost home. Petro admitted that he or any of the others had never heard anything about it. Shiek would be a mother to the boy who looked like Metus during the day because his tears came constantly and during the night when everyone was asleep Petro would often jolt awake hearing crying from Shiek in her sleep. He would then lie beside her in a hug, and hum until she stopped. Only then would he fall asleep. The children continued the routine for a few months. Petro found himself wanting to buy Ragu a gift as he past the shops during the day. He wanted to surprise her so instead of asking Ragu for the funds to buy her a gift, he made a great risk and decided to steal one of the beautiful bracelets that he saw. His decussion was a fatal mistake. He ran out of the shop believing he was successful. Little did Petro realize that the owner had recorded Petro's image with a specialized hologram device. The next few days the owner interviewed people and showed them the playback on the hologram. With luck he was able to track down someone who had seen and recognized the group of children. They pointed the shop owner in the direction of the abandoned building. It was getting late so the owner entered the building and found Shiek with the rest of the children. The owner approached Shiek and confronted her about stealing but she had no idea what he was talking about. He continued in saying that she owed him compensation for his merchandise. The shop owner noticed White's bag in the corner of the room and immediately snatched it up. He looked through the sack and picked out Ragu's necklace realizing that some of the stuff had value. He replaced the necklace in the sack as the children were kicking and pulling at him. Just at that moment Petro came back in and saw the scene. Right away he recognized the man. The shop owner picked Petro up by his hood and dragged him along to take him to the authorities. White told the children to stay in the building as she left to trail them from a distance. The two of them were crossing a tight section that hung in the air. A few miles below was a busy area of the city swarming with local city starships. The section was wide enough for a large group of people and a number of droids. Perto managed to break free but knew what the things in the sack meant to White so he turned back to grab the bag. As he did the shop owner pushed him aside. The sack fell to the ground but Petro was pushed just as a droid was coming by, causing him to fall even further, right over the edge of the side of the section bridge. Ragu arrived to the end of the crowd just in time to see her friend bump into the droid and watched in horror as he flew over the side. White recovered the sack and slowly looked over the edge full of tears in her eyes. Petro's small body was not visible amongst the heavy traffic. He was too weak to prevent his fall. The next month was quiet in the abandoned building; no one dared to speak.Meeting Royalty  Shiek had found a small secluded garden in the city where she had marked a grave for her friend. When ever she woke up during the night crying with no one beside her she would make her way over to the garden, and lie by the marker, and hum herself to sleep. One night Shiek woke up to laughter. She looked up at the statue in the center of the garden to find blurry form sitting on top of it. Shiek slowly rubbed her eyes still very tired. She found her self looking into her own face. She thought she must have been seeing things until her other self ask, \"What are you sleeping on the ground in the cold for, you silly girl?\" White sat up onto her knees to have a better look at who was talking. There on the statue sat a little girl around the same age as Shiek who also looked shockingly similar to her. A second voice called out into the middle of the night and in a rush the double ganger jumped of the statue down to the groud and pressed her back to hide in front of it. She looked at White and signled her to do the same. \"Well what are you waiting for??\" The girl pulled Shiek against the statue along with her and told her to be silent as the second voice continued to call out. As the voice gradually died down into the distance White's new acquaintance began to relax and let go of her hand. The odd girl then spun around on her feet and barked out, \"Who are you, then?\" White wasn't sure if she should say anything but eventually told the girl her name. The girl then replied, \"And why aren't you on your knees? Don't you know who I am?\" White admitted that she didn't know and the girl seemed to be surprised and horrified. The girl picked up a stick from off the ground and gave the back of Shiek's legs a hard whack. White cried out and fell to the ground in pain. She was about to say something when the voice retraced its path and was headed back in their direction. The girl stuck out her tongue at Shiek and took off laughing in the night.Officer Malok  White found herself sitting in the center of a thick forest on the moon of Endor as the moon fell and the darkness of a strange land settled over her.Apprenticeship  White Ragu was taken on by Master Iria Tuqiri as a padawan.First Major Sith Encounter  White Ragu's first major sith encounter came during her first few days at the Kalway Order of Jedi on Yavin 4. A group of apprentices and masters were sitting meditating at the main circle in front of the medbay along with White Ragu. A few sith approached the group and sat do beside them to meditate as well however their real goal was to get them emotional and lose control. What they expected didn't surcome to pass as White Ragu psychologically supported her group at the same time proving the sith's beliefs were folly. She only used facts against them and not just the jedi belief. The ones who ended up emotional was not the jedis but the siths. Slowly, day became night and the jedi group split up to get some work done. White Ragu went back to building her ship on top of the medbay landing pad. White Ragu could barely sense the three approaching sith. By the time she did, they were close enough that it would have been a tight escape. The three sith were now standing around her but did not attack. They wanted to do more damage and turn her from the lightside path. Their efforts proved to be in vain. Luckily White Ragu's master was on her way up to say goodnight when the sith started to use darkside powers against Ragu. Master Iria approached them and the sith started to use the force power fear against her. White Ragu used what power she had to soothe and heal her master until she took a few steps back, misjudging where the edge of the medbay roof was, and ended up over the side. White Ragu ignored the sith who had followed her down, and attempted to make her way back up her master. It was too late. She ended up being knocked unconscious by the sith who was following her and she woke up to find herself in the medbay, with Master Iria standing in front of the bacta tank.Captured and Tortured  One morning White woke up to hearing about one of the masters being captured. Still used to the leadership positions that she was thrown into she decide to lead an investigation her self and relied on her abilities to use psychology. White gathered up the things she need and quietly took a ship and left Yavin IV to head to the base of one of the sith groups in hope that they had heard something about it. When she arrived on the planet she could not find anyone around until she found her way into a temple that had a great darkside aurora. She made her way to the large wooden doors and began to open them using the force, making her way inside. The hall was grand but remained empty. She heard a noise from the floors above and so headed up the staircase that was in the room.Hector  He approached the Yavin IV meditation circle carrying only a bag that he kept close to him at all times. He was only a child and as he came closer to were White was meditating he tried to mask his presence however Shiek could sense him anyways. Without turning to face him she greeted him with a smile and did her usual bow. The little boy was still cautious of her as she introduced her self. Something in her made the boy feel more relaxed and relieved, almost as if he could trust himself with her. He sat down beside her and they started talking as if they had always known each other.Chief of Archives  White was assigned the role of the Chief of Archives after her friend Dawn Donner suggested the position. At first White wasn't too sure, but she eventually decided to take up the role as it would provide very useful in prepiation for becoming a Scholar.Jedi Path  From the beginning of joining the KOJ White Ragu knew exactly what path she wanted to follow. When the time came she chose to be a Consular because she understood that people made many excuses to look for the easy way to do things and often couldn't see other possibilities, however she could. Shiek often mind tricked many of the sith to do as she chose without them realizing it instead of taking out her saber. The sith soon started to be more causious around her. She was also able to out talk them with logic and general facts because she had the understanding of the galaxy her people had.Training with GAR  White and Dawn were having a dispute when Sir Dro Plund approached the two of them. After hearing out what they had to say, he grew tired of the arguement and suggested that they seperate for a little while. He suggested Lady White take some time off at his appartment that he rarely used on Bakura for a week. White could use the time off and agreed to the idea.Sith Holocron Lesson  The following is how White Ragu ended up have the Miraluka sight and senses. Once again White Ragu met up with the grey jedi Farlonis at the old embassy to talk to him about Hector. After their conversation Farlonis told White Ragu to be careful, in which Ragu replied you don't have to worry about me. Farlonis wanted to be sure and asked if she would take a test. White Ragu said she was ready for it. Farlonis took out a sith artifact from his cloak and handed it over to White causiously. The artifact immediately began to glow and suddenly White fell into a deep trance. Farlonis who was witnessing all this became very worried and tried everything he could to bring her out of it. He wasn't able to. Farlonis didn't hear anything, but the sith artifact was now talking to Shiek. Multiple sith voices were speaking to her saying; At which point White fell to her knees crying out screaming in pain. Farlonis was still helpless to do anything. When White Ragu looked up, broken from the trance, her eyes shined a milky silver. She seemed to be looking around and finally said out loud to Farlonis that she could no longer see. White Ragu was now blind and Farlonis had to guide her back to the medbay. There she was put in a bacta tank to try and heal it but with no such luck. Normally it might have done the trick but there was not only a strange black aurora surrounding her eyes but also her whole body. White wasn't the only one who could sense this. It was powerful and not visible to sight. Hector was at the enterence of the medbay with his bear calling out for her. She told Farlonis not to let him into the operating area because she was afraid of what he would do if he saw her so vulnable. After a while of running tests on White and studying, Farlonis realized there was nothing he could do. Over a peroid of time White Ragu stumbled around and could not be the person she used to be with her movement and fighting. She constantly ran into things and people had to escourt her around. She couldn't help but feel defeated. However something was also occuring in the mean time. Her senses were beginning to sharpen and eventually Shiek was starting to be able to use her strong senses to tell where everything was. Finally White was able to use her senses to the point where she was her regular self again. She felt even stronger and more capable then before.Family Reunion  On a quiet morning White Ragu was making her way to the Yavin 4 medbay when she ran into Master Iria, Master Moonsoo, Dawn and the mysterious female stranger she recognized from her first incident with her necklace. She approached the group in the lobby of the medbay but they were in a rush and they all went to the landing pad on the roof. While they where on the roof waiting for a shuttle White Ragu was told that Charles had gotten captured according to the mysterious woman. The masters told White that Dawn Donner had found the crashed ship with the stranger in it and helped the stranger to the medbay. The stranger told them she was going to lead them to Naboo where their knight was being held. Her real motive was to seperate the group and get White Ragu alone. She wanted the necklace for herself and intended to betray the rest of her group. When they all arrived on Naboo they took some time aside to talk amongst themselves about whether or not they could trust this person. White Ragu informed the rest of the group, aside from her master, who this person was. The stranger now realizing that she probably wouldnt have the chance to sucessfully complete her plan decided to make for a quick escape. The jedis still had questions they wanted to ask her and pursued her. She stopped and turned around and ignited her saber. It would appear that she was in fact force sensitive but White Ragu had already expected that from the stronger feelings she had. The stranger tried to put up a fight but still suffered from the injuries from her crash and soon fell to her knees in pain. The jedis helped her to feet and brought her in a cantina that was beside them. They sat her down at a table. White pulled her master and Master Moonsoo aside to talk to them in private. She mentioned everything that Farlonis had told her about the Star Forge. She also explained their agendas to use the power harnessed by it before Hector's father or the creature could. Realizing that she likely would not be sucessful in her plans to seperate the group and get Shiek along the stranger accepted it and announced that they had to travel to Ossus to activate the second crystal of the Ragu necklace.Knighthood  In becoming a Jedi Knight White Ragu took on the advanced path of a Scholar. Having access to much of the material around the galaxy and being instated the Chief of Archives before hand during her padawanship gave her a head start and understanding of what possibilities there was. Also after finally becoming a Jedi Knight she took on Hector as an apprentice as she promised.The Elixa Manifesta  During the early stages of White Ragu's knighthood she discovered an ancient manifest that had some mentioning of what appeared to be her planet and people. Written by one Master Scholar and Scientist Jacob Thorn Shiek placed it in with the material in the KOJ archives.The Dark Whispers  Lady Aichi's apprentice Lyis brought forward a holocron to Shiek that they had adventured for and found. They were unsure of what it was and wanted her to research and study it to unlock it's secrets. After a short while Shiek found out what exactly it was. It was known as the Adas Holocron.Adas Holocron  White soon found herself obsessing over the Adas holocron as she studied it. The effects of the darkside energies were not strong but there was starting to be a change in her appearence and behavour. She became more isolated; keeping more often to herself. The holocron began to build more power as it was working though Shiek. She eventually started wearing darker fashion as the holocron gained enough power. A few people started to notice the slight change in her. Her first padawan Hector was the one who noticed the changes in her behavour. The holocron was able to use Shiek so it was harder to tell and it was able to use her wisedom and blind Nova and Luik to what Hector was saying. She also accused him of spending too much time with the Dark Whispers order but she did so in a way that turned the focus from her to him. They went from not knowing what to believe to telling Hector not to worry about it. The holocron did the most emotional damage to Shiek's padawan Hector. White's behavour was getting worse but still not obvious of a major change. The holocron wanted to keep people blind. However it's power became too strong and a dark presence was starting to be seen even to the point where she had dark auroras around her. People were really beginning to worry. White met up with High Lady Shade and Sylum. They could see the effects of the holocron, but had no idea what was causing it. Shiek was blinded her self, and couldn't see anything wrong. The way see saw it, she had never changed, but she admitted to having a headache. High Lady Shade asked White if she could try to soothe the headache, while Sylum tried to swayed her into still believing there was nothing wrong, pushing her closer to the darkside. High Lady Shade shut the Dark lord up, and convinced Shiek that she could soothe her headache. But what she really wanted was to understand what was happening to her. As she began to meditate through the force with White, the holocron defended itself and attacked High Lady Shade. After falling, Sylum and White looked at each other in confusion and tried to revive her. She wouldn't get up as one of her hand maiden, Nomi, arrived, so White ran to the medbay to retrieve a stretcher for her. However, when she reached the meditation circle, the holocron took control over her mind and clouded what she was doing, to the point where she forgot completely and walked into the archives instead. After a while Sylum came looking for White and found her in the private sith section meditating.Elemental Guardian  It is unknown when White first came in contact with the spirit element but a once realized the danger of bring all of the crystals together as one. In the wrong hands it would have proved to be a great danger. So she rounded up three others in her order and told them a false story, because she was under instructions to keep the the element under strict protection. The three others Master Moonsoo, Master Iria and Lady Koraa.Motherhood  While in the archives on Coruscant, Hector found his way in and approached White, looking a bit disturbed and confused. When he stood in front of her she asked him what was wrong and he admitted that he was torn between choosing who should take the responsiblity of adopting him. After always acting so strong in front of Hector, because of all that had happened, she let down her guard and cried out that she had lost her old order already and didn't want to also lose him too. That she did care who he was with as a son and didn't want to also lose him to anyone else. She said that it was herself that had always been protecting him from the start, since she first met the small child and that was the true definition of a mother. She told him not to confuse her with only being a teacher.Death of Ragu  White Ragu had never given up on her first padawan since joining Praxeum, Mathew LoeningLater Life Council Member of Praxeum  Between major events of the Praxeum Order there was times of confusion and turmoil. The order had lost a number of masters and an even larger number of Council members. A new council was named to resume the responsibilities of the previous one however it was an irregular appointed union consisting of a few of the well mannered knights and padawans. Shiek was not originally assigned a position on the council with the first round of candidates. However the council remained mostly in shadows from a number of it's members. Shiek was told that the masters had said that she was to knight two of the padawans. She was also unaware of the new council's existence so she consulted with one of the masters to get the complete story. He confided that he was also unaware of the dealings of the order at the point and agreed to go ahead. Shiek began to make plans for a knighting ceremony however the when the council heard about what was happening they called for her to present herself in front of them. Shiek answered their call and stood in front of them to discover that there was a council intact. Communication bounced back and forth between them and she realized that the padawans may have been working for their own interests. She questioned the council about the possibility before returning to the padawans with the recent news that they would have to remain patient and wait for the council to decide. While Shiek was attending that meeting she also took the oppertunity to present other issues and ideas. The council was impressed and within a few days was voting on accepting her into the council. Lady Qin informed Shiek of the council's decission to have Shiek join the council. Shiek accepted but was uncomfortable with the irregular council however she also understood that the order still required a council. With the remaining masters of the old council stepping down the new group took on full responsibility. Ragu acted as a bridge between the group members and the council by taking on opinions and ideas to pass forward. She also urged the council to begin pursuing the members who have not been recently active. They begin with one of the knights.Disappearence into the Void  After lending support against an attack on Yavin and the following jail break of the prisoners Shiek boarded a medical ship to return to the planet's surface from the death star orbitting the planet. It was suppose to be a routine flight however something else was in store. Mid way down through the atmosphere Shiek was confronted by a sudden burst only appearing in rear compartment of the craft. Shiek was the only one who was tossed out of the ship and instead of a decline she started to ascend. Further above the incident she rose as Shiek blacked out and landed on a hard ground. As she rose up from the ground still feeling a bit dizzy she indulged on her surroundings. In a moment she realized that she was sitting comfortly on a benchPersonality and Traits  White Ragu was majestic, kind, wise, cunning, sweet, and tried to bring the best out of people and a situation but is also authoritative. White Ragu often had the ability to draw people to her. It is uncertain if it was the work of the force or her beauty and personality that did so. White Ragu often told people that the reason she bowed to anyone who she first started speaking to and when they left was because she respected all live and acknowledged it. It was nearly impossible to have any influence on White Ragu, she usually almost always came to her own conclusions from her own reasoning. Her reasoning was only based of general facts and never on belief. She knew what people wanted and how to influence it to give them what they wanted.Powers and Abilities  White Ragu was kidnapped from the streets of a city on Bakura. Her captures ended up taking her into the middle of a war which occupied their attentions while Shiek was able to escape from their custody. During this time she met up with an officer in the war named Malok. Malok soon discovered the great understanding of White's people through her and decided to train her in battle strageties. Also During White Ragu's stay in Bakura she participated in training with the clone troops of the Grand Army of the Republic which gave her special understanding from the other jedi in her order how to flow through battles as a team and developing special battle plans. She also decided to go back to the beginning during that time and learn the basics of duelling some more with a sword rather then her saber.Lightsaber Training  Having the knowledge and understanding that her people possessed made White Ragu a lethal weapon with the saber however didn't tend to use it as much as using force abilities to support her family of Jedis in the background. It was believed that she had more reason for doing so then just because she was a Consular. When White's undersatnding and Miraluka sight were finally combined it resulted in being about to see and understand biology of other beings. She was then able to mimic the movement and combat style along with other things. She was then able to further herself adapting and advance a form of one of her jedi friends in a different order. At first it was a bit new to her and her opponent was able to get an adventage over her in the first spar but by the second one she had adapted quickly using his own style against him and was then unable to get that advantage he could previously.Force Abilities  Being a Jedi Consular Scholar White Ragu had an extensive knowledge base for the force and for it flowed. She could see with her Miraluka sight how to strengthen connections. Weakening them however is much more of a challenge then one would think. White Ragu tended to have a much stronger use for psychological force powers like mind trick, force illusion, but was also known to use electric judgment from time to time. Shiek also had the senses and the sight of seeing things through the force like her Miraluka side could. She even made a few exceptions to use mind trick on a few of the masters as a padawan but never enjoyed or felt good about it. Only two other people new the full details of what spired. One was Dawn Donner because that was who Ragu was protecting and the other was master Iria who she trusted to tell the truth to. After that event White Ragu promised herself and her master to have more faith in the council's decission. That was the last time she used mind trick on her own order. After suffering the effects of the Adas holocron with old sith magic White's powers and knowledge of the force increased greatly.Equipment Apparel  White Ragu had a number of different white dresses and apparel. The red and white version of her appearance didn't last but did look very suiting too. Her usual fashion was a white classly attire that helped people recognize her outer beauty.Lightsabers Apprentice Saber  White Ragu's apprentice saber was nothing impressive but she did sand down some of the grip to shown a bright bronze. Shiek decided to wield two of them during her time as a padawan. She wore one of either side of her arm just slightly under the jedi armor she wore for a short time that she made herslef. They both shown a white blade surrounded by a black aurora. This auror came from her experience with the sith artifact that took away her regular sight.Heart of the Guardian  White Ragu received the rare crystal from a good friend who was also in the same order named Koraa Aya.The White Blade  Known as a unique double-bladed saber. Like the Vanishing Miraluka Temple of Torr the White Blade was believed to have an odd life like ability to be able to sense beings through the force. This gave the user to also have the upper hand of having another sense as a weapon. It was modified to be able to split into two single sabers to use or as a whole.The Adas Corrupted Blade  This was the corrupted form of the white blade when Shiek fell under the dark influence of the Adas holocron.Final Sabers  Shiek eventually changed her outfit to a more traditional jedi look and took both the White Blade's crystal and the Heart of the Guardian crystal out of their usual hilts and replaced them in a new set of hilts. One side lit up and powerful orange yellow while the other a pure white.Starships Elixa Trava  During her time off one of the things White Ragu deside to do was start building a great transport ship called the Elixa Trava. It is believed that the word \"Elixa\" meant \"Venture\" and \"Trava\" meant \"Void\" or \"Unknown Region\". Together they made up the term \"Explorer of the Obyss\". White Ragu had to eventually put the poject aside for a later date so she could gather the appropiate materials needed.Accomplishments Cain Rosenkreuz Biography The Beginning  Born Cain Rosenkreuz around 182 ABY to a noble family of Echani on the world of Eshan and hailed from a large city named Malakir. His father was an Echani General by the name of Alessandro Rosenkreuz, and his mother was a politician by the name of Caterina Rosenkreuz, however his biological mother was the sister to the late Empress Teta, thus making him half Echani compared to his other siblings who were full. Caterina helped raise her kids, while her husband commanded Echani forces. However little did anyone know that Alessandro was a strong force user whom had secret ties to the Jedi Order. Those secret ties is what got Cain's older brother Abel(whom he had a secret Force Bond with.) into a Jedi Enclave where he began his training. (This would prove to be one of the reason why later on Cain would fall, due to his jealousy of his older brother.) However Cain was ignored and was thought to not be sensitive to the force. Thus he was enlisted under his Father into the Echani armed forces where he at a very young age began his training in hand to hand combat learning all the known tiers of Echani combat. Although this would take time, he would continue his training under the command of his father in the military until around 220 ABY where Cain went Awol and traveled to Cinnegar where his mother's side of the family was. Upon his arrival he walked the streets seeking some kind of future for himself. One day he chanced upon the Tetan Palace which at this point was under control of the Revenant Armada. This step would change his life forever.Life in the Armada  After becoming a member of the Armada in 221 ABY, Cain started out as a private in the Marauder Corps which would begin a life of pain, suffering and Death. However during this time he served under a Captain named 'Preacher' who was a ruthless Marauder whose hate clouded his vision more then once and was quick to temper which would often result in someone's death. Above him was the Grand Marshal Darth Occidian, a Rodian who also had short temper and whose anger also resulted in someone's death. Life in the Armada was hard, constant training under intense pressure. Most Marauders went insane at this point. And to Cain the constant lure of the Dark side was always there. Cain fought constantly to survive as a recruit in the Marauders as he seemed so unimportant in the bulk of the Armada. Towards the end of 221 ABY Captain Preacher approached Cain and presented him with an opportunity that would lead Cain to becoming what he is today. This offer was to undergo experimental training new to the Armada, and new to the galaxy. This new training would create a division in the Armada's Marauders forces known as AIU, or Advanced Infiltration Unit. This would ultimately lead to the fall of Cain. During his new life as an AIU Recruit, Cain was tortured every day with cruel methods. He would be beaten, strapped down to gurneys and experimented on with random drugs and hallucinogens. During the final steps of his transformation, Cain underwent many surgical procedures that nearly killed him and only survived due to his Echani training along with being a force sensitive. During these surgeries he would get physical artificial enhancements placed along areas in his body. Mainly stimulants allowing him to become stronger, faster and over all physically superior than average Echani males. As the time of surgery ended, a drug was ministered to Cain which would attempt to delete him of his identity. However through deep meditation he was able to cleanse himself of said drug. After that he was approached by Captain 'Preacher' and was told his name would be Recruit until he could learn the ways of an AIU. As an AIU Recruit Cain would undergo harsh training under his Captain whom was quick to be temperamental with him and cause Cain to begin building up Rage within him. He went through extensive training to become an Infiltrator, and be able to use stealthy maneuver and techniques that would later prove highly useful. He was taught to become one with the shadows and use shadow warfare to dominate in the war that was to follow against the Republic and the Fel Empire. During the next 5 years Cain would train in the art of Stealth Warfare, Assassinations, Basic/Advanced Weaponry, piloting and of course melee combat. And when Cain finished in 226 ABY he was approached by Captain Preacher who bestowed upon him the title of Infiltrator, along with that of an identity that would create a new personality that would take control of Cain. This name was, Apparition.The Rise of Apparition  In 226 ABY Apparition was bumped up to Lieutenant of the Advanced Infiltration Unit, better known as AIU while his old superior 'Preacher' became the Grand Marshal. During this time the War between the Armada and the Republic had just begun. In the beginning of Apparition's life he recruited many Marauders and trained many in the arts of the AIU. Through this time he conducted stealth Warfare upon the Republic and the Empire in hopes to uproot its government in which eventually would add to the fall of the Empire and Republic on Coruscant. during this time he was not very knowledgeable within the force, only being able to use basic things he picked up here and there. Apparition would conduct many guerrilla warfare tactics that he had learned, continuing to attack in the shadows and then run back into hiding laying in wait. However Apparition was growing in strength, his new personality was taking control of him and removing what used to be him. Turning from a decent nature and patience to wretched anger and rage that would fuel his attacks on the Republic and his victims. Apparition himself constantly fought with his reality and his soul, that of Cain Rosenkreuz and attempted to remove it or taint it and completely take it over with the poison of the Dark Side. This transformation would take many many years to manifest before it ever really took him over.  As 228 ABY rolled around Apparition had become a Captain within the AIU and the Revenant Armada, rising to the position of Executive Officer of the Marauder Corps. This was a highly esteemed rank and something not easily achieved. By this point in time the entity known as Apparition had a strong hold over Cain and began corrupting him slowly. However the major turning point for him was the day when he traveled to the peaceful lush world of Talus. Upon arriving at Talus he went to the famed Jedi Temple and began infiltrating it to find out what he could of the Jedi. To his surprise and shock he stumbled upon a man with shining white hair, pale skin tone and very tall. this man's garments were that of an Imperial Knight Grand Master. Red with white outlines. What shocked him was the fact this was his older brother who ran away so many years ago when Cain was 8 to a Jedi Enclave as he was the favorite of the family, mainly his father Alessandro. Upon recognizing Abel, Apparition quickly grew frustrated and angry and confronted him. Upon confronting him a terrific battle ensued which after hours of fighting and due to inexperience with force Combat and melee combat Apparition fell and nearly died. Abel tossed Apparition into the ocean where he drifted for hours on the brink of death. (Though due to the extreme nature of the fight Abel later on became conflicted within himself and after the collapse of the Empire he joined the Revenant Armada and became a Wraith.) When Apparition was rescued by members of his flagship the,'Dark Omen\", he met up with his fallen brother whom taught him a little more then the basics of the force. Teaching him to focus and control his rage and hatred which would later on be perfected. As 228 ABY neared an end the Revenant forces repelled that of the Empire and the Republic and caused them to withdraw(except for the Republic). Thus the Armada was able to retain their position on Coruscant. 229 ABY would prove to be a testing time for Apparition as his power grew and the tally of victims grew. In 230 ABY he made many enemies and began instilling his reputation among the Jedi and the Republic. In this year he began revealing his identity as 'Apparition' and moved from the shadows into the light. However his silent personal war continued to be fought within the shadows of the Galaxy. 229 ABY would mark the year that 'Apprition' took over the body of Cain and his soul. Upon this time Apparition confronted Wraith Commander Darth Ikyrio, whom he believed to have been more powerful than Grand Admiral Darth Abyssus. From there he offered himself to her teachings so that he may become powerful and a true Sith one day...The Apprenticeship  In the beginning of 229 ABY Apparition went under the tutelage of Darth Ikyrio, someone who was very powerful within the Dark side of the force. Through this time he has learned much in the ways of the force, learning new techniques within the dark side and doubling his force powers. Under her training he is becoming closer to becoming a true Sith. He has learned the nature of the Dark side, along with being able to translate the Ancient Sith language and be able to speak some of it. Through her training he has also come to master basic abilities and become lose to mastering other abilities such as Lightning, and his favorite, Telekinesis. Apparition also grew to love playing mind games and using deception to drive those he fought insane. As a Sith Apprentice Apparition had been sent on many missions by Ikyrio and the Armada to locate Jedi and other such things that can help him become more attuned and knowledgeable of the force. Towards the middle of 230 ABY he had become quite strong for the training he had received. Becoming a Sith whom believed in an organized Sith Order and not one bent on betraying others for positions. Someone avoiding the trap doors of the Dark side which many Lords have fallen to.  As the war began to slow down Apparition found himself with a lot of free time. So he began in search of creating a powerful lightsaber. After many many months of travel throughout the galaxy he tried picking up on leads of where notable crystal sources would be and areas that were strong with the force. While on Onderon he approached a few people whom sources told him were of the black market and did dealings with force relics. Upon learning of some crystals they were selling he found out they had been trying to sell a Vexxtal crystal. After killing the dealers he took the crystal for himself and made his way through the galaxy searching for another. About six months later he had stumbled upon a strong Dark Side presence located around Ziost where he chanced upon a crystal formation. After many hard hours of mining the the rocks and the crystal formation he was able to produce a powerful crystal named Lignan. After showing them to his Master he then presumed work on creating his very own Lightsaber. After easily finding the mechanical parts from the Armada's resources he spent days and days of strict meditation channeling the force into the two crystals he had gotten and attuned them with his stance in the force. Though for one reason or another many years later the crystals would be lost and he would need to create a new Lightsaber. Upon completion he then went to the furnace which the Grand Admiral allowed him to use where he created, through many hours of work through the force, a red synthetic lightsaber crystal. After all this was done he had efficiently created his own deadly lightsaber that emitted a powerful red blade capable of massive destruction. Many of those who thought they were strong enough fell to the blade of 'Apparition', including that of the Grand Marshal of the Revenant Armada's Marauder Corps. In 230 ABY his former superior Grand Marshal 'Preacher' had challenged him to a fight where the Grand Marshal felt insulted by 'Apparition' and wouldn't rest until his AIU leader of dead. At this point in time the Grand Marshal had become a cyborg made of Phrick plating with little actual organs left inside his body. this would prove a thought opponent to 'Apparition' and was a test for his Apprenticeship under Darth Ikyrio who watched the entire time as the two fought on and on. After hours of relentless fighting 'Apparition' gained the upper hand and tossed 'Preacher' (who also went by 'Ravager' at this time) onto the memorial where he destroyed him. This proved to be a major milestone in 'Apparition's' trainings he had finally become strong enough to become something important in the Galaxy. As he Continued to hone his skills with the Force, more or less the Dark Side, he traveled to Korriban in search of a self discovery in a sense to enlighten himself with the ancient wisdom of the Lords of old and to take a step closer to completing his training and Apprenticeship under Darth Ikyrio. Upon completing his training under Ikyrio, Apparition was sent to Rhelg to work on relations between the government and them. However in that time he was accepted into the Trayus academy and Rhelg and while there is under the instruction of the Duke of Rhelg, known as Darth Altus. With this happening Apparition intends to learn more of the Dark Side from a different point of view. While on Rhelg his Master at the time, Darth Altus trained him in various techniques. But something Apparition still carries with him today are a few Lightsaber forms that were taught to him. Those being:Form V: The Way of the Krayt Dragon (Shien/Djem So)  The name of the Fifth Form of lightsaber combat varies, Shien and Djem So draw on one another and are essentially based on the same movements and velocities, and Anakin Skywalker mastered them both. By comparison, Djem So demonstrated a even higher level of physical strength and aggressive moves. So it is believed that Shien and Djem So both fall under the catergory of Form V, much like Juyo and Vaapad in Form VII, with Shien better at dealing with blaster bolts and Djem So better at blade-to-blade combat. Form V is a powerful style developed by Form III practitioners that preferred a more offensive angle. The defensive nature of Form III often leads to dangerously prolonged combat. This style came about from combining Forms II and III. Embodying the perfection of the idea of counterattack, Form V maintains its existence through having sufficient defensive skills, as derived from Form III, but channeling defense into offense. The example is commonly used that while Form III combatants effortlessly deflect laser bolts, Form V practitioners excel at redirecting the laser bolt toward the opponent. This simultaneously defends the user and efficiently injures the opponent. Also, it utilizes Form II's parries, allowing the user to parry the attempted attack, and counter it. However, where Form II concentrated on precise and elegant parries, Form V permits the user to actually fully block and repel attacks since it calls for the use of more brute, Force-enchanced strength. This particular aspect of the technique is beleived to be favored by Anakin Skywalker, and especially later by him as Darth Vader. Form V is also different from Form III in the fact that Form V practictioners believe that the best defense is a good offense. It has already been observed that Form III users simply deflect blaster bolts and parry lightsaber attacks until the opponent makes a fatal mistake. Form V practioners take the near impenetrable defenses of Form III and press the assault, using wide, sweeping blows in an attempt to overwhelm the opponent with brute strength. A dedication to the power and strength necessary to defeat an enemy characterizes the philosophy of Form V, which some Jedi describe by the maxim \"peace through superior firepower.\" To some Jedi Knights, Form V represents a worthy discipline prepared for any threat; to others, Form V seems to foster an inappropriate focus on dominating others. The aggressive philosophy of Form V is the source of many a Jedi's disapproval. With the offensive but refined movements of Form II and the highly defensive postures of Form III, Form V has been proven to be a highly effective style. Both Form V and VII call for its user to use emotion to enhance their strength. Form V users can best be described as bold, powerful, fearless and confident. They are unafraid to let their emotions rule them and contribute to the fight, though they are wary of falling to the dark side.Form VI: The Way of the Rancor (Niman / Jar'kai)  Form VI attempted to balance all elements of lightsaber combat, combining the techniques from Forms that came before into a less intensely demanding combat style. In practice, Form VI was a combination of older forms (Forms I, II, III, IV, and V), and all of them in moderation. In the blending, much of the individuality was lost, but the strengths were spread evenly, and there was little weakness in it. Due to its \"jack-of-all-trades\" nature, the success of this form was largely dependent on the practitioner's intuition, improvisation, and creativity in combat rather than the rote responses derived from other forms. This broad generalization made Form VI well suited for diplomats, as they could spend their time training in the areas of politics and negotiation instead of combat training. Niman was not a weak form. While many other lightsaber forms bolstered the wielder's abilities in one area, while leaving him vulnerable in others, Niman was capable in all situations but had no dramatic strengths. It provided no edge in battle, but achieved its worth in not leaving its wielder as exposed as some of the more aggressive forms. Its strength was its balance. The form was also considered a basis for more 'unorthodox' fighting, as Jedi who used it were less frequently using automatic reflex than constantly thinking and often had time to invent unusual strategies for combat. It also provided a decent defense versus enemy Force powers and blaster fire. Dual-blade fighters, whether classical Niman duelists or individuals applying the Jar'Kai tactic, were able to maintain a strong offense, as the speed of attack that two blades allowed would overwhelm most opponents. A typical maneuver was to continually attack with one blade while relying on the other for defensive coverage, ensuring that the duelist could keep up his guard even as he attacked. However, it was common that both blades be used for offensive purposes, keeping up a continuous wave-front assault.Darth Ikyrio  Darth Ikyrio was Apparition's first Master during his time with the Revenant Armada when he was very young. She trained him with the basic force abilities while he was with the Advanced Infiltration Unit. She put him through many life threatening situations and has been tortured many times. Though despite all this he looked up to her to make the right choices and since he had no family ties then and only had his suit of Armor he grew to be Loyal and respectful to her. His training went by fast and when he was given the title of Darth he declined and kept doing his duties with the Armada. He felt he really needed to earn 'Darth' through some major victory or conquest, something that would qualify him to be one. However when he left the Armada he felt betrayed by his former Master, and the Bond between them was painful when she vanished into the Galaxy without a trace. Not knowing where to go he would go to places like Rhelg and Korriban to further and complete his training. Years later Apparition would sense his Master's presence on the Sith world of Prakith and he had a small glimmer of hope that she would return and help him. Instead she came with the intention to kill him and so the betrayal was complete. Hurt and enraged the two fought on Prakith until Apparition used his new found abilities to open a portal to the Shadow Realm where he lured Darth Ikyrio inside and trapped her there. Once inside they both continued their fight and in the end Apparition beat his Master when he abosrbed her Life Force and in accordance to Sith Law stripped her of her power and has taken her shell of a body captive in an unknown Location. Thus is when the Apprentice became the Master.Apparition's Relics  The Heart of Apparition is a Sith Amulet that was created by Apparition himself in the year of 230 ABY. It all started when upon completing his Seventh Mastery of all Eight Sith Masteries he was directed to go to the Sith world of Rhelg, where he was to travel through a maze and locate sacred tombs and from there take a Crystal best suited for an Amulet. Upon traveling to rhelg he was confronted by the local populace whom he had to prove himself worthy to before he could enter the Tombs. After quickly passing the test he went forward unto the Tombs and found what he had been looking for. After completing the task Apparition returned to Coruscant where under supervision of his Master he empowered the crystal with Dark side energies along with the essence of Sith Magic.  Its abilities include a shield or better known as absorption power that absorbs incoming attacks through the force directed to the wearer which is then stored into the amulet's personal energy reserves. Second ability is that it grants the wearer the ability to read Ancient Sith text. thirdly the wearer's affinity to the Dark side is heightened when wearing the Amulet, making their connection to the force Stronger, and their mastery of the Dark side more powerful. Lastly the Amulet has a countermeasure installed to protect it from misuse by the Jedi. If worn by a Jedi, it will begin to lure them to the Darkside and place a corruption aura around them, as it can only be used by those who follow the Dark side. The last effect that can be placed in it, is upon death of Apparition's physical body his spirit would be placed inside the amulet itself. Apparition also owns a ring that he crafted himself in the fires of Korriban. The Ring itself appears to be silver with black and a Letter in Sith text on the top. Its is also known as, 'The Seal of Apparition.' It is also a Sith relic as it is empowered with the Dark Side of the force, along with the power of Sith Magic. Though it is quite small and not capable of carrying much power, it is able to hold a storage of Force energy allowing the wearer to replenish their force Reserves and can run out of extra energy. For it to work, once every standard week its energy must be replenished. Later on Apparition would create from the depths of Prakith one of his most deadly Relics yet. And that would be the known as, \"The Hand of Apparition\". This object was a Sith sword made from a few metals but developed through intriquete Sith Alchemy and Magical rituals. Like all of his Relics, they are all imbued with a part of him. His Amulet had his Soul sealed within, while his ring (sigil) stored his knowledge of the Force. However this time his newest of Relics, his Sith Sword would be imbued with all of his power, strength, pasison, hatred everything which made him strong. Which is why the wielder will have their strength increase tenfold should they wield the Sword... But also at their own discretion.Life on Rhelg  After completing his training under Darth Ikyrio, Apparition traveled to Rhelg on a mission for the Empress in an attempt to strengthen the ties of his Government with that of Rhelg's. Upon arrival he had already proved himself worthy of an audience with the Duke. After meeting with the Duke he was offered a place as a student to continue his studies in the Dark Side there at the Trayus Academy. Though he completed his initiation task somewhat, he was accepted to train personally underneath the Duke of Rhelg, also known as Darth Altus. Once he had begun his training, he knew that the knowledge and skills he would gain from the Trayus Academy would prove beneficial to himself and hopefully one day to the plan he hopes to set in motion. As both of them were training, Apparition's presence was requested by their leader, known as the 'Taral'ari', and he was brought before him. The Taral'ari was a massive being of the Sith species, though he doesn't know what he was before turned Sith. Upon meeting him he felt a presence in the force he had never felt before, and knew that he could learn much at the Academy and become more powerful than most Sith and Jedi.  His training has mainly consisted of some combat training, little tests to see what he was like in melee combat. Other parts of his training have been talks about the Force. Philosophical and history of the Force. Other than that life on Rhelg has been simple, though he finds himself constantly having to prove himself over and over to some of the occupants in the Citadel. Apparition has undergone many tests, and has gained many friends while staying on Rhelg. There he has learned more about himself than he ever has. He eventually become close with Darth Lilith, a Lord on Rhelg, whom he really looks up to. Along with the Son of his Master, whom he enjoys talking to about anything from Combat to just simple life. He has also been traveling frequently to Byss, where he got the honor to meet the Sith Emperor that the Trayus accept as their leader. Though he has had difficulty completely accepting him as the supreme leader, he does respect him.Family Life  As time progressed Cain would eventually find the need to want a family. The time presented itself when an opportunity arose where the Tetan Empire could strengthen ties with Bakura. The Bakuran Princess had been captured and from there the princess and Cain fell in love with each other. One day the princess had been accepted in as a Lady of the Tetan Empire, and that was the day the two of them were married. Though it could have been seen as a politically arranged marriage, they both settled in. However many years later his loving wife passed away and caused Cain to move on. And years later when an interesting woman broke into his base he realized just who she was and fell in love. Her name was Remnant and later on turned out her real name was Dark Lady Chaos.  A long time into knowing each other they took things slow and both fell in love and eventually they were married by the Emperor and had the ceremony on Byss. In this point in his life nothing could have been better and he had found his one and only soul mate. To him his family is important as he grew up and served in the Armada for years by himself and with nobody there for him. And during that time in the Armada the only connecton he had was with his Master at the time, but even then it was short lived.Lordship  After many years of partaking in many academies, Cain finished his training in both the Sith'ari and the Trayus Academy, elevating himself to Master or Lord of the Sith. Sith Lord in short. In this sense he was a leader in the mighty Sith Empire underneath Emperor Validus and would serve him and the Empire and help better the Sith nation as a whole. However this time of his life turned out to be very boring, as there were too many other Sith Lords in the galaxy, which began his hunt to seek out the strong and separate them from those who never earned the title. He would only surround himself with those whom earned it and only on occasion would he visit Byss. The balance of Sith Lords needs to be lessened, there are too many causing too much conflict. This is what he has thought, thus spending his time not using the title of Darth and seeking those strong enough to create a New Sith Order.Personality  Cain has a very interesting personality that does conflict with him at certain times and almost even random times. His Echani traits give him a certain sense of Justice and honor, along with the mentality of a warrior but it does make him light of heart at times or even caring instead of Dark and 'Evil'. He is very passionate about almost everything, which makes him strong but also realistic. Besides that what also conflicts with him is his Tetan heritage and background, more specifically his noble background which gives him a sense of superiority and even sometimes a sense of arrogance. As a youth when he grew up he attended Echani Military school and learned his whole life to be just like his father, who was an Echani General. In this day and age Cain would be considered an Echani general, having reached the Elderly age and from all his Military time he has developed the natural ability that all Echani are able to learn. This ability was like Battle Precognition, the ability to almost sense your opponent's next move. If Cain is passionate about something he will do his best to achieve it or even protect it. He also can be very nice to people if they are nice to him, though if they are not he can be quite the pain towards them. All in all he isn't a very cocky individual, and prefers for people to blab away as over time he has understood people who show their hand aren't the best of fighters. Some cons of his personality is that he does not like being dominated by any authority, this is the worst way to try and communicate with him. He prefers calm, respectful talk but if he gets the feeling someone is trying to force anything on him then he will shut down and become very very stubborn. He is a military man first and foremost, so everything to him has a strategic point and for that matter nothing he does doesn't have some form of strategy or tactial aim.The New Sith Order  Formed around 232 ABY, The New Sith Order is currently based on the world of Nar Shaddaa as it waits the re-construction of the world of Prakith. Once Prakith is finished they will move in there and make it their home base. The New Sith Order, or known as the NSO is led by Apparition and a few other Sith Masters. Apparition would go on to become an ally of the Sith Empire to help them in their struggles to further the betterment of the Sith Nation. Although the Order is small, its leaders are strong and determined to make something of the NSO. Its Mission is to help unite the Sith and bring about a new modern era, using old traditions and codes in a new way to rebuild what once was. Neo Sith they have been called, but nonetheless they are followers of the Dark side. They have fought in many battles since their creation, and have taken up operations on many planets. Currently they have major bases on Keres I and Keres II, as well as Felucia thanks to the Consortium Alliance and Eshan. They are at war with the Tetan Empire, as well as the newly forming Republic. The NSO has formed its own alliance, taking in other groups who wish to restore the dominion of the Sith, rather than let those on Byss believe they are the law of the land. The Order has established a Sith Troopers Corps to create an army to help fight. Many things are head for the Order, as they bring about the old ways into a new era.Dantooine Jedi Enclave  Dantooine Jedi Enclave is a committed Order of Jedi Masters, Knights, and Padawans, who have dedicated themselves to the study of The Force. The Jedi Order is dedicated to the rebuilding of and protection of the historic Dantooine Enclave. To be Jedi in Dantooine means to be the protectors of this community, we are not the government, we are only the defenders of this planet, working together with the Civilians and the Dantooine Guards, for to keep Dantooine's peace ... because this is our compromise with this community .. and to keep Dantooine's freedom, our hope against the Sith domination in the galaxy. The Dantooine Jedi Enclave strives to be a family which provides one another with mutual respect, encouragement, help and protection in the face of any challenge or threat. This concept of the called \"Family\" is the bedrock of the Jedi Order, everyone in DJE has voice and the main goal of the community is to keep this concept of Family present in any DJE member, because DJE without this concept, doesn't exist.Background The Beginning  For Centuries, the Jedi Enclave was left, after many wars, the Jedi order was eradicated from Dantooine, the commerce and presence of Dantooine in the Galaxy go down, but now, the ruins of the buildings, the commerce and the Dantooine society were restored by the new community. This community in majority human farmers, they start to be the main settlers of this planet, with the time, The community established a government based on the principles of the Republic, learning from the lessons of the past, what it meant the Sith Empire presence on Dantooine, that led to the community almost total destruction. Now this new Dantooine government, has its main objective into strengthen the economy of Dantooine planet, working hard and closely with the Dantooine Guards, the DJE Jedi to maintain peace and security on Dantooine.  Being in the Post-Legacy era, while the Dantooine Community was working in the restoration of the planet, a group of Jedi from the Jedi Order of Ruusan, left the planet to establish a new Jedi Order on Dantooine, with the objective of restoring the Historic Jedi Enclave. Many Jedi left Ruusan and went towards to Dantooine, to support the local settlers and to reconstruct the Jedi Enclave there. A first Jedi meeting was made there, that was the beginning of all the things. By the will of the Force, and with the participation of the main Leaders of this new Jedi Enclave, the called \"The Family\", The first Council Masters decided to rebuild the Dantooine Jedi Enclave and restore the Jedi Presence on Dantooine. This meeting was made with the presence of Master Don Gaton, Master Caronte Blanco, Master Edwina Heron (Eds), the Jedi Knights Mark Ordram, Stallion Raiden, and the Padawans Zero Dragone, Marc Raiden, Brenna Hastings and Blade Kamala.The First Generation  The Main leader of the Jedi Order on Dantooine was Master Don Gaton, Being a Jedi Master Former in NOJ, he decided to lead the new group of Jedi, for to build a Jedi Order in Dantooine, establishing the base of the DJE Jedi Academy, then, the first DJE generation of Jedi Knights continued his work on Dantooine, keeping the fundamentals and improving other things on the Jedi Order. Master Gaton established the bases of this new community, and defined the role of the Jedi Order on Dantooine, his vision and his dedication on Dantooine will never be forgotten. He was a real example of a real Jedi, and the example to follow for the new generations of Jedi in DJE.  The firsts DJE Jedi Knight defined the Jedi Academy training , working in the knowledge of the Force, the Force users abilities, the sabre skills, the discipline and vision of the Jedi Order. They defined the policy against the Darksiders, for to protect Dantooine against the Sith menace, because they were witness in the past, than how the Sith was allowed in other planets and at the end, how that planets fall under Sith domination. It was not an easy decision, but their goal was clear from the beginning, Having the approval of the Dantooine Government, it was very needed for to bring Hope in the galaxy, for to believe in the restoration of a Republic in the Galaxy, and the freedom against the Sith domination.The Time of Darkness  But this beautiful project called Dantooine not always had happiness all the time, Dantooine lived his most difficult time, when some of the Jedi Patriarchs of the Order decided to move away from Dantooine for personal reasons. Was in that time, than Master Caronte Blanco decide to lead the Jedi Order with the help of the other few ones, Master Mark Ordram, Master Blade Kamala, Master Kaz Haiku, and Sir RavenClaw Karu. Being few ones on Dantooine, they start to work in the bases of the Jedi Order of Dantooine, that work was very difficult, because the moral of some ones go down, but with heart and decision, The Masters with patience start to recovery \"The Family\" concept again, because they know than without that concept, Dantooine will not exist. In the worst time on Dantooine, after few days than some of the Jedi Patriarches left Dantooine, the Jedi Master Stallion Raiden betrayed DJE. The fallen Jedi Master, made pacts with the darksiders, the Nightsisters, the Bloodtalon, and taking with him to others from Dantooine Jedi Enclave. Stallion, being manipulated by the Darksiders, made his own army, for attack Dantooine in a weakest moment. It was a time of darkness over Dantooine, Stallion was leading Darksiders and Dark troopers against DJE. They started searching to find the new ones alone on Dantooine, for strike them, in coward way, when the few Masters were not around, searching to make the Dantooine moral fall down, and for that, Dantooine was under attack constantly for some days.  The brave Jedi on Dantooine tried to defend the planet, sacrificing their life's with honour, being outnumbered, the Jedi challenged them on each attack, but for them, to fight against the fallen Jedi, their brothers in the past, it was very difficult. Only when Master Blade Kamala, in front of everybody there, ready for to fight again, He spokes to Stallion about of the reasons of his selfish acts against his old Jedi family, Master Blade offers to him to sacrifice himself (Blade), Leaving Dantooine Exiled, with the condition than Stallion stop the madness of his acts against Dantooine, and only in that moment, Stallion, seeing that his best friend was resigning everything about Dantooine, he ordered to stop the attack, and the dark Forces obeyed him.The Second Generation  At the end, the light of the force heal the Jedi Order again, and after of many tears and to be concerned about of Dantooine, the will of the force with the Jedi Order of Dantooine was showed, and a new Jedi generation was growing up on Dantooine. Master Caronte Blanco starts to be the Jedi reference for the Jedi Order, and for the will of the Force, The Masters Mark Ordram, Caronte Blanco, Kaz Haiku and Blade Kamala worked so hard for to make DJE growing up , training a new generation of Jedi there. From this new generation, we can find the names of the following Jedi: Master RavenClaw Karu, Sir Kanno, Sir Agen Kolher, Sir Ruins, Sir Keiran, Sir Otacon, Sir Rothlan, Lady Krystal, Lady Laura Kamala, Lady Melody Kamala, Lady Bianca Dallas, Lady Neren, and others. Their work and support were very Important for to define the new base of the Jedi Order, and the protectors of the Jedi Enclave, Many of the padawans than suffered the dark time in the past, they become in DJE Jedi Knights, and the few Jedi Knights than existed in the time fo crises, become in Jedi Masters, and all of them worked hard with the councils for to restore the Jedi order again. It was not an easy work, the Sith tried to destroy that work many times, but Many times also they failed, because Jedi Knights, Padawans with honour, with their sabres, protecting and defending Dantooine against the Sith Attacks made by Sith Lords, but, these Braves Jedi show them, each time, than when a group of Jedi has a real goal in their heart, nobody can destroy or take them that. Now, on Dantooine Jedi Enclave, the sunrise illuminates the faces of the Jedi there, now, with the Jedi Order healed, new Masters, new Jedi Knights, new Padawans, born in DJE, and the Jedi Order on Dantooine starts to grow up in Humble way, against the desire of their enemies for to see them fall down. The Jedi of Dantooine, worked in silence, they are being firms in their convictions, always acting as servants of the Force, teaching the Jedi Way to who wish to follow the Jedi path on Dantooine, helping to others, defending the innocent, protecting the weak by the will of the Force, doing their duty, as Jedi.The Third Generation  At the end, with all the efforts made, the work in DJE provide the first results, The Dantooine Jedi Enclave, was working in the new base of the Advanced Jedi Path, new students and padawans start to appear for to be teached by the Jedi of Dantooine, new DJE Jedi Knights are made, and new DJE Jedi Masters are showed by the will of the Force.The Dantooine Goverment and the Jedi Order, build a strong base of cooperation in the planet, the presence of the Jedi, is demarked by cordiality and respect in the community, and having clear their compromise with the community, the DJE define a new base of Council Masters, in this new Generation of Council Masters, the names of Master Sha'ira, Master Keiran Horn, Master Artiste, Master Laura, were recognized by the community like an example of dedication, work and loyalty in the Jedi order.The Fourth Generation (Present Day)  After Master Artiste, Master Lau, Master Sha'ira and Keiran departures, Dantooine and DJE itself have been going through a period of decline followed by a slow renovation process. The Jedi Enclave went through a difficult period in terms of activity, but its community and most loyal members hold strong and decided to carry on the DJE Legacy and so forming a new generation of Jedi. The 4th generation was born. At the end of a long period of rebuilding and re-organization, a new Council was nominated. Council members are: Master RavenClaw Karu, Master Thot Mistwalker, Master Destiny Vuissent, Master Neren Valis, Master Otacon Skinstad, Master Valery Goldshark DJE is now established in a renovated and rebuilt Enclave, still on Dantooine Planet. The new rebuilding has shown particular influence from the Old Republic architecture and tradition. We can find new personalities together with some old members: Master Arth Darkwatch, Master Rothlan Nabro, Master Gabriel Botha, Master Galise, Lady Jarael Kimono and more... The New Council strong of new jedi knights and masters and of a renovated alliance with the Grand Army of Republic (GAR) will keep Dantooine safe and form the DJE next generation. This new Generation of Council Masters in DJE, has the duty of to keep the DJE academy in a highest level, having clear than the challenge in this time will be major, and the Galaxy needs the presence and support of the Jedi, and Dantooine needs to be a reference of why the Jedi is necesary for to keep the justice and peace, against the Sith Empire. The Jedi Order of Dantooine, works so hard for don't allow the Sith Domination over Dantooine. but the price of that is to see than DJE has many detractors, many organizations and groups than don't see them with good eyes, often accused of being too aggressive with whom only represent the dominant power in the galaxy or the servants of the Sith Empire, DJE will not betray their principles and values as Jedi, they will not betray the will of the Force. The Jedi Order of Dantooine will be firm against the selfish desire of glory, power and domination over others, against the Sith Empire, than offers us a false peace, with the objective of eradicate the only ones than really can make to others challenge them, the Jedi.Organization  The Dantooine Jedi Enclave is a Jedi Order than is defined in the same standard hierarchy used by the Jedi Orders in the past, the leaders of the Jedi order are the DJE Council Masters, with them are defined the principles and values than govern the Jedi Order and their members, but, exist a difference with other Jedi Order structures, because in DJE, the Chamber of Jedi Knights and Masters work together, They Define and vote for each important matter than the Councils or the Jedi Order, needs to define for the future of DJE. The Jedi Order of Dantooine has defined the use of the rank called \"Jedi Quarton\" than represents a kind of Padawan in advanced training, ideal for special induction in the DJE Philosophy, for foreign Jedi, from other JEdi Orders, than decided to work and be apart of the Jedi of Dantooine. Exist in DJE, the advanced Jedi Paths, the DJE Knights needs to recieve an additional training, for to development skills in advanced JEdi Path or Advanced Classes, also exist a Jedi Master Leader for each Jedi Path, who determines and define the Advanced Jedi Training for each Jedi knight in each Jedi Path.Behind the scenes  Dantooine Jedi Enclave is a Dream, a project, than was launched, based in the concept of respect, friendship, and loyalty, a group of Jedi decided to build a dream, and after of a hard work, having good times and hard times, generation over generation, the esence of the Dantooine Family was the base of this community in SWRP.

She currently holds dual citizenship on Shili and the Republic and serves as Tython's Senator.Biography Early Life  Nasaji Senou\u00e9 Oba grew up much as any Togruta, learning to hunt and live off the land but also getting more intensive academic  schooling than many other Togruta children, as well. She often quarrelled with her brother Katarien, heir apparent to the Chieftainship of the Nacaal Tribe. At the age of 16 she severely embarrassed the older Katarien by saving him from a fierce akul by using a concussion grenade on the predator, causing her to earn the akul-tooth headdress he coveted for himself. This intensified their already existing sibling rivalry which continues into the present.University Days  Upon reaching the age of 17, Nasaji applied to a major university to earn degrees in planetology and xenology. As part of xenology coursework, she was required to live among a different species for two semesters and write a thesis based on her experiences and observations. Her options at the time were to stay aboard an Ithorian herdship or spend time on Zeltros. In the words of her professor, \"I recommend the Ithorians. If you spend time among Zeltrons you'll never get any work done.\" So she chose to live among the Ithorians during the programme. There she met another xenology student, a Pantoran male by the name of Baran Chuchi. The two quickly became friends. Friendship eventually blossomed into love and the pair even discussed marriage. But this was not to be. Nasaji was eventually recalled to Shili by her father and told that she was to become the leader of the tribe instead of her brother Katarien. She would also be required to eventually find a Togruta husband to produce an heir to the Chieftainship. When she asked her father why she had been chosen he replied, \"Unlike your brother, I know you don't want this role. And also unlike all your other siblings, this is because you see more than the benefits and prestige. You see this role as a huge responsibility. And this is why your are the only suitable heir.\" Bowing to her responsibilities, Nasaji tearfully told Baran that she would have to leave him and why. They parted ways and would not see each other again for several years. Baran was upset but understanding. He continued on with his degree progromme and eventually gained a doctorate.On Tattooine  After University, Nasaji spent some time on Tattooine, briefly running clandestine anti-slavery operations against Hutts, Rodians, and others while posing as a cantina dancer. It was during this period that she developed a mild distrust of humans even though many of the refugees she was trying to protect from \"scum and villainy\" were human themselves. Often they would remark on her outlandish attire and call her a \"half-naked savage\" behind her back...and sometimes even to her face. The local authorities would often have her followed, one time even foolishy sending a cloaked surveillance droid on her heels which she quickly spotted via the passive echolocation Togruta possess. However, her distrust of humans was tempered by sympathetic human Jedi and the gratitude of some of the humans she helped.Becoming Tribal Matron  Nasaji was on Tattooine when her father was assassinated by a Togruta renegade and Dark Jedi by the name of Nayanti Kai. At the time, she was searching for clues to the lost original copy of her tribe's religious scriptures. Upon becoming Tribal Matron, she vowed to contine her search for the Nacaal Apocrypha and eventually bring Kai to justice. She also instituted a policy of allowing non-Togruta to join her tribe providing they were willing to learn the tribe's ways and integrate into Togruta culture. She also abolished the practice of leaving disabled Togruta to fend for themselves, saying \"The Wookies, Ewoks, and Ithorians are as close to nature and the land as we are. But do they abandon their disabled and infirm? They do not. And neither will we.\" This angered quite a few traditionalists among her kind. Some would later whisper malicious gossip that her appointment to the post of Ambassador to Bothawui was partly to get her as far away from Shili as possible.Becoming An Ambassador  During this period, Nasaji was selected by the Vashee Dynasty of Shili to be her planet's Ambassador to Bothawui. On Bothawui, she was briefly reunited with Dr. Baran Chuchi, who had become a Councillor to the Bothans and still had feelings for her. She hoped to share intelligence data with the Bothan Spynet in regards to Sith activities after recovering the lost Nacaal Tribal Apocrypha and the Force-related prophecies written therein. During this time, she spent her few free hours on correspondence courses with the University of Sanbra in hopes of finally getting her doctorate in xenology/sentiology. Another noteworthy event during this time was her first encounter with Darth Marell on a routine diplomatic assessment to Vjun. Coincidentally, reporters Daana Kira and Rakiko Lowtide arrived shortly after Nasaji in hopes of getting an interview with Marell. Nasaji bristled inwardly with indignation at Marell's remarks to and about the two reporters. Especially Marell's speciesist comment referring to Rakiko as \"blue boy\" and his apparent flirting with Daana, which creeped her out greatly. When Marell told his lackeys to shoot \"blue boy\" only if he said anything wrong but to spare \"cute Daana\", Nasaji started smarting off to him in between his comments. Irritated, Darth Marell made some nasty remarks of his own to Nasaji while his men warned her that they might execute her if Marell gave the word. Nasaji simply laughed at Marell and his men, denouncing them as \"clowns\", \"goons\" and \"thugs\" and said she had enough data from the short conversation to complete her assessment, adding between laughs that it had been \"most educational\".The Bombing of Bothawui  The political situation on Bothawui had been unstable almost from the moment Nasaji began her tenure as an Ambassador. All sorts of intrigues were going on behind the scenes, from Bothan nationalism to a secret romance between Prime Minister Felina Sia and Drake Wade of the New Trade Federation. Bothawui was also attacked several times by Wade's forces, presumably because of his affair with Sia. Finally, after half a year as Amabassador, Bothawui was bombed from orbit by unknown attackers while Nasaji was offworld. Nasaji landed at Rhan'starm Port on Bothawui mere hours after the attack and surveyed the damage. also on the scene were members of the Grand Army of the Republic, the GAF, and Obie Solo. Nasaji then got worried that she might have left her unfinished doctoral thesis in her office in the government building, which was heavily bombed and still partially on fire. She rushed to her partially collapsed office and scurried around, checking for her work. As she did so, a gas pipe in the wall had started to build pressure as a release valve had been damaged during the bombing. It exploded with a great deal of concussive force, showering Nasaji with sharp bits of wood, metal, and other debris leving her a semi-conscious bloody mess. Troopers from the GAR, GAF, and Obie Solo rushed to the sound of the explosion along with Nasaji's Togruta friend, Tanya Kyrie who had just arrived in the port city with a bodyguard. A GAR trooper helped get her out of the ruined office and a member of the GAF named \"Drako\" loaded her onto a stretcher. The throng rushed Nasaji to the partially damaged medical facility near the Government Building. Drako and Tanya gave her emergency treatment in the form of modern medical techniques and Tanya's herbal paste to stop the bleeding. Obie Solo and her associates then evacuated Nasaji to Yavin IV for further treatment. In the ensuing days, a weird rumor erupted. Accoording to the rumor, the GAR were accusing the GAF and Obie Solo of kidnapping Nasaji. She got word of the rumor as she was landing on Bakura. She piloted her hoverchair down to the GAR headquarters to try and straighten things out. Instead, Drako of the GAF and several members of the GAR were shouting accusations at each other. Finally, somebody drew a weapon(Nasaji still isn't sure who) and Drako was shot by GAR troopers under the command of Col. Wraith...who told Nasaji she was free to leave and to have a good day. The incident caused such a stir in the upper echelons of the Republic that the Vice Chancellor asked her to give her account of what happened. The facts are still being sorted out.  Shortly before giving her account to the Vice Chancellor, Nasaji was withdrawn from Bothawui as Ambassador, her superiors citing the political instability on that world and the bombing by unknown forces as a threat to her safety.Skills and Languages  In addition to hunting, tracking, and trapping skills common to a Togruta hunter, Nasaji holds Master's Degrees in Planetology and Xenology, hoping one day to return to her studies and finally get her Doctorate in Xenology. She is an avid armchair historian, especially when it comes to the legends of her own species. Nasaji is an experienced diplomat, having many contacts and allies not only in the New Republic but also in Hutt Space, as well. She has some martial arts training with emphasis on knife and spear fighting techniques. She has demonstrated knowledge of basic Togruta first aid skills on more than one occasion. She also knows how to fire a blaster but has rarely done so in a pitched battle. Nasaji also knows how to play a few tunes on the flute. Nasaji has Togruti as her native language. She is fluent in Basic and has a fluent understanding of Ithorian but due to her vocal chord structure has a difficult time speaking it. She has a basic understanding of Pantoran owing to her time with Dr. Baran Chuchi, speaking it with a heavy Togrutish accent and often making comical mistakes in Pantoran conversation. Since arriving on Bothawui, Nasaji has taken it upon herself to learn the Bothan language and currently has a pidgin understanding of it.Weaknesses  Nasaji suffers from a medical condition known as alcohol intolerance. Her internal physiology cannot process any kind of wine, ale, or other alcoholic beverage making her very ill if she does so. According to her brother Katarien, Nasaji is prone to a personality defect which he describes as \"not knowing when to shut the kriff up.\"Personality and Traits  Fanatical, unorthodox yet traditionalist, judgmental, proud of her Togruta heritage even to the point of not caring if her ways make others mildly uncomfortable. She has been known to eat small animals raw in front of humans. She has a fondness for Ithorians, owing to her time she spent living among them.Equipment  As an Ambassador, Nasaji dresses in the traditional regalia of a tribal leader. She often conceals various electonic information devices in her cloak such as a datapad, holocube, and communicator. She usually goes unarmed unless expecting trouble, at which point she dons a blaster carbine and a dagger. She has also been known to carry a spear handed down to her by her father. Nasaji often carries a pouch filled with various medicinal herbs, tonics, and pastes prepared for her by the mystics of her tribe.Behind the Scenes  Nasaji was designed as a pastiche of two existing Star Wars characters: Shaak Ti and Princess Leia Organa-Solo. The look of the character was inspired by Shaak Ti's primitive tribal outfit she had in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed while her \"headstrong politician\" persona is modelled after that of Leia.", "Star Wars: The Old Republic Wiki": "Star Wars: The Old Republic Wiki Companion Character  Companions are non-player characters that the players are able to recruit to accompany them on their adventures. Each companion character has special skills that unlock over time as they level-up alongside the player character. Companions are able to fill the role for a group in a Flashpoint or group quest. They cannot be used in an Operation, however .Companion Roles  During a player's main storyline, they can obtain up to six companion characters at one time. \u00a0With the addition of Section X on Belsavis it's now possible for all classes to gain a seventh companion, HK-51, once they reach level 50. \u00a0Only one can accompany the player off the player's starship. Each of these companions can fill one of three roles for the player: Tank, DPS (Damage Per Second), or Healer. How those work for each companion varies. The Tank role can be either of the following: The DPS role can be either: Players gain a companion very early in the game. The roles can be changed at any time outside of combat or conversation, so each player can be accompanied by their preferred companion regardless of the role they need filled. Most of the time the player can switch companion any time outside of combat or conversation. However, there are some missions that require a specific companion to progress.Missions  Companions are able to do solo missions by themselves as assigned by the player. (For example, see Crafting below.) In addition, companion characters have quests for their own storyline. If the player chooses to complete a companion's quests, it can increase the influence level of that companion. This can result in rewards for the player or group that are unavailable through other routes.Customization  Equipment used by each companion is purely cosmetic, with one exception: A valid weapon has to be equipped to enable some of their abilities. Apart from that exception their equipment has no effect on gameplay. As well as being able to equip humanoid companions with a wide variety of apparel, the player can also customize the companion's physical appearance using \"appearance kits.\" These alterations include changing the companion's skin color and tattoos. Note that there are no outfits for companions \u2013 The companion has to be equipped with apparel for it to appear. In the game interface, a further distinction among companions is that other players' companions are anonymous to you, being titled only as \u201c[Player Name]\u2019s Companion,\u201d while your companion will display the full name. While these appearances help distinguish one player's experience from the others in the MMORPG, a feature with more direct impact is customizing behaviors. This lets the player specify which skills and abilities the companion should use and should avoid during combat. You can buy Companions Customization at several Companion Customization Vendors. These Companion Customizations can be equipped by opening your character sheet (default hotkey \"C\"), clicking on the companion tab, and then right clicking the customization in your inventory. For the Empire, the first known companion appearance vendor Wel-Nolan is on the planet Balmorra at the Sunken Sarlacc Cantina.Influence System  Companion characters will voice their perspectives from time to time, often giving information on current storylines and pointing out locations to visit. They may also try to influence the player's decisions. Likewise, the player will influence each companion. The player's Influence on each companion is stored as a rank and the number of points accrued toward the next rank. More influence points are required to reach each successive rank. Each companion has likes and dislikes that apparently don't change throughout the game and the player's influence upon them will be increased by conversation choices and other choices that the companion either approves of or disapproves of while they are present. Giving appropriate gifts to the companion can also progress the companion toward the next influence rank. Each companion has preferred gift types, which can change if the player manages to successfully romance the companion. Note however, that same sex companions can't be romanced, which reduces the efficiency of progressing the influence of some same sex companions.  Progression in the relationship can open new conversation options, new quests, and unexpected plot twists. For example, companions may reveal secrets about their real identity and background. A higher influence rank has the following effects, It: The points accrued toward the next rank have no direct effect on gameplay beyond that it indicates how many points are still needed to reach that next rank. It's notable that romance aspects are not required in order to play through a class storyline; however, they will likely add to the depth and tension of the narrative. As each companion acquires some influence ranks, lower rank gifts provide less influence with them. Quality of gift also change the value of influence given.Crafting  Companions can be used to help craft, gather, and engage in missions. The basic gathering task of gathering out of nodes can be delegated to the companion currently with the player character. The default button for this is to right click on the node. The Preferences menu can be used to change this. More extensively, as part of the Crew Skills crafting system, companions are able go on gathering assignments anywhere depending on the level your gathering skill.Level Restrictions  Several companions can be sent on crew missions at one time, however keep in mind, that the simultaneous usage of them is restricted as followed:External Videos External Links Classes  These are the eight playable classes currently available in Star Wars: The Old Republic.Sith Inquisitor  This is a disambiguation page\u2014a navigational aid that lists other pages that might otherwise share the same title.

Jedi Knight may refer to:Bounty Hunter  The Bounty Hunter class focuses on tracking down and, typically, capturing or killing people for credits (whichever pays more or occasionally the said hunter has morals). It is one of the classes aligned with the Sith Empire that is not Force-sensitive (but through the legacy system you can have Force sensitive abilities). Famous Bounty Hunters include Shae Vizla.Description  Hunter, seeker, killer for hire Countless enemies stand in the way of the Sith Empire\u2019s drive for domination. The Empire spares no expense eliminating these threats, offering massive bounties to employ the galaxy\u2019s most lethal hunters. Earning a death mark from the Empire means a life spent in fear, constantly looking over one\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s never a question if a Bounty Hunter will find you\u2026 only when. Both infamous and anonymous at the same time, Bounty Hunters are far more than mercenaries for hire\u2014they\u2019re heirs to a professional legacy\u2014an ancient brotherhood with a glorious history. Tracking elusive targets across multiple star systems requires expertise, especially when the targets can be prominent, powerful, and often prepared for confrontation. Thrill seekers from all walks of life set out to become Bounty Hunters, but only the most hard-boiled survive in this competitive and deadly business. The Bounty Hunter\u2019s path lies along the edge\u2014the stakes are always high\u2014and the path only leads two places, to a life of infamous glory\u2026 or to a quick and ignominious death. Imperial Relations Though the Empire disapproves of the Bounty Hunters\u2019 fierce independence, exceptions are made for those who get results. Few individuals in the galaxy have the gall and the stomach to deliver on the delicate and grim tasks in which Bounty Hunters excel. Nonetheless, no one is irreplaceable in the Empire, and even the most proficient must repeatedly prove their worth. In the bounty business, one\u2019s name is everything, and with each mark a Bounty Hunter takes down, his reputation grows, as does his price. Affiliations and Loyalties Bounty Hunters are far from a homogeneous lot\u2014they come from all races and affiliations and each pursues his quarry in his own unique way. Some Bounty Hunters adhere to the rugged Mandalorian code of honor while others answer only to their own moral compass. Some work only on behalf of organizations they agree with, while others have no sense of loyalty. Despite being kindred spirits, fellow Bounty Hunters cannot always be trusted\u2014among the profession\u2019s most notorious members, competition turns colleagues into the most ruthless of enemies. Even the Bounty Hunters\u2019 employers harbor hidden agendas; the tables are turned quickly when complications arise\u2026 and they always do. Shifting allegiances, unbeatable odds, and deadly showdowns are common in the occurrences in the life of a Bounty Hunter. Field Reconnaissance Bounty Hunters come and go as they wish across the galaxy, some working alone, others in groups. Though not uncommon for them to pursue targets in the core worlds, the majority of any Bounty Hunter\u2019s work takes place in the Outer Rim where wary and elusive targets often seek places where they can 'drop off the radar'. Outfitting Preparation is the Bounty Hunter\u2019s best defense, and cutting-edge protective gear is standard equipment for most Bounty Hunters. Artisans spend months and even years hand-crafting the Bounty Hunters\u2019 heavy armor to ensure it offers superior resistance to all manner of weaponry, and that each suit will still allow maximum flexibility and versatility. Offense is just as critical as defense, however, and powerful weaponry is necessary for any Bounty Hunter who might have to shoot his way out of a messy situation. It\u2019s not unheard of for a Bounty Hunter to spend as many credits on an advanced blaster as others might spend to purchase an entire starship. Combat Tactics Whether working for credits or principle, the Bounty Hunter pursues his targets with dogged determination and methodical precision. Bounty Hunters are renowned for their versatility on the battlefield and their ability to go toe-to-toe with Force-users. Their legendary abilities in this arena have earned them the nickname \"Jedi Killers\". Whoever they must face, however, the Bounty Hunter comes armed with the most-advanced weaponry on the black market, packing heavy firepower but always keeping a variety of tricks and gadgets ready to go Always prepared to change tactics on the fly, the Bounty Hunter\u2019s arsenal includes a powerful twitch-action jetpack, allowing the Bounty Hunter to shoot into the air and unleash a hail of blaster-fire. Bounty Hunters are \u201cearly adopters\u201d for the most advanced weapons technologies. They have both the credits and the opportunities to experiment with all manner of gadgets. Though almost always handy with blasters, Bounty Hunters also keep tricks up their sleeve such as a wrist mounted missile launcher. No matter how much planning and strategy is done before an assault, close-quarters combat is often unavoidable. Fortunately, Bounty Hunters are equipped with the gear to burn anyone or anything that decides to get too close.Species  These species are available to the Bounty Hunter:Advanced Classes Powertech Mercenary Companions  Below is a table that shows the companions available to the Bounty Hunter and what gifts they like. \"XXX\" denotes a favorite gift (major rewards). \"XX\" denotes a lovable gift (medium reward). \"X\" denotes a likable gift (minor rewards). \"O\" denotes no likability (no reward). 1. Mako: Acquired on Hutta. 2. 2V-R8: Acquired after finishing Dromund Kaas. 3. Gault: Acquired after finishing Tatooine. 4. Torian Cadera: Acquired after finishing Taris. 5. Blizz: Acquired after finishing Hoth. 6. Skadge: Acquired after finishing Belsavis.Abilities  Due to the often dangerous status of Bounty Hunters' targets, a Bounty Hunter must be prepared for anything that is thrown their way, from blaster bolts to lightsabers. A Bounty Hunters' primary weapon is their ever-present blaster, which is their main offensive. The Bounty Hunter is primarily a ranged class; doing it's best damage from far away and keeping out of range of powerful melee weapons. In addition to their blasters, Bounty Hunters also carry compact rockets, flamethrowers, explosive darts and missiles inside their armor. Bounty Hunters unique resource system is heat. Most abilities the Bounty Hunter uses will generate heat inside their armor, with more heat being generated the stronger the ability is. When the Bounty Hunter reaches 100 Heat, they will be unable to use any abilities that generate heat until their heat level dissipates. There are several talents that reduce the heat cost of abilities, and increase the rate that heat dissipates. While heat dissipates fastest out of combat, when the Bounty Hunter is in combat, the longer they go without using heat-generating abilities, the faster their heat will dissipate. Your heat dissipates faster at lower heat levels. As your heat builds, so does the time it takes to dissipate that heat. To maintain a low heat level, use Rapid Shots regularly to allow your heat to dissipate.Starship  The D5-Mantis Patrol Craft is the starship that all Bounty Hunters are awarded. This ship is gained after finishing the Dromund Kaas storyline, during which your handler for the Great Hunt tells you to steal a ship for the Hunt itself, as part of an old tradition. The Bounty Hunter is then required to break into the hangar the Mantis is housed in, defeat the deck hands around it and take off in the stolen vessel. The Mantis is a powerful attack spacecraft, built to match the attack power and speed of larger vessels, but with less space. This would result in a cramped, uncomfortable interior for the ship's crew, however the designers have made good use of vertical space and small bulkheads to give the ship a very large and open-feeling inside. The Mantis' unique feature are the three extendable engines on \"limbs\" that stretch out from the bottom and both sides of the ship. These engines are folded in for landing, and are re-extended when the Mantis takes off. Two of the three primary blaster cannons are mounted on the left and right limbs of the Mantis, while the third is placed underneath the main cockpit.External links Species  There are hundreds of sentient species spread throughout the galaxy. Only a fraction of them will appear in the game. For a list of non-sentient species, see: Bestiary.Playable species  There are a number of species that the player may choose from for their character. So far, Chiss, Cyborg, Humans, Miraluka, Mirialan, Rattataki, Sith Pureblood, Twi'leks, Zabrak, Cathar (first announced during E3 2012 and made available in Game Update 2.1) and Togruta (implemented in the 3.3 Game Update titled 'Grand Togruta Celebration) are available as playable races. The Human, Zabrak and Cyborg species are available for all playable classes for free-to-play players. All others must be purchased one way or another, whether that be through the Cartel Market, or through purchasing subscriber status. The chart below shows which species are available for each class by default for subscribers. The Cathar and Togruta are only available through the Cartel Market, and makes it available across an entire account on purchase. However, all other species are also available through the Cartel Market in Species Legacy Unlocks, which allow you to create more than one character per species if you have a Legacy at a Level 10 or higher.\u00a0Playable Class/Species Combinations  Subscribing players have all initial species unlocked, but different species have different limitations as to which ones can be used for different classes. If a species is unlocked for a specific legacy, then that species is unlocked for all classes. For example, the Cathar, when purchased from the Cartel Market, is unlocked, account-wide, for all classes. But a subscriber only has access to certain species when creating certain classes (see the chart below). If a character of a specific species is created and leveled to level 50, the species will then be available at character creation for any class in that legacy, even if subscription was ended/expired. Once a species is unlocked as so, the following chart will not apply to what class they can play as.Other species  The majority of species in The Old Republic are not playable, but some will be available as companions to the player.Imperial Agent  The Imperial Agent is one of the four Empire-aligned classes and is one of two non-Force users in this faction.Description  Assassin, Saboteur, the Empire\u2019s Secret Weapon The Empire dominates scores of star systems across the galaxy, but not through the power of the dark side alone. Behind the scenes, the cunning Agents of Imperial Intelligence track down and eliminate the Empire\u2019s enemies\u2014from intractable Republic senators to traitorous Imperial Moffs to bloodthirsty rebels with Republic ties. Imperial Agents must master the arts of infiltration, seduction, and assassination to advance the Empire\u2019s causes; they face the opposition of a terrified galaxy and the capriciousness of their own Sith overlords. Imperial Intelligence cultivates a notoriously vast and efficient network of informants, enabling the Agent to navigate the galaxy\u2019s political landscape with effortless suave. Naturally, the Agent\u2019s allegiance to the Empire is without question, but great latitude exists for those so closely attuned to the Empire\u2019s secret agendas\u2014Agents often harbor their own mysterious motivations as well. Having pierced countless layers of intrigue, these spies know of conspiracies within conspiracies. Even close contacts find it hard to predict what an Imperial Agent will do until it\u2019s done. The most elite operative within Imperial Intelligence is the \u2018Cipher\u2019 Agent\u2014recruited and trained to carry out the most dangerous and sensitive assignments the Empire has to offer. Whether working undercover or carrying out assignments in broad daylight, the Cipher races along the razor\u2019s edge of disaster, using carefully orchestrated tactics that leave little room for error\u2014the smallest slip-up can be catastrophic. Each successful mission, however, shifts the galactic landscape in the Empire\u2019s favor, and the Agent plays a supremely critical role in securing Imperial domination. Relations with the Sith The upper echelons of Imperial society are reserved for the Force-sensitive Sith alone, but theirs is a world apart. The heart of the Empire consists of millions of subjects, descendants of the original exiles who settled Dromund Kaas. For these loyal citizens, the Imperial Agent is the exemplar of the highest level of achievement one might aspire to. These are the people the Agent risks everything to protect. Though there are few idealists in Imperial Intelligence, the art of professional perfection is held in deep reverence, and the Agent embodies the Imperial ideal in this respect. Field Reconnaissance Reconnaissance images of Imperial Agents are rare; between their varied disguises and stealth enhanced battle-gear, they can be hard to spot. If there is anything remarkable about their habits, patterns, and appearances it\u2019s that they can change at any time. Many of the tasks set before the Imperial Agent call for a high degree of subversion and infiltration into hostile organizations, so it\u2019s a safe bet that if they aren\u2019t with their friends, they\u2019re probably with their enemies. Outfitting The Empire risks everything on the Imperial Agent\u2019s performance and spares no expense to make sure Agents\u2019 gear is as smart as they are. State-of-the-art attire with high-grade armor mesh provides protection and ease-of-movement. Many of the Agent\u2019s outfits are augmented with advanced communications technology and attachments to facilitate interfacing with varied computer networks and security systems. Combat Tactics Relying on range, surprise, and an arsenal of state-of-the-art gadgets and weaponry, the Imperial Agent enters battle with a confident strategy. Though striking from a distance or from the shadows plays to the Agent\u2019s strengths, a well-equipped operative is more than capable of evading his enemies when necessary or moving in close to quietly slide a blade between an opponent\u2019s ribs. Whether on a solo mission or working in conjunction with a strike team, this operative keeps a finger on the right button for almost any situation. In the heat of battle, the Imperial Agent can activate a field of energy to protect from oncoming blasterfire. From the relative safety of cover, the Imperial Agent capitalizes on the element of surprise, using a stun dart to paralyze his foe and finishing with a targeted laser attack. Orbital Bombardment allows the Imperial Agent to call in a satellite air strike to rain down lasers and missiles on an unsuspecting group of enemies.Species  These species are available to the Imperial Agent:Advanced Classes Operative Sniper Companions  Order of companions: Below is a table that shows the companions available to the Imperial Agent and what gifts they like. \"XXX\" denotes a favorite gift (major rewards). \"XX\" denotes a lovable gift (medium reward). \"X\" denotes a likeable gift (minor rewards). \"O\" denotes no likeability (no reward).Abilities  The Imperial Agent's abilities are focused on engaging enemies at range with rifles and a variety of thrown weapons. They can also use a cover system to increase their evasion and activate additional high-powered attacks. While all Imperial Agents have abilities used from cover, Snipers gain the most by using this system. Snipers use a variety of probes in combat as well as choosing to use a Sniper Rifle to maximize damage from long range. The Operative uses a Blaster Rifle along with a Vibro-Knife to deal damage from Mid to Melee range and a stealth system to stay hidden. Operatives also bring a Kolto Injector into combat to heal allies and companions. The Imperial Agent utilizes an energy resource system. Energy is used to activate certain abilities that will cause an additional effect such as increased damage or a crowd contorl effect. Energy regenerates fairly quickly even in combat but it is important to pace the energy out incase something unexpected occurs and it will be possible to counter. Energy management is essential for both the Operative and Sniper Advanced Classes. Your energy pool's regeneration rate is dependent on your total amount. In other words, the more Energy you have, the more it regenerates. The less you have, the longer it takes to regenerate. It is important to find a balance between skill usage and managing your energy pool. Using your biggest and most powerful abilities will not sustain your damage (as a Sniper) nor your ability to heal your party members over a long period of time.Starship  The X-70B Phantom-Class Prototype is an advanced prototype vessel and the result of revisions to traditional Imperial starship design theory, incorporating concepts and technologies gathered over the years of the Great War. The X-70B far surpasses the capabilities of current starship mass production techniques, ensuring the vessel will only be entrusted to those carrying out missions vital to the Empire.Trivia External links Sith Warrior  This is a disambiguation page\u2014a navigational aid that lists other pages that might otherwise share the same title.

They are placed throughout the worlds for the players to find, usually in hard to reach places. Although some of these items are hidden from view, spotting other datacrons may be relatively easy, as they give off an extraordinarily bright glow from a distance. Even with these more visible items, though, reaching the datacron will typically entail extra exploration and navigation problem-solving. The true challenge with datacrons ironically, is not usually finding them but actually figuring out how to get to them, especially since some are hidden in elaborate and complex logic puzzles. As a reward for this exploration ingenuity, if a player successfully reaches and interacts with certain datacrons, one of the player's character stats will be increased -- permanently.[1] The player also gains a Codex entry, usually pertaining to the Infinite Empire[2], the creators of the datacrons, and the history of the galaxy up to the point in which the game takes place. Some Datacrons required specific events to get, as they give a lot more stats. Here can be seen an example.Variations  There are many different kinds of datacrons, each kind giving a different statistic boost, and each one of these different variations also has a different color to go with it. A datacrons statistic boost can range from +2 to +10, depending on the type and the planet. There are also datacrons that don't give a statistic boost at all, but in fact give a special item called a Matrix Shard. So far, matrix shards are known to be, but not limited to:Use  Both the Empire and the Republic have their own respective Matrix Assembler and Disassembler for players to use. The Assembler is fairly straightforward. You insert 3 matrix shards in whatever color combination you desire into the 3 slots on the machine, and assemble it into a Matrix Cube. The Disassembler is slightly less user-friendly, as it requires a power core for each separate use. These power cores can only be obtained from junk vendors on various planets, known vendors that sell a core are:Matrix Cubes  Matrix Cubes function as relic-type items, and are equipped as a part of the player's gear that grants a passive stat boost. Depending on the color combination, the Matrix Cube will give a different statistic boost and will also vary in level requirement. The level requirement has no relation to the current level of the player assembling the cube, but rather the colors of the three shards. There are four tiers of cubes at levels 15, 24, 32, 50 [3]. Though it's not always the case, usually the more of a single color shard in a cube the higher level it is. Therefore a cube made with Red, Blue, and Yellow, some of the first colors acquirable, you will have a very low-level cube.

They start on the planet of Ord Mantell. Famous Troopers include Harron Tavus and Jace Malcom.Description  Honor, Duty, Defense of the Republic Not all heroes carry Lightsabers. Some just have the will to fight. For decades, the armed forces of the Galactic Republic defended their civilization against the seemingly unstoppable Sith Empire. Despite countless setbacks, the men and women of the Republic military never backed down until the Senate ordered them to do so. These brave souls remain ready and willing to lay their lives on the line today. In the wake of the Treaty of Coruscant, the Republic military has begun recruiting from within its own ranks, creating cutting-edge Special Forces squads for the inevitable day when the war with the Sith Empire begins anew. These advanced strike teams are comprised of only the most talented and disciplined soldiers\u2014a new breed of elite Republic Troopers. These Troopers are the embodiment of the Republic military\u2019s highest aspirations\u2014the most advanced fighting force in the galaxy. They are equipped to face any foe in any environment, but it\u2019s not their gear that makes them tough\u2014it\u2019s their guts. The Troopers\u2019 greatest weapons are their indomitable spirit, their unwavering sense of duty and their undying loyalty to each other and to the ideals that the Republic represents. In this age, the stakes have never been higher. The Republic must win or face extinction. The fate of the galaxy rests upon ordinary men becoming extraordinary heroes. This is the path of the Republic Trooper. Relations with the Jedi The Knights of the Jedi Order have defended the Republic for generations, but they have not fought alone. A host of unsung heroes have marched at the Jedi\u2019s side\u2014common men courageous enough to enlist and face the same risks as their Jedi comrades despite not having access to the Jedi powers of protection. These heroes have not gone unappreciated by the Jedi. The men and women of the Republic military are accorded complete respect and admiration by the Order and by the Republic\u2019s political leaders. In the years since the Treaty of Coruscant, the Jedi have withdrawn in significant numbers to their homeworld of Tython. Their presence in the Republic military, though still significant, is not what it was during the war. In many ways, the Republic\u2019s newly-trained elite Troopers have stepped up to take charge of the Republic\u2019s defenses. When Troopers are partnered with the Jedi, they are a force to be reckoned with on any battlefield. Field Reconnaissance Deployed to the hairiest battlefields in the galaxy, Republic Troopers generally travel in small, specialized squads. It is not uncommon, however, to see a Trooper engaging enemies on his or her own. Whether operating solo or in groups, members of the Republic Special Forces have become intimidating opponents to their enemies. Outfitting The Republic\u2019s experiments with a new generation of heavy blaster rifles have proven successful, sparking a galaxy-wide trend towards larger, more powerful and more versatile armaments. It takes a great deal of strength and training, however, to wield these war machines, so they\u2019re rarely used outside the military. Republic engineers have also worked overtime fashioning new defensive gear for the Republic\u2019s most elite soldiers, armor suits that provide maximum protection and flexibility in multiple environments. Combat Tactics Whether fighting as part of a small strike squad or at the forefront of a larger force, the Trooper can unleash unrivaled firepower against his enemies. A Trooper\u2019s rifle is his best friend, and the military is constantly challenged to design faster, more powerful and more reliable blaster rifles every year. Wielding such rifles and wearing protective battle armor designed by the Republic\u2019s top engineers, the Trooper will not hesitate to step right into the crossfire. Whether storming a base or a battlefield, the Trooper charges into the fight, blaster-rifle blazing, to clear a path for freedom and justice. Though the Trooper\u2019s tactical strengths tend to rely on ranged technology and superior firepower, standard training involves lengthy exercises in close-quarters combat. A slam to the face from a cortosis-reinforced rifle stock is a very effective melee maneuver. In addition to the arsenal of attacks available to the Trooper using his rifle, standard Trooper equipment often includes a number of sticky grenades. Nearly impossible to remove, these explosives unerringly dispose of the target and anyone standing nearby. Taking full advantage of the modern rifle\u2019s versatile attachments, the Trooper can launch a high-powered grenade that explodes on impact, incapacitating a single target.Species  These species are available to the Trooper:Advanced Classes Commando Vanguard Companions  Below is a table that shows the companions available to the Trooper and what gifts they like. \"XXX\" denotes a favorite gift (major rewards). \"XX\" denotes a lovable gift (medium reward). \"X\" denotes a likable gift (minor rewards). \"O\" denotes no likability (no reward). Order of companions:Class Missions Abilities  The Trooper uses various heavy weapons ranging from laser rifles to two-handed heavy cannons. The Troopers focus on heavy blaster rifles and a range of grenades and quick melee attacks. The resource for their abilities is Energy Cells which recharges at a rate based off how much ammo is currently in your weapon (3/4 ammo recharges 75% speed, half =50% speed, etc) and can be quickly recharged with the ability Fast Reload. Your energy cells regenerate faster at higher energy levels. As your energy cells deplete, so does the rate at which they regenerate. To maintain a high level of energy cells, use Hammer Shot regularly to allow your energy cells to regenerate The Trooper can be specialized to deal substantial DPS (Damage Per Second), but can also serve as a group's primary tank due to their armor and large amount of health. They can also act as main healers through the Commando's Combat Medic tree. The Trooper's main stats are Aim and Endurance. Aim increases the ranged damage of the trooper, and Endurance increases the trooper's hit points.Trivia External links Smuggler  The Smuggler is one of the four Galactic Republic-aligned playable classes. Along with the Trooper, Smugglers do not rely on the Force itself to get things done, only their guts and guns. Famous Smugglers include Captain Nico Okarr.Description  Quick, Clever, Answers to No One Sometimes luck is more important than skill, but it never hurts to have both. Lawlessness has become common in the wake of the devastating war between the Republic and Empire. Shifting political allegiances and marauding pirates have made independent space travel a dangerous enterprise. Cut off from traditional supply routes, entire star systems waver on the verge of collapse. An adventurous spirit who\u2019s not afraid to break a few rules can make a handsome profit hauling cargo to these hotspots, but it requires fast reflexes, fast wits and a fast draw with a blaster. Even then, the life of a Smuggler is always a gamble. Stacking up enemies as fast as they stack up credits, Smugglers only survive in this galaxy by being slick, sneaky and street-smart. Whether sweet-talking an attractive alien or bargaining with a hardened criminal contact, the Smuggler\u2019s charm is a notorious asset, and often the ticket to turning around a deteriorating situation. If circumstances get too complicated, though, count on a Smuggler to always have an escape plan. Experienced in flying under the radar, Smugglers are amazingly elusive. Yet when backed into a corner, they quickly become cunning and often deadly combatants. Above all else, Smugglers make their own destinies. Despite their affinity for credits, Smugglers have been known to turn down lucrative opportunities when the clients have demanded too much control. Some Smugglers are even more discriminating\u2014refusing to work with slavers and representatives of the Sith Empire. It\u2019s a business where one is always looking for trustworthy allies, but they are often few and far between. Whether running an Imperial blockade or shooting down a double-crossing gangster, Smugglers are always flying by the seat of their pants. Every deal carries the chance for wealth beyond their wildest dreams\u2026 or an anonymous death in the harsh void of space. Relations with the Republic Faced with choosing an allegiance in these uncertain times, Smugglers have been forced to consider the implications of trying to operate under the tight controls imposed by the Sith Empire. Though never the most patriotic members of Republic society, many Smugglers have decided that siding with the Republic is siding with freedom, and of course, freedom is everything. The Republic has never indulged a systematic prejudice against Smugglers. Generally speaking, they have more commonly tangled with laws and law enforcement measures from specific star systems, not the greater Republic. Thus, it has not been overly difficult for the Jedi and the Republic military to accept Smugglers as allies in resisting the growing dominance of the Sith Empire. Field Reconnaissance As smart and stealthy as Smugglers might be, surveillance recording from various spaceports and secured warehouses has captured them in the act. These images highlight their ability to adapt to almost any situation. They\u2019re careful and cunning when sneaking into enemy territory, but when caught in the open, whether bluffing or gambling, they appear comfortable staging a courageous stand. Outfitting They don\u2019t wear fancy armor or carry high-powered blaster rifles, but Smugglers are outfitted for action nonetheless. Wearing comfortable, flexible clothing with some custom modifications, Smugglers are able to stay light on their feet and quick on the draw. Usually carrying a fast-firing blaster or two, Smugglers have everything they need to shoot their way out of trouble. Though style is rarely their intent, it seems to come naturally to Smugglers, and their dashing duds generally complement their roguish charm. Combat Tactics The Smuggler\u2019s approach to fighting is guileful and improvisational. Preferring to tip the odds in their favor from the start, Smugglers often rely on the element of surprise, using stealth and trickery to catch opponents off guard. Despite the sly tactics, they are more than capable of holding their own in a fair fight. Fast on the draw and a crack shot with a blaster, Smugglers tend to shoot first and be the last ones standing. Rather than relying on movement-impairing heavy armor, the Smuggler uses nimble footwork and the environment for defensive advantage. Shooting from reflex and instinct, the Smuggler is still a crack shot from any angle. Primarily designed to stun or incapacitate a target for a quick getaway, the tricks of the Smuggler\u2019s trade can also be used to buy a minute for a more carefully aimed, and often quite lethal, head shot. Quick, reckless, and unfailingly lucky, the smuggler can pop out from cover to fire a flurry of blaster bolts at multiple enemies. This maneuver breaks the enemies\u2019 charge and provides cover fire to allow the smugglers\u2019 allies time to set up a coordinated counter-attack.Species  These species can be played as a Smuggler: (And any other legacy species unlocked via cartel market or gtn or legacy system)Advanced Classes Gunslinger  The Gunslinger focuses on ranged combat using dual pistols. The Saboteur spec focuses on various explosives. He relies on delayed damage and random variations more than the Sharpshooter, but in an extended fight has the potential to do amazing damage. The Sharpshooter spec uses specialized direct shots to attack. The damage is extremely predictable, while not quite as high as the Saboteur. Sharpshooters also tend to have more frontload, meaning they do a lot of their damage at the start of the fight rather than ramping up to it. The Dirty Fighting spec is the opposite, relying on periodic damage and debuffs to truly maximize its output. While the Sharpshooter will have more frontload, a fight that carries out for more than the first rotation of abilities will tend to favor the Dirty Fighter, and the advantage ramps up the longer the fight goes on. Whichever specialization you choose, the Gunslinger is one of the few cases of a pure class. You do damage, lots of it, and nothing else. You can focus your entire rotation of abilities on bringing the most DPS to bear against your opponents, and nothing else. Get to know a couple tanks and healers though. As much fun as the class is solo, it's even more fun in a group.Scoundrel  The Scoundrel focuses on close- to medium-ranged combat, as well as healing. All Scoundrels are stealthers, which makes them play MUCH different than the short/med range Troopers, even though they don't look so different on paper. The Scoundrel can specialize into either Sawbones which focuses on healing, or Scrapper whose skills favor melee range with some short range also, or Ruffian which favors short range with some melee range thrown in. Keeping in mind that all three specializations hold onto the abilities common to all Smugglers. While the advanced abilities tend to be stronger, there is always the baseline to fill in the gaps. As a healer, the Sawbones is always welcome in a group. The Smuggler abilities will leave you the ability to run solo occasionally, but you'll never feel like a champ doing damage. The Scrapper is really at his best when he opens the fight from a stealthed attack at point blank range. There are longer range abilities, but they're not your payday. The Ruffian won't deliver the big hits the same way the Scrapper does, but with more mid range attacks is a little less dependent on the melee range opener. Don't assume that melee is a problem, but you're not designed to take big hits the way a Trooper is. Regardless of specialization, the Scoundrel is going to have MANY abilities to track and will be very busy in a fight. Learning to bring as many of those to your group as possible will mean the class is just as challenging at 60 as it was at 11.Companions  Below is a table showing the companions available to the Smuggler and what gifts they like. \"XXX\" denotes a favorite gift (major rewards). \"XX\" denotes a lovable gift (medium reward). \"X\" denotes a likeable gift (minor rewards). \"O\" denotes no likeability (no reward). 1. Corso Riggs: Acquired on Ord Mantell. 2. C2-N2: Acquired on Coruscant. 3. Bowdaar: Acquired on Nar Shaddaa. 4. Risha: Acquired after finishing Chapter 1. 5. Akaavi Spar: Acquired on Balmorra. 6. Guss Tuno: Acquired on Hoth.Abilities  Smugglers focus on single handed blasters and a clever cover mechanic. Some abilities are only usable from cover, so it is necessary that the player become acquainted with it quickly. All Smugglers are able to deal a good amount of damage, and the Scoundrel class is able to heal, but none of the skill trees provide the ability for a Tank role in group play. The resource for their abilities is Energy. The smuggler starts off with 100 energy and it does not increase naturally (Although some skills can raise it by a small amount). Your energy regenerates faster at higher energy levels. As your energy decreases, so does the rate at which it recovers. To maintain a high amount of energy, use Flurry of Bolts regularly to allow your energy to recover.Starship  The Corellian XS Stock Light Freighter is a freighter built for speed and to transport cargo securely. It is equipped with a standard laser, torpedo batteries and mounted turrets. The XS Freighter is one of the fastest ships in the galaxy and featured several ways to secretly store cargo, making it ideal for smugglers.Armor  Smugglers can utilize light and medium armor, preferring flexible clothing for maximum agility and instead relying on its environnement and the assistance of a group for cover. Their clothing is often heavily customized with modifications and upgrades.External Links Jaesa Willsaam  Jaesa Willsaam is a female companion for the Sith Warrior class. She joins the player after Alderaan at the end of Chapter 1 of the Sith Warrior Storyline. Jaesa is also a possible romance for the male Dark Side Sith Warrior.Background  Born on the idyllic planet of Alderaan to servants of House Organa, Jaesa Willsaam was raised in a life of relative privilege. Though she was not a member of Alderaanian nobility, her family\u2019s position within one of the more esteemed Houses allowed her the opportunity to intermingle with the social elite. As she got older, Jaesa discovered that she possessed a gift; she could see the true nature of anyone, and learn of their true intentions. When Jaesa was chosen to be the personal handmaiden to an ambitious, yet deceitful aristocrat, she discovered the lies and hypocrisy that tainted Alderaan politics. Disgusted with the deception, Jaesa grew tired of Alderaan politics and began to question her future. Around this time she also met the Jedi Master Nomen Karr. Master Karr sensed in Jaesa a strong connection to the Force, and believed that with the proper training and tutelage, she could become a powerful Jedi. When he offered to take her under his guidance and train her in the ways of the Jedi, Jaesa leapt at the opportunity to see the galaxy and put her faith in something that represented everything Alderaan\u2019s high society was not. Jaesa holds to the ideals of the Jedi with complete conviction, and has dedicated herself fully to the Jedi code. Yet, because of her skepticism from a lifetime of being surrounded by deceit and treachery, her complete faith in the Jedi teachings could lead to a great fall if she were to ever question them\u2026Sith Warrior Story  When Darth Baras and Sith Warrior discovered through a Republic spy about Jaesa, though not gaining her identity at that time, Baras sends Warrior to track her down. By following leads of her early life on Tatooine and Alderaan, Jaesa eventually intends to meet with the Warrior in an attempt to convince the Warrior to abandon his task. However, Nomen Karr interferes, and the meeting doesn't happen. Later, Nomen Karr tries to meet Baras face to face on Hutta, but Baras sends Warrior in his stead. The Warrior and Karr do battle, and during the battle Karr succumbs to his darker side. This alerts Jaesa to her master with the intention to help, although Karr gave Jaesa a direct order not to come, no matter what. When Jaesa arrives Karr is devastated as is Jaesa, because the Warrior is keeping him in chains. Jaesa is unsure what she should do, and eventually she attacks the Warrior. However, Warrior defeats her, but much to Jaesa's surprise, Warrior doesn't kill her. Warrior reasons this by saying that killing Jaesa would be putting her skills to waste. After this, depending on conversation choices, the Warrior can either corrupt Jaesa to the dark side, or just recruit her to the Warrior's cause, remaining on the light side. If Warrior chooses dark side, Warrior does it by ordering her to use her ability on Nomen Karr. Jaesa had never used it on him, and through the ability Jaesa senses that he was not the man she thought. Angered by this, she turns to Warrior and Warrior takes her as an apprentice. Warrior's first order to Jaesa is to kill her former master, which she does without any hesitation. Finally feeling as a person she was meant to be, Jaesa joins her new master with pleasure.Companion Missions Codex Entry  As a Sith Warrior companion, Jaesa Willsaam is listed in the in-game Codex as a Persons of Note for Sith Warrior's.External Videos External Links Nadia Grell  Nadia Grell is a female companion of the Jedi Consular. She is a padawan for the Consular and one can have a romantic storyline with her. She wields a double-bladed lightsaber in combatBackground  Young, wide-eyed and eternally curious about her surroundings, Nadia Grell is eager to see everything that the galaxy has to offer. Growing up on the remote forest world of Sarkhai, the Senator's daughter was always treated differently by the other children. But as Nadia aged, strange things began to happen in her life, and soon rumors began to spread among the population that the girl had strange, mystic-like abilities which were rarely spoken of and seen even less so amongst her people. Shunned by her friends and silently feared by her people, Nadia became shielded by her father. While many would have lashed out, Nadia saw it as an opportunity to learn about the intricacies of diplomacy. Before long, Nadia was serving as her father's personal assistant during trade negotiations. When her father left Sarkhai to meet with Republic representatives, Nadia was insistent that she accompany him. While this was a golden opportunity for Nadia to satiate her endless curiosity, her father hopes that by bringing Nadia with him, he may find a way for her to control her incredible abilities.Biography  Nadia Grell was born on the planet Sarkhai and was the daughter of Republic senator Tobas Grell. At a young age she exhibited abilities that showed her to be force-sensitive, something very unusual for her race and was thus looked on by her people as something unnatural. The Jedi consular first meets her via the Holo Communicator when she explains that the ship she's on, the Fortitude, has been taken over by Sith.Companion Missions External Links Vette  Vette, born Ce'na, is the first companion character for the Sith Warrior class. Vette can eventually lead into a romantic storyline with the male Sith Warrior.Background  Few people have seen as much of the galaxy as Vette and few have had as little control of their destiny. Vette was separated from her family at an early age and sold to a series of minor crime lords. When legendary pirate lord Nok Drayen utterly destroyed her latest owner's holdings, Vette and the other slaves were given their choice of freedom or joining up with Nok. Vette became a pirate, travelling the known worlds and learning to get in and out of places she wasn't allowed. Years later Nok Drayen mysteriously and suddenly released all of his people from service. Vette was left on Nar Shaddaa where she joined up with other young, idealistic Twi'leks and used her criminal abilities to rob and ruin those who exploited Ryloth's cultural artifacts and people. An unquenchable spark, Vette is older than her years but far from mature, delighting in silly pranks and always ready to laugh at people who think too much of themselves.Biography  Vette first meets the Sith Warrior while a prisoner on Korriban. Despite her situation, which includes constant berating and torturing from the jailer, Vette's humorous personality is still very prominent. When she is freed, she is \"recruited\" to help the Sith Warrior find an Ancient Lightsaber, located in the tomb of Naga Sadow, for his/her final trial. This happens to also be the place Vette was captured by the Sith. She proves quite useful to both advanced classes of the Sith Warrior in combat, no matter how the Warrior treats her socially. Once the Sith Warrior obtains the ancient lightsaber, Darth Baras, the Sith warrior's master, lets him/her keep Vette if the Warrior so desires. Vette travels with the Warrior to the main Imperial fleet to take a shuttle to the capital, Kass. It is here the Warrior first has the option to keep Vette's collar on her or to remove it as Vette wishes. Once arrived on Korriban, Vette pokes a lot of fun at Darth Baras, though whenever face to face with him she is visibly intimidated. On Balmorra, Vette makes fun of Malavai Quinn for his strict Imperial personality, while also trying to persuade the Sith to be gentle in his dealings with the resistance. She even comments on the events of Balmorra with sarcasm, asking if they're on to their next journey of \"death and destruction.\" After this, her humorous personality begins to fade if the Sith Warrior has been dark side in nature, not removing her collar, shocking her, and not compensating with gifts.Romance  Vette's affection rises quickly if the Sith Warrior pursues light side actions, and periodically jokes (in a friendly manner) with NPCs throughout most conversations. She also likes it when you act insolent with Darth Baras. A dark side Sith can romance her, so long as her collar has been removed and he supplements his dark side actions with gifts.Combat  Vette is a ranged damage-dealer, making her an ideal companion for a Juggernaut but still a valuable companion for the Marauder. Vette is able to equip Blaster Rifles, but most of her abilities that do the highest damage are only available when using dual blasters. Vette can use Sniper Mode, which increases the damage dealt by activation-time abilities by 10% and reduces the activation time of Aimed Blast to 2.5 seconds, and Assault Mode, which reduces the cooldown of all area-of-effect attacks by 25% and increasing their damage by 10%.Interactions  Like all companions, Vette's affection will change based on specific dialogue choices the player makes in her presence. These changes will be positive or negative based on her likes and dislikes. With this in mind, certain dialogue options are beneficial:Romance  If the male Warrior decides to take her shock collar off, at a later point in the story, Vette can kiss and even marry the Sith. \u00a0The shift towards a romance storyline is clearly seen during the dialogue of the Reminisce companion mission.Companion Missions Trivia  During combat, Vette will randomly say \"If I die I'm going to haunt you!\", a reference to Jack from Mass Effect 2, who says something similar when defeated in combat.External links Crew Skills  The Crew Skills system in Star Wars: The Old Republic consist of three types of skills, each with multiple focus areas: Gathering and Crafting skills are more closely related, the discoveries found during gathering tasks often being used in crafting tasks. Free to play players will have 1 crew slot, preferred players will have 2, and subscribers have all 3. You may choose to use your skill slots in any combination, but only one Crafting Skill may be selected to master. Crew skills can also affect gameplay by helping a character find alternative routes through a scenario (e.g., Archeology helping spot hidden levers to different areas, Slicing to use droids in an area to assist the player). Each of the Crew Skills can be learned by your companions. In the SWTOR system, companions will have the ability to gather resources while a player is in combat, as well as craft items at a player's ship while the player is engaged in other quests or even offline and they can take the materials needed straight from the cargo hold when doing so. In addition, companion characters can undertake their own missions. These missions can result in a variety of rewards involving loot, credits, and diplomacy advantages.Crew Skill Bonus Attributes  Companions that players meet during class missions, will join the crew of your starship at certain points. Companions will have a bonus to their crafting, mission, and gathering Crew Skills. These bonuses come as benfits to either Efficiency or Critical: Each Imperial character is also given the 2V-R8 starship protocol droid, after acquiring a ship,Republic players receive C2-N2 as a ship droid. The 2V-R8 provides no bonus to crew skills, however, it can still craft and gather like other companions. The Bounty hunter will find 2V-R8 on the D5-MANTIS; The Sith Warrior and Inquisitor meet 2V-R8 on the FURY; and the Imperial Agent meets the droid on board an unregistered X-708 PHANTOM, all this holds true for C2-N2 on the republic side. Affection effects a companions ability to perform crew skills, and can be gained through conversations with a companion present or by giving a companion gifts.External Video Ashara Zavros  Ashara Zavros is a female Togruta companion for the Sith Inquisitor class. She descended from a long line of Force users and was raised as a Jedi. The Sith Inquisitor meets her on the planet Taris. She is a romance option for a male Sith Inquisitor.Background  Intelligent and eager to prove herself, the Jedi Padawan Ashara Zavros is the latest in a long and storied family lineage of Force-adepts. Throughout her childhood Ashara heard stories of her ancestors' adventures. These tales were an inspiration to her, and Ashara devoted herself to the study of the Force and the Jedi Code, determined to be among the greatest Jedi that the Order had ever seen. Her knowledge of the Jedi Code, along with her prowess with a lightsaber and command of the Force, quickly catapulted Ashara to be among the top pupils. But while she was undoubtedly gifted, Ashara was also headstrong and proud. This pride can often lead to insecurity, and Ashara is quick to frustration and will sometimes question her abilities in the face of adversity. But even in the face of the most difficult obstacles, a steadfast devotion to the Jedi Code has kept Ashara on the path of light. Ashara has continued her training under the tutelage of Masters Ocera and Ryen, each of whom believe that one must travel across the galaxy and gain firsthand experience in order to truly understand the Force and both the burden and the gift that it represents.Biography  Ashara's force using family can be traced all the way back to the time of Revan, when an unnamed dark-side ancestor of her's was on Taris when Darth Malak ordered the Imperial fleet to destroy the planet in\u00a0Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic in an attempt to stop Revan from escaping the imperial blockade with Bastila Shan. As a Padawan of the Jedi Order, she exhibited great skills with her light saber, even stating to the Sith inquisitor that she had personally bested one of the Jedi masters in her sparring training. She also exhibited a great deal of impatience because of her prowess in combat which led her to constantly question her master's constant preaching of temperance. This is in fact what led\u00a0the\u00a0Sith inquisitor\u00a0to initially become interested in Ashara, thinking it was possible to turn her to the dark side from manipulating those harbored emotions. When the Sith inquisitor meets Ashara he/she is able to manipulate her to being allowed into the enclave, where the dark side ghost resides. However, she calls upon the Jedi masters to deal with the Inquisitor after she returns to the Jedi enclave. Ashara is amazed when the Sith bests the Jedi masters and kills them, and is further surprised when the inquisitor absorbs the ghost into himself/herself, cleansing the enclave; something the Jedi had been unable to do. Afterwards she joins the Sith inquisitor out of a belief that she has no other choice, rather than a willingness to do so. Once a companion, she constantly questions the Sith inquisitor's actions, both light and dark, the Jedi code being her criteria. Overtime the inquisitor can bring her to accept their line of reasoning (this is much easier for a light-sided character to do), and even comes to respect her new master.Skills Personality  Ashara is at first hot-headed and prideful, questioning her teachers constantly as she sees them restraining her. However, she also shows an uncanny mind, able to understand philosophy when she easily tells the meanings behind the Jedi code. Despite her excellent understanding of higher learning, she prefers to focus on martial prowess instead, partially due to her ideas that the Sith must be dealt with by action. Overtime however, both under her Jedi masters and then under the apprenticeship of Lord Kallig (the Sith inquisitior), she comes to be less aggressive; focusing more on diplomacy and philosophy. This is how she is able to convince some Jedi to help the Sith inquisitor (light-sided) to reform the empire. If the inquisitor is dark-side however, her focus on martial prowess becomes even more prominent. Not out of influence by the dark side itself, but by revulsion and fear of the Sith inquisitor. (This can be avoided by a male if he romances Ashara).External Links Mako  Mako is the first companion for the Bounty Hunter class, joining the mercenary when he/she leaves Hutta. She is a romance option to a male Bounty Hunter. It is revealed during the Jedi Consular storyline she knew Qyzen Fess at one point.Background  Nobody on Nar Shaddaa knows quite where Mako came from but everyone agrees she was born to be a slicer. By the time she was seven it was clear she had an unnatural affinity for all things computer-related and she quickly taught herself all known programming languages. At eight, Mako crashed the accounts of a Red Light Sector orphanage that was attempting to sell her to the highest bidder. With credits in hand and marketable skills she soon found herself running with some of the more notorious slicer gangs on Nar Shaddaa. Years later Mako was found wounded in an alley by an aging bounty hunter named Braden. He needed a tech specialist for his crew and she needed to get off the moon until the job her \"friends\" had so spectacularly blown faded a bit from memory. With Braden and his crew, Mako discovered a love of underground bounty hunter culture, a code of honor that gave her life structure and most importantly, her first real family.Biography  Mako is a female cyborg discovered by Braden on Nar Shaddaa. She was hired by him to provide intel and tech for the Bounty Hunter in the Great Hunt which she is an expert about.\u00a0 Mako first meets the bounty hunter when the character first arrives on Hutta. Shortly after, Braden and Jory are found dead in their base, killed by Tarro Blood, the first main advisary of the Bounty Hunter. She at first blames the bounty hunter for their deaths, but after him/her asking for her to calm down and think, she realizes she was mistaken and dedicates herself to avenging Braden and Jory. She stays on and helps the bounty hunter continue his/her quest to get into the Great HuntPersonality  Mako generally likes it when the player makes light-side decisions but charges the NPC heavily for it. Think: mercenary with a conscience. She loves it when you tell the Sith that you don't work for them and do what you want.Abilites Companion Missions External Links Kira Carsen  Kira Carsen is a Human female and a Jedi Companion for the Jedi Knight class. She is the second companion picked up by the Jedi Knight. She is recruited by the Knight on Coruscant, though she is met much earlier on Tython (long before the Knight met T7-O1). She is an \"extremely vocal\" padawan assigned to Master Kiwiiks, a Togruta member of the Jedi Council. As a Jedi Consular, Kira can use a regular or double-bladed lightsaber and is restricted to using light armor. Although Kira is shown using some kind of disappearing trick in one of the trailer videos, stealth is not one of her actual combat abilities, but rather a cloaking device that she uses during the Jedi Knight Coruscant story arc. It is possible to pursue a romance with Kira (though, attachment being against the Jedi Code may cause the player to receive a few dark side points for this course of action). Although the majority of Dark Side choices will cause you to quickly lose affection with Kira, Kira responds most favorably to the player when his or her choices do not cleave too strictly to the Jedi code.Known/Fixed Bugs  There was a possible bug that could cause Kira to not be romancable. If after killing her brother and you choose the Dark Side flirt, she will no longer give any dialogue or missions. If you choose not to flirt with her (avoiding DS points), she would later have a conversation that would have a flirt option however; this option does not give any DS or LS points and she accepts your advances. This was fixed on December 27th 2011 with patch 1.0.1, but the Bug fix was not retroactive to people who had already chosen the dark side flirt prior to the patch, however; it shouldn't affect anybody getting to that point post patch. The developers have stated that they are still planning on a fix for people already affected, but it will take somewhat longer with no firm ETA. As of Patch 1.1 released on 1/18/12, Kira is now fixed to allow any backlogged conversations to take place. These can be done all at once as they are unlocked as each conversation ends and allows you to do the next. Keep in mind you will have to have the required affection points to proceed.Background  See Kira Carsen's Dark Past Witty, brash and carrying a world-weary sophistication about her, Kira Carsen is something of an anomaly within the Jedi Order. Already an adult when she was accepted into the Order, Kira had already amassed a lifetime's worth of experiences which painted her view of the galaxy. Having been abducted at birth, Kira never knew her real parents and spent the better part of her adolescence in a harsh, abusive environment. After enduring years of abuse at the hands of various instructors Kira fled. She spent the next several years as a drifter, hopping from planet to planet, stowing away on countless freighters when she needed to run. Eventually Kira came across a group of refugees and found her way to the slums of Nar Shaddaa, where she and the other refugees quickly became the targets of the local gangs. After an attack by a vicious gang, Kira left the refugees behind and returned to her life as a drifter. She spent her days living in alley ways, stealing what she needed to survive from day to day. It was this lifestyle that led her to crossing paths with a Jedi Master. It did not take the Jedi long to sense Kira's affinity for the Force, and offered to take her on as an apprentice. Kira has an undeniable appreciation of the Jedi Order, and though she may often question the teachings of the Jedi, her optimism combined with never-ending desire to prevent the evils like those she experienced make her a loyal ally of the Jedi.Personality  Kira is considered kind-hearted, confident, and brassy and a bit aggressive.Companion Quests Appearance Customization  \u200bAlso see\u00a0Companion CustomizationSources References External Links Galactic Republic  The Galactic Republic, simply known as the Republic, ruled from its capital city-world of Coruscant, has been the dominant galactic government for ten thousand years. The Republic, led by a Supreme Chancellor, has a democratic government that has been able to sustain itself for more than twenty thousand years. It is said that its complete history would \"fill a thousand libraries\". Since the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, the Republic has been involved in a Cold War with the reborn Sith Empire.History  For more than twenty thousand years, the Galactic Republic has been the most civilized and advanced power in the known galaxy. Governed by the Galactic Senate with representatives from hundreds of star systems and planets, the Republic has been the center of peace and progress, a bright beacon in the darkness of outer space. The revered Jedi Order has sworn itself to defend the Republic, to battle the darkness, and to bring peace and balance to the greater galaxy. The Jedi have served for millennia in this capacity, and in that time they have earned themselves the admiration of their allies, and the hatred of their enemies. Less than a century ago, the greatest of those enemies returned to destroy the Republic The Republic itself was formed in 25,053 BBY when the first \u201cGalactic Constitution\u201d was signed on Coruscant, after the Corellian Hyperdrive connected many worlds in the Galactic Core. Whether this means that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humans or simply the most powerful world at the time is still up for debate, and there has been little said about the event other than that it occurred. The Republic was made up of several hundred thousand worlds. The onslaught of the Sith Empire caught the Republic and the Jedi completely by surprise, and during a long and arduous war, the Republic was broken. After the capital planet of Coruscant was ravaged by the Sith's military forces, the Supreme Chancellor and the Senate were forced to sign the painful Treaty of Coruscant, which required the Republic to withdraw its support of several long-standing allies, including the ever-loyal Bothans. Struggling with a wave of seceding star systems, an insurmountable supply crisis, and chaos on the streets of Coruscant, the Senate has become paralyzed in the years since the treaty. The bitter and divided nobility of the Core Worlds disputes every decision, damaging the morale of the Republic\u2019s already discouraged citizens. Blaming the Jedi for the failures that led to Imperial domination, the Senate has distanced itself from the Republic\u2019s legendary guardians. The Jedi remain committed to protecting the Republic, but the Jedi Council has moved from Coruscant to the ancient Jedi homeworld of Tython. The Republic has trained new combat squads of Special Forces, disciplined teams capable of working together with near-perfect efficiency. These elite troopers often work in conjunction with the Jedi, but in many places the troopers have taken the leading role in providing the Republic\u2019s defense. Despite a post-war economic depression and the continued expansion of its enemies, the spirit of the Republic remains independent, brave, and strong. New leaders are stepping forward even now to stand against the Sith Empire, liberate the galaxy, and restore the Republic to its former glory.Classes External links Crafting Skills  The Crafting Skills are part of Crew Skills that involve using the raw resources gathered from Gathering Skills to create many different items. These skills enable the character to construct armor, weapons, implants as well as other types of useful items and gear. The Crafting Skills are:Crafting System  One of the benefits of the crafting system in Star Wars: The Old Republic is the ability to let companions craft for you, as well as specialize them into certain crafting skills. Crafting is done \"offstage\" by companions. After assigning crafting orders to companions, the player has no further involvement in the process. A player can give simultaneous crafting orders to up to five companions. Each companion can store a queue of up to five crafting tasks. Companion crafting queues will continue even if you go offline. Companions who have a high affection for the player character will have improved ability to perform their tasks (ex: craft items faster). During a companion's process of crafting, you can contact your crew and cancel a project, regardless of your location within the game. The resources that would have been used are returned to your inventory or mailed to you if you have no inventory space. Developers have claimed that player involvement will be required when learning rare schematics for the most powerful items, but this currently is not necessary. The Crafting skills are specialized, so each character can only master one of these six professions. It is possible to \"crit\" on crafting items. This can result in crafting an item that is as good as you can get in a raid. Another important aspect of crafting is the connection to the game community. The SWTOR systems design team felt that having players craft exclusively for their own use would be less entertaining. While the details are not clear, they have invested a good deal of time ensuring that truly dedicated crafters can make a name for themselves and play an important role in the game community. Reverse engineering will destroy the object but refund some of the resources used to create the object. Upon reversing engineering an item, there is a chance that the player will learn an upgraded pattern of the reverse engineered object. A crafter can only reverse engineer an item whose recipe they already know. If a green quality item is reverse engineered, there is a chance to learn a blue quality version of it. Reverse engineering a blue quality item gives a chance to learn a purple quality version of that item. More details of the progression may be detailed on a crafting skill's page. The game's UI shows a difficulty level for each recipe according to the character's level. As the character levels, recipes become easier. Completing a recipe generally results in a crafting skill increase. The skill increase awarded is based on the difficulty of the recipe. Difficulties and the skill award for completing a recipe of that difficulty are shown in the table below.External Links Jedi Shadow  This is a disambiguation page\u2014a navigational aid that lists other pages that might otherwise share the same title.

Each Advanced Class has two unique skill trees and shares one tree with the other Advanced Class of its class. The choice of Advanced Class determines the three skill trees that are available. Players can reset their character's skill points in the Combat area of their faction's fleet for free once per week, and additional respecs cost credits. There are plans to add a dual-spec feature to the game in patch 1.4, allowing you to switch between two specializations without having to reset your skillpoints at the fleet.Bounty Hunter Mercenary Powertech Imperial Agent Operative Sniper Jedi Consular Jedi Sage Jedi Shadow Jedi Knight Jedi Guardian Jedi Sentinel Sith Inquisitor Sith Assassin Sith Sorcerer Sith Warrior Sith Juggernaut Sith Marauder Smuggler Gunslinger Scoundrel Trooper Commando Vanguard External Links Xalek  Xalek is a male Kaleesh companion of the Sith Inquisitor and the Inquisitor's apprentice. He uses a double-bladed lightsaber in combat and is proficient in the use of Force Lightning as well as a tank/dps hybrid. The player periodically goes to Korriban to review his training under Overseer Harkun (as well as numerous other potential apprentices who fail, much like the player's own prologue section) however he is only collected after completing the storyline on Voss.Background  Once known by his birth name name of Xivhkalrainik, he earned his nickname \"Xalek\" during a battle along the coastline of the Jenuwaa Sea, where he was captured by the Sith, but before he was sent off to one of the Sith Empire's many labor camps, it was discovered that Xalek possessed a strong connection to the Force. Knowing that he could be turned into a powerful Sith, Xalek was sent to the Sith Academy on Korriban to undergo training. \u00a0he was given the nickname of Xalex by the other Sith Acolytes. A man of few words and swift action, he has come to be one of the most promising and dangerous Acolytes of the Sith. Born on the Kaleesh homeworld, Xalek was raised in the traditional Kalee manner, coming to believe that war was an important part of Kaleesh culture, and valued honor above all else. During a battle along the coastline of the Jenuwaa Sea, Xalek was captured by the Sith. But before he could be sent off to one of the Sith Empire's many labor camps, it was discovered that Xalek possessed a strong connection to the Force. Knowing that he could be turned into a powerful Sith, Xalek was sent to the Sith Academy on Korriban to undergo training. Xalek was eager to prove himself, and bided his time while at the academy. One-by-one, Xalek's rivals would fall by the wayside, either through accident or through failing the trials. Now Xalek stands among the elite Acolytes, ready to strike down his enemies and prove himself worthy. Real Name: Xivhkalrainik Named \"Xalek\" by Overseer Harkun after he was unable to pronounce the Kaleesh acolyte's true name.Skills External Links ", "Star Wars Imperium Rising Wiki": "Star Wars Imperium Rising Wiki Star Wars Imperium Rising Wiki Imperium Rising, a Star Wars RPG that anyone can edit.

The Corner became a place for former slaves to rehabilitate themselves back into normal society as they were progressively set free. All of the employees, thus, are slaves and/or former slaves. It is located in the club district on the West end and has five distinct floors. The first floor is parking and entrance for speeder bikes. The second floor is the main level where the dance floor and first bar is. It has a live DJ playing every night with different themes each night as well as regular top 100's, with a general theme of new electronic dance music. There is a back area located on the first floor designated for more \"intimate\" encounters. The third floor is an ambient lounge with sound proof walls for those who wish not to participate in the more fast paced and exciting part of the downstairs. The decorations are natural with indoor trees, waterfalls, and another bar with down tempo music for relaxing. The fourth floor is the VIP lounge, decorated in much the same way the third floor is, but more exclusive. The top floor is the apartment complex that Grayson and Conner now own, so access to this is completely restricted to those who do not have permission to enter.History  The club was first established in 31 ABY By Matiak and Christoff Dirano, as aforementioned, as a middle-ground area for slaves to be rehabilitated back into society. Only a few months after gaining in popularity, though, the entire building was completely destroyed by Anzek Dirano, due to a conflict that arose within the family. Not long after the bombing, Matiak, upon his death by Anzek, left his fortune in the hands of the Tarion brothers Grayson and Conner so they could reistablish themselves with a new home and a new club. They followed Matiak's wishes, and thus became the new owners of the newly established \"The Corner,\" now located in the West end club district. Now that Matiak is alive once more, the last of his fortune has been returned, and co-owns the club as a silent partner while the brothers learn the tricks of the trade. Christoff also participates by continuing to supply new employees, slaves, to work there.Notable Employees  Conner - A Tarion approxomately 200 years old who was freed from slavery by Kuole Valek and Christoff Dirano 20 odd years ago. Grayson - Conner's brother and his younger sibling by 50 years, was freed from slavery only two years ago by Conner and Eeva Tremonti Matiak Dirano - Silent partner in the business, supplied the business location and the finances to establish itself in his will Christoff Dirano - Another silent partner who supplies the employees and aids the brothers in learning the ways of business.Timeline  This is a timeline of galactic history.

The chat's events take place around 100 ABY. The chat's timeline takes elements from the old EU and the new Disney EU. However, the major divergent point is after Return of the Jedi. The timeline follows the events of the old RPG settings up to the current setting.Before the Battle of Yavin (BBY) c. 7,500,000,000 BBY - 20,000 BBY 20,000 BBY - 10,000 BBY 10,000 BBY - 1,000 BBY 1,000 BBY - 0 BBY Battle of Yavin (0 BBY) After the Battle of Yavin (ABY) Current Setting (100) The Spiced Rancor Description  The Spiced Rancor is a tall building in the top levels of Cloud City, along with other luxury hotels and casinos in the district. The main room of the club is large, with a high ceiling and comfortable lighting. Booths line several walls and a bar that covers the left and the place has some organics working, but most of the waiting done is by droids. The back area of the main room has a stage where a big band plays. The food is served out of access ports at each booth, the tables out on the floor are served via droid waiters. \n There are several side rooms, plus other floors where more specific tastes in entertainment can be sought out. Gambling, dancing, even a library with sound proofed walls so one can read and study. This is a place where people of all types can come. Even a floor for Droids to come and relax. The upper levels of the tower were made into a luxury hotel, in order to accommodate rich clients and other important people who wish to remain near the tower.History  The Spiced Rancor was built in 30 ABY under the direction of Dracon Darrius Blackstar III. He wished to create a place where people could come and enjoy many varieties of entertainment and have the luxury of being able to rest there as well. Thus the Spiced Rancor was built, the name being taken from an incident where a rancor that had been spiced out of it's mind was let loose on the streets of Cloud City, to draw people in on the infamous moment. The establishment was opened to critical acclaim and drew many of the more influencial people of Cloud City and the Outer Rim itself. The place has served as a host for many different functions in the Outer Rim, from planetary disputes to local guild talks. The Spiced Rancor also hosts famous entertainers for the customers to watch and listen to in order to further increase their enjoyment.Toxic Biography Birth and life as a slave  Toxic was born the child of two smugglers. Due to their inability to sustain a child on the money they made, they sold Toxic into slavery as a baby. Toxic worked in a shipyard in the Outer Rim. His master knew Toxic's parents and promised to take good care of him, so in exchange for hard work, Toxic got food, clothes, shelter, and was even allowed to learn about piloting a star ship. When Toxic was in his teenage years his master died unexpectedly, and his son took over the shipyard. His son was not as kind as he was and treated Toxic very harshly. Toxic could not handle the abuse that he was being put through and decided to fight back, killing his new master and escaping on a ship that was brought in for repairs.Life on the streets  Toxic found himself stranded out in the Outer Rim alone, but free for the first time. He never knew what to expect when it came to fending for himself, so he did whatever he could to survive. He began small, as a petty pickpocket. Stealing money here and there to try to get food and shelter. Eventually he started getting hired to do local drug running, and eventually got enough money to buy his own ship and begin smuggling. Toxic wasn't the most notorious smuggler around, but he was skilled enough to get some attention, and he started getting hired to do increasingly dangerous jobs. Eventually it got to the point where he was no longer smuggling anything and was getting hired for espionage, sabotage, kidnapping etc. At that point he had become a full blown mercenary.The Children of Vega  Toxic's work as a mercenary definitely turned heads a lot faster than his work as a smuggler. He caught the interest of a group of mercenaries called The Children of Vega, and they approached him to begin working with them. To Toxic this was a major honor. The Children of Vega carried the reputation of being one of the best mercenary outfits in the Outer Rim at the time, so Toxic eagerly took the position. While he was within the ranks of the group, he began training in various forms of hand to hand combat, along with advanced training in marksmanship. He went around doing various extremely dangerous jobs with the group, and started to feel a brotherly bond with them, along with getting paid for his work handsomely.New beginnings in Coruscant  The Children of Vega got hired on for a huge job for the Republic. They were hired to transport a young Jedi knight to a drop point so he could carry out a mission, and then return and retrieve the operative. During the mission, The Children of Vega unexpectedly turned on the young Jedi. Toxic attempted to help the inexperienced force user, battling against his own men. They killed the Jedi, and when Toxic attempted to use his lightsaber to defend himself, he got pinned down, and The Children of Vega cut off his arm and sliced open his right eye. The near dead Toxic was then handed over to the sith who orchestrated the entire act. Unknown to Toxic, he was the subject of many experiments conducted by the sith, the main one allowed them to have a constant connection with Toxic's small presence in the force. The sith removed all memory of what had happened to him, and made him believe that he managed to escape from The Children of Vega. They sent him to Coruscant made to believe that he crash landed, and had his arm and eye replaced with cybernetics by his own free will. When Toxic awoke, he headed towards a local cantina in order to have a drink after the \"terrible week\" that he believed he had. When he entered the cantina he was accosted by a force user, and quickly dispatched of him, definitely bringing attention to his location. While he was trying to look for work on the new planet, a female force user, who was the star of a reality show, caught his eye. He followed her to the holovid studio that produced her show and attempted to flirt with her. When that failed miserably, oen of the producers noticed his arrival and asked him in to talk to him. The hutt knew about Toxic dispatching the force user earlier that week, and offered him a show on the holonet. The show was to follow Toxic and a crew he assembled around the galaxy as they took on jobs, and battled against the odds. It was a smash hit, becoming the 2nd most popular show on the holonet (second only to the show starring the young female jedi). During this time, Toxic began befriending members of the Jedi Order, getting pretty close to the entire organization as a whole in an attempt to find the men that turned on him. Unknown to him, this was playing right into the sith's hands. Due to the connection they had with him, they could use him to keep tabs on the Jedi Order. The only problem with the sith's plan was that Toxic took it upon himself to seek out the sith, and attempt to assist the Jedi Order in quelling their threat. Ratings for his show were on the rise during this period, but quickly began to fall after he failed to have anything but minor confrontations with the sith threat. Before he could achieve his, or the sith's goals though he was called into his producer's office. His producer noticed the slip in ratings, and was going to cancel the show. Toxic got into an arguement with the producer, and learned exactly what happens when you argue with a powerful Hutt. He was dragged off by two hired thugs and frozen in carbonite.15,000 years later...  Toxic managed to stay frozen for quite some time, approximately 15,000 years. He missed the fall of the republic, the sith taking control, the rise and eventual fall of the Intergalactic Empire. Decades after the Rebellion defeated the Empire, and a new republic was announced, Toxic was uncovered by archeologists. Due to his age, they found it far too dangerous to release him from the carbon freezing and had no scientific use for the findings. He was given to a charity to be the centerpiece of a large charity auction that was being held on Bespin. The night of the acution began and a bidding war broke out over Toxic. In the end, he was sold to Jenisteen Dirano for the sum of one million credits. That night, Jenisteen brought Toxic back to her home, and her husband Christoff Dirano convinced her to let him release Toxic back into the world after 15,000 years. When he was released, Toxic believed that it was still 15,000 years ago and that they were thugs that the hutt hired to take care of him. Toxic swung wildly, but found himself to be helpless due to the blindness caused by hibernation sickness. He was eventually calmed down by the husband and wife, and they took him in, keeping close watch on his actions. Both were force users, and they could feel a very strong ancient presence within him.Life with the Dirano family  Toxic never quite fit in with the incredibly wealthy high class life that the Dirano family lived. Despite the fact that he, himself was quite wealthy in his time, he never acted like it. Jenisteen Dirano took interest in the way he chose to live his life. He didn't play by the rules that she was used to, and it was something that attracted her to him, but it also made her worry about what her husband would do to him if he ever knew. During his stay with the family he started to bond with their daughter Kiley, feeling like a father figure to her due to her own father rarely being around to take care of her. During this time he also started getting closer to Jenisteen, becoming an outlet for her frustrations, and a kind listening ear. Because of his kindness towards her, they started having an affair. The rest of the family found out, and in a plea to protect Toxic's life he had his memory erased, along with having a chip implanted inside of him that would allow someone to shock, or destroy him at the press of a button. The remote was given to Kiley's brother Kian, who despised Toxic and everything he stood for. Despite Toxic slowly regaining his memories over time, along with those of his true past, he was still under the control of Kian. Kian abused Toxic frequently. Toxic attempted to save himself yet again, but failed when Kian began shocking him until he was defenseless. Kian then sliced off the rest of Toxic's limbs, leaving him to die. Toxic was taken by some witnesses to a hospital, and he had all of his limbs replaced. Toxic made new friends after that, now that he was on his own again. They included but were not limited to a Jedi healer known as Sileen Tenlae, a mechanic named Ayano Taiki, and a young inexperienced force user named Cassus D'Kai. They all helped him in getting the slave chip removed from his chest, and got him back up on his feet.Beyond Bespin  After his troubles with the Dirano family, Toxic decided it would be best to lay low for a while. He spent a lot of time in hiding, and he could only think of one group of people that could help him. He began seeking out the new jedi order. When he found them, he begged them to take him in and let him stay for a while. They allowed him to stay as long as he trained his mind and body with their teachings. His presence in the force was much to small for him to be considered for actual training in the Jedi arts, but he began to learn their teachings, and what their religion stood for. Once again he became a friend of the Jedi. Much later he found himself seeking out Jenisteen Dirano again. He found out that she was possibly in some sort of trouble back on her homeworld. When he arrived he found that Jenisteen no longer had any memory of her life on Bespin, and believed that she never left home, and was about to be married to a man there. Toxic tried desperately to revive her memory, but he ended up leaving the planet defeated. One his way back to Bespin, he came across Ayano Taiki, stranded in space. Her ship desperately needed repairs, so Toxic boarded and helped her out. During the time he spent with her on her ship, they began to develop a relationship. They returned to Bespin and ended up becoming very close. It was about at that time that Toxic found that all of his funds have been taken by the Republic, and that the Empire believed that he gave it to them willingly. Despite his feeling for Ayano, he knew that he had to get away, so the Empire could not find him. He didn't tell Ayano about his departure in fear of her also becoming a target. While he was again on the run, he went to Mos Eisley, where he was hired by a hutt to free the slaves of a rival slave trader.Present Day  Toxic returned from the Jedi Temple to find that Ayano had moved on with her life without him. He was again stranded in a strange time with no one around to turn to. He got by doing odd jobs now and again, and charging any repairs or supplies he needed to the Republic. In his absence Kiley Dirano ended up killing one of her relatives, and was hiding from her family. If she was found then she would be murdered in vengance. Toxic found out about this and took her in, in order to protect her. While he was out one day, Kiley ran away. He is currently seeking her out in order to try to bring her back to safety.Pesonality  Toxic tries to have a very hardened exterior at all times. His past has taught him that any sign of weakness can be his downfall. When confronted, Toxic commonly keeps a calm head, and handles the situation tacfully, and with grace. He feels a strong compassion towards his friends and loved ones, to the point where he's willing to abandon them if he feels that his presence will bring them danger. He also has a strong compassion towards children. He feels that because he never had a true childhood, that it is his duty to make sure other children do not suffer the same fate as him. He is a very compulsive man, with an extremely addictive personality. He has many vices, such as but not limited to, gambling, smoking, drinking, and sexual relations. Despite all of this, he has very strong people skills, and is an excellent diplomat. He knows how to charm people and persuade them.Skills and abilities  Marksmanship Hand to hand combat Awareness PilotingOrganizations  A list of organizations in the RPG.Magnus Sith  The Magnus Sith empire was a collection of Sith Lords who banded together to wage war against the Republic and the Jedi. This Empire was active around 15,000 BBY and started what was later known as the Sith Crusade. This war covered most of the known galaxy at the time, and caused the deaths of trillions.Founding  The Magnus Sith Order was founded by Darth Asmodeus after she killed her master, Darth Praedicatio. The Order was founded from the teachings of the Tariqah'Saarai that Asmodeus learned from her Master. After his death, she went about luring people of influence and power to her cause with her beauty and her power. This would lay the foundations of the Magnus Sith and begin a build up of resources that would lead to the Sith fleets that would eventually wage a devastating war on the Republic. Asmodeus also gathered many scientists to her Order, allowing them to do more questionable genetic experiments in her quest to create the prophesied Sith'ari of which the supreme leader title was named after. This quest would ultimately prove to be her undoing by her own apprentice and continuing the legacy of betrayal that she herself had unwittingly began in slaying her own master.Final Defeat  The forces of the Order were scattered after Crucious' death over Tatooine. Without the leadership of the Sith'ari to focus the Sith forces, they were reduced to infighting and warring amongst themselves. This led to a power struggle between new Sith'ari as each attempted to take command for themselves. This ultimately lead to Darth Convincous, Lord of Conquest, taking command after slaying all of his rivals in saber combat. During his rise to Sith'ari, Convincous learned of a Mimirian superweapon with the power to bring him victory over the Old Republic once and for all. Gathering the remains of the Sith Forces, he lead a direct assault on Mimir intending to capture the weapon . This battle would lead to the unleashing of a Perfect Thought Bomb by the Mimirians which would wipe out everything on the planet's surface and in it's orbit, causing the near extinction of the Mimirian race. This defeat would be the final defeat of the Magnus Order as it dissolved in the following months as there were no strong leaders to rally around nor any sizable forces for the Sith to challenge the Republic and Jedi with.Ranks Megadyne Industries  Megadyne Industries is one of the largest conglomerates in the galaxy. Specializing in cybernetics, robotics, droid design and development, and new technologies research development and construction (including weapons). The company also has it's own internal shipping division to move it's products. Megadyne also has contracts with both the Empire and Republic, and many smaller powers around the galaxy.

Though it suffered many set backs and changes in leadership and structure, the GenoHaradan has endured the ages.History  Note: The following information comes from the Wookieepedia article (Click Here). Xim the Despot created the GenoHaradan as a sort of secret police, using it to eliminate his most powerful enemies and rivals. Even with its agents under his complete control, however, Xim was defeated after a mere 30 years at the Third Battle of Vontor during the Hutt-Xim conflict. It was believed that the GenoHaradan died with him, and this is the point at which common knowledge of the ancient guild ends. In actuality, the GenoHaradan merely disappeared from the public eye and reshaped its existence. Without a governing body to defer to, the Guildmasters hired their agents to the highest bidders, becoming a powerful assassination tool for the wealthy and ambitious. Centuries passed, and the GenoHaradan slowly reshaped further. Its leadership realized that some individuals and governments were more beneficial to the guild than others, and it gradually learned to discriminate between those it sold its services to. The guild was evolving a sense of self-interest and becoming an influential faction in its own right. To balance the power of this new identity, it was decided to divide leadership among four Overseers instead of a single Guildmaster. The foremost of those the GenoHaradan saw as beneficial was the Galactic Republic since the end of the Tionese War in which Tion persumibly became the capital. The Republic's democratic system of succession presented the GenoHaradan a stable entity with which to work, and its democratic system of representation presented them a wealth of corruptible bureaucrats. In time, the GenoHaradan would work almost exclusively for the Republic, operating in the shadows and quietly doing the government's dirty work, even without the government's knowledge, profiting from the secret relationship all the while. It was a perfect symbiosis. The Galactic Republic would grow to become the foremost power of the galaxy, and those few who knew of the GenoHaradan would attribute this growth almost exclusively to the guild's involvement.Organization  Secrecy was the GenoHaradan's prime concern; its power derived from shaping events through peripheral actions. As such, its bounty hunters, while perceiving themselves as more skilled than their contemporaries, strove to remain in obscurity and never attained the fame of hunters such as Calo Nord. A GenoHaradan agent's objective was not only to eliminate the target, but to eliminate the target in such a way that it would seem the agent had no involvement whatsoever in the death or disappearance. Since this left agents with no ability to produce proof of their success, other agents would be assigned to monitor them and report results to superiors. To most, the guild was entirely unknown, and any who attempted to betray the group's existence would have generally been derided as a crackpot conspiracy theorist. The idea that the Republic had only survived so long because of a secret society keeping it alive sounded fantastical, and the GenoHaradan relied on this doubt to maintain its anonymity. Still, a handful of government leaders and perceptive Jedi did learn of the GenoHaradan, and this was how the guild found bounties\u2014when it wasn't determining its own targets. Whenever the GenoHaradan transformed into a faction with its own interests, the power of its Guildmaster increased; guild leadership was becoming much more than a simple go-between for elite bounty hunters and rich customers. The GenoHaradan governing system was therefore reformed: it became led by a cabal of four Overseers. Like anything else in the GenoHaradan, the Overseer system relied on secrecy. The four Overseers would consult with each other on all guild business, but they did so through agents and messengers so as to protect each Overseers' identity. In this way, the individual ambitions of all four Overseers would serve to balance each other out, theoretically resulting in the overall best interest of the GenoHaradan. The method for choosing and replacing an Overseer was a complicated process that required ensuring each candidate's anonymity; other than this, details of the process are unknown.Fate  3,956 years before the Battle of Yavin, the four Overseers of the GenoHaradan were Hulas the Rodian, Vorn Daasrad the Gamorrean, Rulaan Prolik the (possible) shapeshifter, and Ithorak Guldar the Selkath. Of course, since all Overseers kept their identities secret, no one knew this information... no one except Hulas. Hoping to become sole commander of the GenoHaradan, a position that had not been taken since the days of the Guildmasters, Hulas spied and worked to uncover the identities of his peers; having succeeded, he lacked only a means to eliminate them from the picture. This means presented itself when Calo Nord was killed by a powerful but relatively obscure Jedi. Not realizing this man was the infamous Revan, Hulas invited the mind-wiped Jedi to meet with him personally on Manaan, at which point he attempted to recruit Revan into the GenoHaradan. Hulas undoubtedly intended to have Revan kill his fellow Overseers as common criminals, leaving Hulas the sole head of the GenoHaradan. Revan did not accept any of Hulas's initiation bounties, assassination being a morally questionable act. Hulas did not believe he could have found an alternative agent capable of defeating the other three Overseers and Revan refused, so all his work in uncovering their identities may have very well been fruitless. As of now there is no real information concerning whether the GenoHaradan survived through the later years of the Republic, the Galactic Empire, or beyond, but for centuries there has been no indication of their survival past the Old Republic era. Of course, if they had continued to thrive, then there would not be any indication of their survival regardless. However, it can be noted that the Tac-Spec Corporation, a droid manufacturer that operated into the last few centuries of the Old Republic, is claimed to have originated as a GenoHaradan front-company. Their exclusive automata for the Republic's aristocracy, such as the FIII Footman Droid, would have been ideal agents for the organization's policy of subtly influencing Galactic politics.Conflicts  This category contains wars, conflicts and campaigns consisting of multiple battles.Dark Lord of the Sith  Here is a listing of Sith Lords in the Imperium Rising story.Second Galactic Civil War  The Second Galactic Civil War (30 ABY), also known as The Galactic Civil War Part 2 and The Imperial War of Revenge began when the Galactic Empire Declaration of War on the New Republic after two simultaneous attacks that destroyed the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin IV and the Bilbringi Shipyards. This battle would reignite old hatred and rivalries around the galaxy as the two major powers battled for control of the galaxy. Because of this the President of the New Republic, Adamar Kintero, seeing the devastation of the war to come, resigned from office, not wanting to have to deal with the pressures of a galactic war like others before him, which lead to the Bothan Matylya being elected to the position. Starting a decade after the Empire signed a peace treaty with the New Republic, elements inside the Empire who were at odds with this move began a decade long build up, under the control of Adamska Eckhardt before eventually moving against the commander, Gilad Pellaeon, and deposing him from power. Eckhardt then lead the Empire into the opening stages of the war until his power was usurped by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Animus. The war also lead to many worlds breaking away from both governments and establishing a new galactic government, the Aegis Commonwealth in 31 ABY. However, the war ended in 40 ABY when Darth Animus was hunted down and defeated on Umbara. After this, the Empires eventually merged into the Brotherhood of the Sith and began a new war against the successor state of the Republic, the Galactic Union.Origins Buildup to the War  During the decade after the signing of the Pellaeon-Gavrisom Treaty, many of the hardline elements within the higher ranks of the Empire saw the peace accord as a major show of weakness. However, due to the weakened state of the Empire, they could do little about it. It is during this time that an Imperial officer by the name of Adamska Eckhardt begins to gather people around him. Moving quickly through the ranks of the Empire, bringing forth resources not seen before to aid the Empire in defense of their territory against hostilities. Eventually Eckhardt would rise to the Rank of Moff, controlling the central system of the Empire, and overseeing the administration of the capital Bastion. Once there, he began to spread his network, and bringing up those who had like aims as his own. Those on the Moff Council who did not wish for war, or were too hesitant to back his ambitions, he removed from power, finding ways to strip them of their rank, push them into retirement, or simply have them killed and making it look like an accident and replacing the vacancies with people he had maneuvered into position. Once he had his foundation secured, he would expand by slowly introducing more fleet resources to fill the large gaps in the Imperial Fleet. TIE fighters, Star Destroyers, and other craft slowly trickled in over the years to bolster the Imperial Fleet. Unknown to most, however, was that Eckhardt was withholding the majority of his resources in case of emergency, and to prevent the Republic from taking note of a sudden influx of new power. Once he had the fleet's back up to the level of power he desired, he began to work on removing the major obsticles to his desire to retake the galaxy. This was mainly in the form of the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Forces, Gilad Pellaeon. Working on removing high ranking officers who were large supporters of Pellaeon's peace initiatives, replacing them with those who supported Eckhardt's view, or were simply loyal to the Empire itself and not one ruler, Eckhardt thinned out Pellaon's support base. To ensure there would be no surprises, Eckhardt also tracked down former Admiral Natasi Daala and destroyed her and all her followers, not wanting to risk another one of her ambitious drives. When all this was done, nearly ten years after the Bastion Accords were signed, Eckhardt and the Moff Council issued Imperial Contingency Order 65, which allowed them to remove Pellaeon from power. Those few still left to support Pellaeon attempted to fight, and were quickly dealt with by people Eckhardt had put into place. In the end, Eckhardt gave Pellaeon a simple choice, surrender peacefully or die. Pellaeon decided to surrender, believing it to be the better part of valor, that he might find a way to win in the end. With this done, the Moff Council ordered the sealing of their borders until one year later, when they would formally declare war and begin the Second Galactic Civil War.History The Destruction of the Jedi Temple and the Bilbringi Shipyards  The first strikes that began the Second Galactic Civil War. The Empire in sudden ambush attacks dropped out of hyperspace on the shipyards and attacked during the unveiling of a new ship class. This attack caused great damaged to the shipyards and claimed the lives of thousands. Admiral Ackbar was wounded and put into a coma as a result of this attack. At the same time as the attack on the shipyards occurred, the Empire also attacked the Jedi Temple on Yavin IV. Using long range hyperspace torpedoes as the opening salvo, the Empire destroyed the temple of the Jedi before they land troops and sweep up any survivors. Luke Skywalker, Grandmaster of the Order is taken prisoner during the clean up operation.Battle of Bespin  In an effort to reduce the effectiveness of the New Republic's armies, the Empire attempts an invasion of interdiction of Tibanna Gas that was meant for the New Republic. The New Republic along with local forces managed to repulse the Imperial attack and stop their take over of Bespin. However, this was only half of a planned attack, as the Imperials invaded and took control of Thyferra and managed to control the flow of Bacta.Ambush at Augury  The Jedi, in an attempt to gain information about the spreading darkness of the Force and the Imperial War machine seek out a being known as the Oracle. However, when they were speaking with the Oracle, they were ambushed by a Darksider who killed the Oracle and kidnapped the Jedi Howri.Senate Office Attack  Hoping to improve the relations between the Jedi and Republic, Jedi Korden travelled to Coruscant to speak with Senator Visio. Continuing their dialogue they've kept for many months, Korden believed that Visio would be their best hope with the Republic. However, unknown to him, Visio was the very Darksider who had ambushed them on Augury. Revealing himself, Visio attacked Korden, then threw him out the window of the office. Afterwards he staged evidence and framed the Jedi for an attempted assassination on his life.Escape from Ossus  Because of the evidence presented, the Republic believed, with extreme reluctance, that the Jedi had gone rogue and sent a small task force to detain the Jedi on Ossus. But before the task force could arrive, the Jedi made an escape, having to out run the MC90 Republic ship, Saint. Managing to escape the ship's range, the Jedi jumped to hyperspace, leaving the Republic to take control of an empty temple.Battle of Coruscant  One of the most costly and devastating battles in the war, the Imperials struck a deep hit against the Republic. Having long planned this battle and secretly staged and set resources in place, the Republic was caught off guard as the Imperial fleet assaulted the Republic Capital and managed to destroy the Senate District and kill thousands of people, including most of the Republic Senate.Mandalorian Exile  Continuing their advance, the Imperials, after hitting the Republic hard, decided to shore up their defenses and fortify their area of the galaxy. To do this, they turned their attention to the Mandalorian held planets in their space. Using guile and deception, the Imperials instigated a short lived civil war on the Mandalorian worlds before they came in and attacked them from both inside and outside. This resulted in the bulk of the Mandalorian forces being forced off their worlds and scattering them across much of the galaxy.Mission to the Virus Facility  In order to help stop the advance of the Imperials, Republic Intelligence plotted an attack against a secret virus production facility. Sending in a strike team, they manage to destroy the facility, encounting a prototype Phase IV Dark Trooper during the course of the mission.Duels on Korriban  A series of duels that occured on Korriban before it's destruction at the hands of Darth Animus.The Battle of Caamas  In another attempt to strike a devastating blow to the Republic, the Empire, with the use of their newest super weapon, the OMEN, attempt to destroy Caamus. In a turn of events, the Republic, thanks to Sileen Tenlae, discovered the plan for Caamas and intercepted the fleet and a space battle ensued near Caamas.Siege of Shogun  Due to uprisings by local forces, the Empire sent the 792nd Legion and support forces to Shogun to deal with the issue. In reply, the local Mandalorian forces have requested support from Mandalore and any other mandalorian friendly forces.Political Fallout  Because of the warring factions of the Empire and New Republic, many worlds, long weary and having suffered great loses because of the long wars stretching all the way back to at least the Clone Wars decided to not take sides in this new war. In the end, this gave rise to the formation of the Aegis Commonwealth. This group is dedicated to not taking sides in the war, while they hold pacifists ideals, they are not afraid to defend themselves. The planet of Naboo serves as the capital of the government body, also is home to Forseti Ullr, current monarch of Naboo and leader of the Commonwealth. While the Commonwealth is not involved in the war, they do not turn those in need away. Spearheading the largest and most organized humanitarian aid in the galaxy, the Commonwealth also offers protection and shelter for the millions of refugees that have been displaced as a result of this galaxy wide war between the Republic and Empire.Darth Crucious  Darth Crucious was a Dark Lord of the Sith around 15,000 BBY. Once known as the Jedi Knight hero Taren Virok, who was celebrated as the one who defeated the Sith Lord known as Merciless. This act of heroism would also lead to his downfall and lead to him taking the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith and taking the name Crucious, Lord of Torment.Early Life and the Sith Crusade  Born to a small family on Corulag, Virok was located by a Jedi Scout and was brought to the Jedi Council for testing. After his testing, all but three of the Council approved of his entering the Jedi Order. The three who opposed make up what was often called 'The Small Council', and they lead to Virok's downfall. Taren Virok lead a notable life in the Jedi Order, going on many missions where he helped to defend the Republic from threats great and small. His life in the Order lead him to become a Jedi of high standing, which, when the first Sith Crusade was being waged, allowed the Jedi Council to grant him command of a task force that was to hunt down Darth Merciless. The 'Small Council' were worried over this, seeing great darkness in the future for the Jedi. Virok and his task force tracked Merciless to his fortress and engaged him and his personal guard in combat. After a long battle, Virok was the last standing Jedi to stand against Merciless and his remaining guards. Alone in battle, Virok fought with such skill and ferocity, that he became in sync with the Force, to such a before then unseen extent, he nearly became energy in the battle. In the end, Virok overpowered the Dark Lord and his guard, sending the Sith over an edge.Jedi No More  Drained from the battle and alone, Virok left the planet and began the trip back to Coruscant when he was contacted by the small council and ordered to change his course to the world in which they had oversight. As he arrived, he was ambushed by the small council, as they believed he would bring ruin to the Order and thought he would betray the Order. The battle was brief but brutal, and in the end, they believed that they had killed him when he was caught in a power generator explosion. They quickly fled the battle and labelled it as a tragic incident that saw the loss of a hero of the Jedi Order. However, unknown to the academy, Virok survive. This was due mainly to how weak he was in the Force after his battle against Merciless, and the fight against the Jedi Masters sapped the last of his strength, so when he was caught in the explosion, he was so wounded, they thought he was dead. However, the sting of the betrayal made him cling to life and he kept his presence hidden as his strength returned and he escaped on a cargo transport when it was shuttling supplies to the Jedi Temple. Once aboard the transport, he finally saw how he was maimed from the battle, his lips were gone, leaving his face in a ghastly grin and his face was scarred and all the hair from his head burned away. Killing the pilot in a fit of rage, he took the transport and went into hyperspace, letting his anger and hate guide his path. Eventually, he arrived at a desert world that had once been a hidden fortress of Merciless, feeling a kinship to the place, Virok made this place his home, and found the holocron of Merciless, and began to learn from it's teachings. Emerging from the shadows of the galaxy, known now as Darth Crucious, he began to round up the scattered remnants of Merciless' fleet, using force to reel in the scattered warlords to serve him and he renewed the Sith Crusades against the Republic, lusting for revenge against those who he served and was in the end betrayed by.End Game  The war he waged was brutal. Using the might of the Sith fleet to hit the Republic hard, robbing resources and lives from the Republic and the Jedi. Eventually, he would corner the Small Council on the planet that they tried to kill him. Having his troops slay the rest of the Jedi, Crucious faced the three masters on the top of the temple, revealing his true identity to his former masters, he engaged all three at once, and overpowered the Masters and slayed them. Lining up all the bodies outside the temple, he took his saber and marked all the corpses, in the style after his scar that burned away his lips, leaving his face in that ghastly grin. After destroying the temple, his forces left the planet behind to resume the war. The battle raged as planets were left in ruin, the war was nothing but an act of revenge by a once noble Jedi. Eventually, the Jedi selected a Jedi to hunt this Sith alone, Tal Rennon, a Jedi who was similar to Virok in his standing and skill. After a spearhead attack against the Coruscant defense fleet, Tal Rennon followed Crucious' ship as his forces were repelled into hyperspace and boarded the ship as it began to be pulled towards Tatooine because the ship's power was failing. Crucious knew of Rennon's presence, and waited on the bridge of the sinking ship for his enemy. When Rennon arrived, Crucious spoke at length with the Jedi as the ship slowly sank towards Tatooine's gravity well. He revealed his history to the Jedi and told him why he turned on the Order. Once the words were finished, he began the duel and opened with a heavy onslaught of blows against the Jedi, who matched the Sith move for move. As the duel continued, the ship began to roll and spin as the gravity of the planet pulled the ship closer. The battle raged along the halls of the ship as pieces started to tear free, explosion racked the ship, and the battle ended up in the main hangar bay of the ship, where the final showdown happened. During the final battle, Crucious lost his saber and impaled Rennon with a lose piece of pipe, piercing his chest and lifting him in the air and throwing him around, greatly injuring him. Finding his saber, he stalked in to kill his opponent, but at the last second, Rennon called his saber to hand and lashed back and impaled Crucious square in the chest, mortally wounding the Sith Lord. As he lay dying, he spoke final words to the Jedi, warning him that those who walk the path of light will be burned by that light, and those who fall to shadows, will forever be lost. His last act was to pass his lightsaber to the Jedi, saying the Jedi keeps what he earns, and that he earned the saber. With this act, Taren Virok, Darth Crucious, passed from this world.Legacy  Though the Sith Lord died in darkness, his vengeance was not yet complete. As a last act, his death triggered a signal that activated the last project of Merciless, the warrior Ruin.The Doctor  Not much is known about this mad super scientist. His skills are never in question, and he can do a wide range of jobs for the Empire. His career with the Empire began back during the final days of the Clone Wars, his job was attempting to finding the secret of immortality. He along with a team of other scientists were trying to find a way to extend the natural life span of a human indefinitely, on orders from Palpatine. His various projects into such matters made incredible breakthroughs, but his recent project, Genesis, in which he studied the stasis held form of a Sith Warrior known as Ruin, gave him such insight to the DNA structure of humanoids and into the Force it allowed him to create the Imperial Knights program and later the terrible Void Trooper program, both in which he grafted the Force onto a human, and gave the anti-Force ability of Ysalamiri to humans.Description  The doctor appears to be a human male in his late 50s to mid 60s. He has long white hair that he has tied back behind him, and a white mustache that he often strokes while in thought. His eyes are pale blue, giving his gaze a chilling touch to them. He is often seen wearing lab coats and uniforms fitting a lab, but often times colored black to offset his shock of white hair. More recently, he can be seen wearing a more detailed outfit and walking with a cane, whether this is due to his age or just his preference is unknown.Final Days  During the final days of the War with the Republic, the Doctor found himself on the run with no allies to aid his escape. Eventually he was hunted down by a Republic SpecOps team and captured. He was brought before the courts on Coruscant and stood trial for his crimes against sentients. He was found guilty and put to death. However, before he was executed, he was said to be laughing and smiling, claiming that in the end, he had won.Darth Asmodeus  Darth Asmodeus was a Dark Lord of the Sith and Lady of Desire. Asmodeus was also the founder of the Magnus Sith Order. She was considering beautiful by all those who saw her. This beauty for many years hid her dark nature from all those who knew her.Jedi Reconstitution Project  The Jedi Reconstitution Act was a petition proposed by Luke Skywalker to receive aid and resources from the New Republic in helping the Jedi Order reorganize into a more structured format to help Force Users around the galaxy train and understand their power. This petition also allowed the Jedi Order more military resources such as fighters, in order to aid the Republic in defense of innocents around the galaxy.History  After an ugly and bloody series of battles in the Adega system, and on the planet Ossus in particular, Luke Skywalker desired a chance to reorganize the Jedi Order and to make it stronger, so it would not so easily be on the receiving end of Imperial conquests. To this end, he began to work with his sister and others who were friendly to the Jedi Order to begin making motions and commissions in the New Republic about giving a wide range of aid to the Jedi Order to help rebuild their temple on Ossus. The Jedi Reconstitution Act was envisioned by Luke Skywalker as a way to modernize and centralize the scattered New Jedi Order. He also saw this as a means to stabilize the sparse resources afforded to the Jedi by the Republic and other worlds. Due to Skywalker's military record with the Rebellion and his service with the New Republic, the Senate approved the project with only a handful of planets voicing dissent from the approval, the most vocal of this being the Bothans. Shortly after the petition was passed, a vast design program began. The design phase of the project began in 26 ABY, with the main designs being handled by the Republic Engineering Corps under supervision of the Jedi Builders. These design phase alone took two years, offering up a large array of designs for the new temple, to make it as modern as possible, yet fitting to the needs of the Jedi Order. During this time, the Jedi Temple on Ossus is taken down, using the materials of the Temple as a foundation for the site of the new Temple. The construction of the new Temple began in 28 ABY and is finished in 30 ABY, using a combination of standard building methods meshed with the shaping skills of Jedi Builders.Goal  The goal of this project was a complete restructuring of the Jedi's power base and centralize the main governing body of the Jedi Order in the new temple being constructed, while the Praxeum on Yavin 4 would continue to serve as a training ground for new comers to the Order. All records at the Praxeum were copied and moved to Ossus, while relics at the Praxeum were moved to safe houses around the galaxy until the Ossus Temple was completed.Escape from Ossus  Template:PreloadCat In response to the claims and evidence provided by Senator Geminus Visio, arrest warrants were drawn up for members of the Jedi Order and those closely associated with them. This caused the Jedi to release a statement against the charges leveled against the Order, and plan to leave the temple on Ossus before Republic forces arrived to arrest them and seize control of the Temple. Loading the CR90 Corvette, Sentinel, the Jedi lifted off from the Temple grounds and made for space, hoping to avoid a confrontation with the orbiting MC90 Republic ship, Saint. However, the Republic ship detected the Jedi's escape attempt and moved to intercept them before they could jump to Hyperspace. After issuing a warning to the fleeing Jedi, the Republic ship opened fire on the Sentinel and launched X-Wing fighters to stop the Jedi from escaping, however, they were unable to reach the Jedi in time before they escaped into Hyperspace as the Republic fleet was arriving at Ossus. Now on the run fugitives from the New Republic and the Galactic Empire, the Jedi consider what their next moves will be.The Second Escape  During the Jedi's preparations to leave Ossus, Nala Aurelias was making her own plans for her and her husband to leave and make their way to Bespin in order to rescue a friend, Eeva Tremonti who was stranded on Cloud City with no way to fend for herself. Because of the Saint in orbit watching over the Jedi, and the current halt on outgoing traffic from Ossus, Nala was forced to seek out another means of leaving the planet, which lead her to a tavern where she met Dash Xander. A scoundrel of sorts, Dash agreed to take Nala and Jeard to Bespin for 10,000 credits, originally wanting the payment all in advance, but agreed to being paid two-thirds before the flight, and the rest after. He told her to be at docking bay five in an hour, or he'd leave her behind and make his own escape, not wanting to be around when the Republic fleet arrived. An hour later, Nala and Jeard arrived to the bay and boarded the Grizzled Condor after some words, and blasted out of the bay to Republic soldiers' fire as they had caught wind of the escape attempt. Driving out of the atmosphere, the group runs into the Saint as it had swung back to Ossus after the Jedi escaped, not wanting to allow others to escape while the ship was distracted. Dash flew his ship into the asteroid field known as the Cron Drift in order to shake the pursuit of Republic Forces, the Saint stopped at the edge of the field while the X-Wings continued to follow. In order to shake the fighters, Dash drove the Condor between two large asteroids that were about to collide. The collision sent a cloud of debris in all directions, forcing the X-Wings to veer off or were destroyed as Dash pulled the ship out of the field further away from the Republic forces that were now arriving in the system. With the coast clear, they jumped to hyperspace and started the trip to Bespin.The Exchange  Originally a criminal organization that operated around 4,000 BBY, and was considered the most powerful criminal outfit of the day. However, overtime due to various disruptions in their operations, the Exchange grew weak and attempts at reorganization occurred in 1,000 BBY, but the organization could not compete with other newer organizations such as the Black Sun and the Exchange was eventually dissolved in 500 BBY. This did not stop various members from continuing to operate until the Exchange was reformed in 5 ABY after the Black Sun was dealt a major blow with the death of Xizor. The new Exchange now is mainly a slaver operation, becoming the more prominent and powerful slave dealing operations in the galaxy.Previous History  This information comes from Wookieepedia (Their Article) The Exchange was an extremely powerful criminal organization that operated throughout much of the Outer Rim Territories. The shadowy group was led by an even more mysterious entity called the Compeer, with a command structure that included individual crime lords controlling profitable worlds. The only way to be accepted into this elite group was to be nominated by several other crime lords. The Exchange was briefly yet significantly involved with, and damaged by, two important figures around the time of the Jedi Civil War: Revan and the Jedi Exile. In 3,956 BBY, Revan infiltrated the Exchange headquarters on Taris and killed its local leader, Davik Kang. Five years later, the Jedi Exile arrived on Nar Shaddaa. She proceeded to destabilize the Exchange's operations on the moon by killing the crime lords Saquesh and Visquis, and by destroying the Visionary. G0-T0 went along with the Exile in hopes of stabilizing the galaxy. He was eventually destroyed on Malachor V when the Mass Shadow Generator was re-activated and blew up the planet along with G0-T0.G0-T0  Goto was the Exchange boss of Nar Shaddaa. He was never seen in person, and appeared only as a hologram. This was because 'Goto' was not an organic being: he was a droid (G0-T0) using the hologram to give the impression that he was a living being. Eventually, he would travel with the Jedi Exile. G0-T0 managed to use the illegal actions of the Exchange for his ultimate purpose of stabilizing the Galactic Republic. Its smuggling ring caused the deaths of destabilizing persons or organizations, developed unofficial profits for entire sectors, and strengthened Republic worlds that would otherwise be poor and ignored. Believing that the major source of the Republic's problems revolved around the Jedi Civil War, it also enacted bounties for live Jedi and Sith. Many bounty hunters simply killed Jedi and Sith instead of capturing them, but the outcome remained: less Jedi or Sith to fight against each other meant less fighting period. G0-T0, as part of his programming, was simply interested in keeping the Republic in order and keeping its infrastructure intact due to the devastation caused by the Jedi Civil War.Downfall  According to Kreia's predictions before her death on Malachor V, the Exchange grew in power, until the Hutts ceased tolerating the Exchange, causing it to slowly feed upon itself.Reorganization and Dissolution  While the Hutts helped to weaken the Exchange, the destruction of the group was slow to happen. The Exchanged continued to operate until around 1,000 BBY, where the leader of the time attempted to restructure the group to bolster it's weakening power. This only prolonged the inevitable, as the Exchange was unable to compete against new powers such as the Black Sun, which helped to finish off the Exchange's ambitions. In the end, the Exchange was completely dissolved around 500 BBY, where it quietly faded into the shadows. There was no war, no glorious battles nor any vows to return. The organization simply went quietly into the night.Service in the Shadows  With the Exchange no more, many of the former members found themselves without work, and unable to find employment in the rival organizations who were at odds with the Exchange. To this end, many became pirates and smugglers, dealing with whoever would hire them, often times working for less the reasonable fees. Eventually, those former members and their partners were able to slowly work their way back into the criminal underworld, and into the rival groups that the Exchange had worked against. At first, their goal was not that of revenge or the destruction of their former rivals, but simply to survive. However, in the years following, those members and those that followed them saw their rivals begin to weaken, including the seeming unstoppable Black Sun. In 32 BBY the Black Sun was shaken badly due to the loss of their leader, Alexi Garyn, and those that remembered the Exchange (or those who were of long lived species and remember their service in the Exchange), saw this as a means to take the Black Sun down. However, the Black Sun was not so weak as they had hoped, as many of the conspirators who wanted to see the Exchange reborn, were captured or killed by the Black Sun loyalists. While some continued to operate in secret, having not allied themselves with the ones who plotted, the Black Sun was far from finished.The Galactic Civil War  The Galactic Civil War brought the Black Sun into the rancor's den, as the leader, Xizor, had dealings with the Empire that would eventually lead him to his death, and lead the Black Sun to near destruction. With Xizor's death, many of the still surviving conspirators moved swiftly to secure resources for the new envisioned Exchange, even going so far as to filter information to Palpatine's spies about the Black Nebula in order to ensure that they would not pose a threat to their designs.Restoration  The conspirators left the dying Black Sun and reformed the Exchange, believing the name would still carry weight with it after all this time. However, a newer member that had joined the group and had a different view of how the organization should be run, claiming that the Exchange should be that, an exchange of illegal goods and let other groups, like the Black Sun, deal with the larger matters that would draw fire to them. This lead to the first war within the newly formed Exchange, where many of the conspirators and the last few living members of the original Exchange were defeated, many killed, and many more sold into slavery. Thus it was at this time that the new member who had started this war, a Kushiban named Moriarty Lepus took control of the Exchange.New Vision  Lepus' vision for the Exchange was a slaver operation, and using the resources secured from the Black Sun by those he defeated in the conflict in the organization, he quickly established the group as the dominant slaver outfit in the galaxy. Using his appearance to throw his rivals off guard, he was able to kill, capture, or simply buy out others who worked in the same field as him, and had solidified a foundation for the Exchange and set up his organization on Nar Shadda.Business Plan  With the Exchange's mechanism now in place, the organization now needed to seek out clients in order to ensure a steady flow of credits. To this end, the Exchange began to buy and sell slaves, becoming the market for which they set prices and established a stranglehold on the slave trade. While there were minor slave trades operating outside of the Exchange's sphere of influence, they were very small scale, usually operating on an Outer Rim world. If the Exchange encountered these small time operations, often times they were dealt with, with finality.Resources  Coming SoonBattles of the Second Galactic Civil War  This category is for battles of the Second Galactic Civil War.Battle of Coruscant  The Battle of Coruscant was a devastating blow to the New Republic from the Galactic Empire. Having taken time to build up this assault, the Imperial Forces moved slowly for months, working in stealth soldiers onto Coruscant to ensure the failure of the proper sector of the planetary defense shields when they attacked. During the attack, a specially built Super-class Star Destroyer, Longinus, was flown in using a highly complex droid brain and it rammed through the defenses and the opening in the planet's shields and crashed into the Senate building only to activate the massive payload of explosives stored on the ship. The resulting explosion wiped out the entire Senate District. During the retreat of the imperial forces, the Vanquisher was destroyed by remote detonation ordered by Marshall Himmler, killing all hands on board. The Republic Star Destroyer Crimson Dawn was also stolen by the Mad Dogs Storm Commando squad aided by Imperial agent Anzek Dirano.Aftermath  An hour after the battle was finished, the Imperial Holonet News Network issued a release from the Moff Council: Not long after that, the Supreme Commander of the Republic Forces gave a statement in reply: People of the New Republic. Trust me when I say that the events of this previous evening have sickened and shocked me just as much as they have you. I grieve for your losses as if they were my own flesh and blood as well. This is why we will be carrying out swift and severe retaliatory strikes upon the limbs of what remains of a our enemy. What remains of the Empire will accept full responsibility for their actions and will be held accountable. That our enemies would take so shocking a step towards war is nearly unthinkable. The lives of millions of innocent people were lost and the beating heart of the Republic was reduced to ash. This pains me as much as you. However, those of you who can hear this know that the Republic has faced dire situations before and we will not be caught standing by idle while the culprits go dance and revel in their supposed victory. As of today (insert galactic standard date) we are declaring open war on the Remnants of the Empire. I will be mobilizing Republic Forces to deal decisive counter-strikes. There will be no tolerance. Any Imperial forces found on planet are to be detained. If there is any resistance they are to be shot on sight. I will not tolerate further harm to my people. Please know that I am deeply sorry for your losses and the fact that this happened on my watch. I will not rest until justice has been dealt, I give you my word. In order to allow you some peace of mind your security forces have been doubled and our fleets are reaching full mobilization. We will not leave you vulnerable. I will not leave you vulnerable. Whatever happens, I take full responsibility. And I swear to you on my life that I will not stop until justice is served and peace is returned. The villains behind these inhuman strikes will be brought to justice. Until then, rely no the resources you are being provided. Use what help you need to stand up on your feet again and stand tall knowing your heartache is not wasted. Gods protect you and keep you, my people. I must leave you with these words and actions and return to my duties but rest assured. You are not alone. Signing off, Your New Republic Commander Of Armed Forces. Ivia Xalin.Dracon Darrius Blackstar III  *Note: This page is still being worked on. Dracon is a harsh business man who has little room for emotion or patience for failure. He runs on of the strongest conglomerates in the galaxy. Dracon inherited the business, Megadyne Industries from his father after he was killed in a shoot out. Dracon now has the greatest robotics and cybernetics company in the galaxy, also working in advanced technologies research designs and development. He also has contracts with both the Republic and Empire, allowing him ease of movement across nearly any sector of space.Description  Dracon is an older man, in his 50s, with dark red hair and a face with enough age to it that one thinks he'd be dead by now. His deep (british) accent always makes a room listen to what he has to say, and his way with words bends others to his will, without the need of the Force (read: He is not a Force User). His face is hard, like stone, and his will is even harder. He sees life as a game, and all are a pawn to himHistory Early Days  Born as the son of Dracon Darrius Blackstar II, Dracon was born into a rich family on Courscant, one with close ties to the political arena. Dracon was raised to take his spot in the family business of gaining power. It was all his family lived for, and he learned his lessons well. Too well.Acquiring Power  Eventually Dracon killed his father by arranging for a meeting he was sitting in on to be attacked by local thugs, his father died knowing his son had outdid him in the ways of manipulations and died with a smile on his face. With his father dead, Dracon became the head of his family, and all titles and the riches with his position to go with it.Assuming Control  Dracon founded the Megadyne Industries, which was a massive company that dealt in spaceship technologies and even advanced robotics. Draco also developed a line of combat power suits which could be worn by soldiers that boosted their defense and gave them amazing combat abilities.The Jedi  However, the suit was still not ready for mass production. And the resources to make the suit were not fully realized, and Dracon took to wearing the suit, a blue suit with a red crest on the back of the head which housed advanced computer systems. He also needed the mineral used in the armor's construction from Ter\u2019dek 3, he had an operation there using illegal means to obtain the material he sought. He believed his senate connections would allow the sight to be overlooked, however, the Jedi eventually found out about it and sent two Jedi to investigate and stop it, Jedi Master Ambrosius, and his Padawan Learner, Nay-Tei Shen. The operation was found out, but the Jedi were captured by Dracon's forces, as Dracno would not allow his operation to be uncovered without having the proper backups in place. He beat and then killed Ambrosius with his own saber in front of the young Nay, before turning his attention to Nay. However, Nay managed to strike out one attack at Dracon, damaging the suit in the lash, however, it only ended with Nay being brutally beaten before being launched into a disabled escape pod in space, to die a very slow death.Declining Health  However, unknown to Nay when he struck Dracon, he had a measure of revenge on Dracon, because of the suit's experimental nature, it used a new type power source that was damaged and exposed Dracon's body to it's energies, which poisoned his body. Over the long years his body fails bit by bit, and each piece has been replaced or enhanced with highly advanced cybernetics, making him more machine than man now.Second Life  Eventually he focused more on his company, and on keeping a hold on his power, the changing governments and endless conflicts only allowed his grip on his power to tighten and increase his influence. Eventually he was able to fade from the face of the galaxy and keep control of his power, and to work on his other projects, eventually finding a way to use high powered frequency jammer to block the Force for an extremely limited area (hence the need for alot of power). And his body continued to fail on him, reducing him to a hovering chair. Or so all was meant to think...Cybernetic Enhancements  *Note: This information is OOC only, as it has not been publicly revealed IC. Dracon is a cyborg, a mix of organic and machine parts, though more machine now than organic, and far more advanced than either Vader or Grevious were ever thought to be.\n\n All that remains organic of Dracon is his head and part of his chest, the rest of him is purely machine, with highly advanced synthflesh grafted over him to appear completely human (to show a face of weakness when he is indeed far stronger than they believe). His fore arms carry a set of three one foot long claws that extend through his fingers and lock into place, their material and sharpness can cut through medium metal plating easily enough, and his fists are strong enough to punch through a ship's hull without effort. His right arm also has a blaster built into it, allowing him to take an enemy unaware by firing a bolt through the palm of his hand. His reflexes are many times greater than that of a normal human, making him on par with a Jedi in speed and reflex. He has a power generator in his stomach construction that grants him this speed, power, and skill. He also has cybernetic implants in his brain that prevent a Force User from manipulating or reading his mind, and his eyes have also been enhanced to let him see better, and has small computer readouts that let him link up to his operations as needed.\n When in public though, he rests in a hover chair, as everyone believes him to be a cripple. Unknowing his true danger.Darth Animus  Darth Animus (also known as Geminus Visio, and Atrum Viator) is a Dark Lord of the Sith and Lord of Purity. Posing as a Senator on Naboo named Geminus Visio, he assumed the position of Senator after the previous Senator was killed in a hyperspace collision with a stellar fragment.History  His early life is currently unknown at this time, but his machinations for the galaxy have taken deep hold in many events in the galaxy. During his time as Senator, Visio has lobbied the Senate for more aid for the Jedi to help the two organizations come together in a more concerted effort against the ambitions of the Galactic Empire. However, no one could know that the Senator was in fact using his good deeds to set up the Jedi and bring about a falling out between the Republic and Jedi. During a meeting with Jedi Master Jarek Korden, Visio revealed that he was in fact the Darksider that the Jedi were looking for. In a brief encounter, the Senator threw the Jedi from the office window and presented a security feed that showed the Jedi trying to kill him, thus framing the Jedi for attempted murder. After this the Republic issued arrest warrants for the Jedi Order and sent ships to take control of Ossus. During this time, the Senator has been giving speeches and having meetings with others, pushing for more sanctions against the Jedi and their supporters, using the line that he himself was a great supporter and they tried to kill him. During a supposed trip to Naboo to speak with members of the court about the Jedi, Animus used the time away from Coruscant to torture and twist Jedi Master Lilathiana Howri to the Dark Side, finally shedding his identity of Atrum Viator and revealing his Sith name and title. After turning Howri to the Dark Side, he named her one of his servants, a Hand, and moved to ready her for service in his Order.Ruler of the Empire  Eventually, Animus came into contact with the Doctor and began to plot with him about taking over the Empire. He promised the doctor access to Sith Alchemy and other Sith secrets that the Moff could not promise, the Doctor saw this as a way to expand upon his continuing research and accepted the offer. Together, they infected the Moff Council along with other key members of the Empire with the Subjugation viral weapon to ensure their loyalty as Animus was named Emperor. To keep the ruse of his role as Senator up, the Doctor created a clone of Animus that posed as Geminus Visio in the Republic Senate, to allow the Sith Lord to continue to corrupt the Republic from the inside while he rules the Empire. Claiming the throne of the Empire and naming himself Emperor, he pushed the Empire into a new series of assaults on the Republic, hoping to draw out the Jedi as well as crush the Republic under heel. However, due to the investigations of the Republic Intelligence branch, with help from the commander of the armed forces, they were able to expose the clone of Animus as a traitor and send it back to the Emperor. This act caused a brief moment of healing between the Republic and the Jedi, which Animus refused to allow to heal any further. To this end, he ordered the OMEN, a superweapon that was constructed in the previous years under orders from Moff Eckhardt to be brought to full service and prepared to use it on the worlds of the Republic. However, before he used it, he used the cover of construction on the OMEN as a means to hide other projects he was constructing, allowing the OMEN to draw the eyes for those watching.Establishing the Sith Empire  Once he had finally had his true aims well on their way, he began to ready the OMEN itself for it's first mission. Before the mission could begin, he had Sileen Tenlae brought before him. Upon meeting her, she attempted to assassinate him using the Force to attack his internal organs. Lashing out at Sileen in anger, Arcanum leaped into the path of the Force Lightning attack to protect her from Animus' wrath. Suffering from his wounds, he was taken to the medical bay below the throne room for emergency surgery using the avatar as a source for the needed donor. Due to his injuries, he was forced to wear a respirator that filled his lungs with bacta solution to heal the rest of his wounds from the inside. Across his chest was a scar in the shape of a cross from the surgery the doctor had to preform. Due to this, his avatar posed as him, to make it seem as if he had suffered no harm from Sileen's attack upon his person. Using his avatar, he had the preparations for the OMEN continued, acting as if business was usual with the Empire. Punishing both Arcanum and Sileen for their acts, the avatar attached a keeper to Arcanum's throat to ensure both he and Sileen don't cause anymore trouble. Knowing the Battle of Caamas would be a wasted effort, he sent his avatar in his place to lead the assault. During this time, he was still recovering from serious wounds that nearly killed him, thanks to the actions of Sileen Tenlae. When his avatar was killed in the battle, Animus decided it would be better to let the galaxy believe him dead than to return just yet. As such, he allowed his apprentice, Darth Traya to go about reviving the former Imperial Agent, Klave. With the Empire appearing to be secured for the time being, Animus retreated to Sith Space where his true aim was held, the Dark Elysium space station, which was the seat of his growing Sith Empire. Here he continues to train adepts he had taken in under his wing during his travels, such as Darth Ryyst.Abilities Lightsaber Combat  Animus is highly skilled in lightsaber combat. Drawing on an obvious knowledge of classical swordplay skills, he is mastered in the art of Makashi. He is also well trained in all the other seven classic forms of Lightsaber combat, making him a deadly enemy to face in saber combat.Gallery Matiak Dirano  Matiak Dirano BiographyBiography Life with the Imperials\u00a0: Early life  His real parents are the Imperial Inquisitor Hark and Director Zhilarsk who conceived him with the purpose of being the next Inquisitor for the Moff Council. Upon his birth, it was discovered that he had an incredibly rare talent to control technology with the Force, and the scientists who were monitoring him decided it would be within their best interest to extrapolate on his talent. Thus, at the tender age of three years old, The Doctor implanted a chip inside of his brain that would further make his talent all the more powerful. In doing this, he spent most of his time in the science labs on Muunilinst and never once shared time with his parents, thus, he never knew who they were. When he turned Twelve, the scientists decided it was time to see if his talents had grown as they had anticipated. Much to their excitement, it had. But, Matiak was uncompliant. Their questions and tests were met by a wall within his mind, and while he could easily perform the tasks they wished him to do, he refused to do them. A few months of intense interrogation, and sometimes even torture to get him to comply, the Moff decided that the boy should be executed. Far too powerful and too much of a stray arrow to be reconned with, untamable, they felt his death would be within their best interest. His parents thought otherwise, though, having a sliver of attachment to their child, and Hark rescued him from his imminent death. From then on, he traveled with Hark, viewing him indeed as a father-figure, but never knowing that Hark was really his father. He grew into his teenage years spending vast amounts of time walled up inside his bedroom on Hark's cruiser ship, teaching himself how to create pieces of technology that only he would be able to use, mostly in the form of triggerless weapons. Unbeknown to his crew, though, Matiak began to hack into the computer systems, particularily on Coruscant, where he gradually robbed high yielding bank accounts to accumulate wealth. In doing this, he only would take small portions: twenty credits here, ten there, but these numbers soon added up. He was planning for something, but even for him, he didn't know exactly what.Apprenticeship with the Dirano  One day, Hark, Matiak, and their crew landed on Cloud City on the planet of Bespin to do some inquiring into the Dirano, intent on arresting Jenisteen Dirano. Barely there a couple of weeks, Malice the Mandelorian arrested Jenisteen and entrapped her within the ship's prison. Out of curiosity, Matiak went to the cells to see who the new prisoner, and upon seeing Jenisteen, instantly felt an attraction to her. At 17 years old and having little contact with women, he was instantly confused by his emotions. He wanted to help her, often brought her food and blankets while she slept, and watched her from the security cameras at a safe distance. Acting one day in desperation, finally, he broke into the security system of the ship and released Jenisteen from her prison. Jenisteen, indebted to Matiak for releasing her, asked him to join her at the Dirano temple on Bespin. He, utterly infatuated with this woman, thought of whatever he could to be close to her. He agreed without a second thought, and went to Hark with an excuse to stay at her side. He told Hark that he would be an inside spy at the temple, and would report to Hark of any strange or illegal activities. Thus, he began his apprenticeship as a force user under Jenisteen Dirano, and she instantly became his master. As time passed, he regularly reported to Hark, but everything he sent to Hark was nothing but good information. Finally, Hark asked for Matiak to return, but soon discovered Matiak's falsehood when he stated that he would not be returning. Furthermore, he denounced his purpose to become an Inquisitor, throwing all Hark and Zhilarsk's lifework away. Hark could not refuse Matiak's choice, though, so he let the boy go, much to his distaste, telling Matiak that despite his refusal to return, Hark would always be there in the back of his mind. Watching, waiting.  As time slowly passed and the months drew on, Matiak's powers grew under Jenisteen's training. One day, Jenisteen received a request from her home planet of Valoria and shedeparted without a word. In a panic, he followed the course of her ship to the planet in his own ship and soon joined her on Valoria with Jenisteen's daughter, Kiley. At first, the citizens were not receptive of the off-worlders, who were seen as invasive and unwanted, but on Jenisteen's order, they were allowed to stay. While Jenisteen dealt with what she had to on Valoria, Matiak and Kiley had much time to spend together and soon formed a relationship. They spent their time together dreaming, making plans for what they would do once they left Valoria, and even made a plan to leave all together with Kadin and Konar, Kiley's brother and nephew respectively. And yet, moments before their first time of intimacy together, Matiak told Kiley not to fall inlove with him, knowing that his heart still belonged to his beloved Master. That infatuation he had for Jenisteen had never once dwindled, even though she was indeed happily married to Christoff Dirano. Often, Kiley would question Matiak if he was only with her because he could not be with Jenisteen. He, not lying, told her that this wasn't the case. He did care for Kiley, but not in the same way or at the same degree he did for Jenisteen. Time would pass, and Jenisteen and him would have much time to get to know each other in a more meaningful way beyond their student-master relationship. They grew to become friends, family, and eventually lovers. Yet, she would never give herself over to him. It was plutonic, and he filled the void to be that warm body next to her at night when her husband could not be around for her. Beyond this, though, nothing happened. Unknown to them, or even the people of Valoria, one of the King's attendants Kor was gathering strength and forces to overpower the King and take over the kingdom. The fateful day would finally come, then, when their golden time would pass within a flash, and the whole planet sent into a civil war: Kor and his rebels against the Valorian kingdom and Jenisteen's family. Jenisteen, having ties with the Imperials, called upon the Moff for assistance. The Moff agreed to aid Jenisteen in the endeavour, yet did not tell her that their reasoning for helping was to harvest the planet's rare metal ore that could repel lightsabers and blaster shots. Their victory would mean gaining utter control over this resource. The king would eventually be taken prisoner by Kor, and Jenisteen called upon Matiak and their imperial soldiers, as well as Jenisteen's friends on Valoria to free the king and defeat Kor. Matiak agreed wholeheartedly, and would have a face off with the rebel. Although he was able to kill Kor, Jenisteen would not be spared the sting of death, receiving a mortal wound. Matiak instantly went to Jenisteen's side and professed his love for her, but instead of accepting his love, she asked for her Husband who had been all but present for her over the passing months. She broke his heart, and this ate at his insides like nothing had before. Her refusal set him upon a dark course that the leader of the Templar Knights felt, intrigued by his strength and the looming dark side that was brewing inside of him. When Jenisteen died, Matiak went into a fit, bearing his lightsabers and killing anyone who entered his path, friend or foe. He traversed the planet for weeks, slaughtering, until he came upon a mining project that the Imperials had set up. He had finally discovered the Moff's dark plan, but refused to do anything about it. Instead, when confronted by Setis Jaeda, the leader of the Knights, he accepted her offer to train under her.Apprenticeship with Setis Jaeda and Darth Kothar  His time with Setis Jaeda would be brief, knowing that despite being a leader, as a dark side force user, she was weak. She had unique abilities, but that did not compare with her lack of knowledge in the basic forms of the Force. He killed her and retained her title as the Templar leader of the Knights, yet would not act upon this role for some time. Instead, he was confronted by Christoff Dirano, finally, and was soon taken up as an apprentice of him and the Sith imprisoned inside of him, Kothar. On one hand, Christoff taught him how to properly fight as well as how to be a proper businessman as he was, yet when Kothar took possession of Christoff, the sith would teach Matiak about the dark ways of the force. Together, him and Kothar would finish off whole villages of innocent people just for the sake of training, torture people who would oppose them, or those who had useful resources and information. Matiak did this without a moment of regret, still writhing on the inside from his refusal by Jenisteen. It finally came to a time when he and Christoff formulated a plan to finally get rid of Kothar once and for all, but the only way to achieve this would be to allow Kothar to possess Matiak, in which his own death would be feigned. So, he and Christoff went to the old Dirano graveyard on Ossus to do the deed. Yet, their plan would not go exactly as they had forseen it. Bitter by her heartbreak because of Matiak leaving her, Kiley came upon the two fighting men, sneaking up behind Matiak and impaling him upon her lightsaber, killing him. When this occured, Kothar was inhabiting his body, Christoff utterly free now of the demon Sith that possessed him. Using Kothar's knowledge to switch bodies, though, Matiak was able to use the last ounce of his strength to push out his soul and inhabit the body of his twin sister. Christoff, taking Matiak's body to the Doctor who first created Matiak for what he was, soon disappeared again. The Doctor was able to heal Matiak, and soon he gave up the host body of his sister to reinhabit his own.Admittance into the Dirano Family  Jenisteen, too, was revived from her death with the help of Christoff's abilities he gained from Kothar, but she could not remember anything of their life together. Not their marriage, their children, or her history. Instead, she only remembered her childhood on Valoria and the promise she had made to Seichi Tatsuo to marry him. So, she did, and when Matiak sought out his old master, she was left in confusion. Having a new found look on life, Matiak decided that instead of imposing himself on Jenisteen, he would watch and guard her from afar, no longer hurt from what happened before. Time would slowly pass again, Valoria soon becoming overtaken by the forces of the Imperials, and Jenisteen slowly regaining back her memory. Jenisteen had a debt to the Imperials after they agreed to help her, so when she finally could remember everything, she went into their services as the Prefect. At this time, Matiak would do the same and assume his role as the Templar Knight leader. Yet, because he had not done so sooner, the Moff had already taken charge of the order. Thusly, his leadership was merely for appearances only, and he had little power in the military. Jenisteen would become the target of assassins, so Matiak decided that it would be time to assume the role of her guardian now, giving up his place as the pseudo leader of the Templar Knights. Yet, despite his continued devotion to Jenisteen, and what he perceived to be their growing love, upon Christoff's imminent return, she refused him again. She went to the arms of her husband, leaving him to look on with hurt and scorn. He decided that it was time to leave their services, but when moments before his ship was to leave the ground, he could not bring himself to go. Instead, he went back to Jenisteen in a fury of emotion, pledging himself to her. He needed her far more than she could ever imagine. She was his foundation and his purpose, as was her husband. They were like his parents, his allies.  Because of his devotion to their family, Chris would eventually offer for Matiak to join the Dirano as an official member. Matiak whole heartedly agreed to the offer, knowing that this would give him purpose and duty. He received the Mark of the Dirano, and the group of them finally settled upon Coruscant together. Christoff would soon depart again to search for his children Kian and Kiley, who were both kidnapped, leaving Matiak and Jenisteen to rekindle the love they once had. Despite everything they had been through, they were able to pick up where they left off. Yet, just as it seemed that things were finally going okay, the head of the Dirano Family announced that it was time to cleanse the bloodline. This meant that everyone whotarnished the image of the Dirano would die. This would come to be, then, Matiak's second taste of death, and Jenisteen going on the run once more. Lured out of the business that he and Christoff had only just created by Anzek Dirano, Matiak was forced to pledge himself to the \"real\" Dirano, and to admit to all the wrong doings that they had commited. With a gun pointed to his head, Matiak could not do otherwise, valuing his life, so he admitted to everything. Yet, Anzek still shot him in the head. Utilizing that same power that he had the first time he was killed, Matiak pushed out his soul and possessed the body of a Valorian boy who was immigrating to Coruscant. Issedir Takoru and his family were moving to Coruscant when their ship crash landed on the landing pad. Everyone was killed except him, and he was left in a state of near-death comatose for two years. The doctors were finally at the moment of pulling the plug, but suddenly his eyes flaired open. Matiak, inside of Issedir, could remember nothing, nor could Issedir. With the two memories inhabiting one, Issedir/Matiak would spend much time regaining their past while his body was recooperated by the Doctor for the second time.Present Day  He was finally confronted by Christoff with his new body, waiting to be reinhabited again, but Matiak was almost hesitant to accept it. He was enjoying his new life, detached from everything. No Dirano, no Imperials, nothing, just him and his new sense of self discovery. But, he still felt a sense of devotion to the Dirano, despite how they had ordered his death. And, he knew that Issedir needed his own life back, now that he was awake and aching to remember, so he finally agreed. He used his strength to go back into his body, but it severely weakened him, not only physically and in the Force. This leaves with today, Matiak trying to regain his lost strength, and getting used to this new body. Older.Personality  Matiak grew up having little contact and knowledge of the outside world, so despite being 19 years old now, he is still quite naive about the workings of the Galaxy. He is strong, but often downplays his strength and people often perceive him as meek, quiet, and sometimes even weak. Matiak is intelligent, passionate, and devoted to the purpose set out before him. He does not believe in the religious beliefs that Jenisteen follows, finding no sense in worshiping omnipresent beings that he cannot feel or see. He is very logical and literal, taking everything as is. He often seems detached and even cold at times to others, but deep down he is a hopeless romantic, and often showers Jenisteen with love in ways he does not show others. It is in this way that she has accepted him as the other man in her life, because he fills a void for her that Christoff cannot.Abilities  Controlling all forms of technology with the force Basic skills in the Force, dark side. Creating weapons and new forms of technology, as well as discovering minute problems inside pieces of technology that already exists and fixing them Piloting Possession of other bodies, but this severely weakens his strength for months at a time. (more to come)Cybernetics and other specialty possessions  A chip within his brain that extrapolates on his natural ability to control the force. The chip is now under control inside his body. A cybernetic heart, to replace the one that was destroyed when Kiley killed him. Also cerebral parts that has been added to his brain from when he was shot by Anzek. Left arm replacement from damage sustained while protecting Jenisteen. Also owns: Custom lightsabers and weaponry that he controls within his mind, thus they have no triggers to them. This means that no one else can use them but him.

It is the prequel to the\u00a0original Fatal Frame. It was the first game game of the series to not be developed and/or published by Tecmo, \u00a0the first to not be released to a PlayStation console and also the first game of the main series to never be released outside of Japan. Fatal Frame IV was developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Nintendo on July 31, 2008 in Japan. Fatal Frame IV employed a brand new story and gameplay elements exclusive to the Nintendo Wii. The game centers around the motifs of the moon, memories and masks, and the dominant color throughout is a vibrant yellow, alluding the brightness of the moon against a dark sky.Synopsis  Ruka Minazuki looks towards Rougetsu Island as she approaches it from a boat. She travels to the island, her old childhood home, in hopes of uncovering memories she doesn't recall. She finally journeys to the island herself after two of her friends, Misaki Asou and Madoka Tsukimori, went themselves and have yet to return. The three girls are the only survivors of a kidnapping incident that occurred on the island ten years ago, however they have no recollection of the incident. They were rescued by a detective named Choushiro Kirishima, who found them underground, on the eve of the island's ceremonial Kagura dance. Shortly after the incident, the five kidnapped girls and their families were taken to live away from the island. However, a mysterious incident occurred on the island two years later, and none of its inhabitants were left alive. Now two of the kidnapped girls have died, and Ruka, Misaki and Madoka have taken it upon themselves to find the truth behind the island's mysterious deaths and their lost memories.Development  Tecmo, developer of the previous titles of the series, revealed the game was going to be released exclusively for the Nintendo Wii console. This signals a major break for the series, with the previous three titles having been released on Playstation 2 and eventually, Xbox. It was revealed the game would be developed with the help of Grasshopper Manufacture. The project was delayed, apparently to make way for Grasshopper's No More Heroes, which was subsequently released toward the end of 2007. Adding confusion and speculation about the game's development, in January 2008, it was revealed that Nintendo would play a heavy role in the game's development, with directorship roles shared between Shibata Makoto, who had previously been involved in the direction of the Fatal Frame series and Goichi Suda (commonly known as Suda 51) from the previously mentioned Grasshopper Manufacture. Although the game seemed to joint effort between Tecmo, Grasshopper and Nintendo, it was revealed that the game was going to be published under the Nintendo banner, further fueling speculation that Nintendo has purchased the Fatal Frame franchise from Tecmo.Release Issue  The game was released to the Japanese audience in July 31, 2008, however, release outside of Japan has been canceled. Reasons for the game being canceled overseas have not been clearly stated, as Tecmo has referred fans to Nintendo, and vice-versa. Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo America spoke in an interview with MTV Multiplayer concerning the game's publishing rights: Tecmo has also responded to fan inquiry with the following statement: Currently, the title will not be published in any territory outside of Japan.Glitches and Bugs Fan Translation Patch  In response to Nintendo and Tecmo's statements regarding the overseas cancellation of the title, a group of dedicated fans decided to create a patch that would allow imported copies of Fatal Frame IV to be played with any Nintendo Wii system. The patch is designed to bypass the console's region-locking feature and allow physical copies of the game disc to be played. In addition, the patch team translated in-game text into English and efforts to translate into more languages are currently underway. The patch was released on the team's website for free download on January 17, 2010. As of March 15th, 2016 the official website appears to be offline but alternative links to download patch content can be found in the 4.3 guide linked below. Wii users with a 4.3 menu need to follow special instructions to get the patch to load properly. The official one on the Patch site seems to have vanished but a new one has recently come into existence. Fatal Frame IV 4.3 English Patch GuideEnglish Dub Project  Another team of Fatal frame/Project Zero fans were working on an English-Dub project, however, this has been cancelled and will not be released anymore.Developers' thoughts  Keisuke Kikuchi (producer) and Makoto Shibata's (director) thoughts about the game:Sales in Japan  Fatal Frame IV was released on July 31.

The game focuses on Rei Kurosawa, a photographer who has recently lost her fianc\u00e9, Yuu Asou, in a tragic accident. Rei sees Yuu while taking photos of an old manor, however, and decides to follow him. In doing so, she falls under the curse of manor, where survivors of a disaster are tormented in their sleep by the ghosts of the dead. Like the previous game, Fatal Frame III features a dominant color throughout. The dominant color in this game is a luminescent but somber blue, signifying the themes of dreams and ethereal slumber.Synopsis  After following Yuu into the strange manor, Rei begins to \"visit\" the Manor of Sleep in her dreams at night in hopes of seeing him again. While exploring the manor's entrance, however, she is chased by a ghost wandering its halls. The ghost was covered in tattoos, and after being touched by her just once, Rei wakes from her nightmare and the same tattoo begins to appear on her body, causing her pain. When asleep, Rei returns to the manor every night, looking for the truth behind the Tattooed Curse, and eventually she finds out that only those who are sole survivors of a disaster are brought to the snowy manor. Miku Hinasaki, who lives with Rei and works as her assistant, was the only survivor of the Himuro Mansion in Fatal Frame, and she is brought into the nightmare as well. With her help, Rei is able to uncover the dark rituals that occurred inside the manor, and eventually doomed its inhabitants. The two must work fast to undo the darkness that grips the dream mansion before the curse of the tattoo consumes them, and they are forever trapped inside the nightmare.Plot  When Rei first enters the mansion in her dreams, she is chased by the ghost of a Tattooed Priestess, a shrine maiden of the Kuze Shrine. Rei discovers that their purpose is to be engraved by a sacred tattoo to stop the spread of The Rift, the divide between the land of the living and the land of the dead. To keep the Rift at bay, the tattoo, in the pattern of a Snake and Holly, is instilled with the pains of those who visit the shrine and offer it. This process, called the Piercing of the Soul\u00a0is done with ink made from the blood of the living and the dead, called Ink of the Soul. Through this ceremony, the tattooed priestess is able to take away the sorrows and suffering of those who come to the shrine, and stop the Rift from spreading. However, because of the agonizing pain she is under, measures must be taken to ensure the priestess will be at peace. At the end of the ritual, the priestess is taken to the Chamber of Thorns deep within the shrine and impaled inside its walls. She is then sung a lullaby to ensure that she falls into a deep sleep and never wakes from her pain. Through this Impalement Ritual, the priestess is kept from wandering the shrine, and allowing the pain engraved on her to affect others. The last Tattooed Priestess to undergo these rituals was a young woman named Reika Yukishiro. Reika came from a village beside the Kuze Shrine, where she met and fell in love with a man named Kaname Ototsuki. One day, when Kaname was away, disaster befell the village and Reika's whole family was killed. When the shrine offered to adopt Reika, she agreed, hoping that by becoming the Tattooed Priestess she would be able to ease the pain of those who have felt loss, as she has.  When the time to sleep in the Chamber of Thorns came, Reika was unable to forget Kaname, and her dreams began to affect him. Kaname visited the shrine and, with the help of a handmaiden, found Reika within the Chamber of Thorns. This was strictly against the code of the shrine, and when the Kuze Family Head found out, she rushed to the chamber and killed Kaname in front of the awake Reika. Devastated, Reika lost control of the tattoo's pain, allowing the Rift to be unleashed. In order to contain the Rift, the shrine's carpenters\u00a0and handmaidens were sacrificed to seal the shrine within a dream. But the Tattooed Priestess's pain could not be controlled, and those who survived disaster and suffer grief over the dead are haunted by the Manor of Sleep and the Tattooed Curse. Rei is lured into the manor as she continues to think of Yuu, however, those who continue to follow the dead into the manor are eventually consumed by the cursed tattoo and are forever trapped inside the dream. Miku hoped to be with her brother Mafuyu and so follows him deep into the manor. She eventually goes too far and becomes unable to wake from the dream. Rei is unable to bring her back and as things begin to seem hopeless, Yuu's friend Kei Amakura visits Rei in her home. Kei is the uncle of Mio and Mayu Amakura, and since the events of Fatal Frame II, Mio has been suffering from the Tattooed Curse and dreaming of the Manor of Sleep. Hoping to find a cure for his niece, Kei fervently researched the curse and the Kuze Shrine, but eventually, he began to enter the dream himself. Kei came to Rei to seek her insight and pay his respects to Yuu. Kei brings his research findings out and proposes his plan to Rei. Kei believes that to subdue the Tattooed Priestess for good, they must venture into the Chamber of Thorns and impale the priestess with the Tattooed Stakes\u00a0belonging to the handmaidens. Kei searched for the stakes and after finding them, enters the chamber. Upon entering, Kei begins to feel an enormous force, as if the chamber is engulfed in darkness. Kei attempts to impale Reika with the stakes, but he discovers that Reika has been pinned down the whole time. Suddenly, Reika begins to break free from her stakes, and before Kei is able to escape, the chamber doors seal shut. The next morning, Rei sees that Kei has been taken by the curse as well. Rei is determined to end this curse, and decides that she needs to enter the Chamber of Thorns herself. When Rei arrives, Reika rises and starts to pursue Rei. With the power of her determination, sixth sense and the Camera Obscura, Rei is able to defeat Reika, who falls and asks to finally be let to sleep.Endings  There is only one ending cinematic that plays after completing Fatal Frame III. However, after finishing the game at least once and fulfilling certain tasks during the next playthrough, an additional ending can be achieved where all main protagonists survive.Normal Ending (Ending 1)  Rei shuts Reika's eyes, saying that \"It's alright...to close your eyes now\". Rei goes farther past the Chamber of Thorns, and she reaches the Abyss of the Horizon. She sends Reika and Kaname's bodies on a boat across the waters of the abyss while singing the last verse of \"Sleeping Priestess\", allowing them to \"Go to the other side\". The souls of the dead then appear and follow suit, crossing the rift as brightly lit lanterns floating and drifting on the water. Rei then sees Yuu's soul among the mass of the departed and chases after him. Rei is determined to go with Yuu, believing that she should be by his side from now on, as he had been with her. Yuu turns to face Rei and embraces her, but says that he must go on alone. Before parting, he takes the cursed tattoo away from Rei and says that as long as Rei goes on living, he will continue to live on with her. Rei wakes up inside her home, and realizing what has happened, breaks into tears. It is then revealed that Miku was also spared from the curse, and the two now understand that they must continue to live on no matter what.Good Ending (Ending 2)  While the ending movie is the same as in the first, photos shown during the credits reveal a more positive conclusion to the story. During this playthrough, Kei Amakura does not disappear and leave behind a soot stain. Instead, he is shown waking up, as did Miku. The photos also show that Mio was eventually freed from the same curse, and was introduced to Miku and Rei. To achieve this ending, both pieces of the echostone earrings must have been found and Kyouka Kuze must be fought additional times.Misc. Info  Although the second ending hasn't been as canon to the series, Makoto Shibata (director and co-creator of the Fatal Frame series) has stated that he and the other game staff considered the second ending to be the canon ending due to the fact that all the main characters are alive and are free from the curse.Gameplay  Fatal Frame III is similar to the previous two games, in that the player controls the character of either Rei, Miku or Kei and uses the Camera Obscura to photograph clues and fight off ghosts. Like the previous games, it is also separated into phases, here called \"Hours\", and between hours the player is able to look around Rei's home during the day and gather research, before going to bed at night and entering the dream manor. One key difference is that certain photos taken in the mansion can be captured as Musty Film\u00a0in the real world, where it can be developed in Rei's dark room and used to gather information. After each \"Hour\", Rei wakes up back in the real world, however, as the plot proceeds the lines between the two worlds begin to blur for Rei. As a result, she starts to have visions of ghosts even when awake and the mysterious tattoo grows to cover an ever-increasing percentage of her body. The basic controls and mechanics have remained generally the same; there is a filament on-screen that indicates the presence of a ghost and the camera can be raised to enter Viewfinder Mode to investigate or to battle. The filament has an added capability, however. In addition to indicating whether the ghost is hostile or not, the filament also turns blue when a wandering ghost is unaware of the player's presence, and red when it knows the player's location, adding an element of stealth gameplay. The camera has a limited amount of film and thus film must constantly be stocked. Points are gained through defeating ghosts or by taking pictures of benign ghosts, and the points can go towards powering up the camera or purchasing the unlockables\u00a0obtained after beating the game. Like the previous games, there are short puzzle sequences scattered throughout the game, progressively increasing in difficulty and opening up more sections of the manor as the story goes on. In some chapters, the player has the opportunity to play as Miku or Kei. Each character has different special abilities, making each of their playing styles unique. Rei is capable of using the camera's flash to scare off some spirits, but can only use it a limited number of times. Miku has a special \"Sacred Stone\" charm that decreases the speed of spirits when used. Additionally, using her \"Double\" ability, she can double the camera's charge and damage. She can also crawl into smaller spaces and openings due to her smaller physical size. Kei, with his greater physical strength, can perform actions such as moving heavier objects or jumping from the roof of one building to another. However, as Kei's spritual capacity is weaker than that of either Rei or Miku, his camera obscura is significantly weaker and he must hide to avoid detection by spirits.Guidebook interview  An interview featured in the game's official guidebook, with Keisuke Kikuchi (producer) and Makoto Shibata (director), was published as below:Sales in Japan  Fatal Frame III was released on July 28.

The PlayStation 2 port was developed and published by Tecmo on November 27, 2003 in Japan and December 10, 2003 in North America, and was published by Ubisoft on April 30, 2004 in Europe. It was re-released as a \"PlayStation 2 Classic\" on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on May 7, 2013 in North America. The game also had a Director's Cut version released for the Xbox in 2004 and a remake entitled Fatal Frame II: Deep Crimson Butterfly released for the Nintendo Wii in 2012. The game resumes the characteristic use of a camera to fend off ghosts, only this time without the claim of being \"Based on a true story\". Despite this, Fatal Frame II is arguably the most known of the Fatal Frame series, due to its engaging story, refined use of the camera and abundant scares.Synopsis  The twin sisters, Mio and Mayu Amakura, are visiting a childhood play spot when Mayu, who walks with a limp after a childhood accident, follows a mysterious crimson butterfly deep into the woods. Mio, concerned for her sister, follows Mayu, and the two girls are led to a lost village. The village is curiously empty, and it is revealed to have been cursed by some past event, trapping the village in perpetual night. As the Amakura twins investigate, they discover the Camera Obscura and are set upon by the ghosts of the past villagers. Mayu is eventually led astray by the ghosts and Mio becomes determined to save Mayu and escape before they meet the same cursed fate as the village's former residents. However, Mio learns that in order to save her sister and escape the village, she must delve deeper into a ritual that was performed in the village: the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual, where one twin must kill the other.Plot  Mio and Mayu visit a spot in the forest that they used to play at during their childhood. The area is soon to be a dam site and the two sisters reminisce about the times they spent there. While remembering an accident in the forest that left Mayu's leg weak, Mio notices that her sister has disappeared. She sees Mayu chasing a crimson butterfly and, after following her, the two are spirited away into All God's Village (a.k.a. \"The Lost Village\" and \"Minakami Village\".) Unknown to the twins, the village is the site of a mysterious ritual that failed, causing the village to be trapped in continuous night and to disappear from the region, destined to relive the events of the ritual's failure forever. The two sisters discover a newspaper clipping and photo of a couple on the outskirts of the village and decide to investigate before leaving by entering one of the nearby family houses after seeing a female ghost entering it. Inside they find the abandoned Camera Obscura, as well as the diaries of a woman who came to the village in search of her missing boyfriend, which the twins assume to be the ghost they viewed previously. Upon finding her final diary, the woman's ghost attacks the sisters in anger, forcing Mio to use the camera to exorcise her. After defeating the female ghost, Mio passes out and learns in a vision that the ghost, Miyako Sudo, was trapped in the village and then strangled by her boyfriend's ghost, seemingly an act of madness after he was also trapped in The Lost Village. During this vision, brief scenes of a woman in a white kimono is shown, laughing maniacally, an event that is also described in Miyako's diaries and is implied to have been an influence in her mental disintegration before being found by her boyfriend and killed. Mio wakes up from the vision alone and sees her sister about to leave the house by herself, apologizing and saying that she must go. Mayu is then shown following a trail of crimson butterflies deeper into the village, stopping in an alleyway where an unknown woman in a white kimono is standing, facing away from her. Mio traces Mayu's path and is led towards the house of the village's ceremony master, the Kurosawa House. She views Mayu entering through the front gate, but cannot reach her in time, and discovers that the gate to the house is now locked, forcing her to go find the keys. When leaving the gate, Mio is also greeted by the crimson butterflies, which lead her to a storehouse where she meets an unnamed white-haired boy (Itsuki), who is locked inside the storehouse for unknown reasons. Itsuki says to Mio, whom he refers to as \"Yae\", that \"the ritual is about to start\" and the she and Sae must leave the village immediately. He tells Mio that \"Sae is about to start the ritual at the ceremony master's house,\" and tells her how to find the gate keys so she can go stop her. At this time, it is unknown to Mio why she is being called Yae, but there is no doubt that Itsuki's reference to Sae overlaps with Mio's twin, Mayu, who is also at the ceremony master's house, implying that Yae and Sae are also twins. Before departing, Itsuki tells Mio that if she cannot find a way to leave the village, to come back to him for assistance. Mio is now free to explore the village to search for the gate keys, which opens a new area at the back of the village where veiled priests are seen traveling up a path to a shrine housing an old mirror, along with an area atop a hill with an alter and torches being guarded by a group of angry villager ghosts. After retrieving the gate keys from their respective shrines, Mio makes her way to the ceremony master's house. Inside the Kurosawa house, Mio encounters more ghosts of the villagers and veiled priests who speak, saying things like \"the twins that become the sacrifice have returned\" and \"The Kusabi is coming\", though the Kusabi is not explained at the time. A scene then shows Mayu walking in a trance-like state through the house, murmuring \"The Repentance has begun. Everyone is dead,\" before entering a room where the unknown woman in the white, now bloody, kimono (Sae) is standing. After Mio also makes her way to that room, she receives a vision where the room is covered in dead bodies and Sae is standing in the middle, laughing maniacally, before an entity of a tormented man covered with ropes appears and begins to chase her. Unknown to Mio at the time, this ghost is called the Kusabi and it pursued and murdered many of the village's inhabitants during the Repentance, the disastrous result of the failed Crimson Sacrifice. Mio finally escapes the Kusabi and continues to look for her sister. In the house, she finds research from The Folklorist, Seijiro Makabe, which describes the Crimson Sacrifice ritual's purpose to seal the gate to hell and how it results in Twin Shrine Maidens becoming crimson butterflies that return to watch over the village. His research also finally reveals to the player that the Repentance is a reference to the disaster that occurs whenever all of the multiple attempted ceremonies that make up the Crimson Sacrifice ritual end up failing, a time when the gate to hell will open and release calamity, plunging the village into darkness. Later, a vision shows the Folklorist, along with his assistant, Ryozo Munakata, arriving at All God's Village in order to conduct this research and is interrupted multiple times with images showing the Folklorist being tied up in ropes, thus turning him into the Kusabi, though this process and connection is still not explained to the player. The Folklorist's research additionally reveals that Munakata is looking for his friends, the twin boys Itsuki and Mutsuki, in the village, but they are nowhere to be found. Mio finally reunites with Mayu, though she is beginning to show signs of possession, such as moving erratically and sometimes speaking as if she were someone else. Mayu claims that somebody was calling her to the house to perform the ritual again, but does not specify who. The girls now begin to collect butterfly diaries, which contain entries from both Yae and Sae, and finally begin to open up the backstory of their shrine experience, along with the events invlolving the aforementioned Kusabi. The first entry describes how the Folklorist is likely to be turned into the Kusabi (though that term is purposefully removed from the page) because they aren't ready for the ritual yet and they want to help him escape the village before that happens. Unable to escape through the house's front opening, the sisters try to pass through the basement. However, Mayu gets locked inside a prison cell while retrieving a key. The cell is held closed by a lock and the key for the lock is not nearby, so again the two must separate and Mayu has to wait for her sister to find the key. After leaving her sister behind, Mio is directed towards the Osaka house, where a family altar hides a passage to an underground storage cave. Mio searches for the key inside the cave, but mistakenly alerts the ghosts that haunt the village's underground. One of the ghosts drops the key that unlocks Mayu's cell and, after picking it up, Mio can either defeat the ghosts or avoid them. Key in hand, Mio returns to her sister's side. Upon Mio's return to the cell, however, she finds that Mayu has yet again disappeared. It is revealed that Mayu has entered the Kiryu House, another large house in the village, and is making her way to the Tachibana House through a bridge connecting the two houses. As the door to the Tachibana house is locked, Mio makes her way through the Kiryu house to retrieve her sister. While searching through the Kiryu house, Mio learns more about the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual, which involves one twin killing the other in order to protect the village from harm. The twin that is left after the ritual is referred to as the Remaining, and the Remainings suffer from so much grief that their hair turns white. Some time ago, twins born to the Kiryu house, Akane and Azami Kiryu, also underwent the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual. Eventually, Mio finds out that the bridge Mayu just crossed has somehow become locked, though there is another way, an underground tunnel, that Mio can use to enter the adjacent house. On her way through the tunnel, however, Mio is stalked by the ghost of the last Crimson Sacrifice Ritual, a woman in a bloody white kimono. While running from the ghost, Mio drops the Camera Obscura and has no choice but to exit the tunnel without it. Inside the Tachibana house, Mio is still being chased by the malicious spirit, but without the Camera Obscura to defend herself, Mio has no choice but to flee from the ghost, go back to the tunnel, and retrieve the camera. The tunnel is only one-way, so Mio must navigate through the Tachibana house and use the connecting bridge to return to the Kiryu house and re-enter the tunnel from there. The ghost follows Mio as she goes through the house, laughing and asking Mio if she is leaving her again. At some point, she also imitates Mayu's voice in an effort to trick Mio. Mio is able to avoid the ghost, return to the tunnel, and retrieve the camera. Moments later, upon entering the Tachibana house, she finds that the ghost with the bloody kimono is no longer in pursuit and she is able to resume her search for Mayu. While freely exploring the Tachibana house, Mio uncovers more of the village's history. It turns out that Itsuki also had a twin brother, Mutsuki Tachibana, and they had also performed the Crimson Sacrifice. Their ritual failed, however, and the villagers became desperate to prevent the Repentance from occurring. Mio is able to find Mayu, who seems to have regained her composure, and the two decide it's time to escape the village. They plan to use an escape tunnel beneath the village's shrine, which was sealed off after a set of twins in the past used it and were caved in. Mio knows how to unseal the entrance to the tunnel, however, and she heads to the Old Tree, where the mechanism to open the way is located. In order to open the tunnel, Mio needs to gather the four crests that are held by each household of the village. Mio has already picked up the Tachibana crest while inside the Tachibana house, and so she must collect the remaining three crests in the other locations. However, Mayu is tired and must rest while her sister gathers the crests. While unconscious, Mayu repeats phrases related to the three locations of the remaining crests: As Mio places her hand on Mayu's shoulder, she is swept into a vision that Mayu's sixth sense reveals. In the vision, Mio is walking down a path leading to the Hellish Abyss deep below the village. It is there that the Crimson Sacrifice takes place and, upon arriving at the abyss, she is shown that her sister has already fallen within. Determined to save her sister, Mio finds the other three crests, but before returning, she heads to the storehouse to see Itsuki one last time. When she arrives, she learns that Itsuki was imprisoned in the storehouse for helping Yae and Sae escape. The escape failed, however, and only Yae was able to leave the village. Sae was brought back to fulfill the ritual alone and Itsuki was locked in the storehouse. Unable to bear the grief of failing his brother and friends, Itsuki took his own life by hanging himself inside the cell. Like Mio, Sae went to the storehouse to see him one final time, but she arrived too late. Mio returns to the old tree and unseals the tunnel out of the village. While on their way to the tunnel, however, Mayu is captured by the ghosts of the villagers, who want to use her to complete the ritual yet again. Mio makes her way to the Kurosawa house, where the way to the abyss is found. Upon reaching the abyss, Mio is shown what occurred on the day the village was swallowed in darkness. Since only Yae had escaped the village, the people panicked, not knowing if they should continue with the ritual. Sae waited for her sister to return, believing in the promise they made to always be together. In the end, the villagers decided that the ritual must go on or else the malice spilling out of the abyss will be too much. Sae was taken to the abyss alone and was hanged before being thrown in. Because the ritual was meant for one twin to kill the other, Sae's sacrifice failed, and her corrupted spirit returned from the abyss, bringing the darkness that engulfed the entire village. Along with Sae, the ghost of the Kusabi, an earlier sacrifice, returned and the two spirits unleashed their vengeance on the villagers in what was known as the Repentance. Sae and the Kusabi slaughtered the people of the village, while Sae's laughter filled the air. Sae vowed to wait forever for her sister, however, and when Mio and Mayu arrived, the villagers' spirits saw their chance to repeat the ritual to free themselves. Sae possessed Mayu, determined to repeat her sacrifice, but this time Mio would be there to be by her sister's side. Depending on the game's difficulty and the player's choice, Mio must defeat the ghost of the Kusabi or Sae herself and, once doing so, frees herself and the village from the curse of the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual.Endings  There are four potential endings for the game. Two can be obtained by completing the game on varying difficulties, while one is exclusive to the Director's Cut version of the game for the Xbox.Crimson Butterfly ending  Finding Mayu in time, Mio looks to see the ghosts lining up in a circle as she goes to tug at Mayu. Mayu says to her sister that there is no other way out but to finish the ritual, and Mio has no choice but to take her sister's life. Mio's hands are placed on Mayu's neck and soon enough Mayu is dead. The ghosts pick Mayu up, throwing her into the Hellish Abyss, completing the ritual. A single crimson butterfly soars up, and Mio chases after it in tears. She says how sorry she is before finally seeing Mayu is leading her to the gate. It is then seen swarms of the butterflies, all from the past rituals before the final scene shows. Moments later, Mio is shown sitting on a bench near the newly formed lake, her neck showing a crimson mark of what looks like a single butterfly, symbolizing the twins becoming one. According to the events in Fatal Frame III: The Tormented, this is considered the canon ending.Hellish Abyss ending  Running to save her sister, Mio finds Mayu possessed and about to jump, but Mio takes her hand saves her at the last moment. In doing so, the ghost of Sae is expelled from Mayu's body and falls into the Hellish Abyss. However, while pulling her sister up, Mio accidentally gazes into the abyss. The sight of the souls inside the abyss rushes into Mio's eyes and permanently blinds her. Mayu then recounts how the two escaped the village and were found unconscious in the woods. She also states that the village exists no more. The camera reveals the two sitting on a bench overlooking the new lake, Mio's eyes covered with bandages. Mayu then says that it's her turn to take care of Mio now.Runaway ending  Mio realizes she cannot keep her promise to Mayu and runs away alone through the tunnel beneath Kureha Shrine. While running, she hears Sae's voice asking \"Are you leaving me again?\". She hesitates, hearing Itsuki's voice tell her not to look back. She turns around after hearing Mayu's voice call out, only to see a menacing Sae moving towards her. Mio freezes in shock and fear as Sae approaches her and everything goes black. A moment later, Mio wakes up by a river, alone. Worried, she calls out to Mayu repeatedly, but receives no answer. Both Sae and Mayu now wait forever for their sisters. This ending is achieved by exiting underneath Kureha shrine instead of going to the Kurosawa house to save Mayu. This scene is much less of an ending than the others, resulting in a Game Over screen, rather than the finishing credits. The ending is given the name \"Lingering Scent\" in the Gallery of the Xbox Director's Cut version.Promise ending  Mio is running down a tunnel to get to the sacrificial site. When she sees Mayu heading towards the abyss in a trance, she calls out her name and runs to her. The priests banging their staffs vanish and, as Mio runs, Yae's spirit appears out of her. Yae walks toward Mayu, who takes the form of Sae as she turns around to face her twin. Yae apologizes for leaving her sister alone and Sae forgives her. The twins join hands and walk towards the pit, promising to be together for eternity. Realizing that they both intend to jump, Mio runs towards to Sae, who is using Mayu as a host. She wraps her arms around Sae's waist and pulls Mayu out of her just before Yae and Sae jump into the abyss. With the successful completion of the ritual, the crimson butterflies fly from the pit and go off into the sky. The souls of the villagers and victims of the Repentance are seen throughout the village, watching the butterflies. Mio and Mayu leave the village, hand in hand. Mayu confesses that she was overwhelmed by the fact that they would live and die separately. Mio tells her that, even though that will happen, she'll never let Mayu go again. The sun rises and the game ends on a happy note.Deep Crimson Butterfly (Wii Edition) Endings  These endings aren't canon, but serve as addition for this version of the game.Shadow Festival Ending  Mio encounters the Kusabi one last time, but it takes some time for her to defeat it (more than 5 minutes), and as a result causes the events from All God's Village to repeat itself. Seemingly tired from the Kusabi fight, Mio stumbles in an attempt to move forward. After a few steps she stops at the first shrine before the stairs and sees the ghosts of the people that were performing the ritual fleeing upstairs, screaming that The Repentance was coming. Immediately becoming worried, she quickly tries to get to where Mayu is, only to see her kneeling close to the Abyss. Mayu, possessed by Sae, starts talking to Mio, who now sees her as Yae, saying that The Repentance was coming towards the surface. Though she was happy to see that Mio/Yae returned for her, she was still sad that it was too late, and that she would have preferred for Mio/Yae to have abandoned her so that they were \"at least saved\". Meanwhile, The Repentance starts to pour out from the Abyss, about to shroud the village in darkness. Mio, surrendering, kneels close to Mayu and admits that it would be hard to live without her, with all \"the sadness and pain\" she would have to endure, but that she was happy to be with her, even if it was for \"such a short time\". The scene quickly switches to a flashback from both Mio and Mayu's childhood, where they are both wearing kimonos with different colors and patterns, seemingly enjoying a Red Lantern festival. Both appear to be very happy to be with each other, and proceed to let go of their lanterns where they float up towards the sky together. After that the scene changes to the present, where a still imprisoned Itsuki, after encountering a crimson butterfly, suddenly looks out the window to see The Repentance coming towards the village. Not long after the entire village becomes shrouded in an inky darkness, repeating the events of the village's tragic past. After that, both Mio and Mayu are seen shrouded by a deep darkness, apparently nude, but covered by a golden cloth and cuddled against each other. It is interesting to note that they are both positioned just like the twins shown in the Twin Maiden stones in not only the game, but also the ones in real lifeFrozen Butterfly Ending  After exorcising Sae from Mayu's body, Mayu pulls Mio's hands close, encircling them around her neck with the intent of becoming one but Mio pulls away, refusing. Mayu tells her she always knew her sister could never do such a thing and how she loves her because of that. She tells her that, as long as they are together, she doesn't care if she has to live in hell and starts laughing and crying at the same time. A flashback is shown in which Mayu had temporarily snapped under the pain and stress of going through a near death experience, laughing and crying simultaneously. It can be interpreted that Mayu had always been mentally unstable since that moment or that Sae had been in possession of her since their childhood. Mayu asks her sister to stay in the village with her forever as she encloses her hands around Mio's neck. A crimson butterfly flutters it's way across a room full of dead and marred bodies to land on the sleeve of an inert Mio whose head is being stroked by Mayu in her lap. With the roles for the having been ritual reversed, Mayu and her sister's body remain trapped in the village for eternity. At the end of the credits, it is shown Mayu in the doll room, making up Mio's lips. She looks at her sister, kisses her on the cheek, as Mio seems to be crying, then holds her head.Gameplay  Fatal Frame II uses gameplay mechanics very similar to its predecessor, with some changes and updates. For most of the game the player controls Mio Amakura, except for some short scenes where it controls her elder twin sister Mayu. Mio's only weapon is the Camera Obscura, an antique camera with the ability to take pictures of ghosts and exorcise them. Like in the previous game, special film types and lenses can be found that increase the damage it can deal. The camera's native functions and the special lenses can be upgraded using Spirit Orb's found in the game and points earned from photographing ghosts. The camera also features an unique filament which glows red when facing a hostile ghost or blue when there is a non-hostile ghost nearby. During the game, Mio has to explore the entire village area and its central buildings, and needs to find various objects and solve puzzles in order to advance. In addition to hostile ghosts, there are numerous vanishing and hidden spirits Mio can photograph to receive clues or reveal the story of the village. The game is divided into chapters, mostly related to certain areas which Mio visits as she chases after her sister. The total number of chapters is nine, with a special tenth chapter available in hard and nightmare difficulty settings. The game has a new game plus feature, where the player can start a new game while keeping its camera with all the special functions, lenses and upgrades from the previous playthrough, as well as all the stored health supports and film. Over multiple playthroughs the player can unlock various bonus content, including a mission mode, different outfits, gallery features and special lenses for the camera. In mission mode, the player is presented with a challenge, usually to kill certain ghosts as quickly as possible or getting the highest points possible.Director's Cut gameplay  The director's cut edition for Xbox also has an FPS mode, where the player can play through the entire game in first person. This does a lot in fixing the problems inherent with fixed camera locations. Unfortunately, the FPS mode also takes away some of the game's atmosphere. The Xbox version also included a survival mode, a new ending, enhanced graphics, a greater number of alternate costumes to unlock and a shop, where the player can trade points from pictures for items.Reception  The game's aesthetic presentation was highly praised by both critics and fans alike. As the name would suggest, the dominant color for the game was a brilliant red, creating a very bold and striking contrast in comparison to much of the game's shadowed and nocturnal settings. The title was ranked #2 in Gametrailers' \"Top Ten Scariest Games\" in 2006, and #3 in X-Play's \"Top Ten Scariest Games of All Time\". Game Informer ranked it number one on a similar list.Translation differences  While the English translation of the game is generally of high quality, one important thing could not be carried over from the original Japanese. In Japanese, Mio calls Mayu \"Onee-chan\", meaning literally \"big sister\", clearly indicating the order of the twins. While this is perfectly normal in Japanese, it would sound odd in English, and therefore Mio calls Mayu by her name instead. Because of this, there isn't anything in the English translation that would tell the player which of the twins is the elder, while in Japanese it was clear that Mio was the younger and therefore destined to be sacrificed - until the revelation near the end that in the village's tradition the twin order is reversed, and Mio's fate is to sacrifice her sister instead. This revelation is largely lost in the translation.Interview with the developers  An interview with Makoto Shibata (director) and Keisuke Kikuchi (producer), was published as below:Sales in Japan  Fatal Frame II was released on November 27.

Miku comes from a family susceptible to the paranormal, and, like others in her family, is able to utilize the Camera Obscura, a unique camera that has the ability to see the impossible and capture images of the other side. She and her brother, Mafuyu, were introduced as the first protagonists of the franchise when they became trapped as soon as they set foot in the haunted Himuro Mansion. Miku is also featured as one of the main protagonists and playable characters in the third entry into the series, Fatal Frame III: The Tormented, as well as a supporting character in Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water. With her heightened paranormal abilities, she is again tasked with handling the Camera Obscura to shed light on the surrounding mysteries.Biography Background  Miku was first introduced when she was 17 and in high school (college in American and European versions). After her father died and her mother tragically committed suicide, Miku has lived under the care of her older brother, Mafuyu, whom she is very close to. Like their mother and grandmother, Miku and Mafuyu have been gifted with a sixth sense, giving them the ability to see things normal people aren't able to. Miku's mother, after inheriting the Camera Obscura from her mother, suffered because of this sixth sense and went mad, ultimately hanging herself on a tree in their home's garden.Fatal Frame  After her brother hasn't returned from his investigation of the Himuro Mansion, Miku becomes worried and decides to look for him herself. She enters the mansion and picks up where he left off, finding the Camera Obscura her brother took with him. While on the trail of her brother, however, Miku encounters a powerful ghost, the ghost of the last Rope Shrine Maiden. She is able to escape the ghost, but not without falling under the curse of the Strangling Ropes\u00a0that tore the shrine maiden apart in the Strangling Ritual. Now, Miku must find a way to reverse the effects of the Strangling Ritual before the ropes appear on all her limbs and she is swallowed by the darkness. After thoroughly searching the mansion, Miku uncovers the truth behind the disaster that occurred there, and why all who venture into the mansion never return. The last Strangling Ritual had failed and resulted in the Calamity, spilling Malice\u00a0throughout the mansion. The Malice consumed the people, killing and driving them mad. Because of this, the spirit of the Rope Shrine Maiden, Kirie Himuro, became malevolent, inflicting the pain she suffered on all who enter the mansion. Miku also uncovers that in order to fight the malice, she must recover the pieces of a Holy Mirror, used to seal the Hell Gate from which the Malice has escaped. After doing so, Miku frees Kirie from the Malice's grip, as well as her brother Mafuyu. Realizing what has happened, Kirie decides to fulfill her sacred duty as the Rope Shrine Maiden and seals the Hell Gate, binding herself before it so that it may never open again. The mansion grounds begin to collapse, prompting Miku and Mafuyu to escape. Mafuyu decides not to leave, however, saying that he wishes to stay with Kirie if that will ease her unending pain. Miku reluctantly leaves the mansion, and when she gets out, she sees the souls of the dead rise up the sky and find their peace. Miku notes that from that day on, she was never able to see the impossible again.Fatal Frame III: The Tormented  Prior to the events of Fatal Frame, Mafuyu entrusted Miku under his good friend, Yuu Asou's care should anything happen. Yuu took Miku in after Mafuyu's disappearance, and they lived together in the home of Yuu's finace\u00e9, Rei Kurosawa. There, Miku worked as Rei's assistant, helping by researching and accompanying her on photographing sessions. Unfortunately, Yuu was killed in a car crash, which Rei survived, and since then Miku and Rei have been plagued by the Tattooed Curse\u00a0besetting those who survive death and disaster. For Miku, part of the Manor of Sleep that she enters in her dreams presents itself as a manifestation of the Himuro Mansion, where she re-lives her harrowing experience. A handmaiden of the Kuze Shrine, however, seeks Miku's help. She asks Miku to save two people, the Tattooed Priestess and the handmaiden's brother. As the handmaiden directs Miku, telling her \"big brother's over here\", Miku begins to believe that she is being led to Mafuyu. Miku follows further and further into the Manor of Sleep, eventually until she meets Mafuyu one last time. Miku decides to follow Mafuyu, regretting her survival in the past, and she is consumed by the Tattooed Curse and falls into an endless sleep.Fate  Miku's fate remains the same regardless of the ending achieved in Fatal Frame III. After freeing the souls lost in the Manor of Sleep, Rei effectively reverses the curse of the Holly Tattoo\u00a0that plagues her and Miku. Miku wakes from her sleep and says that although she never understood why she survived, she realizes why they were allowed to live.Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water  She went missing when her daughter, Miu Hinasaki was 3. She is believed to be on Mt. Hikami. Miku appears in a cutscene in\u00a0Fatal Frame V, in which Mafuyu and her are joined by the\u00a0Yuukon\u00a0ritual, a form of posthumous marriage. Miku speaks often of Mafuyu and her longing to be with him again. Her daughter, Miu, is revealed to be a\u00a0Yomi Ko, the child of a dead person and a living one, and it is heavily implied in the game that Mafuyu is Miu's father, though this was not confirmed until the release of the\u00a0official guidebook. The guidebook explains that Miu was conceived in Miku's dream at the end of Fatal Frame 3, when she and Mafuyu were able to meet briefly at the\u00a0Abyss of the Horizon.Story  Miku, feeling the end of her life very soon approaching, goes to Mountain Hikami to perform the Yuukon ritual, which is a marriage ritual between the living and the dead, with her beloved brother Mafuyu, in order to be able to be with him in the afterlife and help ease his suffering at the hell gate.Fate Appearance  In her debut in Fatal Frame Miku's appearance was designed to resemble Japanese style school uniforms, the most prominent feature being the ribbon in the front of her blouse. She also wears a choker around her neck similar to her brother's, as well as a comb passed down from her grandmother to tie her long hair. For the US and Xbox releases of Fatal Frame, Miku's appearance made some noticeable changes. The focal ribbon was removed and her blouse and skirt were made to look more streamlined and mature. Her face was also edited to make it less round, give her redder lips, slightly smaller eyes and lighter hair. For her appearance in Fatal Frame III: The Tormented, Miku wears a different outfit while her basic features were unchanged. Her blouse and skirt are now more colorful and she wears simple shoes with stockings instead of boots. Miku's cursed tattoo is also significantly different from all others found in the game. Her tattoo is colored red, rather than the more common blue, and has a slightly different pattern from the traditional Snake and Holly.Alternate costumes  Miku, like all playable characters in the series, sports a variety of alternate costumes. They include: Fatal Frame Fatal Frame III AccessoriesTrivia Mio Amakura  Mio Amakura is the main character in Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly, and also makes a cameo appearance in\u00a0Fatal Frame III: The Tormented. Mio is also the younger twin sister of Mayu Amakura. She is a direct descendant of Dr. Kunihiko Asou, the creator of the Camera Obscura\u00a0and\u00a0Spirit Stone Radio. Mio and her sister have always been together, however, as the two become trapped in the Lost Village and the events of the past unfold, Mio must face incredible darkness if she and her sister are ever to escape.Biography Background  Mio and Mayu grew up in the Minakami region, where they frequently played in the forest. One day, while running down a high forest path, her younger twin sister, Mayu, slipped off the path and fell, injuring her leg. Since then, Mio has been very protective over her sister, blaming herself for the accident. It was also in the Minakami forest that Mio and Mayu's father disappeared, a mystery that compelled their mother, Shizu Amakura, to move the family away from the region. Years later, Shizu fell severely ill, and was subsequently hospitalized. Shizu asked her younger brother, Kei, to look after the girls in her stead, and it is then that they hear of the scheduled building of a dam in the area of their childhood home.Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly  Mio and Mayu are introduced as they reminisce of their childhood in the forests surrounding the Minakami region. A dam will soon be built to flood the region, and so the sisters spend one last day remembering their time there, including the day of Mayu's accident. Suddenly, Mayu leaves Mio's sight as she hypnotically chases a crimson-colored butterfly. After following her sister, the forest grows dark and the two find themselves in All God's Village, a \"Lost Village\" rumored to spirit away those who come near, and trap them under the village's eternal night.  Mio decides to investigate, and after entering the nearest house\u00a0and exploring, they come across the Camera Obscura and are then attacked by a ghost of a woman who previously became trapped in the village. With the camera's help, Mio is able to exorcise the spirit, however, she is separated from her sister after the attack, and Mio must search for her and a way to escape the cursed village. Although Mio is able to fend off the hostile ghosts, Mayu is vulnerable to their calls, and she is lured into becoming the next Twin Shrine Maiden to be sacrificed in the village's Crimson Sacrifice Ritual. Mio learns that the ritual consists of the sacrifice of the younger (the first born according to the village's custom) twin, who is thrown into the Hellish Abyss to prevent darkness from entering the world. The ritual is carried out in order to protect the village and ensure peace, but when the last ritual failed, it caused the Repentance, killing all the villagers and wiping the village off the map. In order to free the village from darkness, the ghosts seek to repeat the ritual using Mio and Mayu. Mio hopes to retrieve her sister so that they may escape the village; however, the ghost of the last Twin Shrine Maiden, Sae Kurosawa, has possessed Mayu and is bent on performing the sacrifice through her body. With the help of a white-haired boy named Itsuki, Mio is able to follow her sister and uncover the village's history and customs.Ending  Ignoring Itsuki's warnings, Mio follows the possessed Mayu deep into the underground tunnels of the village, where the ritual physically occurs. When she gets there, Mayu is convinced that she must complete the ritual to save the village, and to become one with Mio. Reluctantly, Mio is made to wrap her hands around her sister's neck, strangling her until she is lifeless. Mayu's body is then cast into the Hellish Abyss, and the ritual is complete. Mio, in utter disbelief, cries out for her sister and follows the crimson butterflies that rise from the abyss. Mio chases after the butterflies, saying to her sister that she is sorry, while they break the sky and make way for the sun. Later, Mio is shown sitting on a bench before the newly formed lake. A close-up reveals the mark of the crimson butterfly appearing on her neck, symbolizing her becoming one with Mayu.Alternate endings  There are three alternate endings to Mio's story in Fatal Frame II that aren't considered canon, but are achievable nonetheless. One, the Promise Ending, is only available in the Xbox release of the game.Hellish Abyss ending  If the player has beaten the game at least once and the game is set to \"hard\" difficulty, the \"Hellish Abyss\" ending is achieved in the end. After reaching the abyss, Mio confronts her sister, who has become fully possessed by Sae. Mio battles with the insane ghost, and after the final shot, Mio quickly pulls her sister away from Sae's grasp. Sae falls yet again into the abyss, while Mayu hangs on to her sister's hand. While trying to pull Mayu up, Mio accidentally glimpses into the abyss and is permanently blinded by sight of the writhing, tormented souls at its bottom. Later, both sisters are shown looking towards the newly formed lake, and Mayu comments on how it is her turn to look after Mio from now on.Promise Ending  This ending is achieved by playing at \"Nightmare\" difficulty on the Xbox version of the game. After pursuing her sister and reaching the abyss, the ghosts of the Veiled Priests suddenly disappear, and Yae Kurosawa's spirit emerges from\u00a0Mio's body. Mayu, now possessed by Sae, turns to face her, and after apologizing, Yae joins with her sister and the two decide to complete the ritual together. Before they jump into the abyss, Mio quickly pull's her sister's body away from Sae. The Kurosawa twins fall and later emerge as a single crimson butterfly, uttering a \"thank you\" to Mio and Mayu. As countless other butterflies flutter out of the abyss, the skies above the village clear, and the souls of the villagers are finally at peace. Mayu tells her sister how afraid she was and how she now realizes that Mio has always been with her. Mio adds that she will never let Mayu go again.The Lingering Scent Ending  Another ending is available on both systems; however, this one results in a \"Game Over\" rather than completing the game. Mio chooses to leave her sister behind and escape through an underground passage beneath Kureha Shrine. As she runs through the tunnel, she hears Sae's voice asking, \"Are you leaving me again?\" Mio hesitates at first, but remembers that she must not look back. Suddenly, she hears Mayu's voice uttering their promise to stay together. Mio turns around, is rushed by Sae and passes out. After waking up, Mio finds that she has returned to forest where she and her sister were in the beginning. She calls out for Mayu, but sees that she is nowhere to be found. As the screen fades to black, Mayu's voice can be heard, saying that she will wait for her sister forever.Fatal Frame III: The Tormented  Since escaping the Lost Village and becoming a Remaining, Mio has been wrapped in guilt and grief over losing her sister. Mio felt so much regret that she soon began to enter the Manor of Sleep in her dreams, hoping to be able to join her sister. Mio has been trapped in the dream since, unable to wake up, and her uncle, Kei Amakura, becomes desperate to find a cure. Kei eventually seeks the help of Rei Kurosawa, who has been looking for a way to break the manor's curse since she too, began to dream of it. Kei continues to find out as much as he can about the mysterious manor, and with Rei's help, he hopes to put an end to the fearsome curse and rescue his niece.Fate  Mio's ultimate fate has not been specified as there are two endings for Fatal Frame III. In the first ending, Kei is taken by the Tattooed Curse and Mio is not shown waking up from the curse. A second ending is available where Kei does survive, and after Rei breaks the curse, Mio is shown in the credits to have broken free as well. Kei later introduces Mio to Rei and Miku Hinasaki, bringing the protagonists of the first three games of the series to a positive ending. In the ending where Mio appears and is introduced to Miku and Rei, Makoto Shibata (director and co-creator of the Fatal Frame series) has stated in an interview and his twitter account that he and the other game staffs considered\u00a0this to be the true and canon ending.Appearance  Mio dresses in similar manner as her sister, with the same basic color scheme. There are noticeable differences, including Mio's more open shirt, white skirt with leggings that look like pants, and simple black shoes as opposed to boots. Both sisters retain the red bow at the center of their shirts, alluding to the crimson butterflies central to the plot. Mio has her bangs on the left side of her face. Although she isn't shown for an extended amount of time, Mio appears inside the Manor of Sleep in Fatal Frame III wearing similar clothes to her previous role. During the second ending, however, she is shown being introduced to Rei and Miku wearing a different shirt and skirt, and if looked closer, her outfit bears a slightly to strong resemblance to her school uniform.Alternate costumes  Including those exclusive to the Xbox version, Mio has a total of 14 unlockable costumes and 5 extra accessories. How to unlock each one on both consoles is provided as well.Costumes Accessories  Note: Accessories B-E must be purchased in Extras mode in order for the player to be able to wear them.Related items  Files: Photos:Trivia Fatal Frame  Fatal Frame, or Zero in Japan and Project Zero in Europe, is a Japanese survival horror game and the first installment in the Fatal Frame series. It was first\u00a0released for the PlayStation 2, and later for the Xbox. The PlayStation 2 version was developed and published by Tecmo on December 13, 2001 in Japan and March 4, 2002 in North America, and was published by Wanadoo on August 30, 2002 in Europe. It was re-released as a \"PlayStation 2 Classic\" on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on April 9, 2013 in North America.\u00a0 It is the first game of the Fatal Frame series, introducing the franchise's unique premise of fighting ghosts with a special camera.Synopsis  Set in 1986, the story begins with an aspiring folklorist, Mafuyu Hinasaki, decides one night to investigate the Himuro Mansion, a place that is said to be haunted, in search of renowned folklorist Junsei Takamine. He brings with him a family heirloom, a special camera that has the power to \"expose things the normal eyes can't see\". Mafuyu enters the mansion and discovers that the ghosts of those who have perished in the mansion are roaming the empty halls. After fending off a violent ghost and seeing the power of the camera for himself, Mafuyu decides to continue his search. As he attempts to return to the entrance hall of the mansion, however, a dark presence surrounds him, and Mafuyu's fate is unknown. Two weeks later, Mafuyu's sister, Miku, arrives before the mansion. Fearing the worst may have happened to her brother, she takes it upon herself to enter the mansion and find him. Inside she finds the camera that Mafuyu brought with him, and, continuing his investigation, finds out the truth about the folklorist who went missing. Takamine came to the mansion to document the grisly events that occurred there long ago. In his progress, he uncovers the mysterious Strangling Ritual that took place in the mansion, but before he and his assistants could leave the haunted grounds, they were set upon by the spirits that were killed in the aftermath of the failed ritual. Miku continues deeper into the mansion, determined to find the truth and her missing brother. The story gets worse and worse by every room Miku enters, when later on she finds out that the Shrine Maiden (who is dead) looks for Mafuyu too.Plot  During her time in the mansion, Miku sees various apparitions of her missing brother, leading her towards solving the mystery of the mansion. Eventually, Miku learns that the Himuro Mansion was the site of many horrific rituals, the main one being the Strangling Ritual which was designed to keep the Hell Gate located beneath the mansion closed and protect the region from harm. The ritual would require a woman within the family to become the Rope Shrine Maiden, who is selected and hidden away for ten years with little contact with anyone, so she would have no attachments to the world. Beneath the mansion is an expansive cavern, where the final acts of the ritual culminates. The Rope Shrine Maiden is purified and taken to a large stone pedestal, where five ropes are tied to her limbs and neck. The ropes are connected to five pillars, symbolizing the five head families of the surrounding region. These pillars are turned, causing the maiden great pain until her limbs are torn from her body. The ropes, stained by the sacred blood of the sacrificed maiden, are then used to tie the doors of the Hell Gate closed, thus preventing The Malice\u00a0within from escaping and causing catastrophe. The ritual failed, however, and the disaster known as The Calamity occurred when the last Rope Shrine Maiden, Kirie Himuro, failed to sever her attachments from the world. While she was isolated within the mansion, Kirie met and fell in love with a man who stayed at the mansion and bore a striking resemblance to Mafuyu Hinasaki. The Himuro family began to fear her growing attachment, and after confining her to her room, the family master ordered the man to be killed. Kirie learned of his death before the final moments of the ritual, and her regrets caused the ritual to fail. The Malice poured forth from the gate, killing most within the mansion and driving the rest mad. The malice attached itself to the spirit of Kirie, twisting her into a vengeful ghost bent on making others experience the pain and misery she went through. Apart from the ghost of the Rope Shrine Maiden was the spirit of a Girl in White Kimono, guiding Miku along her investigation. This is the embodiment of Kirie's more innocent self, tied to her sacred duty as the Rope Shrine Maiden. Ever since the Malice erupted from the Hell Gate, the mansion has been trapped in darkness and the souls of all who perished inside are unable to rest. Junsei Takamine and his assistants, Koji Ogata and Tomoe Hirasaka, were caught in the darkness upon setting foot inside and they fell to Kirie's wrath. They are cursed with the same gruesome fate that befell the Rope Shrine Maiden and become violent ghosts themselves. When Mafuyu entered the mansion, he became trapped as well, however, because he resembled Kirie's lover so much, he was allowed to live. After being trapped inside the Himuro grounds, Miku nearly falls to the curse of the strangling ropes, but on the fourth night she takes the final path of the Rope Shrine Maiden and finds Mafuyu before the Hell Gate. They call out to each other, but before Mafuyu can reach out to Miku, Kirie pulls him back, saying \"We will always be together\". Miku uses the powers of the camera obscura to exorcise Kirie's ghost, but she is overpowered and the camera is thrown to the ground and broken. Before succumbing to the malicious ghost, Miku sees the girl in the white kimono point towards the broken camera. She is really pointing at the shinning fragment that came from within the camera, the final piece of the Holy Mirror\u00a0used as a last resort against the Malice. Miku has uncovered all other of its pieces while searching the mansion, and after assembling them, she is able to banish the evil that possesses Kirie, freeing her spirit and Mafuyu from the Malice.Endings  There are two possible ending cinematic that plays after completing the game. The second scene is only available after beating the game in \"Nightmare\" mode. Additionally, a third ending can be obtained on the Xbox release by completing the game on \"Fatal\" mode.Normal ending  After freeing Kirie from the Malice with the Holy Mirror, the girl in the white kimono appears and points towards the Hell Gate, saying \"Don't forget your duty\". Resolute, Kirie rises and walks towards the Hell Gate and wills the ropes to tie around her wrists binding herself in front of the Gate so that it will never open again. Suddenly, the cavern starts to shake and crumble. Kirie tells Miku and Mafuyu that she must remain to block the Hell Gate and they should escape. Miku and Mafuyu start running, but Mafuyu stops and tells Miku that he cannot leave Kirie alone. He stays behind to comfort Kirie from her endless pain, and tells Miku to escape. Outside of the mansion, as she watches the souls of those trapped in the house float gently into the sky, Miku comments that, after that day, she no longer saw things that other people didn't. This ending is considered canon due to the events in Fatal Frame III: The Tormented.Mafuyu ending  This ending is achieved by completing the game in \"Nightmare\" difficulty. Kirie closes the Hell Gate, and binds the sacred ropes around her wrists to prevent it from ever opening again. The cavern begins to quake and Kirie tells Miku and Mafuyu that they must escape. Mafuyu hesitates for a moment, but he and Miku quickly exit the crumbling mansion. The two watch the sky outside as the souls of the mansion's dead float and find their peace. Mafuyu, in a sad tone, speaks of how Kirie has sacrificed her entire life, and will forever be in pain in order for their souls to be at peace.Photograph ending  This ending is achievable only on the Xbox version. It is obtained by completing the game in \"Fatal\" difficulty. The cinematic of this ending is identical to the \"Mafuyu Ending\" found in the Playstation 2 version, however, the change occurs in the game's credits. During the credits sequence, it is also revealed through photographs that Kirie finds solace beneath the mansion when she is reunited with the soul of her lover. The two embrace and the game ends in a happy note for both main characters and Kirie.Gameplay  Fatal Frame was the first to introduce the innovative use of an old-style camera as the primary weapon. In addition to navigating the main characters around the mansion grounds, players are able to enter Viewfinder Mode, where the camera is raised and the view changes to that of the camera's frame. In viewfinder mode the player is able to snap photographs of ghosts, both violent and benign, which is the main method of progressing through the game. Items are also available, some being consumable and most being key items needed to unlock doors, complete tasks or solve puzzles. Puzzles are encountered frequently in the game, some being based on the same concept but becoming progressively more difficult. The varying difficulty settings of the game (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Fatal (Xbox only)) determine the amount of consumable items scattered throughout the mansion and how formidable the enemies are. The main horror aspect of the game is, undoubtedly, the ghosts. The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player. The ghosts' appearances are usually inspired by their deaths or by Japanese stigmas of horror, which, some argue, are particularily chilling. The game, depending on which console it is played on, offers two endings. Upon completion of the game, a ranking is given based on total time taken, points accumulated and other categories. The player is also given rewards and unlockables, such as alternate costumes and camera functions, depending on what difficulty was beaten, how much of the Ghost List\u00a0was completed and other criteria. Beating the game also unlocks Battle Mode, where the player is faced with fighting specific ghosts, and is rewarded with points towards purchasing unlockables. An option is also given where the game can be replayed with all equipment, upgrades and unlockables carried over.Xbox gameplay  The Xbox release of Fatal Frame included many changes, the largest being the addition of a new ending and a new difficulty setting (Fatal). The appearance of the camera's viewfinder mode was also revamped, and more hidden ghosts, diaries and unlockables were added as well as an optional battle with a brand new ghost during the game's final night.Sealing spirits  The idea of a camera absorbing ghosts is based on a superstition that having your picture taken steals your soul and the only way it can be returned is to burn the film. There are followers of religions around today that believe this to be true including places in Mexico. The ghosts encountered are all lost souls.Regional changes  Other than the obvious name change, other aspects of the game underwent editing for releases in regions outside of Japan. The term \"Fatal Frame\" itself was not introduced until the overseas release, prompting the name change. Another prominent change was in Miku's character design. The large red bow over Miku's shirt (much like those seen in Japanese school uniforms) was removed, and the shirt underneath was made more red to compensate. Miku's face was also edited, giving her slightly smaller eyes and redder lips, and her hair was changed to a more vibrant brown color. The new model was used for all subsequent releases, including the Japanese Xbox edition.Controversy  The cover of the overseas release of Fatal Frame contained the tag line \"Based on a true story\", however, the validity of this claim is questionable. The plot of the game is allegedly based on legends surrounding a Himuro Mansion found outside of Tokyo, Japan. Stories are told of the gruesome deaths of the family and inhabitants of the decades-old mansion, however, series producer Makoto Shibata has said that the real-life mansion was not the basis for the game's plot. Instead, Makoto Shibata cited two old Japanese urban legends as the game's main inspiration, rather than the stories of the Himuro mansion murders. Further, the \"Based on a true story\" tag line was not explicitly advertised during the game's Japan release, and was only added upon its release outside of the country. Makoto Shibata described the actual inspiration for the game\u2019s haunted house in an interview:Lawsuit  The developer of Fatal Frame, Tecmo, was quickly sued by the movie company behind Ghostbusters, claiming that the idea of capturing ghosts in a camera infringed upon the concept of Ghostbusters. The case was later dropped.Zero Novel  A Japanese-only novelization of the game is available on Amazon.jp. (ISBN 4840220654.) It is told from the viewpoint of Mafuyu Hinasaki and its storyline differs slightly from the original game.The PlayStation 2 interview  An interview with Makoto Shibata (director), Keisuke Kikuchi (producer) and Hitoshi Hasegawa (aka. Zin Hasegawa, character design director), was published on the December 21st issue of Softbank's Weekly \"The PlayStation 2\".

She was the last Rope Shrine Maiden whose ritual failed, ultimately causing the Calamity.Biography Background  Kirie was born to the Himuro family. When she became seven years old, she and the other girls of age were subjected to the Demon Tag Ritual. In a locked room, the girls were tasked to avoid being tagged by a blind woman, the \"demon.\" The first tagged would become the \"demon\" in the next Demon Tag game, and the last tagged, who turned out to be Kirie, would become the next Rope Shrine Maiden and perform the Strangling Ritual. Kirie was kept in seclusion to prepare for her duties as the Rope Shrine Maiden, and was locked inside a cell within the Himuro Mansion for ten years. During this time she had a servant, who became the ghost called \"Girl Turning\", Kirie's servant was thrown into the well in the Courtyard in order to maintain the secrecy of the Himuro family rituals.  Nearing the time of the Strangling Ritual, Kirie met and fell in love with a visitor to the mansion, meeting him on occasion in the mansion's Cherry Atrium. The Himuro Family Master thought this to be dangerous, however, and ordered for the visitor to be disposed of. Kirie learns of her loved one's fate in a dream and is haunted by guilt, believing she caused his death. Finally, the day of the ritual arrives, and Kirie is taken to the Moon Well\u00a0to be purified before the ritual. She is then escorted by Lord Himuro and the four head priests to the underground Rope Altar, where the ritual would commence. Kirie laid onto the central stone dais and ropes are tied around her neck and limbs. The ropes are then connected to five wheels turned by the four priests and Lord Himuro to pull the ropes. The wheels are turned until the Rope Shrine Maiden is strangled and her limbs are torn from her body. The stained ropes, now sanctified by the blood of the Rope Shrine Maiden, are taken to the Hell Gate and used to seal it for years. In order to complete the ritual, the Rope Shrine Maiden must have severed her attachments to the living world. Having fallen in love and learning of her loved one's fate, Kirie was tainted with guilt, and the ritual turned out to be a failure. The Hell Gate burst open, and the Malice\u00a0contained inside was released all over the mansion. The Malice killed most and drove others mad, and sank the mansion and the surrounding area in darkness. Kirie's spirit was also corrupted by the malice, turning her into a vengeful ghost, bent on making others feel the pain she endured. Mystified by the dark, abandoned mansion, novelist Junsei Takamine set out to explore it with his assistant Tomoe Hirasaka and editor Koji Ogata. They were trapped inside, however, and eventually succumbed to Kirie's malevolence.  Seeking to uncover what happened to Takamine, Mafuyu Hinasaki, one of his fans, journeys to the mansion himself. He, too becomes trapped inside, but instead of killing him, Kirie captures him because of his resemblance to her late lover. Now, concerned over her brother's disappearance, Miku Hinasaki enters the mansion. She is attacked by the dark spirits of the mansion, but she eventually learns about what transpired behind its walls. In addition to corrupting Kirie, the Malice also had the effect of splitting Kirie's soul in two. One half became the hostile ghost that killed all who entered the mansion, and the other half took the form of Kirie as a child, and held Kirie's sense of duty to protect the mansion and its souls. With the help of Kirie's untainted spirit, Miku is able to release the mansion from the Malice's grip and end the curse, which let the spirits of the mansion find peace, as well as freeing her brother from his captivity by Kirie.\u00a0Fate  Regardless of which ending is achieved, Kirie is compelled to fulfill her duty as the Rope Shrine Maiden when she is freed from the Malice. She approached the Hell Gate and forces it to close, using the sacred ropes to bind herself and prevent it from ever opening again. Kirie thus completes her purpose, however, at the cost of forever living in pain. In the normal ending, Mafuyu also decides to stay behind and comfort Kirie for the rest of his life, telling Miku to escape the crumbling mansion. In the optional Mafuyu ending, Mafuyu escapes with Miku, and Kirie is shown sealing the door by herself. During the credits, however, it's revealed that Kirie finds peace when she is reunited with the soul of her dead loved one.Appearance  Kirie's ghost appears in a stained white kimono, with the lacerations ropes used in her ritual still tied to her limbs. Whenever Miku encounters her in the game, she is surrounded by a dark presence, the Malice, appearing as a throng of ghostly bodies congealed into one. Kirie's eyes are never shown, apart from the ending cinematic, and she moves through the air, her feet never touching the ground.Battle  Players will encounter Kirie throughout the game while they explore Himuro Mansion. When encountered, the screen will go black and white and she will follow Miku until a safe room can be reached. During these times Kirie is invincible and using the Camera Obscura on her will not injure her nor defeat her. If Kirie touches Miku she will kill her instantly, and a cutscene plays with her attacking Miku with a swarm of disembodied hands,\u00a0although at some points her touch is inescapable and signals the end of a chapter. Kirie is only able to be defeated during the final night where Miku will battle her in front of the Hell Gate. Kirie can still kill Miku instantly if she manages to grab her, so it is recommended to have a Stone Mirror at hand. Although she moves rather slowly, she has a tendency to teleport directly beside or behind Miku where she can quickly attack. She also has the ability to regenerate health after disappearing, making her fight difficult if the player does not stay on the offensive. Kirie can only be damaged by Zero Shots, and Type-90 Film is the best film to use against her. In normal difficulty, it will take approximately 5 to 8 Zero shots to kill her, provided she does not regenerate too much health and high power film is used. It is also important to note that the cave quakes during the battle with Kirie, making it hard to aim the camera properly. Finally, Kirie moves in certain patterns and learning them will make the battle easier. Utilize the whole room to help keep distance from Kirie and to power up shots.Info  Below is displayed the ghost's info according to the game's official guidebook.Night 1 Night 2 Final Night First appearance Final appearance Related items  Files: Items:External links Sae Kurosawa  Sae Kurosawa\u00a0is a powerful hostile female spirit and the main antagonist\u00a0in\u00a0Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly. She is the twin sister of Yae Kurosawa. Sae was a villager living in All God's Village before the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual was called for and she became the vengeful spirit who ushered in the Repentance.Biography Background  When the first crimson sacrifice ritual performed by the twins Itsuki and Mutsuki fails, Sae and Yae become the next two twins to perform the ritual. Yae does not want to perform the ritual and believes that it is a cruel barbaric ritual. With the help of Itsuki, she had planned on running away from the village with Sae before the ritual by the use of a large tree that has an underground passage from the village. Sae, being the weaker twin, wished to become one with her sister and perform the ritual because she felt that if they left the village, in time she and her sister would fall apart from each other.  The night of the ritual, they attempted to run away from the village, but Sae purposely fell in an attempt to get them caught, but Yae, who didn't realize that her twin sister had fallen, kept running and escaped the village while Sae was caught.Fate  Without Yae's return, the villagers were left with no other choice but to perform the sacrifice with Sae alone. Sae was taken to the Hellish Abyss deep beneath the village, where the ritual takes place. Sae was hanged with a rope and her lifeless body was thrown into the abyss. However, Sae's sacrifice was incomplete, and the Hellish Abyss was not calmed. Instead, Sae's spirit was corrupted by the Malice, and she returned with the Kusabi to wreak vengeance on the villagers. Sae's return filled the village with the Malice, and the sky above was forever engulfed in night. Decades later Mio came to the village with Mayu, Sae mistook Mio for her long since dead sister, Yae Kurosawa, and followed Mio throughout the village with the Kusabi.Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly  In the Crimson Butterfly ending, Sae stays inside Mayu's body and tells Mio that she must kill her and that it is the only way to save the village. Once Mio has killed Mayu, Mayu's body and Sae's spirit are thrown into the Hellish Abyss, finally bringing her to her originally destined fate.Appearance  Sae wears a white kimono folded right over left (traditionally in Japan only done for deceased individuals) with blood stains splattered across the torso and lower parts of the kimono, the pattern of which resembles half of a butterfly.  \u00a0Sae is seen with a grim smile upon her face when encountered and other times a soft and/or worried facial expression.Battle  Although she can be photographed in other areas, the only instance where Sae can be hurt is when the Hellish Abyss ending is achieved, and the difficulty setting is on \"Hard\" or higher. \u00a0Sae attacks by rushing towards Mio and quickly lunging forward, her hands reaching for the neck. Unlike before, Sae's attacks do not kill Mio instantly. In-between attacks, she will frequently appear and stand still, laughing before disappearing. While fighting her, Sae is constantly surrounded by a bloody, crimson mist that protects her from the powers of the camera obscura. Occasionally, Sae will appear without the mist, and speak with Mayu's voice, during which the camera will sense a rare shutter chance. Although she does not kill Mio in one attack, Sae is still a formidable ghost due to her protection against the camera and quick attack speed. Any time that she is within the mist, the capture circle does not charge and the camera is entirely useless. Tremors also occur frequently in the underground cave, muddling the controls and the camera's accuracy. Immediately before and after attacking Sae exits the mist, however the shots taken here do not push her back. It is best to avoid Sae's attacks, and wait for the times that the mist does not appear, keeping an eye out for the shutter chance. During this time, there is also a quick Fatal Frame opportunity, however, it is very sudden, and should be attempted only if the player is proficient with the camera. It is also recommended to use the highest film type available and to keep the health bar full after every attack. After enough damage has been inflicted, the screen will change, and Mio will be facing Sae above the abyss. After some words the camera is prompted to take a shot, finally exorcising Sae's spirit.Related Items  Stone FilesTrivia Mayu Amakura  Mayu Amakura is one of the two main characters in Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly. She is the older twin sister of Mio Amakura. The two share a very close bond, however, unlike her sister, Mayu is highly susceptible to the paranormal. When the two step foot in the mysterious Lost Village, the spirits of the dead soon prey upon Mayu, and she must endure the darkness so that she and her sister may survive.Biography Background  Mayu and her twin sister spent their childhood in the Minakami region, where they spent much time playing in the surrounding forest. An accident occurred one day when the two were running through the forest, and Mayu was left with a broken knee after falling down to the bottom of a steep ravine. Mio blamed herself for leaving her sister behind and since then Mayu has walked with a slight limp and cannot run very easily. Some time later, after Mio and Mayu's father disappeared in the forest, the two sisters and their mother, Shizu Amakura, decide to move away. Shizu fell gravely ill some years later, and asked her younger brother, Kei Amakura, to care of Mio and Mayu. Soon after, the two sisters heard news of the dam that was to be built in the Minakami region and both decide to visit their childhood home that they had always played in one last time before the dam would swallow it.Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Fate  In the Crimson Butterfly ending, Mayu and Mio complete the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual. Mayu, having been possessed by Sae, now comes to understand that completing the ritual is their only hope of becoming one and saving the lost village. Mio is urged to wrap her hands around Mayu's neck and strangle her with her hands in the shape of a butterfly. After enough time, Mayu's lifeless body is thrown into the Hellish Abyss while her sister watches, horrified at what she has done. Mayu is thus transformed into a crimson butterfly and, before rising up to the sky above, she thanks her sister one final time. Mio is then shown chasing after her sister's spirit, crying out how sorry she is for killing her. The ending concludes with Mio falling to her knees in tears as the sun rises over the village.Alternate endings  Though not carried over into Fatal Frame III: The Tormented, these endings were available if the player chooses a harder difficulty setting or a different option during the final chapter. An additional ending is also available only on the Xbox release of Fatal Frame II. Hellish Abyss ending\n The Hellish Abyss ending can be achieved by playing the game on Hard difficulty or above. In this ending, Mayu is completely possessed by Sae, and instead of seeking to complete the ritual, Sae seeks to kill Mio. After being exorcised by the Camera Obscura, Sae is separated from Mayu's body and falls into the abyss. Mayu is saved by Mio, but in the process Mio glimpses the abyss's bottom and is permanently blinded. Later, the two sisters are shown overlooking the lake formed by the new dam, and Mayu comments on how it is now her turn to take care of Mio. Promise ending\n The Promise ending is exclusive to the Xbox version. In this ending, as Mayu prepares to jump into the abyss, Yae's spirit rushes out of Mio's body. Upon hearing her sister, Sae emerges from Mayu. The two finally meet, and after Yae apologizes, they promise never to be apart and jump into the abyss hand in hand. Afterwards, a flock of crimson butterflies fly out of the abyss to part the skies. The souls of the villagers are shown looking towards the sunrise and Mio and Mayu are seen leaving the village and talking about how they are always with each other even when apart. The Lingering Scent Ending\n The Lingering Scent ending occurs if Mio chooses not to follow her sister into the Kurosawa House and instead exits under Kureha Shrine. Unlike other endings, this one results in a Game Over screen. As she runs through the underground tunnel, she hears Sae call out to her and hesitates. Mio remembers Itsuki telling her not to look back, but after she hears Mayu's voice she finally turns around. Sae is seen moving quickly towards Mio and when she catches up, Mio blacks out. Eventually, she wakes up alone in the area of the woods where the game began. She calls out for Mayu, but she is nowhere to be seen. As the scene fades to black, Sae and Mayu are heard saying that they will wait forever for their sisters' return.Wii Edition  Mayu pulls Mio's hands close, encircling them around her neck, Mio pulls back and refusing.  Mayu tells her she always knew her sister could never do such a thing and how she loves her because of that. She tells her that, as long as they are together, she doesn't care if she has to live in hell and starts laughing and crying at the same time. She is no longer Mayu, but Sae. A flashback of Mayu's accident is shown, in which a young Mio finds her sister laughing crazily amidst her tears. She asks her to stay in the village with her forever, as her hands gets closer to Mio's neck. Later, a red butterfly flying around to Mio's arm is shown. Her head lying on Mayu's leg as she calmly caresses her hair in the middle of a room full of dead bodies. The ritual possibly didn't work, since she was the one meant to be sacrificed, not Mio. She and Mio's corpse end up trapped in the village forever. At the end of the credits, it is shown Mayu in the doll room, making up Mio's lips. She looks at her sister, kisses her on the cheek, as Mio seems to be crying, then holds her head.* Shadow Festival Ending  Mio encounters one last time the Kusabi, but takes for her a while to defeat it (more than 5 minutes), from which this causes the events from All God's Village repeat itself. Mio seems tired from the Kusabi fight, stumbling in the effort to move forward, after a few steps she stops in the first shrine before the stairs, seeing the ghosts of the people that were doing the ritual fleeing upstairs, screaming that The Repeatance was coming. She gets worried deeply, for what she tries to be quick on arriving where Mayu is, only to see her kneeling close to the abyss. Mayu, possesed by Sae, starts talking to Mio, that now sees herself as Yae, saying that The Repeteance was coming towards the surface, sounding happy on the fact Yae returned, but sad that it was too late, and that she preffered for her to had abandoned her so she was \"at least saved\". Meanwhile, from the Abyss, The Repeantance starts to come out, about to shroud the village in darkness. Mio, surrending, kneels close to Mayu, saying that it would be hard for her to live without her, with all \"the sadness and pain\" she would have to endure, but that she was happy to be with her, even if it were in \"such a short time\". While the scene quickly swaps to a flashback from both Mio and Mayu, where they are wearing kimonos that not only have a different color, but also a different pattern, seeming to be enjoying a Red Lantern festival, where they not only were happy to be together, but also let go each one their lantern, making them float up towards the sky. After that, the scene changes to the present, where Itsuki, which was still trapped inside the storehouse, after encountering a crimsom butterfly, he suddenly looked towards the window, seeing The Repeteance coming towards the village. Not after that, we can see the village being engulfed by it, just like it happened in the past. After that, both Mio and Mayu are seen shrouded by deep darkness, apparently nude, but covered by some golden cloth, cuddled againist each other. Fun fact: They both are positioned just like the twins shown in the Twin Maiden stones not only in the game, but also the ones in real lifeFatal Frame III: The Tormented  Mayu makes a small appearance in Fatal Frame III: The Tormented after a photo of Mio is taken inside the Manor of Sleep. Having endured the events in the village, Mio now suffers from guilt and longs to be with her sister. The photo reveals that Mayu is still watching over her sister. Mayu is also mentioned in an article as one of many people who have gone missing in the Minakami region.Appearance  Mayu's appearance is very much like her twin sister's, with both of them favoring rust their primary color, but everything about Mayu is a little bit more modest and a little bit more withdrawn. Her hair isn't styled the way Mio's is. Instead, Mayu wears it straight and limp. She wears a high-collared shirt black under her short dress, and boots to cover up what remains of her legs. Because of her past injury, Mayu has a bandage around her right knee.Alternate costumes PS2 Costumes  Costumes unlocked by completing the game in Normal Difficulty: Costumes unlocked by completing the game on Hard/Nightmare Difficulty: Costumes unlocked through Mission Mode: Accessories:Xbox Costumes  Costumes unlocked by completing the game in Normal Difficulty: Costumes unlocked by completing the game in Hard/Nightmare/Fatal Difficulty: Costume unlocked through Mission Mode: Costumes unlocked by other means: Accessories:Related items  Stone: Files: Photos:Trivia Reika Kuze  Reika Kuze is a powerful hostile female spirit and the main antagonist in Fatal Frame III: The Tormented. She is the last Tattooed Priestess. Before becoming the tattooed priestess and adopting the Kuze name, her full name was Reika Yukishiro. Upon the failure of her Impalement Ritual, the Unleashing occurred and The Rift engulfed the Kuze Shrine. Reika was made the Tattooed Priestess after her entire family was murdered. The Kuze household adopted her because she wanted to help to ease the pain of others who experienced the same pain as her.Story  Reika is the main antagonist of Fatal Frame III: The Tormented. She is the last Tattooed Priestess, and she haunts the dreams of those consumed by grief and guilt over the loss of loved ones.Background  Reika grew up in a village near the Kuze Shrine, the same village where Kaname was smuggled out to as a baby. It was there that the two met and fell in love. Kaname left the village at some point to study, leaving Reika the Echo Stone Earring his mother had given him. While he was gone, an unspecified disaster occurred (believed to be an avalanche, many of which occured during the later years of the Edo period in the eastern Tohoku area.) Reika's whole family was killed. With no way to contact Kaname and poor future prospects as a young woman without a family or a husband, Reika agreed to serve as a Tattooed Priestess, hoping that she could help people who had experienced pain and loss like her. She went to live at the Kuze Shrine and adopted their last name. During this time, she wore the ritual attire of blue and white, similar to the Handmaidens.Fatal Frame III  As a priestess, before the rituals, Reika spent her days in the Hanging Prison, where she was cared for by Amane Kuze, and took comfort in talking to Amane about the outside world. At some point, unaware that Amane was Kaname's half-sister, she showed Amane the Echo Stone Earring. Amane recognized it, and wrote in her diary of her suspicion that Reika's friend was Kaname. In preparation for the Piercing of the Soul ritual, Reika etched her grief into the Mirror of Loss so that it would not interfere with the pain of the parishioners. Much of her pain had to do with Kaname and her desire to see him again. During the ritual, Reika's body was etched with tattoos by the Engravers to represent the pain of the living and the dead. She was tended to by Handmaidens during this time, who had the duty of singing the Handmaiden's Song to her and impaling her during the Impalement Ritual. Once the tattoos covered her body, Reika was required to break the Mirror of Loss and cast her love away. At some point after receiving the tattoos, Reika wrote about a dream she had of Kaname, revealing that her love for him still existed inside her. She hoped to dream of him in her eternal sleep. At last, she was impaled in the Chamber of Thorns. Wanting to help Reika, Amane lead Kaname into the Kuze house. Kaname wishing to save Reika entered the chamber of thorns and awoke her from her sleep. However, Yashuu Kuze found out what Amane had done, determined to preserve the Commandment, she followed Kaname into the shrine and murdered him in front of Reika. Reika was so distraught that she allowed the tattoos to enter her eyes, causing the Unleashing. Reika then began to wander the manor, and everywhere she wandered was engulfed in the Rift. Despite the efforts of Yashuu to contain the Rift by making sacrifices and sealing the Manor into a dream, Reika's pain continued to spread and spill into the dreams of those who had lost loved ones. In the end, Rei defeated Reika, and then cast both Reika and Kaname off in a boat together, letting them cross the ocean to the Other Side.Strategy  Reika, upon leaving the Chamber of Thorns, will immediately teleport from the chamber's gate to the Abyss of the Horizon. Her attacks consist of her Sending the winged skull above her towards Rei, or moving towards her, hand outstretched to touch her if she is on the ground, and a heavily damaging double aerial lunge, in which she soars airborne, and swoop down towards Rei, but actually narrowly missing her to reach a different high point, and only now that Reika aims for Rei. Quite oftenly, Reika will enter a \"miasma state\", turning the entire battlefield monochrome and giving her a one-hit-kill touch, should Rei remain too close to her. During this state, Rei has to run away as far and quickly as possible for a certain time period, and the normal battle will resume. When Reika is on the ground, she is very easy to dispatch. Simply aim the Camera Obscura towards her as she advances on Rei and wait for her to come close, which she will use either the touching attack, or send the flying skull above her towards Rei. Either way, as soon as the capture circle flashes red, click the shutter, and Reika will be repelled before teleporting away. Swing the viewfinder around to find her before she approaches. If she continues to stay on the ground, repeat this strategy, or if she soars airborne, then keep her in the viewfinder, because her lunge is very fast. If Rei has good timing, then when Reika passes her during the first lunge, she can snap a Fatal Frame chance, interrupting the second lunge altogether. If she doesn't snap the first lunge, then wait for Reika to come to her in the second lunge, in which the Fatal Frame chance is a bit more difficult to photograph, requiring Rei keeping the viewfinder low enough. If a Fatal Frame chance is achieved, then try to prolong the combo chain for as long as possible and keep Reika from attacking, even though chaining a following hit is quite difficult. If she enters the \"miasma state\", run away from her as fast as possible, and keep the distance for about 10 seconds, and the fight will resume. The recommended films to use against Reika are Type-61 and above, while recommended Upgraded lenses are <span class=\"explain\" title=\"To maximize the amount of points earned, use the lens in the exact moment of a shutter chance for at least the Shutter Chance, Boost Shot and Special Shot bonuses.\">\"Pierce\"</span> and <span class=\"explain\" title=\"Especially useful during a Fatal Frame chance, effectiveness even further increased with the films Type-90 or 00. Also, if Rei has obtained the Festival Equipped Function (granting all photographs the properties of a Fatal Frame shot, in terms of damage and knockback effect. The alarm light will always be flashing), then combining it with good film and the Crush Upgraded lens will result in an especially lethal effect, killing Reika in one hit.\">\"Crush\"</span>. Photograph all Shutter Chances and Fatal Frame moments, while staying away from her in the \"miasma state\", and Rei will emerge victorious.Trivia Rei Kurosawa  Rei Kurosawa is the main character in\u00a0Fatal Frame III: The Tormented. Having survived a fatal car crash that took the life of her fianc\u00e9, Yuu Asou, Rei is beset with grief and guilt, wishing to be with him once more. Her grief becomes dangerous, however, when she starts to visit a strange manor in her dreams. It is known as the Manor of Sleep, and after seeing Yuu inside, Rei follows him in further and further, not knowing that those who follow the dead too far in never return.Biography Background  Rei works as a professional freelance photographer. She met her fianc\u00e9, Yuu, while they were in college, where he studied anthropology and folklore. Yuu was good friends with Mafuyu Hinasaki and Kei Amakura, and the three worked together in their research of the occult and local customs. Before disappearing, Mafuyu entrusted Yuu with his sister's care should anything happen to him, and after becoming engaged, Rei and Yuu bought a house together, and took in Mafuyu's sister, Miku. Rei was never told about Miku's past, or what had happened to her brother, and the two became good friends, Miku began working under Rei as her assistant. One rainy night, Rei was driving with Yuu when the car crashed off the side of the road and Yuu was killed. Rei blamed herself for Yuu's death, and since then showed little interest with the outside world, only occasionally leaving her home for her job. \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25acFatal Frame III: The Tormented  Regardless of what ending is achieved at the end of the game, Rei's fate remains the same. After briefly re-uniting with Yuu one last time at the Abyss of the Horizon, Rei is brought back to the real world, free from the curse of the Snake and Holly Tattoo. She, along with Miku, now understand that regardless of why they were allowed to live, they must continue to survive.Appearance  Rei has short, dark brown hair that falls just above her shoulders in choppy lengths. She bears a fringe which is parted to the left. With a beauty mark close to her right eye, her eyes are dark brown. There are many outfits available for her to wear but she is more commonly seen in the default costume.Alternate costumes  Her alternate costumes consists of:Other costumes Trivia Itsuki Tachibana  Itsuki Tachibana is a male character and non-hostile spirit in Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly. He is\u00a0one of the souls trapped within All God's Village. Itsuki meets Mio and Mayu Amakura after they find themselves trapped inside the village. He first gives advice to Mio after she lost track of her sister, letting her know the way to reach the Kurosawa House, where he believes Mayu is headed. During the entire time that Mio and Mayu speak with Itsuki, he addresses them as Yae and Sae Kurosawa, the last twins meant to undergo the village's secret ritual. His help is limited, however, as he is only able to give advice from within the storehouse\u00a0he is locked in.Background  Itsuki was one of the villagers that resided in the village before the Repentance occurred. He belonged to the Tachibana family, one of the influential families living in the village. He had two other siblings, a twin brother named Mutsuki and a younger sister named Chitose. The twins were regarded as Altar Twins, the male equivalent of the Twin Shrine Maidens. The two brothers were the twins that performed the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual before Yae and Sae were tasked to. Itsuki was the older brother and was given the responsibility of sacrificing his younger brother Mutsuki. They failed, however, and Mutsuki's sacrifice did not calm the Hellish Abyss, and The Kurosawa twins were tasked with performing the ritual. Following Mutsuki's death, Itsuki was beget with grief and his hair turned white. Itsuki and Mutsuki made a promise to never to let their friends Sae and Yae suffer the same fate they had, and before the ritual would take place yet again, Itsuki formulated an escape for the twins. He wrote a letter to his childhood friend Ryozo Munakata, who left the village to become a folklorist, to ask him to care of Sae and Yae after their escape. On the night of the escape plan, Itsuki was locked in the Tsuchihara storehouse for interfering with the ritual process. Thinking that he, again, failed to save anyone, he found no other choice but to commit suicide hoping to be reunited with his twin brother.Fate  Like everyone who fell to the Malice,\u00a0Itsuki's soul was trapped inside the village. He refers to Mio and Mayu as \"Yae\" and \"Sae\", helping the two find a way to escape the ritual and the village as he did with the Kurosawa twins. When Mio visited the storehouse for the final time, she learns of what befell Itsuki and left with only his final thoughts and regrets over his loss.Promise Ending  In the added Promise ending found in the Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Director's Cut edition, the ending shows Itsuki's spirit being reunited with Mutsuki's soul, showing that the two are finally able to be at peace, along with their younger sister.Trivia Camera Obscura  The Camera Obscura, known in Japanese as Shaeiki (\u5c04\u5f71\u6a5f, roughly \"shadow-shooting mechanism\"),\u3000is the main device featured throughout the entire Fatal Frame series. The camera functions by recording images onto photographic film, however, the Camera Obscura found in the series is unique due to its ability to exorcise spirits. The Camera Obscura, along with the Flashlight, is a staple item in the Fatal Frame series. Usually acquired as a hand-me-down or discovered in some place within the game, the camera is the only \"weapon\" the main characters are given to survive. By utilizing the various exorcismal powers of the Camera Obscura, players are able to fend off hostile ghosts, as well as capture lingering spirits and receive helpful clues from ghosts that desire to communicate.Background  Developed by Dr. Kunihiko Asou, the Camera Obscura was devised to look beyond the material world and, \"take pictures of impossible things\". Dr. Asou and his assistants were responsible for creating more than one Camera Obscura, six of which have been featured in the games so far. The first Camera Obscura Dr. Asou considered functional was given to his friend, Seijiro Makabe, a folklorist who took the camera along with him to research All God's Village. As the development of \"Mystical Science\", the field in which Dr. Asou studied, progressed, the Camera Obscura's abilities expanded and gained attention from many occultists and paranormal enthusiasts. Eventually, the many cameras became rare collectibles scattered throughout Japan and some no longer functioned to capture images of the other side. However, as stated in the \"Notes\" section for Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, it could be that their current owners do not possess the capacity to operate them. In Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, the \"Notes\" Entry for the Camera Obscura states that the cameras that Dr. Asou created were all prototypes, hence why each camera has different functionalities. It is unknown at this time if a final or \"perfect\" version of the Camera Obscura exists.Function  Central to the premise of the Fatal Frame series, the Camera Obscura is used to fight ghostly entities and exorcise spirits of all kinds. By raising the camera, the player enters viewfinder, or first-person view mode, where the spirits and environments can be photographed. Damage is done by aiming the camera towards a hostile ghost and pressing the shutter button to take a photo. Ghosts that aren't hostile are not damaged, but are captured in the same way. The amount of damage done depends, primarily, on the amount of time the ghost spends within the capture circle, the type of film used and whether power-up lenses are used. By taking pictures of spirits, the Camera Obscura not only captures them, but attains Spirit Points as well. The amount of spirit points gathered depends on variables that determine the quality of the shot. These variables include proximity to the target, whether the target is centered, the amount of damage inflicted, the amount of targets captured at once and many others. Spirit points can then be used in the camera to upgrade the camera's basic functions and special lenses. Every damaging shot also absorbs spirit power, the amount of which varies depending on the damage. Spirit power can be stocked and is needed in order to use power-up lenses. The camera relies on special film retrieved by exploring different areas in the main characters' setting. Without any film loaded, the camera is unable to take photographs. There are five known types of film found in the series. Beyond Type-07, film types are of limited quantity and are scattered throughout the game. The more rare a film type is, the more damage it is capable of inflicting, however, the amount of time the film takes to load between shots varies and doesn't always increase with rarity.Shutter Chances  If a hostile ghost is captured during certain moments of activity or weakness, the shot is called a \"Shutter Chance\". Shutter chances are usually indicated by a bright glow of the capture circle and the camera zooming in. Shutter chances vary between ghosts, but usually occur before, during or immediately after an attack. A shutter chance deals increased damage and has the added effect of pushing the ghost back.Fatal Frames  A \"Fatal Frame\" is a special shutter chance shot occurring only in very short time frames of a ghost's attack. Fatal frames are more difficult to attain, as they commonly last only one second and must be \"found\" in a ghost's attack. A fatal frame captures a ghost when it is most vulnerable, dealing even more damage and pushing the ghost back severely. In addition, fatal frame are the only shots that can be chained, creating combos that can do massive damage.Components  The Camera Obscura employs various elements that are used to exorcise spirits. The basic components the camera uses in the games include:Capture Circle  In the center of the viewfinder is the capture circle. In order to be photographed, spirits must be within the capture circle when the shutter button is pressed. The capture circle also determines how much damage is inflicted on the target/s within by acting as a sort of gauge; as a ghost spends time within the circle, the circle is illuminated more and more until it is fully charged.Filament  At the top of the viewfinder is a tubular filament that detects a ghost's presence. A blue glow from the filament means that a benign ghost is present, or a clue is nearby and can be photographed. A red glow means that a hostile ghost is present and can be fought off. In addition, the glow of the filament brightens as the player faces towards and gets closer to the source.Lenses  Special lenses are also used to cause varying degrees of damage and inflict statuses on ghosts. These lenses can be used when the proper amount of spirit power has been stocked and can be used by pressing a specific button. Lenses can be upgraded like the camera's basic functions, enhancing their effects on enemies. Some examples of power-up lenses are:Appearances Fatal Frame  The Camera Obscura was introduced in Fatal Frame, however it was not introduced with that name. Mafuyu Hinasaki inherits the camera from his deceased mother, and uses it to investigate a mansion that is said to be haunted. After going missing for some time, Mafuyu's sister, Miku Hinasaki, ventures into the mansion, finds the camera and picks up where her brother left off. After uncovering more of the mansion's history, Miku realizes that her mother's camera came from a past resident of the mansion, and that using the camera eventually led to her death. Miku continues to use that camera to uncover the secrets of the mansion and put the spirits haunting it to rest.Fatal Frame II  In Fatal Frame II, the camera is found by twins Mio and Mayu Amakura after they are spirited away and become trapped in All God's Village. The village had been caught in a disaster brought about by a failed ritual, and after nearly all its inhabitants were killed, the village had become notorious for spiriting away people who venture near. It is later revealed that the camera was brought to the village by a folklorist who wanted to use it to film the village's ritual. Mayu, being susceptible to the paranormal, is led astray by the ghostly denizens of the village, and Mio must use the camera to solve the mysteries surrounding the village, save her sister and escape the village.Fatal Frame III  The camera in Fatal Frame III is found within an old manor that certain people visit in their dreams. Rei Kurosawa is one of those people, and she is given the camera by one of the ghosts in the manor. Rei sees her late boyfriend within the mansion, and, wanting to see him again, pursues him and uncovers the truth regarding the manor with the help of the camera. The manor only appears in the dreams of those who have become sole survivors of a disaster, and two more people are brought to it. Miku Hinasaki, who survived after searching Himuro Mansion, relives her fears of that place when she begins to dream of the manor. Kei Amakura begins to dream of the manor after researching it in hopes of curing his niece, Mio. The three are able to use the Camera Obscura to fend off the ghosts that have been trapped inside the manor, and lift the curse that killed all of its inhabitants and draws survivors into the nightmare.Fatal Frame IV  In Fatal Frame IV, there are two Camera Obscuras and another paranormal instrument, the Spirit Stone Flashlight, that the protagonists use to uncover the mysteries of an island and its people. Ruka Minazuki, Misaki Asou and Madoka Tsukimori travel to the island they grew up in after two of their friends, who also came from the island, are found dead. They arrive and begin searching the place they grew up in, hoping to uncover forgotten memories. Ruka and Madoka utilize a Camera Obscura that has become a display inside the Kunihiko Asou Museum on the island, and Misaki brings with her a camera that was passed down her family. Meanwhile, in another location on the island, former detective Choushiro Kirishima, who found the six girls ten years ago when they were kidnapped, is on the trail of the man behind the kidnapping. He utilizes the Spirit Stone Flashlight after Ruka's mother gave it to him and asked him to follow Ruka. The four investigate the island, revealing what had occurred ten years ago and recovering their lost memories of Rougetsu Island.Fatal Frame (Japanese movie)  In Fatal Frame: The Movie (Gekij\u014dban Rei ~Zero~) Susumu Kusanagi owns an old camera that he found in his family photo studio. Its exact origin is unknown. But it was once used in a ritual to capture the final image of forbidden lovers, before the pair would drown themselves in the near by lake. While their photos remain in the studio where they are enshrined. Susumu would often wander around the town with this camera, in hopes of photographing a ghost with it. A goal that he finally achieved when he snaps a picture of a mysterious pale skined girl on a bridge near the old resovoir. It is currently not known if it was created by Dr. Kunihiko Asou, or if it can even exorcise ghosts. However it can be used to see (and take pictures of) otherwise invisible spirits.Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water  In Maiden of Black Water, two versions of the Camera Obscura are used throughout the game. The cameras belong to Hisoka Kurosawa and Ren Hojo, the former's camera also being used by Yuri Kozukata and Rui Kagamiya. Both cameras differ in functionality. Hisoka's Camera (seen at right) has the ability to use several special lenses that can deal more damage, slow enemies, and even heal the photographer. Meanwhile, Ren's Camera has a different function- pressing the Special Lens button allows his camera to take four photos in rapid succession, however, the reload time of the photos suffer for it. This is due to the nature of his camera, which has unique compound lenses instead of a single lens. As is customary with the Series, neither Ren nor Hisoka were the original owners of their cameras.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Maiden of Black Water's version of the Camera Obscura will be appearing in Ultimate, used by Yuri in her move set as an Assist Trophy. When used in battle Those caught in the camera's sight's will be stunned and be surrounded by a dark aura that impedes their fighting capabilities.Trivia Kusabi  Kusabi is a powerful hostile male spirit in Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly\u00a0and Fatal Frame III: The Tormented. He was known as Seijiro Makabe.Background  Otherwise known as \"The Folklorist\", the Kusabi was a personal collegue of Dr Kunihiko Aso, as well as the unfortunate soul to be used as a sacrifice to buy time until the Crimson Sacrifice and brought about the Repentance. In Fatal Frame II, the player is not able to fight him like any other normal ghost before his end-game boss fight and he can kill Mio Amakura in one hit. He also makes another appearance in Fatal Frame III: The Tormented, in the All God's Village part of the Manor of Sleep where he is much faster and deals reasonably-low amounts of damage to Kei Amakura. He had originally come to the village to observe and take pictures of the Crimson Sacrifice ritual, bringing the Camera Obscura with him. The villagers had other plans for him however, and decided that since the twins had yet to complete their purification rituals, he was to be used for a hidden sacrifice to satisfy the Malice and keep it from overcoming the village. While this did buy time for the villagers, it backfired when the Crimson Sacrifice ritual failed. The soul of the folklorist came back with the soul of Sae as well, enveloping the village and everyone inside in Malice. It is likely that Seijiro was chosen to be imprisoned and sacrificed over his student due to his near-obsessive need to find out everything he could about Minakami's rituals, making him exceptionally easy to lead, trick and capture. It is even specified that Seijiro was accepting of his sacrificial role merely to satisfy his curiosity.Death  By studying the room where the ritual took place, one can assume that the sacrifice is first bound in rope and suspended in the air by various mechanisms as they pull the ropes tightening and eventually breaking the bones of the sacrifice. One journal that can be found in the game states that \"The more the sacrifice suffers, the more satisfied the Abyss becomes\". It is also learned that the Kusabi undergoes the Cutting Ritual prior to being sacrificed into the Hellish Abyss. They are repeatedly slashed and cut all over their body. Furthermore, the Kusabi is to be tortured only until they are on the very brink of death. If the Kusabi is to die before being thrown in the Abyss, the ritual will be a failure. The failed Kusabis, or those who died before being thrown into the Abyss, are buried in the stone walls of the Underground Passageway leading from the Rope Room in the Kurosawa House to the Hellish Abyss. Observing the Kusabi yields sight of his right arm that appears to have been severed at some point during his torture. The arm looks to have been both nailed and tied back onto Seijiro's body, likely due to a lack of clarification regarding the rules for throwing the sacrifice's entire body into the Hellish Abyss.Battle Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly  Upon entering the room where the player meets the ghost of Sae laughing among dead bodies (this being a cutscene), the Kusabi will appear and give chase after the cutscene. There is nothing that can hurt him. The camera doesn't seem to affect him and instead the pictures taken become warped and blurred. He will kill Mio instantly just by touching her, even if she has a Stone Mirror, and will result in a Game Over screen. At the end of the game, however, Mio will have to fight him, but will be allowed to hurt him with the camera this time. However, the Kusabi can only be damaged with a Fatal Frame or Zero Shot.Fatal Frame III: The Tormented  In Fatal Frame III: The Tormented the player must also battle Kusabi, upon his first appearance, he is unable to be harmed by the Camera Obscura. However, he appears a second time and must be defeated by Kei. After defeating him, he disappears and the player is allowed to leave the room but Kusabi will give chase, he is no longer able to be damaged and the player must run until a cutscene ensues. Like the other foe ghost, Kusabi can also randomly appear to attack the player.Info  Below is displayed the ghost's info according to the game's official guidebook.Chapter 3 Final Chapter Known Victims External links Broken Neck  Broken Neck\u00a0is a hostile female spirit in Fatal Frame. Like many other ghosts that appeared in the game, not much is known about her; it is known, however, that she was not a member of the Himuro Family, but a visitor to the mansion. Perhaps unusually, she was aware of the rituals being performed at the mansion. On the day of the ritual, Broken Neck was visiting the mansion as a guest. It's not known whether she was one of the people that witnessed the failure of the ritual at the Hell Gate or not, though it is likely that she was on the second floor at the time of the ritual, as that is where she was before she died. It's known she lept to her death from the Moon Observatory\u00a0at the time of her death, why she commited suicide isn't told, though many suspect she had seen Himuro Family Master on his killing spree and got scared, choosing to take her own life rather than let him murder her.Battle  In battle, Broken Neck is aggressive and will not hesitate to attack. When fighting her, she will vanish and move sideways in front of Miku. Since her head is in the back of her body, the player has to time themselves to take a photo of her facing backwards. Miku should try to keep Broken Neck at distance if possible, because Broken Neck often turns invisible just before performing her close attack, it also means she can land multiple attacks in quick succession, not giving Miku a chance to react.Fatal Frame  In the 1st Night, after Miku came out of the Doll Room, this ghost came falling down from the second floor, she then attacks Miku. Like some of the other ghosts, she's randomly encountered throughout the nights. She appears to like popping in front of the camera out of nowhere and surprising Miku, since she laughs her sinister laugh after doing so.Info  Below is displayed the ghost's info according to the game's official guidebook.Night 1 First appearance Random appearances Night 2 First appearances Random appearances Night 3 Trivia External links Madoka Tsukimori  Madoka Tsukimori is one of the four protagonists in Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. One of the five girls who survived the Rougetsu Island disappearances, Madoka returned to the island in order to keep an eye on Misaki who she feels was tricked into coming back, and avoid the fate of the other islanders. Things take a turn for the worst, however, when she is separated from her friend Misaki Asou while investigating Rougetsu Hall. Madoka soon witnesses firsthand what has become of the past islanders as their ghosts begin to haunt her and she is led further into the old sanatorium.Biography Past  Not much is known about her past, only that she was staying at the sanatorium where she met the other girls. She was said to be a timid girl by nature, and spent most of her time with Misaki. She seems to have enjoyed drawing, as there are many crayon drawings on the walls of her room. While she was staying at the sanatorium, she was involved in various incidents with Ayako on her floor- on one occasion she was pushed down the stairs in the entrance hall and, on another occasion, Ayako cut the neck of her pet canary with scissors. Her voice as a child can be heard asking why her mother won't come back for her (on the Spirit Stone Radio in Kazuto Amaki's room during Chapter 5) implying that she has abandonment issues. She was kidnapped by You Haibara, and taken with the other girls to perform the ritual as one of the Kanade. When the ritual failed, Madoka and all of the other girls lost all of their memories. The group were then rescued by detective Choushiro Kirishima.Background  Madoka was one of five girls kidnapped to be Kanade for Sakuya Haibara's Kagura Dance ritual. As the game starts, she is one of the only three former Kanade still living. Like the other girls, Madoka was a patient at Rougetsu Hall when she was younger, although her Luna Sedata Syndrome manifested itself in a much more mild form than that experienced by Ruka or Misaki. Little more is known about Madoka, except that she was fiercely bullied by Ayako, another patient, and developed a strong attachment bordering on fixation to Misaki. Also like the other girls, Madoka has amnesia about the events of her childhood, but unlike either Ruka or Misaki she seems to feel no need to recover her lost memories. It's possible that she always has actually remembered more of what happened than her friends, and has simply chosen to wall off her memories as best she can, voluntarily suppressing them.Appearance  Madoka has dark hair and a slightly pear-shaped figure, which she dresses modestly, wearing a longer skirt than either of her friends and a plain white button-down shirt. She stands in noticeable contrast to Ruka and Misaki, both of whom have a more distinct sense of fashion, and also carries herself more meekly, clutching her heart with one hand before she finds a flashlight to carry.Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse  Madoka is the character which the player will first take control of in the game's Intro Chapter, Madoka is extremely frightened by the creepy abandoned hospital and has none of Misaki's interest in regaining her memories, but is worried about her friend Misaki as she feels she was tricked into going there, and out of worry they will share their friends' fate if they do not get answers. After the deaths of her friends Marie Shinomiya and Tomoe Nanamura, Madoka becomes worried after noticing changes in Misaki. Of the three surviving girls, Madoka leaves with Misaki, to return to the island and recover her lost memories of her childhood. After this opening sequence, Madoka realizes that Misaki is no longer in sight and spends the rest of the game chasing after an image of her friend that is always just ahead of her, opening a door or disappearing around a corner and not responding to Madoka's plead for her to wait. Madoka is eventually led by this vision of Misaki into the Kunihiko Asou\u00a0Museum, where she picks up and begins to use a Camera Obscura that Asou donated to the museum's collection.  As soon as she looks through the Camera's viewfinder, she sees her first hostile ghost and a brief battle ensues . Madoka is terrified by this experience and decides to leave Rougetsu Hall, stating emphatically that she doesn't want to remember anything. All she wants to do is find Misaki and get out of this horrible place. But as Madoka tries to leave the museum, she is overwhelmed by numerous hostile spirits.Fate  In the end of the Intro Chapter, Madoka is attacked and killed by many ghosts in the Asou Museum causing her to bloom. In Chapter 1, Ruka begins finding Madoka's memos scattered throughout Rougetsu Hall during her own investigation, and eventually encounters the spirited away Madoka. In this way, Madoka is the game's first true boss fight. Madoka is encountered again by Misaki in Chapter 5, and promptly attacks her. After this final fight, Madoka leaves behind one last \"memo\", in which she expresses jealousy over Misaki's divergent affections and asks whether it would be all right for the two of them to die together. During the Hard Mode Ending, Madoka is shown reuniting with Misaki, She smiles once Misaki rushes over to her having dropped Miya to the ground, she then moves on with the other spirits to the Afterlife.Battle  Madoka is not a terribly complicated foe; she tends to come at the player from the same location repeatedly, moving in a fairly slow straight line, and only rarely \"disappears\" so that the player has to guess about what direction her attacks will come from. She will sometimes dash at the player, giving the player the opportunity to catch a Fatal Frame, but mostly she will just move in the aforementioned straight line, giving the player plenty of time to charge up the camera for stronger shots. Madoka is a Blooming ghost, and in her bloomed form a single attack will instantly kill the player's character (Hard or Nightmare modes) or drain 50% of health (Easy or Normal modes). Type-14 is recommended for players first encountering Madoka or fighting her on higher difficulty levels. With an upgraded camera on replay games, Madoka is easily taken out with Type-07 film and occasional Fatal Frame shots.Related items  Files:Trivia Kei Amakura  Kei Amakura is one of the three protagonists in\u00a0Fatal Frame III: The Tormented. Having researched the folklore of the Kuze Shrine, Kei is somewhat versed in the superstitions and rituals that went on inside its walls. However, involvement into the shrine's past and its curse has caused Kei to dream of the Manor of Sleep himself.Background  When Rei Kurosawa is first introduced to Kei, he informs her that he worked under Junsei Takamine along with Mafuyu Hinasaki and Yuu Asou, however, at one point he eventually turned his interests to researching folklore himself.Fatal Frame III: The Tormented  Kei's ultimate fate is determined by which ending is achieved at the end of Fatal Frame III. If the first ending is attained, Kei never returns from his last venture into the Manor of Sleep. Kei was trapped in the Chamber of Thorns shortly after entering, and he was unable to stop Reika's attack. The next morning, a black soot stain can be seen where he was sleeping on Rei's couch, affirming Kei's demise from the Tattooed Curse. If the player has beaten the game previously (the requirements can be achieved on any difficulty, as long as the game has been cleared at least once) and has obtained both pieces of the Echostone Earring, Kei's fate significantly changes. Rather than disappearing and leaving behind the soot stain, Kei is left physically unharmed but in a deep sleep, much like Miku. During the ending credits, a photo is shown depicting Kei with his niece, Mio, who has evidently been cured of the curse as well. Another photo is shown with Kei introducing Mio to Rei and Miku in their home. It is unknown which ending is considered canon, but Makoto Shibata (director and co-creator of the Fatal Frame series) stated in an interview and his twitter that the game staff considered the second ending (the one where he awakes from the curse and Mio appears and is introduced to Miku and Rei) the canon ending, although this is not confirmed.Appearance  Kei has styled black hair with bangs that is parted to the right, he has black colored eyes. Kei also has pale skin. He wears a simple necklace around his neck. His outfit consists of an opened black polo shirt, under it is another shirt colored lavender/indigo which has the top buttons undone, he wears a pair of black wristbands in each wrist. For his bottom, Kei is wearing stone wash colored jeans and a belt, Kei wears black shoes as footwear.Ending 2  To save Kei and Mio from the curse, the player must achieve the second ending. To get this ending, the player must obtain the two earrings:Sakuya Haibara  Sakuya Haibara is a powerful hostile female spirit and the main\u00a0antagonist\u00a0in\u00a0Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. Sakuya was tasked with performing Rougetsu Island's\u00a0Ceremony of Passage, however, the ceremony failed and she was forever affected by the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.Background  Sakuya is the daughter of Shigeto Haibara and the older sister of You. When she was young, her mother contracted Luna Sedata Syndrome and committed suicide in Haibara Hospital. This drove Shigeto to begin researching the disease and treating the patients diagnosed with the disease. Soon, Sakuya begins to show symptoms of the same syndrome her mother suffered from, so she was admitted in Rougetsu Hall where she meets Misaki Asou, one of the main protagonists of the game. As Ayako was also staying in Rougetsu Hall, Sakuya hoped to spend time with her daughter and guide her with kindness, however, she was unable to do so, and Ayako continued to act out. During Sakuya's stay there, she collected dolls in order to preserve a sense of self and to keep her memories, as one of the symptoms of Luna Sedata Syndrome is memory loss. After befriending Misaki, Sakuya passed down to her a doll they both named Miya - a combination of Misaki's and Sakuya's names. During this time You left the island to conduct an independent research on the disease. Nearing the end of his research Shigeto found a link to Luna Sedata Syndrome and the Ceremony of Passage performed in Rougetsu Island's past. Believing that reviving the ceremony would help cure those suffering from the disease, Shigeto, his son You, and master mask-maker Souya Yomotsuki collaborated to arrange a ceremony in secret.Ceremony of Passage  In order to begin the ceremony, six people were needed to fill the specific roles. The central performer, known as the Utsuwa, would dance to the sacred Tsukimori Song \u00a0and don the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. Shigeto chose his own daughter, Sakuya, to be the Utsuwa for the ceremony. Five children were then required to fill the roles of the Kanade, the five instrumentalists who played the Tsukimori Song through the length of the ceremony. You Haibara was charged with kidnapping five girls from Rougetsu Hall to be the Kanade of the ceremony. The five were Ruka Minazuki, Misaki Asou, Madoka Tsukimori, Tomoe Nanamura and Marie Shinomiya. In preparation for the ceremony, Souya crafted five Kanade masks for the girls and You taught them to play a restored version of the Tsukimori Song. With the preparations completed all that was left was to wait for lunar eclipse to perform the ceremony under.  On the night of the eclipse a simplified, tourist version of the ceremony was to be performed outside of Rougetsu Hall. Beneath ground, past the ancient tunnels in times of old, the true Ceremony of Passage was to be performed in secret. The five girls were gathered in a circle and in the center Sakuya, wearing a true Mask of the Lunar Eclipse forged by Souya, began to dance to the Tsukimori Song. During her performance Sakuya lost focus and began to panic. Cracks grew on the Mask of the Lunar eclipse and in a moment of climax it shattered, revealing Sakuya's bloomed\u00a0face. At that moment all participants of the above-ground performance died of a sudden heart attack, while below Sakuya and her Kanade collapsed. The ceremony had failed and the five girls lost their memories. Sakuya fell into a coma and was to be enshrined\u00a0underground.The Day Without Suffering  Shigeto's research allowed him to discover some vital information on the Kiraigou, the precursor to the Rougetsu Kagura. He, You, and a master mask maker decided to resurrect the ritual with Sakuya being the utsuwa. The utsuwa is the ritual's masked dancer who acts as the channel of the souls of the dead. Five girls were needed to make up the Kanade, the ritual's instrument players, so You kidnapped five, including Misaki, to complete the ceremony. Parallel rituals were done on the night of the Kiraigou. The true and original ritual with Sakuya was taking place in a secret underground chamber while a tourist version is also happening above the surface. Due to this reason, the two utsuwas and all ten Kanade collapse with Sakuya and her Kanade collapsing, then having memory loss and in Sakuya's case, falling into a coma. The tourist version participants also collapsed, but never woke up. Sakuya was then kept in a ward in the Rougetsu Hall basement during the course of her coma with a nurse and a guard outside her door. On the anniversary of the ritual, Sakuya awakened with her face manifesting the effects of blooming, one of the symptoms of Getsuyuu Syndrome. She leaves her room and starts wandering the city, infecting everyone who sees her face. Soon, the entire island population was wiped out by Sakuya.Fatal Frame IV The Miya mystery  Ten years after the Rougetsu Island incident, Misaki Asou returns to the island with her friend, Madoka Tsukimori, to ferret out a grey spot in Misaki's past: a girl named Miya, haunting her, is somehow connected to the island and it's horrific events. Miya's ghost guides Misaki right to the Underground Lunar Hall, where the Kiraigou took place previously - that Misaki has particiapted in aswell as Sakuya's Kanade. Misaki learns soon, that Miya has eventually led her right to Sakuya's malicious spirit, resulting the two in a fight. After Misaki defended herself from the corrupted ghost, Sakuya takes the form of Miya, pointing at a doll in the middle of the hall - who resembles the exact appearance of Miya. Though the girl, who haunted Misaki turns out to be a doll only; \u00a0it is a significant toy both from Misaki's and Sakuya's past at the same time: the two, while they have been treated in Rougetsu Hall, became close friends, helping each other mutually not to lose their memories. As a token of their relationship, Sakuya gifted one of her dolls to her friend, giving it the name Miya (ax the mixture of Misaki and Sakuya).   However, as the treatment proceeded and the ceremony was prepared, it was a necessary step to sever the two from each other - after Sakuya's departure, Misaki used the doll to keep her memory intact during the syndrome, just as Sakuya did - and through these times, Miya began to hold the soul both of Sakuya and Misaki; and aswell the memory of their friendship. As Misaki recovers the doll she lost ten years ago during the failed ritual, regaining her lost memories, she begins to cry - Sakuya, seeing her old friend in sorrow, transforms into her normal form, comforting Misaki for a brief moment. Sakuya cracks a mysterious smile before vanishing and Misaki collapses.Aborting The Day Without Suffering  Ruka Minazuki, another native of the island, exploring her past; learns the chain of events that lead to the disaster and gains the necessary tools and knowledge to put an end to it. Although Sakuya attempts to\u00a0vanquish the visitor once on her journey, Ruka still manages to recover the reforged the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. In the possesion of it, she tracks Sakuya down to the Tsukuyomi Peninsula Lighthouse's top, where the corrupted spirit was seeking a way to be close to the moon as possible. Ruka fiercely battles Sakuya, successfully weakening her down long enough, to play the Tsukimori song on the organ there. Sakuya, hearing the melody, calms down sufficently, so Choushiro's ghost could replace the mask on her face. Sakuya, now being able to fulfill her task as a medium, guides the lost souls to the Afterlife before she'd cross herself over aswell, and with it, finally finding peace.Trivia Chitose Tachibana  Chitose Tachibana is a hostile female spirit in Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly. The younger sister of Itsuki and Mutsuki Tachibana, Chitose was not a twin and knew very little about the Crimson Sacrifice Ritual. She did not understand where Mutsuki had gone and why Itsuki's hair had turned white. In her confusion, she did not know what to do when the latest Crimson Sacrifice Ritual failed and all of All God's Village was swallowed by darkness.Background  Chitose had poor eyesight, and was often frightened of strangers, frequently hiding inside of closets when they came to her home. Because of this, Itsuki gave her a bell to wear, so that he may know when she was in danger and could go to her aid. Before leaving to help Yae and Sae Kurosawa escape the village, Itsuki gave Chitose the key to his room, with instructions to give it to his friend, Ryozo Munakata. When Ryozo came, however, Chitose got so scared that she hid, unable to give him the key. After the escape attempt, Chitose blamed Yae for having Itsuki wrongfully imprisoned, not understanding how much he wanted to help them escape. When Sae's ritual failed and the Repentance occurred, Chitose hid inside of a cupboard to escape the coming darkness. She became trapped inside, however, and panicked, scrawling \"help me\" on the walls and frantically calling out for help from her brother.

Perplexed by her memories of the past and worried by the death of her two friends, Marie and Tomoe, Ruka journeys to Rougetsu Island to try and find answers. She isn't alone in her curiosity, as two other friends, Misaki Asou and Madoka Tsukimori also seek the truth of their past life on the island. Ruka knows from her clouded memories that some tragedy occurred in their childhood, but she wasn't prepared to face the darkness lay that hidden within the island.Biography Background  Ruka was first introduced when she was 17 years old. She had entirely forgotten her past. All she remembered was a faint recollection of a melody, which she tried to reconstruct on the piano. She had no memory of her childhood, and had even forgotten her father's face. Two of her childhood friends are dead in a terrifying manner. In search of answers, Misaki and Madoka depart for Rougetsu Island, and do not return. Ruka follows, searching for her lost memories.Past  Ruka was born and raised on Rougetsu Island. Her childhood seems to have been a happy one, and she was close to both of her parents. Her mother, Sayaka, was a Tsukimori Maiden, and although the tradition had died out, she began to teach Ruka to play the Tsukimori Song on the piano. However, Ruka's father, Souya Yomotsuki, a mask-maker, became more and more obsessed with the craft of one of his ancestors, and started to neglect his family to work on masks. Souya and Sayaka began to argue a lot as she tried to convince him to stop what he was doing, and Ruka wrote in her diary that she was lonely and bored when he didn't hug her or stroke her head. One day she went looking for her father in his workshop, where he was hammering a mask. When he turned around, he was wearing a mask too, and Ruka was frightened when she didn't recognise his face. Souya forced Ruka to wear one of the new masks he had made, and as a result, Ruka developed Getsuyuu Syndrome. Sayaka found her in the garden one night, gazing at the moon, and took her to Rougetsu Hall for treatment. It was there that she met Misaki Asou and Madoka Tsukimori, and became friends with them. One of the experimental treatments Ruka underwent was music therapy, and she reacted very strongly to it, saying it made her remember horrible things. She was eager to see her father again, unaware that Sayaka, convinced that Souya's work on the masks was endangering Ruka, had decided to keep her away from him at all costs. On the night of the lunar eclipse, all the patients at Haibara Hospital and Rougetsu Hall gathered in the Lunar Eclipse Hall to watch the traditional Rougetsu Kagura. During the performance, Ruka, along with her new friends Misaki and Madoka, was taken away by You Haibara and brought to a vast cavern underground. She was dressed in the ritual garb, wearing a mask of a Kanade and made to participate in the even older Kiraigou ritual, providing musical accompaniment for a dancer, the Utsuwa, who wore the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse that Souya had been working on so diligently. However, the ritual failed. The mask shattered and the Utsuwa, Sakuya Haibara, fell into a coma. Ruka and the other kidnapped girls collapsed too, and lost all their memories. For more than a week, they remained underground, in a special chamber in which the light of the moon filtered down through a well. It was thought that gazing at the moon would have a purifying effect. It was there that Choushiro Kirishima, investigating at Sayaka's request, discovered the girls. They were taken to Amakore Bay Police Station and then returned to their families. However, Sayaka and Ruka did not go back to the Yomotsuki House where Ruka had grown up; instead, they left the island completely, leaving Souya behind, and Sayaka refused to tell her daughter anything about her childhood, preferring to focus on building happy memories. To erase Ruka's connections to the events, Sayaka changed Ruka's family name into Minazuki. Sayaka had been worn down by the stress of the events of 1970, and fell ill, eventually dying, and the islanders were all wiped out in an unexplained event in 1972. Ruka's only connections to her past were now the other four girls who had been kidnapped, and a faint recollection of a melody, which she tried to reconstruct on the piano. She had no memory of her childhood, and had even forgotten her father's face.Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse  Ten years after the incident at Rougetsu Island, two of the five girls, Marie and Tomoe, are dead. In search of answers, Misaki and Madoka depart for Rougetsu Island, and do not return. Despite always warned by her mother to not return to the island, Ruka follows Misaki and Madoka, searching for her lost memories.  She arrives at the abandoned sanatorium, Rougetsu Hall, where the girls were photographed ten years earlier. As she explores, she catches glimpses of Madoka disappearing out of sight. She finds an old camera on the floor in the Kunihiko Asou Museum, and discovers that this camera is able to capture strange images. Ruka learns the truth when she catches up with Madoka in the library: Madoka has died, and now is a ghost. With a distorted face, Madoka attacks Ruka, begging for help. Ruka makes her way around the building, gathering fragments of a black mask. She later discovers her own room, and remembers a song that was played by a music box when she was a child. When she plays the song on the piano, she has a vision of a different place, which seems familiar, and has a memory of a man hammering masks. Later on, Ruka finds her way into the hospital and goes underground, finding the secret cave in which the ritual was performed. She also finds the house she used to live in while living on the island, the same one she remembered when she played the song from the music box. In the house, it is revealed that the man that she saw hammering the mask was her father. From books and diaries scattered around, Ruka learns more about the history of her family, both her mother's side and her father's side. Her father was descended from a long line of master craftsmen, dedicated to making special masks which can affect the wearer's very soul, and her mother was a Tsukimori Maiden, one of a group of shrine maidens who assisted with the Kiraigou in the past. Ruka's ancestor Souetsu Yomotsuki had attempted to create the true Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, but instead had brought about the Day Without Suffering, a disaster in which many islanders died. Her father, Souya, had attempted the same thing, and suffered the same fate, when the Utsuwa from the failed ritual woke up and began to wander the island, causing everyone there to Bloom. However, Ruka learns that the song played by the Tsukimori Maidens is reputed to calm the moon and end the Blooming. She discovers the passage that leads to the lighthouse, at the top of which is the Gesshou Shrine, a special shrine used by the Tsukimori Maidens.Ending  Ruka defeats Sakuya and plays the Tsukimori Song on the organ there. This calms Sakuya long enough for Choushiro to put the remade Mask of the Lunar Eclipse on her face, and the spirits are able to pass on to the Afterlife. After Sakuya crosses over, the mask falls onto the floor and Souya appears and takes it. He turns around, finally revealing his face to Ruka, before he too crosses over. After the game's credits, Ruka is seen playing the same piano that is shown before she returned to Rougetsu Island, although this time she is now playing the Tsukimori Song instead of the incomplete melody she played before. As she plays, she sees a vision of a quiet forest, with a pool reflecting the moon: her father's vision of the afterlife.Appearance  Ruka's default outfit consists of a yellow dress, which hugs her figure and flows out more towards the bottom, the dress falls down a couple inches above her knees. She wears black stocking and a pair of high heels (which match the color of her dress. Around her neck she wears a gold chained necklace with gems. She wears her hair short and layered out; and her bangs brush across her eyes in a left to right style. Other costumes are available for Ruka to to wear through-out the game.Trivia Choushiro Kirishima  Choushiro Kirishima is one of the four playable characters in Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. He has been to Rougetsu Island in the past, investigating the kidnappings of five young girls. He witnessed the disaster on the day the islanders mysteriously died, however he has yet to uncover the truth behind the catastrophe and the kidnappings.Biography Past  Choushiro is the detective that was pursuing You Haibara on Rougetsu Island, because of the many murders he had supposedly committed. Both rituals took place during his investigation, and he was on the island when they failed. While he searched for You in the basement of Haibara Hospital, he found and rescued Ruka Minazuki, Misaki Asou, Madoka Tsukimori, Tomoe Nanamura and Marie Shinomiya, who were kidnapped by Haibara to perform the secret, \"genuine\" version of the tourist ritual. Ever since the incident he kept in contact with Sayaka Minazuki, Ruka's mother. He hid feelings for her which were not corresponded. Two years after the failed ritual, Choushiro returned to the island in pursuit of You Haibara. It was then he witnessed Sakuya Haibara escaping from the basement where she was locked away. When Choushiro finally did catch up to You, it was at the top of Haibara Hospital. Haibara, who had been hiding behind hanging laundry, stabbed Choushiro. Choushiro rushed at Haibara, and both fell to their deaths.Fatal Frame IV: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse  Years later, Choushiro reawakens on the ground in front of the hospital, unaware that he is dead. He recalls Sayaka Minazuki asking him to return to the island and save Ruka. As he wakes, Choushiro sees You entering the hospital, and so he begins the chase once again, battling ghosts with a special flashlight, created by Dr. Kunihiko Asou and given to Choushiro by Sayaka. It is not clear whether she gave him this flashlight before his return to the island, or whether it is only available to him now. During the events of the game, Choushiro, like Ruka and Misaki, collects a piece of Sakuya's shattered ritual mask. Sayaka asks him to give the piece to Ruka; he finds her underground, in the Moon-Reflection Well, looking exactly as she did when he found her ten years ago. While he is there, he sees Haibara, and once more pursues him to the roof, where they repeat their final confrontation. When he falls from the roof again, and witnesses his own body lying in the same place where he woke up in Chapter 3, Choushiro finally understands that he has been dead all along. Sayaka, who is also dead, appears and stands with him. When Ruka defeats Sakuya and plays the song, the winds and forces surrounding Sakuya are too strong for her to overcome, and she drops the mask. Choushiro comes to the rescue, picking the mask up and placing it on Sakuya's face. With this act, the ritual is 'completed' and the curse lifted. Choushiro then goes to join the other spirits as they cross over.", "ZeldaWiki": "ZeldaWiki ", "Diablo wiki": "Diablo wiki ", "Wiki Assassin's Creed": "Wiki Assassin's Creed ", "Wiki Mario": "Wiki Mario ", "Kingdom Hearts Wiki": "Kingdom Hearts Wiki ", "Mortal Kombat Fanon Wiki": "Mortal Kombat Fanon Wiki The Mortal Kombat Fanon Wiki Mortal Kombat Vs. DC Universe 2  This is the sequel to Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe.Story  Main article: Mortal Kombat Vs. DC Universe 2's Story Mode The Mortal Kombat Universe has changed since the conclusion of MK vs DC.

The fallen Elder God Shinnok and his cohort, Quan Chi; seek allies from the other realms to aid them in their Konquest of Earthrealm. Shinnok bridges an alliance with the galactic super-computing entity, Brainiac; in the hopes that the two can merge the realms for mutual benefit. Sensing a new merger of the Realms, Raiden decides to make contact with his allies in the Earth-One in preparation for the coming war. The rage had returned to both dimensions. New allegiances and rivalries will be formed; among friend and foe.Story Mode Chapters  The story of Mortal Kombat Vs. DC Universe 2 is told in 24 Chapters. Prominent Characters that are non-playable include Lex Luthor, Atrocious, Dr. Fate, Amazo, Bo' Rai Cho, Fujin, Havik, and Onaga.Characters  DLC:Arenas Gameplay  Gameplay has carried over from MKX and Injustice. Fighting occurs on a 2-D plane, with the ability to interact with background elements such as projectiles or springboards. Due to the introduction of X-RAY attacks from the previous installments, the X-RAY carries over to MK v DCU 2. At the first indicator of the meter, the player is allowed to perform an interrupt action by performing a perfect block. The second indicator allows for the player to actuate their RAGE meter. A player in RAGE acts identically to the previous MK vs DCU, it protects a player from being stunned and boosts a characters damage potential. The maximum indicator allows for the X-RAY move; which allows a character to perform a series of damaging attacks for a large portion of damage. In Story Mode, players again join a side. Since this time the heroes and villains band together instead of with their separate universes; the heroes and villains are collaborating beyond their two universes to come out ontop. Independent villains like Eclipso are using the heroes and villains RAGE against each other; while other characters simply fight to prove dominance.

If the player moves away from the square, it turns red, indicating that the Fatality/Heroic Brutality will not be executed. This time, either finisher can be selected instead of only showing the first finisher, which required players to pause the game and look for the alternate finisher in the move list. Lastly, the Krypt is available from the start with alternate costumes, concept art, development videos, and more to purchase.Hanzo Hasashi  Hanzo Hasashi (\u6ce2\u4f50\u5fd7\u534a\u85cf), also known as the ninja specter, Scorpion (\u880d), is a non-fanon character that debuted in the original Mortal Kombat. Like his blue counterpart, Sub-Zero, he is regarded by all as the poster-boy of the series, being the most recognizable of all the characters.About Scorpion  Scorpion is a hell-bent warrior seeking revenge. He was formerly the son of a great Shirai Ryu general, and desired to join the ranks of the clan. However, his parents were against this endeavor. Despite their best attempts to persuade him, Hanzo Hasashi came to be one of the most skilled warriors in the clan, granting them honor in glorious kombat. Eventually, Hanzo married and had a child. There came a time when he was contacted by the sorcerer, Quan Chi, who tasked him with retrieving the sacred Map of the Elements. Unbeknownst to Hanzo, however, the Lin Kuei warrior, Sub-Zero, was also contracted to retrieve the scroll. Hanzo Hasashi had failed in his attempts to retrieve the map and was ultimately killed by Sub-Zero. His soul laid waste in the Netherrealm while the sorcerer, Quan Chi, was occupied with murdering his family and clan, exterminating them to earn the Lin Kuei's favor. Hanzo Hasashi was resurrected by Quan Chi and thus, Scorpion was born. Quan Chi has deceived the ninja specter into believing that in addition to his own death, Sub-Zero had also murdered his clan and family. Enraged, Scorpion sought out Sub-Zero, and encountered him in the Netherrealm. Scorpion was defeated, however, but the wraith could not be killed.Personality  Scorpion is a tormented and broken soul, making him at most times silent and ominous. He rarely speaks and when he does, it is mostly regarding his former life and strong desire for vengeance. His only motive is revenge, which limits his sense of morality and remorse. This renders him as an impatient, vengeful, and somewhat unintelligent rogue who is neither good nor evil.Royam Niaz  Royam Niaz is the leader of the Kenduno Clan.

DC Universe 2 The story of Mortal Kombat Vs. DC Universe 2 is told in 32 chapters (16 for each universe), with one character being playable in each chapter and any hero from their respected universe being playable for the final battle. After beating both story modes, two more stories are unlocked involving the villians of both the MK and DC universe, consisting of 22 chapters (11 for each universe), with one character being playable in each chapter, any villain from their respected universe being playable for the final battle, and an alternate ending for both the MK and DC stories.Introduction  Much has changed since the \"collison\" years ago. One day, a meeting between Quan Chi and Lex Luthor turns into an alliance. First, they gather allies for their alliance. Quan Chi frees Darkseid from the Netherrealm and Luthor releases Shao Khan from the Phantom Zone. Afterwards, they convince Baraka, Kano, Shang Tsung, Goro, Mileena, Noob Saibot, Reptile, Sektor, and Shinnok along with Deathstroke, the Joker, Atrocitus, Black Adam, Cheetah, Despero, Metallo, Ra's Al Ghul, and Sinestro to join their cause. Next, they cause their worlds to collide through the combination of Luthor's technology and Quan Chi's magic. In order for their next phase of the plan to succeed, they needed to remove their two greatest obstacles: Superman and Raiden. Quan Chi goes to the Fortress of Solitude and weakens Superman with a powerful spell and Lex Luthor goes to Raiden's Temple and weakens Raiden with a powerful device. Despite this, Superman and Raiden escape before Quan Chi and Luthor can finish them, which could pose a threat to them and their plans. Even so, they both bring discoveries that could empower them greatly: Lex Luthor discovered the site of the Dragon King's undefeatable army and Quan Chi found a crater from a meteorite with immense energy inside of it. As a final means to prevent anyone from stopping them, they manage to create an artificial rage virus, much like the virus from before. To use it to their advantage, Luthor creates a device that allows whomever has it to not only resist the rage's ability to drive the kombatants mad, but also enables them to still use its power. With this advantage, the heroes will be driven mad while the villains will use the rage virus while in full control over it. They send their comrades to kill anyone and everyone that poses a threat to their plans as they try to discover how to unleash the undefeatably army and whatever may lie within the crater. Should they succeed, then both worlds will fall prey to this Deadly Alliance.Mortal Kombat  Raiden is outside of his temple when he suddenly feels a sudden surge. Then he is attacked by Lex Luthor, someone that he recognizes from the previous invasion. Raiden at first has the advantage, easily beating the mortal with his godly strength and speed. That all changed when Luthor hit Raiden with a beam that made him feel greatly weakened. Just as Luthor was about to finish him, Raiden uses the remainer of his strength to send himself far away from his temple. He finds himself at the Graveyard and as he tries to steady himself, a knife is thrown at him, which he barely dodges. Kano, hired to \"collect\" Raiden's head, appears, and prepares for kombat. Despite Raiden's weakness, Kano is defeated by the God of Thunder. Raiden is about to finish him when Kano presses a button on his wrist and teleports away. However, Kano leaves behind a vial with yellow gas inside of it. Raiden decides to take it, knowing that it had to have been of some importance to Kano. Raiden then goes to the Wu Shi Academy to see Liu Kang when he witnesses Baraka attacking the monks. Baraka then turns his attention to Raiden and charges at him. Raiden defeats the savage tarkatan, but before falling unconsious, Baraka strikes the vial, releasing the gas within it. Out of nowhere, Captain Marvel appears before Raiden, having no idea of how he came to the Wu Shi Academy and with no intention of fighting Raiden. Recalling that Captain Marvel had attacked him before, Raiden is suddenly filled with rage and attacks and defeats Captain Marvel. As he prepares to finish him, Kung Lao arrives and tells Raiden to spare him, since Captain Marvel appeared to have meant no harm. Raiden then feels betrayed and attacks and defeats Kung Lao. When Raiden is about to finish Kung Lao, Liu Kang jumps behind Raiden and knocks him unconsious. When Raiden awakens, he sees Liu Kang and Kung Lao are watching over him. He apologizes to Kung Lao for attacking him and then explains that the yellow gas within the vial that Kano had left behind was what had caused him to go berzerk. He also noticed the similarities between the rage that the gas had created to the rage from the \"collision\" years ago. Believing that Kano and Baraka are part of something even bigger, he asks Liu Kang and Kung Lao to find out who they were working for. They both prepare to leave when Metallo suddenly appears in. He charges for Raiden, only to be stopped by Kung Lao, who swings his hat and slashes him. Kung Lao tells Liu Kang to escape with Raiden and the two of them leave. Metallo, angered by the slash since it put a scar on his face and by the fact that Raiden was escaping, decides to kill Kung Lao, but is defeated. Kung Lao then decides to go along with Raiden's plan to find the ones behind the attacks. He vengers across Earthrealm until he sees an anomaly: a body of water that was not originally in the region with a yellow line going across it. He is then approached by what appears to be Kitana, who tells him that she is afraid that a new threat is approaching and Kung Lao replies that he will do all in his power to stop it. Then she suddenly tells him to watch out from behind him, to which Kung Lao turns around. Then Kitana lunges at Kung Lao with sais, only for Kung Lao to move them aside with his hands. However, this knocks him off-balance and both him and Kitana fall into the water below. Kitana grabs a hold of him to drown him, but to both their surprise, neither of them drown and they suddenly find themselves near an underwater city. With both of them standing on firm ground, Kung Lao asks her why she had attacked, to which she doesn't respond and instead lunges again. The two battle with Kung Lao emerging victorious. He is curious as to if Kitana was influenced by the same rage as Raiden was and examines her, but then notices a tear on her mask revealing what appears to be a fang. He then removes the mask, revealing that it wasn't even Kitana at all: it was Mileena. Kung Lao then realizes that something must have happened to Kitana if Mileena was disquised as her. Suddenly, a trident is thrusted, which Kung Lao nearly dodges. He turns to see Aquaman, with his eyes glowing yellow, like Raiden's. He tells Kung Lao that he and \"the beast woman\" have trespassed upon Atlantis and that they will pay for it with their lives. The two battle and Kung Lao manages to defeat him. After emerging from the water, Kung Lao continues his search and eventally happens upon the Fortress of Solitude. He looks around until a batarang flies behind him. Kung Lao then swings his hat and slices the batarang in two. Batman then appears before him, asking why he is there and why he attacked Aquaman. Kung Lao replies that he is there searching for answers and that Aquaman had threatened to kill him. Batman, not buying it, instead plans to take him in. Kung Lao resists and the two battle. Though Kung Lao seemingly had the edge, Kung Lao insists that they were evenly matched. Batman then states that now that they've fought, he believes Kung Lao's story. He was only testing him to see if he could be trusted. Batman then asks Kung Lao for his aid. Kung Lao asks why and Batman explains that the worlds are merging again and that they do not know who is behind it. Kung Lao then accepts and the two of them leave in the Batplane. Soon after, Jax is wandering through what was supposed to be a desert, only to see it in the middle of a snowstorm. He communicates with Sonya Blade, telling her that he's detecting something with a huge energy reading. He eventually detects it right underneath him and then he notices what looks like a cable or wire of some sort. He reaches underneath and feels a person underneath, though the sensors do not detect any humans. He pulls out this \"person\" to find that it's Cyrax, who seems to be deactivated. He realizes that Cyrax was the source of the high energy reading and takes him back to the Special Forces Base. Jax and Sonya look over Cyrax and scan his body, seeing that he is a cyborg. They then open up a compartment in the back of Cyrax's head, revealing chips. Jax sees one that he believes is a power source and decides to activate it. From there, Cyrax activates and then sees Jax and Sonya as enemies. He disables his safeties, activates kombat mode, and battles with Jax. With Jax on the ground and Sonya in front, ready to defend her ally, Cyrax decides to eliminate both in one fell swoop, only for conflict to begin between his human emotions and his programming. Eventually, Cyrax manages to win over the programming and regain his humanity. After helping up Jax and Sonya, he introduces himself and explains their story. He then states that before his system blacked out while he was in a sandy desert, he was searching for a cyborg like himself, whose name he cannot recall, possibly due to a memory error. Though Jax and Sonya are not sure where to find this cyborg, they tell him that the best place to start searching would be the Lin Kuei temple. They check their computer, only to see that it is in an entirely different place than it originally was, to which Cyrax curiously wonders how it was moved. Jax and Sonya then triy to tell him about the invasion from years ago, but with Cyrax deactivating before it, he has no knowledge of it. Considering that his trip will be long, Cyrax tells them to explain it to him as he searches for the temple and over time, Cyrax has all of the info that he needs. He happens upon Gotham City and as he continues on his way, he is quickly alerted by his sensors that someone is trying to take him out. He turns to see Deathstroke, who fires an electrical round from his sniper rifle. Cyrax then seperates himself and reassembles behind Deathstroke, whom he swings at, but misses. Deathstroke then jumps through a window and lands on the streets below, to which Cyrax follows. Deathstroke then exclaims that Cyrax is not \"the mech I'm looking for\", to which Cyrax wonders if the \"mech\" is the cyborg that he's looking for. The two then battle, with Cyrax managing to defeat Deathstroke by kicking him into the air and through a wall. Cyrax then move on and eventually makes it to the Fortress of Solitude, which is nearby the Lin Kuei temple. As Cyrax passes through it, he detects something charging at him and jumps out of the way to avoid it. The individual is revealed to be Metallo, who states that he has been looking for another cyborg, but Cyrax will do just fine. The two of them battle and Cyrax manages to defeat him and carry on to the Lin Kuei temple. He then sees that it has recently been under attack and then rushes to ensure that he is not too late. He then reaches the main hall, where he sees Sektor in battle with Sub-Zero. Sektor claims that the Lin Kuei along with a medallion are rightfully his and Sub-Zero took them from him and must pay. Cyrax interrupts and tries to battle Sektor, but he dodges every move that Cyrax throws and then counters. Sektor has had his head implanted with old Lin Kuei cyborg files, allowing him to read everything about Cyrax and his fighting style. As Sektor prepares to eliminate his former comrade, Nightwing appears behind Sub-Zero and battles Sektor, whom mocks his metal staff. Then Nightwing pulls the staff apart into two batons and when he strikes Sektor's head, an electric shock is delivered that prevents him from accessing the cyborg files. Cyrax then tackles Sektor and battles him away from Sub-Zero and Nightwing. He eventually beats Sektor and deactivates him by striking a weak joint that sends power to the head. Sub-Zero then greets and thanks Cyrax and asks what he is searching for. Cyrax explains the situation and then Sub-Zero tells Cyrax that the cyborg that he has been searching for is named Smoke. Then Cyrax's memory files being running again and he manages to access his files. With these files, Cyrax has multiple locations from across the globe that Smoke might possibly be. Before leaving, Cyrax is approached by Sub-Zero, who not only asks him to take good care of Smoke if he finds him, but also if Cyrax is willing to aid him. Cyrax agrees to do so when he returns and journeys off in search for Smoke.DC Universe  Superman is inside of his Fortress of Solitude when he suddenly feels a sudden surge. Then he is attacked by Quan Chi, whom he does not recognize. Superman at first has the advantage, easily beating the sorceror with his superhuman strength and speed. That all changed when Quan Chi hits Superman with a spell that made him feel greatly weakened. Just as Quan Chi was about to finish him, Superman uses the remainder of his strength to fly far away from his fortress and to Metropolis. There, everything seems to be fine until the Joker arrives with a parade vehicle of himself. As it fires machine guns and rockets at multiple buildings, Superman flies over the vehicle and tears off the Joker head, disabling the vehichle. When he lowers it down, the teeth of the Joker head retract to show the Joker inside. Superman prepares to take the Clown Prince of Crime into custody when the Joker throws a bomb at Superman, which knocks him back and disorients him. The Joker, completely surprised by this, decides to use Superman's sudden weakness to his advantage and take him on, but is defeated. Superman calls for Batman to let him know that he has the Joker and then turns around and uses his heat vision on a sniper rifle from a rooftop. The sniper rifle was being used by Deathstroke, who was about to take out Superman, already knowing of his new-found weakness. Deathstroke then comes down and tries to take down Superman up close, only to be defeated as well. After calling the Justice League to let them know of the Joker's and Deathstroke's arrests, Superman suddenly sees Scorpion emerge in front of him, confused as to what had happened and where he was. Superman does not trust him due to his past experience with Scorpion and decides to stop him. Superman defeats him and before Scorpion falls unconsious, he warns him about Quan Chi. Then a news flash on a TV talk about a rampage near Gotham City, so Superman asks the Justice League to pick up Scorpion and then flies off. When Superman gets there, he finds his old nemesis Metallo, who had orcestrated the event just to get Superman's attention. He, like Deathstroke, knew about Superman's new weakness beforehand and believed that now would be the best time for him to defeat his hated enemy. The two battle and Superman seems to have the edge, but barely. Superman demands to know how he and Deathstroke knew about his weakness, but Metallo throws a vial with yellow gas on the ground and then teleports after pressing a button on his wrist. As the gas gets into Superman's system, Superman is suddenly sent into rage and is teleported himself. Nightwing is in the Batcave when he suddenly sees Superman disappear off the grid. He calls Batman to inform him of the news and Batman reports that he will discuss the occurence with the Justice League after he returns to the Bat Cave. After Nightwing finishes the transmission, Reptile sneaks through a small passageway into the cave and spits acid towards Nightwing. He narrowly dodges it, only for the acid to melt through part of the control panel. Reptile then leaps down to take care of Nightwing, but is defeated. Batman then enters the Bat Cave and Nightwing explains to him that Reptile had broken in and attempted to kill him. Batman then asks Nightwing to watch over Gotham for him while he meets with the Justice League and Nightwing agrees. As he patrols the city, he hears an alarm in the distance and spots a broken window. Then he sees Catwoman running on a rooftop not far from there. Nightwing leaps down to stop her, but Catwoman does not halt. Nightwing then throws a batarang at Catwoman, causing her to drop a jewel that she had stolen, which agitated her. The two battle and Nightwing seems to be victorious. He demands that she give up the jewel, to which Catwoman agrees. Just as she is about to leave, Nightwing swings his bo-staff at Catwoman's chest, knocking a jewel out her vest. Nightwing then takes the jewel, discards the fake, and heads off. Later, Nightwing sees a strange aura in a nearby alleyway and goes to investigate it. Kabal emerges, telling Nightwing to stay back, and runs off. Nightwing is suspicious of this and pursues him with the Batmobile. As he does so, Nightwing notices a yellow line across the ground, but decides to worry about it later and focus on the mission at hand. Kabal stops at the Graveyard, to which Nightwing stops as well. He asks Kabal who he is and what he was doing, but Kabal only replies that he (Nightwing) must go as far away as possible before \"it\" takes him. Then Kabal's eyes glow yellow and he goes berzerk. Nightwing manages to defeat Kabal and soon after, he is met by Nightwolf, who asks why he attacked Kabal. Nightwing tells him that it was self-defense, but Nightwolf is not convinced and then battles him. Nightwing barely defeats Nightwolf, who then believes Nightwing's tale and asks for his forgiveness. He had battled Nightwing in order to see his intentions and through kombat, he saw that Nightwing's intentions were good. As Nightwolf retrieves Kabal and prepares to leave, Raiden appears before Nightwing, asking him for his aid. Nightwing wonders what for and Raiden informs him that the worlds were merging again and that Quan Chi was at large. Nightwing then comes with Raiden as he teleports both of them. Green Arrow is in a forest firing arrows at multiple targets when Black Canary approaches him and informs him that Superman is missing. Green Arrow states that he hopes that Superman is not frozen at his fortress again, only for Black Canary to reply that Batman has confirmed that Superman is not there. From there, Green Arrow takes his arrows out of his targets and decides to go look for him. As he searches, he happens upon an area that he has never visited before, with Black Canary telling him on a headset to be careful. He walks by what appears to be gardens and sees Mileena lying in the water, whom he dives in to save. He places her onto the land and once he presses on her chest to get air flowing circulating through her body, she attacks him. He wonders if the water has possibly gotten to her head, but then sees a tear on her mask revealing a fang, to which he replies that she is a beauty and beast. The two battle and Green Arrow manages to defeat Mileena. Afterwards, as he prepares to leave, he turns to see Baraka right in his way. Baraka retracts his blades and Green Arrow asks if Mileena is his wife, to which Baraka then tells him that he will die for trespassing on Shang Tsung's island. Green Arrow fends him off and fires two arrows, both of which trap Baraka to a tree. Before he can retract his claws, Green Arrow tells him that he used sedative arrows, which will render him unconsious for some time. He then continues on, wondering if all of this resistance means that he's closer to Superman. He eventually goes down a stair case and eventually happens upon Shang Tsung's Flesh Pits and is disturbed by the beings that he sees are being produced. He is then met by Kano and asks him where Superman is, to which he replies that he isn't anywhere near there. Green Arrow warns Kano not to pull out his knives, to which he does and Green Arrow fires two arrows, one which is knocked away by one of Kano's knives and the other cut down the middle by a thrown knife. Green Arrow then battles Kano and emerges victorious. Kano attempts to flee by teleporting, but Green Arrow tackles him, teleporting the two of them to Goro's lair, which Kano was not planning on going. Green Arrow then knocks Kano out and venters through until Goro appears behind him. Green Arrows states that the big scary monster is supposed to get him and then dodges to avoid a swing from Goro, to which he replies that he managed to survive the cliche. Goro then warns Green Arrow that he is not a monster and that he will tear him apart for opposing the Deadly Alliance. Green Arrow states that \"being torn apart\" is another cliche that he survive and then asks Goro what he meant by the Deadly Alliance. Goro prepares for battle and Green Arrow simply replies that it's been a while since he's hunted big game. The two finally battle and Green Arrow barely manages to defeat Goro. He lays down by a wall exhausted, only to hear a voice talking to him. It states that it is all of the shadows in the room and that it is darkness itself. The voice calls itself Noob Saibot, to which Green Arrow replies that he should change his name, since no one in his world will take it seriously. Noob then appears right behind Green Arrow and when Green Arrow gets up, Noob summons his shadow behind Green Arrow as well. Then Black Canary hears Green Arrow disconnect and wonders what has happened to him.Mortal Kombat Vs. Ben 10 Universe  Mortal Kombat Vs.

If you are planning to write a deity, you should also make sure it does not exist in the Real-Life Figures pages or in the gods list below already.The Story  Main article: Lore of Cubeaism In the time before, there were three siblings: Roki, Terrae, and Net. They were bored with all that they had in their own dimension, so pooling together their powers they decided to create a world to entertain them. Roki acted first, cutting off his finger and using it to build the bedrock core of the world. Then cutting off the rest of his arm, he layered the world in smoothstone. Gathering his remaining energy, he struck the world as hard as he could with his right arm. The force of the blow created massive amounts of pressure causing diamonds, gold, iron and coal to form at different layers of the world. The resulting earthquakes created great chasms and cave openings leading deep into the earth. Terrae, looking upon Roki's work said, \"It's a good start, but it\u2019s hard and cold. This world needs beauty and softness as well.\" And with that, she reached down and picked up chunks of smoothstone and ate them. Chewing and melding them with her delicate tongue, she turned the stone to dirt and spat it back up, covering the world. Then she ran her hand over it and layered the dirt with grass short and tall. With great care, she pushed four of her fingers into the earth. Removing each of them one by one; from the holes... the first oak, birch, pine and spruce trees were born. She then cut her arm, and bled out onto the world creating the oceans. Net, the youngest of the three, was impressed with what the other siblings had done. But he had not yet fully realised his powers and became sad. He shed a tear and it fell onto the world the siblings had created, from the tear a tiny rmoronic chicken was born. Net was overwhelmed with joy at his creation, even though it had zero survival instincts and would aimlessly wander off cliffs as often as anything else, he still loved it. Over the years as Net further realised his power, he created pigs, sheep, cows, wolves and squids. The other gods were proud of him and having watched him develop, decided to teach him how to focus his power. With this, Net was able to create the first human. The humans of the world prospered, and adored their creators. Terrae and Roki took shifts to watch the world, Terrae's eye was bright like fire and caused all her creations to prosper as she watched them. Roki's eye was white and cold, signalling the time for the humans to rest. Many ages past as the world prospered, Roki and Terrae were finally content and continued to watch over it. Net however, became bored and restless again. Using his power, he created the first slime for his amusement. While mostly harmless, the slime had the power to hurt the other beings of the world. When Roki and Terrae looked upon it, they were upset and banished it to only live in the very depths of the world, away from the humans. This infuriated Net and he demanded his siblings allow his creation room on the surface. The two refused, and having seen his siblings make sacrifices to enhance their powers, he did the same. He cut off his ear and used it to create the first zombie. Terrae and Roki were unable to banish this creature and it quickly began to decimate the humans that the pair loved so much. Seeing the progress of this monster made him want to create more, so he pulled a bone from his arm to create skeletons and eight of his toes to create the spiders. Terrae, seeing Net's growing insanity, cut out an eye and used it to curse his monsters with fire whenever she looked upon them. Roki and Terrae then turned to Net, furious with him and pooled their powers together to banish him to a world of suffering and pain; The Nether. In his last defiant act before his banishment, Net tore his heart out and created the mighty creeper. This creature will stalk the land, immune to the powers of Terrae's eye, and would be a great calamity on the world. The humans of the world were wiped out, their structures now overrun with creatures and slowly growing moss. Terrea and Roki turned to one another, and using all the energy they had left, they summoned one final human. Spent, the two gods are now only able to take turns passing their eyes across the world, keeping close watch on their last creation, Steve....The Gods  To see the original authors look at the old Cubaeistic Deity Table.

Terrae created all the life including plant life. She also created dirt, biomes, and the oceans. She and Roki created the world while Net created the mobs. Net was eventually banished by Terrae and Roki for creating hostile mobs.Lore  The Eye of Terrae, more commonly known as The Sun, watches over the Overworld during the day. Her Eye is warm, and comforting, as it is a sign of peace as she illuminates the world. Terrae cut out one of her eyes, in order to curse the monstrous forces of Net's with fire, should they ever appear within her gaze.The Gentle Faith Level 1 \u2013 Initiate of Terrae Level 2 \u2013 Tree Shepard Level 3 \u2013 Druid Level 4 \u2013 FeyChild Optional Challenges Lore of Cubeaism Canon Cubeaism Lore Cubeiasm Genealogy  Within the Universe of Cubeiasm, there are a massive number of Gods, Spirits, and Demons, all of which are born of one another, or are born of mankind. Generally all Spirits or Demons who are born of a god, are allied with that god, though there are exceptions. Spirits and Demons of Mankind are considered Neutral entities, as well as the Great Mysteries, despite all gossip that says they may be agents of Abstergo.Fan-Made Lore Abstergo  Abstergo is the God of The Void. He exists in a realm of pure nothingness, a place even the gods do not dare return to. It is said that he existed long before the Major Gods created the world, and became enraged when they filled his pure empty realm with worlds. His existence is unknown to the world, as he exists in a place beyond the gods. Acolytes of his are extremely rare, but it is said by those who know his story, that his greatest desire is to return the worlds back to the Void. To clean up his now cluttered realm. He is a villian far greater than Net, for if he were to gain power over the worlds, he wouldn't fill the lands with fire, lava, and pain. The worlds, and the gods who created them, would cease to exist.Awy\u00e9  Awy\u00e9 is the goddess of jungles and nature. When Terrae created the first jungle tree, she cut herself on the rough bark, and a drop of her blood melded with the tree, giving it a consciousness and a spirit. This consciousness spread through the entire jungle creating a vast network of consciousness. Sometimes, the spirit manifests itself in humans, who become the followers of Awy\u00e9. Unlike Terrae, who is peaceful, Awy\u00e9 is affiliated with the harshness of jungle life. The path to becoming a follower of Awy\u00e9 is the path to becoming a true warrior and hunter.Belgo  There once was a small spirit, who had a jack 'o' lantern instead of a head. He was a kind-hearted, positive being, that was beloved by children every year. He learned to love them back, and felt that it was his duty to protect these living things. He had no real purpose at that time, until one day when he was watching the world in the form of a jack 'o' lantern, he discovered that those he loved were a helpless race that Net's creatures craved to kill. Belgo then gathered some of Terrae's trees and some of Roki's stone, and used it to create a village. He collected more, but this time he crushed it all into a combined powder, and he spread it across the land and villages sprouted, and from that day, he grew from a simple Spirit in a Jack 'o' Lantern, to the Guardian of Villages, having given the defenseless and helpless race a place to call home.Darathos  Terrae and Roki watch over the overworld and illuminate it both during the day and night in the forms of the Sun and Moon, Darathos attempts to corrupt the humans of the world in the places they can't reach. He speaks to mankind in whispers in the darkness, and is the reason children ask for a torch by their bedsides when they sleep. He is considered one of the Great Mysteries, as he is not affiliated with the three Major Gods in any way, and his purpose is unknown.Definitis  Paranoid and crazy. He only wants his followers safe. Even if it means them being holed up in a fort the rest of their lives flinching at shadows. Gods usually have no opinion of him mostly because they don't want to entice his already rampant thoughts of everyone turning against him. No one knows why he is so afraid, or what it is he is afraid of, Definitis is one of the Great Mysteries.Deus Ignis  Deus Ignis was a demon summoned by Net. He was a secret, until now. Net has been losing a secret war against Terrea. He told Deus Ignis to Go Gather an Army of men to go and help against the war.Fara  In the beginning, the world was in relative peace until Net's forces began creeping onto the land of Minecraftia. To protect her lands, Terrae asked Roki to help her create a goddess that could protect her land. They created Fara from a portion of Terrae's soul, and Roki's strength, and some of their combined power. Fara was then sent to guard the ends of the earth. Eventually, Fara played with her land, created a labyrinth filled with strange terrain that monsters and darkness is said to be lost forever in. After centuries of fighting Net's forces, Fara grew weak. It is said that she used up her power during the conflict with Nets' forces. It is rumored that Fara is dead, due to the reappearnce of Net's forces. Now, the majority of Fara's teachings are lost. Those that remain are carefully preserved by her followers. Throughout the ages, Fara's followers have dwindeled due to the unknown state of their goddess. Only her true followers know that she now exists in a place between the worlds, guarding the metaphysical boundaries between realms.Feirgenirb  This god, Poise's twin brother, was forgotten until a\u00a0miner\u00a0named Hero found ancient texts that spoke of him while searching for diamonds. Once Hero saw these ancient texts, his eyes were purified with one desire that he read about in the scrolls: destruction. To become a perfect follower of Feirgenirb, Hero added the end of Feirgenirb's name to his own and reversed it, calling himself Herobrine. Herobrine's one goal is the beginning of Feirgenirb's name reversed: to grief. Griefing is an act that worships Feirgenirb.Flynt  This is a Spirit of Humanity, and he despises people who do things for fun, not to collect information. He hated Net, but he also hated Terrae. He hated Penna and Glueco, but he loved Roki, for his stoic nature, and Poise, for his ruthless demand for sacrifice. He is a spirit of perserverence, of unending dedication, and desire for knowledge, and success.Fructum  Toximit, fascinated by the creations of the other gods, learned from Terrae how to create life. He first combined his two favorite things, snow and pumpkins, to create snow golems. These creatures were so simple that anyone could create them. Even Roki was proud of his creation, and allowing him to use his resources to create the Iron Golem. But Toximit still wanted to create more. One day, when exploring an abandoned mineshaft, he found a chest. The chest contained a single seed. He showed this seed to Terrae, she was puzzled, and helped him grow the plant, and the first melon was born. Toximit tried to create a snow golem out of the melon, but failed. After scratching his head for a good amount of time, he decided to try and enchant the melon. It worked. The \"Melon Man\" called himself Fructum. He was much less shy and more sociable than Toximit, and he made friends with many other gods. This angered Toximit, and in his anger he sent Fructum down into the mineshaft where he came from. Fructum began planting more melons, storing their seeds in chests. He even got friendly with the spiders that infested the mineshafts, infusing them with chlorophyll, causing them to possess poison. Toximit and Fructum are still enemies to this day.Furan  Net had been banished into the nether, in his rage making an empty void of power, a mass of energy slowly compacting over the years. As Terrea and Roki danced and rotated in their sleep, the energy suddenly reaching critical mass and imploding. Thus, Furan was born. Furan knew of most everything that Net knew, and as such, had his twisted mind. However, there was a bit of his mind that wanted happiness among his wanderings-setting fires and growing nether warts was fun, but really not all that satisfying. One day, amongst his wanderings in the nether, he came upon the sleeping Net, and he reacted to it as he did to all things-setting it on fire. Net awoke, but instead of being mad, he smiled and called Furan his son. After some father-son bonding time, mostly setting things on fire, Net set down to teach his son everything he knew. He told Furan of Terrea and Roki, the two that had cursed his creations and banished him here. Furan now wished for vengeance, and created two new races with the help of his father-The Endermen, and The pigmen, to ruin all that terrea held dear and blast a hole through the wall that trapped his father. Furan soon created a portal and warped into his enemies realm. Once he arrived, he was awestruck-such beauty, such wonder, such variaty! He cherished everything he saw, in the only way he knew how-fire. He created a massive wild fire that ruined everything that he saw, and when the fire died out, Terrea and Roki came out of their slumber, saw him, and gave him a massive scar down his left eye. He cursed them, and the created a being to destroy them-the almighty Enderdragon. Eventually, he realized that his burning was not right for this world, and as such felt he needed to give something back. So he did-he gave birth to the second race of humans, gave them homes, and then banished himself and the dragon to places unknown, until some one found him and forgave him for his wrongdoings. Unfortunatley, he forgot to tell his followers where he went. To this day, his followers still search for him, knowing that the rain itself is his tears, trying to put out the fire he started long ago. \u00a0Gluceo  Gluceo the god of cake was made by net. Some wonder why net made him. Gluceo has split personality syndrome. One side is an evil god made by net to use the love of cake against people, and made highly addictive cakes to destroy the human race. The other one is the good god who was the side of cake net could not destroy. Who would make perfect cakes with a snap of his fingers. The nice side of this god usually destroys the others cake, and eats and shares his. But on accident he ate the one his other self made making him highly addicted to cake. As he felt himself losing control he made 3 new gods Toxmit, Fructus, and The Holy Apple. After having the battle inside is head he said he had won, but he was still adicted to making cakes enlessly. He said the good in his head had beaten the evil. So now the last question is. Is he telling the truth? Or is THE CAKE A LIE. (ha.. Thank you Valve.)Harenam  It is unknown as of the moment who Harenam is related to but he did learn and work under Net. Harenam's\u00a0Deserts tend to kill anything that hasn't adapted to it, especially in the summer(see\u00a0seasons mod, and\u00a0solar apocalypse mod). He isn't an insane maniac like Net, but he is evil. When he created a desert out of Poise's sand, drying up a small lake, it made Poise mad for using what was Poise's main construction material. Thus he was banished to the Nether, Net helped him escape. Once out, he spread his desert's destruction, killing life... Poise soothed the desert a bit with some oaises to help adventurer remain out of Harenam's hands. It is said he is a Demon born of Shens ruthless and violent nature.Herobrine  Herobrine, The Blind Destruction was created by the obscure Great Modders, followers of Notch. He can corrupt mass of land in single seconds and master the dark magic. Imprisoned in the depths of Nether, he is very septic about Net, and has payed it by the curse of fire. He shows complete disregard every thing he did not see, and is further even more aggressive. He is the very inverse of Steve, and will destroy in place of build, will corrupt at the place of load and kill passive Mobs at the place of growing them. He do not belong to any of the three Gods, he is thus one of the Great Mysteries. He is the incarnation of the Null, and he worships FeirgenibHowlith  A deity who's gender is never specified. Often taking the form of a wolf, Howlith is an aggressive, yet powerful leader of the pack. Followers of Howlith are most commonly found in leadership positions. They are able to control large groups just by stating their desires as long as the outcome is beneficial to the entire group. Howlith is said to appear to their followers during the blue moon.Kratae  People who follow Kratae are not known for their speaking abilities, nor for their appearance. If they are known for anything though... it's pure fear as anyone watching their numbers swell with men, women, and children who follow a leader's orders without question... no matter the order wonder just why they heed a deity's call that NO ONE understands! The Faithful Saint McCormick is a member of the congregation and seems to be the only one who knows the true motives of Kratae... and he will not reveal this knowledge. All attempts by outside forces and other deities to find out about these cult-like acolytes have met with failure and often... disappearances... He is considered one of the Great Mysteries, as he is not affiliated with the three Major Gods in any way, and his purpose is unknown.Moouka  It is said that Moouka was born into the universe upon Nets first attempt at breaking the barrier between the Overworld and The Nether. The Great Shift was not acheived, however, Nets pure insanity seeped into the land, and corrupted a portion of the world forever. The dirt warped into a strange inexplicable substance, commonly called Mycelium, the trees warped into giant caricatures of mushrooms, and the local livestock began to change color, and began to sprout mushrooms out of their spines. Upon discovery of this strange, deranged land, it was found that Nets insanity alone had concecrated this new and awkward place with it's own God, which was able to push the boundaries of its realm, to corrupt the rest of the world with Nets Insanity.Net  Net is the demon, the ORIGINAL demon. Net will do something harsh to you if you:Penna  The Goddess of the sky. She is peaceful, loving, and it is said that she fled to live in the realm of the heavens to avoid the violence on the ground. When the Endermen appeared, she cried, creating the rain. The rain is a blight against the First Sign of the Second Coming, and should be seen as a blessing.Roki  The Eye of Roki, more commonly known as The Moon, watches over the Overworld at night. His gaze is cold, and harsh. Roki is the god of the underground, his realm is for the tough, and his gae reflects this. Monsters run rampant under his Eye, and be blesses the world with little to no illumination. It is unclear as to why Roki's gaze wazes, wanes, and occassionally is vacant. It is said that Roki does not concern himself with the surface world, and often maintains more focus in his realm below the ground.Shen  Shen the god of Desert Warfare. He is the son of Roki and is brothers with Poise the god of the sea who is trapped in a never ending slumber under the ocean. Shen was made by Roki to fight back the monsters of Net. He was too confident and aggressive at one point and went to the Nether. He brought with him the power of the desert and his knowledge of warfare. Net ( god of insanity,maddness and the Nether) saddly he was corupted and he was sent back to the world. He then made his son Harenam with the power of Net manipulating his anger and aggression. Harenam was the Demon of the Desert. Shen was so disapointed in himself he wanted to be free from Nets control. His prayers were ansered when Roki and Terrea used their power to free him from Net's control. At the cost of him staying in the sands of deserts. To this day he tries to get humans to complete the mission that he could not. DESTROY NET.Soukia  Soukia is the Goddess of Sin, and exists to turn Acolytes away from their paths, by whispering terrible, suggestive thoughts into the minds of the faithful and devout. She is the reason why Acolytes of Terrae will burn down trees, or why Acolytes of Roki will abandon the safety of their underground mines to seek the warmth of the sun, or why an Acolyte of Net will begin to see reason. She is considered one of the Great Mysteries, as she is not affiliated with the three Major Gods in any way, and her purpose is unknown.Terrae  The Eye of Terrae, more commonly known as The Sun, watches over the Overworld during the day. Her Eye is warm, and comforting, as it is a sign of peace as she illuminates the world. Terrae cut out one of her eyes, in order to curse the monstrous forces of Net's with fire, should they ever appear within her gaze.Net General  Net is the god of the Nether. He originally created mobs but was banished for creating hostile mobs. He is now a god of madness.Lore  Net created the first passive mobs, but eventually created the slime, which could hurt other mobs. This angered his siblings who banished it into the underground, which infuriated Net. He went mad and created more aggressive hunting mobs like the spider and zombie. Roki and Terrae, his siblings, banished him to the Nether and made it so all of his creations (except the Creeper) would burn at day.

His name was Nixos. Nixos in his life was an inquisitive man; a scholar among the early people, he helped in the development of crafting in all its forms. A man brought forth a length of tree, Nixos devised interlocking planks. A man brought forth a bundle of sticks for a fire, Nixos was inspired to create fences. He was even present when the first set of distinguishable specialized tools were created. The at the time almost tribal leaders, with the guidance of Nixos\u2019 genius even developed firing techniques for the creation of glass and refined stone. In his middle age, Nixos took to the more philosophical view and widened his thought to the world as a whole. In it he saw other creatures of Net, the soft land of Terrae, and the strong foundations of Roki. Some villagers took to exclusive worship of one of these mighty gods; but Nixos wasn\u2019t satisfied with such a narrow view. He saw all things existing in balance; for without Roki\u2019s foundation, there would be nothing to stand upon. Without Terrae\u2019s flourishing cover; he could not survive. And without Net\u2019s influence, he would not exist. This lead to a long period of study and homage to each god, focusing on how their influence fringed on each other. During this time, Nixos developed the idea of balance. While all of his works have been lost to the ages, it is believed that Nixos took his studies back to his home village, and delivered it to the presiding council of man. He was judged harshly by the devout who focused on only one particular God; and was exiled. On his journey to find a new home; he was walking across a planes land when he happened upon a chicken, teetering on the edge of a stone block precariously hovering over a pool of molten rock. Working quickly; he took planks from his pack and built a pathway for the fowl to safely escape upon. Net witnessed this benevolence, and was pleased. He appeared before Nixos; and granted him one favor. Nixos was a humble man, he wanted nothing more then to spread knowledge to his fellow man; and asked for a light for others seeking wisdom to gather on. Net gathered up sand from a nearby bank; and set it ablaze, leaving a towering collum of glass. The inside of this collum was set alight, creating a shining beacon on the plain. Nixos was humbled; and swore to use his skill of the craft to creating a structure worthy of standing near the God\u2019s gift. Time passed; curious travelers and small nomadic tribes alike stopped to investigate this odd light, and Nixos welcomed them. He sought to teach any who would listen; provide for those who could not provide for themselves, as long as they were willing to learn. Soon; a blooming community erupted around this guiding light. Toward Nixos\u2019 twilight years, his now thriving town was on the verge of another breakthrough; over agonizing years of study the inhabitants had learned to sense and draw upon the energy the God\u2019s themselves used to forge the world. They focused, and channeled this power into their tools; granting an additional sliver of might to all of their works. It was believed that when a tool was infused with the same power used to create themselves; that humans were imparting life into their tool. Each item imbued with this spark of life was to be kept in the highest honor; most of which held a special place of rest within the home of their creator when their handles or tips threatened to break. A new grand hall was constructed; dedicated to the study of these radical new techniques, with an ornate glass dome that allowed a view to Net\u2019s beacon. Fate was about to take a turn at this point however; the infighting between the gods was beginning to frighten the humans below. For the humans were beginning to understand the faintest fringe of the threads of power these beings wielded, they began elaborate, deeply buried, fortresses within which they could hide if need be. And then one day; the monsters came. Zombies flooded to the beacon, able to see its light for miles around. The town was overrun in a matter of hours. Where the walls held; skeletons hailed arrows into the town beyond them. Nixos himself, becoming slow in his age; took up a blade of diamond and led the charge against this evil horde. It is said that before him; monsters would burst into flames with a single blow. Zombies were sent sailing dozens of yards with the faintest of strokes of his blade. For Nixos was armed not only with a common sword; but knowledge. To fight the undead, he brandished a blade of life. To fight the vile leaping spiders, he brandished a blade of death. He held what he could while the town evacuated to the Stronghold below; pulling concoctions from his belt that would melt the flesh of up to a dozen zombies in a single sparkling burst. It is unknown whether or not if the town\u2019s people survived; but on his dying breath, the Two rent Nixos\u2019 soul from his battered mortal body; and cast him to the heavens. It stands as a testament to one man\u2019s greatness, that the Gods themselves reached out to save one of the most outstanding creations. To this day he stands vigilant among the stars; offering wisdom and guidance to any who seek it, and are willing to learn. And now; it is your turn. It was Nixos\u2019 belief that all of mankind has the potential for greatness, for we were granted a spark of knowledge that net\u2019s other creations were spared. If you are willing to listen, perhaps you can hear his call; and follow the path of Nixos.Path Description  ((Please note, the following challenges are meant to be achieved in a multi-player environment.

She protects from the outside dangers of the world, and crusades against Net's creations. A Fara worshiper will have lots of claimed territory to keep safe, and grand monasteries and temples to make up for the previously reported \"death\" of their god.Path of the Crusader Level 1 - Knight Brother  1. Those who wish to join the Crusade against Net's forces must first find a village to sponsor them. Find a village with a church in an acceptable biome, and build a monastery nearby (a good distance away). 2. Defend the village, of course; it is recommended to wall it in and light it up if you can. This is not a priority yet, however. 3. Create a shrine to Fara near your monastery.Level 2 - Drapier  1. Beautify your monastery; create a brewery, stained glass, and generally have it proclaim: Fara is back, ready to protect all that is beautiful. While you are doing this, itset up watchtowers around your territory. 2. Prepare an expedition; upgrade your monastery with a barracks, and prepare for a major expedition to an area that requires reclaiming. 3. Find a desert village. Create maps on the way during this expedition, and you are only allowed to rest in villages. It must be at least 64 chunks away. 4. Create a small outpost castle there by the village; both monastery and barracks. This village should be fully walled in. Mark any villages you find along the way to the distant village.Level 3 - Seneschal  1. Expand your villages with a major wall (at least 5 blocks wide), and create a grand road from your initial village to the desert village. Furthermore, any villages you have found along the way between the two villages are to also gain monasteries, walls, and roads connecting them. Name them all, as well. 2. Now that you have set up borders, it is time to crusade. Find a way to a woodland mansion, kill all those within, and destroy it. Create a grand cathedral on the foundation of the destroyed mansion. From here on out, you are to wall any villages you find, forming a massive boundary between society and the wild.Level 4 - Grand Master  As a grand master, you have only one place left to truly crusade: to follow Fara across the boundary between the worlds. 1. Purify a Stronghold by destroying it and building a cathedral on top of it, with the end portal in the basement. Take the Dragon's egg as a relic. 2. Similarly, convert a Nether fortress into a cathedral as well.Howlith Lore  When Terrea and Roki banished Net, they soon realised that they needed to replace him; if they didn't, animals would perish, having no reason to live. So, Roki took one of his remaining fingers and sliced off a bit from the first knuckle down. Terrea then cut off a lock of her hair and wrapped it around the finger, then tossed it into a forest, where it took root and grew into a God, with the head of a wolf and a shaggy mane. He thanked Roki for his sacrifice and thus pledged to live in his warm embrace, as well as thanking Terrea for her warmth and thus pledged to watch over her sacred land. He was eternally loyal, and thus lived in caves and watched over the animals. He kept nature in balance. The time came to re-balance; the sheep population grew too large and began stealing food from the pigs and cows. He chopped off his nose, one of his fingers, an ear, and some of his hair and created a wolf, eternally loyal to those who feed it and will hunt down sheep to keep them from spreading too far. One day, as Howlith traversed over the land, he saw a strange four-legged being, tall as he was, but green and whitish colored. He decided to attack it with his sword. The resulting explosion killed half of his pack, scaring the rest of the pack as well as all their descendants to never anger a creeper.Path Description Level 1 - Preparations for the Pack Level 2 - Form the pack Level 3 - Purify Level 4 - Overwhelming pack Fructum General  Toximit created Fructum, but was jealous that he had became friends with the other gods.

The MKGG 21:04, February 6, 2012 (UTC)KalebtbaconNadir Nadir - God of the Plains  Nadir is the furious demon of the wide wastelands in which no trees grow.Story  Angry because his parents, Terrae and Roki, cared more about the humans than about him he wanted to destroy them. Nadir started to dry out the land, turning green forests into deserts, rivers into dry canyons and swamps into poisoned realms of mushrooms. As food became rare, many people starved to death or were killed by each other, but some few endured the rage of the god and managed to survive even in the deadliest deserts. When Nadir noticed them, they earned his respect and he stopped his destruction. Henceforward, Nadir has an eye on those who are able to survive even the greatest dangers and leads those who are traveling through the most dangerous landscapes. With the upcoming 1.9-Update and the feature of animal breeding i thought of another god. While the followers of Nadir are barely limited in terms of Food or Weapons, they are limited by other restrictions and their inventory. Materials: Sand, Sandstone, Wood, Wool, Cactus Colours: Brown, White Foods: Whatever drops from Sheep, Cows and Pigs Biomes: Plains, Desert Armour: Leather Weapon: Bow, Sword (no Tools better than iron), Wolves and Cactus barricades Shrine: This Cactuscraft or Bonecraft might be useful. If you really can't handle the space of your inventory, i recommend Mo's Creatures which provides you a pack horse. Level 1: Abandoned Mineshaft: Leave your mine, stop mining. Never go underground again. A couple of steps into a cave are allowed tho. If you find ores or coal at the surface, you may collect it. You are allowed to carve cobblestone for your tools from the side of mountains. Welcome to the Herd: To become a nomad you have to gather a herd for your living. Find 5 Cows, Sheep or Pigs and keep them. You always must have a herd of at least 5 animals. During night, surround them with fences and defend them against wolves and other enemies. If every single one of your animals dies, you are lost. Delete the world and start a new one. You should also gather some Wheat, seeds and some Blocks of Dirt before you proceed on your path. Grow Restless: Give up your home and move into flat landscapes. From now on you are not allowed to have a firm home or base. At least every other day you have to delete your shelter for the night, the torches and the fences for your animals. Move on and wander to another place. Everything you cant carry has to be left behind (not in a chest, just throw it on the ground); your inventory is now everything you will ever possess. Level 2: Breed: Every human has to eat and that's what your herd is for. Start breeding your animals to get food. Since you're not allowed to settle down and grow wheat, you need to hunt during the night and use bonemeal to insta-grow your seeds into weed. Don't eat the rotten flesh of zombies tho. Oasis: find an Oasis with water and some trees. If you really don't find one, you can make one on your own. This is your only source of Wood now. You are not allowed to visit the Oasis more frequently than every third day. Shrines: whenever you find a remarkable spot or a landmark (stuff like a stone-pillar in the middle of the desert), build a shrine for Nadir. Whenever you visit the shrine, sacrifice a piece of meat on it (no rotten Zombie meat). Level 3: Sanctuary: In the very middle of the desert, far away from every source of water, you should build a temple for Nadir. Use Sandstone and Sand, some Cobblestone is fine too. Try to let it look Egyptian. In this sanctuary you may put a single chest and your allowed to store stuff in it. For the Sanctuary applies a similar restriction like for the Oasis: Don't visit it more than once a week.Mithros Mithros, Spirit of Miners and Metalsmiths Level One: Welcome to the Machine Level Two: Metallurgical Practitioner Level Three: Mechaniker  Ultimate efficiency: Build at least one cobblestone factory near your house. You must now use it/these for all cobblestone-gathering purposes. Bonus points if you made them automatic factories by using pistons. Dabbling Trappist: Build at least 3 TNT landmines and 3 lava pitfalls near/around your house. If you accidentally kill yourself on one, you are officially a disgrace to Mithros. You must leave the faith, travel at least 50 chunks away, and begin a different faith. Forgekeeper: Expand your forge room to double the number of furnaces. You now have to keep at least one running at all times. No slacking off!: You may not eat anything during the day, when there is work to be done.Lever Four: Chief Artificer  Engineer: Build a railway to the the nearest mountain. Architect: Build a 4-building mining town (one building if in SSP) at the end of the railway. Take that, Roki!: Hollow out the mountain, completely (TNT mining is allowed). Dwarf Fortress: Put in floors, windows, drawbridges over lava moats and obsidian piston gates. The Mountain is your new home. Mechgineer: Replace your minecart tracks with a piston-powered monorail. Bonus points if you make it redstone-powered instead of using a bunch of levers and/or buttons. Moving out: Tear down your house, and take everything with you back to your fortress. Set up shop in the main hall, rebuild your cobblestone factory(s) and build another shrine.Level Five: Chosen of Mithros  Trans-Dwarf!: You must now begin mining. Mithros doesn't car how you do it, so long as the ONLY entrance to the mine is in your fortress, and you bring back at least 30 ores/gems/dusts per trip. This is inadequate!: Make yourself some diamond tools. What does this do?: Mine 14 obsidian and make a Nether Portal. Setting up shop: Build an outpost in the Nether, with a double-chest and a redstone-powered dispenser array or TNT cannons to ward off any Ghasts without having to do more than press a button or pull a lever. An interesting block, this is!: Mine out a crap-load of glowstone. Replace all the lighting in all of your homes with Glowstone.Level Six: One with the Machine!  Incereratorium: Build a 2x2 or larger lava disposal put somewhere in your fortress. Sacrifice for the greater good!: make one diamond, one gold, one lapis and one iron block. Dump them along with 9 redstone and 9 coal into the incinerator. Foreman: Build a mechanical mole using pistons and redstone, and use it to mine out at least 4 chunks. Modern it is!: Replace as much of the inside of your home as you can with iron blocks, and throw a huge party (at night, of course. Daytime is work-time!) Yessir!: You are now one with the Machine. You have at least a PhD in redstone wiring, can make any follower of Roki envious of your mining skills, and could likely take over the world if you felt like it. Retirement: You may now do whatever during the day, you have passed the six sacred tests of Mithros, and are worthy. May your days be longer than the next guy's and your hardships dealt with like a boss.The Story Creation  In the time before, there were three siblings: Roki, Terrae, and Net. They were bored with all that they had in their own dimension, so pooling together their powers they decided to create a world to entertain them. Roki acted first, cutting off his finger and using it to build the bedrock core of the world. Then cutting off the rest of his arm, he layered the world in smoothstone. Gathering his remaining energy, he struck the world as hard as he could with his right arm. The force of the blow created massive amounts of pressure causing diamonds, gold, iron and coal to form at different layers of the world. The resulting earthquakes created great chasms and cave openings leading deep into the earth. Terrae, looking upon Roki's work said, \"It's a good start, but it\u2019s hard and cold. This world needs beauty and softness as well.\" And with that, she reached down and picked up chunks of smoothstone and ate them. Chewing and melding them with her delicate tongue, she turned the stone to dirt and spat it back up, covering the world. Then she ran her hand over it and layered the dirt with grass short and tall. With great care, she pushed four of her fingers into the earth. Removing each of them one by one; from the holes... the first oak, birch, pine and spruce trees were born. She then cut her arm, and bled out onto the world creating the oceans. Net, the youngest of the three, was impressed with what the other siblings had done. But he had not yet fully realised his powers and became sad. He shed a tear and it fell onto the world the siblings had created, from the tear a tiny retarded chicken was born. Net was overwhelmed with joy at his creation, even though it had zero survival instincts and would aimlessly wander off cliffs as often as anything else, he still loved it. Over the years as Net further realised his power, he created pigs, sheeps, cows, wolves and squids. The other gods were proud of him and having watched him develop, decided to teach him how to focus his power. With this, Net was able to create the first human. Note: All of the above images are an artists interpretation of the gods, and not their true images. The humans of the world prospered, and adored their creators. Terrae and Roki took shifts to watch the world, Terrae's eye was bright like fire and caused all her creations to prosper as she watched them. Roki's eye was white and cold, signalling the time for the humans to rest. Many ages past as the world prospered, Roki and Terrae were finally content and continued to watch over it. Net however, became bored and restless again. Using his power, he created the first slime for his amusement. While mostly harmless, the slime had the power to hurt the other beings of the world. When Roki and Terrae looked upon it, they were upset and banished it to only live in the very depths of the world, away from the humans. This infuriated Net and he demanded his siblings allow his creation room on the surface. The two refused, and having seen his siblings make sacrifices to enhance their powers, he did the same. He cut off his ear and used it to create the first zombie. Terrae and Roki were unable to banish this creature and it quickly began to decimate the humans that the pair loved so much. Seeing the progress of this monster made him want to create more, so he pulled a bone from his arm to create skeletons and eight of his toes to create the spiders. Terrae, seeing Net's growing insanity, cut out an eye and used it to curse his monsters with fire whenever she looked upon them. Roki and Terrae then turned to Net, furious with him and pooled their powers together to banish him to a world of suffering and pain; The Nether. In his last defiant act before his banishment, Net tore his heart out and created the mighty creeper. This creature will stalk the land, immune to the powers of Terrae's eye, and would be a great calamity on the world. The humans of the world were wiped out, their structures now overrun with creatures and slowly growing moss. Terrea and Roki turned to one another, and using all the energy they had left, they summoned one final human. Spent, the two gods are now only able to take turns passing their eyes across the world, keeping close watch on their last creation, Steve....The Story Thus Far  You, are Steve. Unknown to you, you are a creation of the Gods, Terrae and Roki. The world appears to you as a blank slate for you to explore, rearrange, and recreate with. As you explore you find that the world is in a state of unrest, as monsters begin to appear everywhere when the sun sets, trying to kill you, and the other peaceful human inhabitants in the nearby villiages are being actively exterminated. The very fabric that holds the world together seems to be rippling with turmoil, as you come to learn more and more about the world around you. It is then, feeling a vibration in the air, that you finally come to understand that the Gods of Creation are engaging in a secret cold war behind the scenes of the realms, preparing for a war for the Overworld. Spirits... Demons... Gods? What have you gotten yourself into, Steve? The Spirits are out there, the Demons are always whispering, and all the Gods need to hear is a prayer. Pick a side, or choose to remain neutral, where you go from here is all up to you.The Second Coming The Great Shift  Rumours are abound of an event called The Great Shift. When Net will tear the very barrier between the Nether and the Surface world to unleash his anger once more. He will spread fire and lava across the world and bathe the followers of his siblings in pain. The followers of Roki will be buried in gravel in the depths of the earth, and the followers of Terrae's will be beaten to death by trees that Net himself will rend from the ground. Net's followers will be given the ashen groves and the empty halls of their previous owners and tasked with turning them into monuments of the Great Shift. The first sign of Net's return will be the appearance of the Endermen. Beings that are said to be drawn to shifts in reality, cursed with the insanity to constantly re-arrange the environment around them. Looking at an Enderman causes it great distress, as doing so traps the creature in your reality and solidifies its physical existence. These creates are not entirely substantial, and exist in multiple realities at once. This gives them the ability to break certain rules in any one reality. They have been known to warp great distances in the blink of an eye but only display this ability when angered.Simoeis Simoeis - Spirit of Building and Construction (Warning: this path is extremely time-consuming and will take a hell of a lot of effort to complete legitimately) Lore:  Many ancient legends tell that shortly after the dawn of Humanity, we had nearly become extinct. We spent our nights cowering in caves and under ledges, praying that the angry mobs gathering outside would not find us. Even when the mobs were nowhere to be found, we were still at the mercy of the weather; caves offered little protection against floods or the extreme cold of a blizzard. As our numbers dwindled, all seemed lost.Then, one cold night, a group of humans huddled together for warmth under a cliff ledge saw a strange figure emerge from the center of the unforgiving snowstorm draining the warmth from their bodies. At first, they thought it to be a hallucination brought on by the cold; but as the figure drew nearer the humans saw that it was no illusion. The ghostly figure, vaguely feminine in appearance, drew closer to them. The spirit spoke, telling them its name: Simoeis.Simoeis told the humans that she had been watching their suffering, and decided to intervene on their behalf to keep them from dying off. She taught the humans construction (the idea of building something being foreign to them), starting with basic mud huts. Once they had learned what they needed to survive, Simoeis left the humans, floating away toward the sky. The humans thanked her by worshipping her as a goddess in appreciation. However, as time went on, and the humans built larger and more impressive structures, they gradually forgot about their mysterious savior, and few today even believe she exists, let alone worship her.--Level 1 - Apprentice Architect--  1. Feels Like Home...: Find a cave filled with resources, then build a house nearby. The house must be at least two stories, and have a lower basement level as well. Attached to or close by should be a renewable source of food (e.g. an animal farm or melon/wheat farm), as this will be your main base of operations throughout the path. Inside the house should be a bed, crafting table, furnaces,storage chests, an endless water spring and a 2x2x2 lava pit garbage disposal. Once the house is constructed, build a shrine to Simoeis on the roof to get her attention. Other additions, such as a swimming pool or garden are not required, but are encouraged. If you think of something cool to add to your house, do it! The same applies to any other structure you build on this path; Simoeis smiles on creativity in architecture, and frowns on those who just follow the instructions in a boring manner. 2. Power supply: Collect at least two stacks of redstone dust, an invaluable resource to have in architectural pursuits. 3. All the time in the world: Craft a clock. Put it in your hot bar, equip it, take note of the time...and promptly toss it into your lave pit. Construction is something that cannot be rushed, and you should put in as much time and effort as is needed for quality structures. Rushing is a foreign concept to followers of Simoeis. Once you have completed this ritual, you are officially a follower of Simoeis. Upon completion of this ritual, you are no longer allowed to craft, use or possess a clock for the remainder of the path.--Level 2 - Skilled Architect--  1. High on Life: Build a floating fortress, the foundation of which floating no lower than y = 90. The fortress has no size requirement and can be made from any material(s), but should be entirely self-sufficient should the surface ever prove too dangerous to live on. This means it must include: bed, chests, furnaces, water/lava springs, animal AND wheat/melon farms, a tree farm and a cobblestone generator (in case you need to make repairs to the fortress without having to go back down to the surface. Once the construction on the fortress is complete, it is not to be connected to the surface or other landforms in any way (including ladders). Instead, have a waterfall flowing off the edge of it (as the game engine allows you to \"swim\" up waterfalls). 2. Land Down Under: Build a fortress underground, the highest ceiling of which being no higher than y = 25. As with the flying fortress, it can be made of any material and can be as large or small as you wish, but must be entirely self-sufficient. The list of requirements necessary for this fortress is the same as the one above, with the exception of the cobblestone generator. In its place you must have a mineshaft built connected to your fortress to get building materials from. The entrance to your underground fortress must be sealed off from the surface to conceal it. 3. Humility: At this point, you're probably full of yourself. You've made some amazing structures, inspiring awe from onlookers and curses from your rivals. However, in the grand scheme of things, you really aren't that special. Many have walked this path before you, only to fail due to their overconfidence. To teach yourself some humility, store all of your possessions, save for one sword, two torches and one food item of your choice (excluding cake), and travel out into the wilderness (but make sure you know how to get back!). For two in-game days, you must survive using nothing but these bare essentials. You may not collect any other items during these two days, and once you put either of the torches down, you may not take them down and reuse them. At dawn of the third day, return home remembering how hard life was when you first started the path. Humbled, you are now a skilled architect of Simoeis.--Level 3 - Expert Architect--  1. Honor Thy Mother: By now, others have noticed your marvelous designs, and questioned what inspired you to create them. When you explained your faith to them, some showed interest in the worship of Simoeis. Problem is, they have nowhere to gather in fellowship and worship her. Create a temple in honor of Simoeis. The style of the temple is up to you; Greco-Roman, Gothic cathedral, it doesn't matter. The only requirements are that the foundation must be at least 30 x 20 blocks wide/long, and you must place a second shrine somewhere inside. Pews, sculptures, columns etc. are optional, but preferred. Again, be creative! 2. Ninth Wonder of the World: Create ONE of the following 3 super-structures:--Level 4 - Master Architect--  1. Babel Rises: The time has come to complete your masterwork. The structure that everyone will remember you by; the building that will outlive the language it was originally described in; the Tower of Simoeis. The tower must stretch all the way from bedrock to the highest block you are able to build at. At minimum, the foundation of this tower must be 60 x 60 blocks wide. At the top of the tower you must place an upgraded version of Simoeis' shrine. Instead of a gold block surounded on all sides by a block of iron, this shrine is to be a block of gold surrounded on all sides by two blocks of iron.  Aside from these guidelines, the design of the tower is entirely up to you. Make it straight up, have different towers branch off the main spire, build it from bedrock up through the surface of the ocean, whatever you think works. Now more than ever should you be as creative as possible; after all, this is what future generations will remember you by. 2. Impregnable: Now that the tower is complete, it needs to be defended from enemies. First, create a wall around the entirety of the foundation, leaving only space for a pair of iron double doors for you to get in and out of. This wall must be at least 15 blocks high, and can be made from smoothstone, brick, nether brick, obsidian or any combination of the four. Next, create a moat on the outside of the wall and fill it with lava Finally, create a redstone drawbridge to allow yourself to get over the lava moat. If you can think of any other ideas for traps, such as sand/gravel avalanches or arrow-filled dispensers, include them; Simoeis would not be pleased with you if harm were to come to her tower.--Level 5 - Architect of Legend--  You have successfully created the Tower of Simoeis; a reminder to man and god alike to never forget the impact that construction and architecture has on our world. Simoeis is very pleased with you, and has bestowed upon you her blessing. [install toomanyitems] Whenever you require any amount of any material to complete a project, you now possess the power to materialize it in front of you with little more than a thought. What better gift could an architect ask for? Now you have little more to do than continue your work, creating awe-inspiring structures and spreading the word of Simoeis.", "Chadtronic Wikia": "Chadtronic Wikia ", "Drawception Wiki": "Drawception Wiki ", "ROBLOX Island Royale Wiki": "ROBLOX Island Royale Wiki ", "Darwin Project Wiki": "Darwin Project Wiki ", "Ryse: Son of Rome Wiki": "Ryse: Son of Rome Wiki ", "Wiki Test": "Wiki Test ", "ROBLOX Jailbreak Wiki": "ROBLOX Jailbreak Wiki ", "Unofficial Roblox Jailbreak Wiki": "Unofficial Roblox Jailbreak Wiki ", "Roblox Jailbreak Wiki": "Roblox Jailbreak Wiki ", "Slither.io Wikia": "Slither.io Wikia ", "Island royale Wiki": "Island royale Wiki ", "Giovanni's Malware Wiki": "Giovanni's Malware Wiki ", "SuperSmashBrosColosseum Wiki": "SuperSmashBrosColosseum Wiki ", "Pokemon Essentials Wiki": "Pokemon Essentials Wiki ", "BOBBY JOE Wiki": "BOBBY JOE Wiki ", "State of Decay 2 Wiki": "State of Decay 2 Wiki ", "State of Decay (2018 Novel) Wiki": "State of Decay (2018 Novel) Wiki ", "The Evil Within Wiki": "The Evil Within Wiki ", "Tarshin Wiki": "Tarshin Wiki ", "CoryxKenshin Wiki": "CoryxKenshin Wiki ", "Tythin Wikia": "Tythin Wikia ", "Roblox Confederation of the Rhine Wiki": "Roblox Confederation of the Rhine Wiki ", "ChaosWithin Wiki": "ChaosWithin Wiki ", "BBB: Project Smashin' Wiki": "BBB: Project Smashin' Wiki ", "Demon Within Wiki": "Demon Within Wiki ", "Hades' Star Wiki": "Hades' Star Wiki ", "FNATI Shades Wiki": "FNATI Shades Wiki ", "Bophadese-Games Wiki": "Bophadese-Games Wiki ", "Sleuth: Shades of Mystery Wiki": "Sleuth: Shades of Mystery Wiki ", "Nightshades of Taure Ru Wiki": "Nightshades of Taure Ru Wiki ", "Green Hell Wiki": "Green Hell Wiki ", "The Virtual Family Kingdom Wiki": "The Virtual Family Kingdom Wiki Virtual Family Kingdom Wiki  Welcome to the Virtual Family Kingdom Wiki!This is a fan-made work-in-progress wiki containing in-game content of the game Virtual Family Kingdom (VFK)!

It features live and beautiful scenery to depict the times of certain periods in time. The Western Age is a very dry desert scene with many cacti to revive the old western feel. Each land features rooms and various settings which would be common in the era. To navigate yourself through these lands, you can use the special VFK map. Just walk on the name of the place you wish to go to, and you are instantly transported there. The maps are constantly being updated to add more lands/rooms.Areas/Ages/Lands Glitches And Bugs  Like many games, VFK has had a variety of glitches and bugs throughout its time online.Stuck On A Wall  This glitch has been resolved.What Happens  At the Medieval Gate House, your character will get stuck to the left wall for what seems to be because someone is already standing right next to the wall, and the game tries to make someone also stand there.How To Fix  Move rooms via friend list, home button, or exit the game and restart if needed.The Clone Army  This glitch has been resolved.What Happens  You can end up with frozen clones of yourself in your house. Pretty cool, huh? This is a man-made glitch. You have to want this to get it. Each time you are loading, VFK is creating a new instance of you for a new room. If you combine this idea and the home button bug, you can get as many as you want. Once you use it on a certain room however, that instance is now stuck in the room you choose to put your clones in (in other words, you can't move aka invisible once you enter the room). Also, remember that you only get one chance at it, since the loading page for each room only happens the first time you enter it. Right now, what you can do is use friends and the popular list to get a whole bunch of loading screens for a load of clones. The clone record currently with proof is 43, and without proof there was someone who claimed they had 53.How To Fix  This is a man-made glitch, but if you just want all those clones gone, just restart the game.Size Malfunction  This glitch has been resolved.What Happens  Your character retains a different height from a different room. You can look shorter or taller than the others. If you go to any room, change any article of clothing or hair, and press the home button, you will retain the same size. Fairy Dazzle Enchantment makes an effect like this.How To Fix  Restarting the game will fix this glitch.Audubon's Jeep Outside Game  This glitch has been resolved.What Happens  The car from Audubon's Outdoor Adventure game appears outside the mini-game in place of your character. If you get a message saying that your connection isn't established in the middle of the game, click connect. Or when you start the game, before you get in the car, click the home button and teleport home!How To Fix  You have to wait until the energy of the car runs out. You will get teleported back to game lobby when it does. Or, you can press the EXIT button and you will also be teleported. Refreshing also gets rid of it.Everlasting Magic  This glitch has been resolved.What Happens  Magic is in use until you log off or cast another magic spell. Start a magic of your choice. Open your Closet and leave it alone until magic ends. Then, the closet will close by itself. Open the closet again and change your hair. The magic should now be on again. You may change hair and clothes without the magic going away.How To Fix  Cast another magic spell to stop the one you chose or log off and back on again.Automatic Furniture Sorter  This glitch has been resolved.What Happens  When you place a lot of furniture without moving, it will pile up. When you come back, it's automatically sortedHow To Fix  Remove the items from your room. For some reason, when you log back on, the furniture's colors appear darker.Teleporter Animation What Happens  A person gets on a teleporter, but doesn't teleport. Then they have the animation from it until fixed. OR ORHow To Fix  Do any kind of magic or restart the game. You must use Merlin's Magma-Porter or the Black Hole Teleporter to do this effect.Fireworks Instructions Typer What Happens  You can type what you want on the fireworks instruction sheet but you cant save it and no one else can see it.

Character design by Tenhiro Naoto. PC version released on July 27th, 2005 by Gainax. PS2 version released on September 1st, 2005, distributed by Cyberfront in Japan, and PS2 Collector's Edition released on the same date, distributed by Jinx in Japan. PS2 version released on December 2nd, 2005 in Korea and distributed by Gainax KO. PC version released in China, released by Gamebridge Beijing. Subsequently released as a part of Best Hit Selection by Jinx on March 14th, 2007. The Chinese localization made several changes to the game, one of which is the exclusion of the Best Friend/Girl endings in which your daughter presumably falls in love with one of the three possible friends in the game. Originally, the daughter in the game was a girl named Karen, who is now in the Princess Maker Questionnare game.Mechanical Information  Minimum Requirements CPU: Pentium III 733MHZ\n OS: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP\n RAM: 128MB\n Space: 950MB Hard Drive space\n Disc Drive: CD-ROM or DVD-ROM\n Display: VRAM 8MB / 640x480 Resolution / 16 Bit\n Controls: Keyboard, MouseGame Plot  The story takes place in a setting similar to Princess Maker 2, a fictitious location that resembles western Europe. The time might be later than Princess Maker 2 as the city looks a little closer to those from the Renaissance than those from the Middle Ages. The game is heavily dependent on events, the plot aspect of these events will be detailed later.Features  Princess Maker 4 is still very similar in terms of features to the other games. There is more choice in the control of her diet, and in fact a little less statistics to go around. The option of choosing to talk to the player's daughter still exists with the added benefit of her talking without the player having to mention a subject to talk about. The game has become very heavily event based, with many of the endings dependent on completing several events. This makes it difficult for those who don't know the language to play, but adds a visual novel aspect to the game that wasn't there before. There are only 32 endings available for this game, with some endings containing two CGs.Characters  Patricia Halliwell Cube IsabelleFriends  Note: In game, when you first meet up with the three main girls, whoever you meet first is who you're most like, then the one you're like second will be met second, and the same applies for the third. Christina O'Hara Northerly Marie Stollman Lise Torvalds Karen A little child magician met if your daughter has enough Magic as a child. She is quiet and speaks in fragments (ex. \"Magic.. you like it?\"). If met enough, she will show your daughter your friends she is always talking to: faeries! She has a different appearance in the old and new versions of the game. Karen appears to enjoy monsters, as she is seen riding a dragon in one of the events.Love Interests  Charles/Sharul Lee Baroa Chris the millionare A millionare who believes that there is nothing that can't be bought by money. He will become interested in your daughter if she works at the market enough.Castle People  Gatekeeper\nMagistrate\nEarl\nBishop\nMinister\nQueen\nKingOthers  DaratanFestival Rivals  Karin Matthew\n Mageurite Mina Hamilton\n SerenaDemon Realm Castle Schedule  The schedule is one of the primary aspects of this game. At the beginning of every month except September, the player is given three choices for the three parts of the month. Classes, Work or Rest. Work and classes are still the same, carried over from the first game. Rest is split up into five parts. Free time, Go out, Vacation, Supervised Free time and Recuperation when she is sick. Choosing free time will allow the daughter to choose what she wants to do on her time of rest. If given an allowance, her stress will decrease faster. Go out will take the player to the town map, where the choice of visiting three locations is offered. At these locations, the player may trigger events, learn about the people or buy items. At the end of the three turns, the daughter rests up and continues onto next month. The locations include shops and places within the city, the castle, and the possible choice of going to the Demon Realm under specific conditions. Vacation has changed in that the player is able to speak to the daughter while on vacation. Each of the different vacations throughout her eight years will offer up a different scenario. The player is then given three choices of possible things to do. These choices will often affect her statistics, increase or decrease her stress or trigger an event. At the end of the choice, she rests and one or two statistics increase as per the season. Supervision is for when the daughter is belligerent and requires Cube to follow her and watch her during her free time while Recuperation is for her to recover at home or at a sanatorium from sickness.Festivals, Holidays and Events New Year's Celebration  The New Year's Celebration is referred to as \"Founding Day\" in the game, to celebrate the birth of the kingdom. The castle opens to all citizens on this day. On the daughter's 18th birthday, she can join in on the Founding Day Dance Party, where she might just meet the prince.Harvest Festival  Every September is dedicated to a whole month's celebration over the year's harvest. The main events are three contests held at the castle. Winning one of these contests will gain the player's daughter some money, reputation and a special item. If so wished, the player can opt out of the celebration and just rest at home. The format of these three contests are basically ported from Princess Maker 2, except the cooking contest has been omitted.Martial Arts Contest  The format of this contest is very similar to that in Princess Maker 2. There are only eight participants each year, and each participant is matched up in elimination. Magic and Physical combat are both allowed.Dance Contest  The Dance Contest is also very similar to the one in Princess Maker 2. Several contestants dance over court judges who mark up the scores by Constitution, Artistry and Charisma. Being well known at the castle helps out a lot during this contest.Art Contest  Also named the Celebration of the Arts. If the player's daughter takes lessons at the art teacher's, she will be given a chance to paint randomly; this painting will cost 100G to make. When she does, she becomes eligible to enter in this art contest.Christmas  The Christmas celebration is usually held in the home with family, the player, the daughter and Cube gather to celebrate. However, if the daughter has made new friends or even found herself a boyfriend, she will most likely leave the player and Cube alone to spend Christmas with them.Birthday  Needless to say, the player is given a choice to buy a present for the daughter on her birthday. In return, if the player is in her good graces, she will also buy gifts for the player on his birthday. The daughter will also visit each of her friends on each of their birthdays with a gift, make sure there is enough money left to go around during these months.Events  The game contains over a hundred events, all of which are unique and will occur only when certain conditions are met. Some are without CG, only a conversation between the daughter and whomever she is speaking to. Many are with CG and even choices for the father to decide what to do on these events. Besides the time based and statistic based events, several will depend on her going to different places and talking to different people. She will need to meet certain statistics or even preliminary events to be able to access these, and only in the right locations. Some are chained with one another and some are just a one time deal. Several of these events will affect her work, and her classes, or even unlock places where she couldn't go before. They also have a profound influence over the ending of the game, so key events are not to be missed!Classes  Class List Theory\nCombat\nMagic\nProtocol\nArt\nDance There are only six classes in this game. The player starts out with Theory, Combat, Magic and Art, and discover Dance class through a mini-event involving Christina (Meet Christina at the dress shop, then go to the upper street, the fountain, then the lower street to meet the dance instructor and you're now able to go to Dance class). Protocol is activated after your first visit to the Castle. Each class has four levels, Novice, Adept, Master and Instructor. The expenses increase from Novice to Master, and the status effects are also different. The fourth one is a pseudo-level that is activated after a mini-event at the classes involving the teachers of the course. The player is compensated as an instructor.Jobs  Jobs Summary Chart Housework Daycare Farm Church Restaurant Maid Lumberjack Inn Market Bar Tutor Maid Bar Sleazy Bar Casino Some of these jobs come with age, but because the game is highly event-based, some of these will have to be sought out. Usually they're easy to find. The Maid job will be recommended to you by the Protocol Teacher, the Maid Bar will be recommended to you by one of the town girls (brown pigtails, orange ribbons), and the Sleazy jobs will be from the Alleyways. Each job features several levels of compensation, and will increase as the player's daughter's statistics increase. When a job is finished without mistake, there is also a chance of a bonus.Items Dresses  Click on the name of the dress to see photoes of your daughter in the dress.Special Dresses  There are three special dresses in the game; one availabe from Baroa, another from Lee and another from Daratan for 4,000 gold.Locations  Town MapEndings  When the daughter reaches 18 in the 8th year of the game (March 31st), the game will reach its end. In the Japanese PC version of the game a few more endings were included. There are four involving the friends/rivals that your daughter meets; Lise, Christina, Marie and Karen as well as a few extras. Besides the personal ending regarding the player's daughter, actions throughout the game will be taken into consideration for an epilogue concerning the war between Humans and Demons. Each of these epilogue endings come with a picture, although the picture is not saved in the Album.

For example, there is a glitch that causes the game to consistantly crash in some circumstances on December 17th when someone tries to invite your daughter to a Christmas party. Such issues can be fixed via patches that have been released on the official Japanese website for Princess Maker 5. The FAQ section of the official Japanese Website (which can be translated into English using services such as Google Translate) contains said patches.Game  The game has gained more depth in how the player manages both their own resources and those of their daughter's. Several changes in game play has been made while previous features have been improved to offer more choice for the player.Setting  The change in setting is significant in this game because up until now, all Princess Maker games in the core series have taken place in a fantasy world with European flare. Princess Maker 5 takes place in the modern world, two fictitious areas named Himemiya Machi (\u59eb\u5bae\u753a), which is more like a suburb, and Hamasaki Shi (\u6ff1\u5d0e\u5e02), which is more like downtown. It is assumed that these two areas are located somewhere in Japan. Due to the modern setting, many possibilities have opened in terms of what your daughter can and cannot do. For example, she now goes to public school and it is mandatory. The possibility to become a female parent has been opened as well (but your daughter's marriage with her parent is only possible when playing as a father)Plot  In the parallel worlds that exist alongside modern Japan, there is unrest in the Human Kingdom, the Realm of Heaven, the Realm of Demons, the Faerie World and the Realm of the Spirits of the Stars. In a show of good faith and an attempt to keep peace and balance in the world, the Human Kingdom decided to crown a princess and eventually a wise Queen who will help pacify each realm. But mysteriously, the candidate for the position of Princess were assassinated one by one. Thus, Cube, a butler and keeper of one of such candidates spirited her away from this world, and erased all memory of her murdered family and torched home so that she might escape the fate of the more unfortunate princesses. The player is a retired hero from the Human Kingdom, now self-exiled into a foreign world to escape the past. However, when Cube chooses the player as the parent of this girl, the player simply cannot refuse. The conditions are that after eight years, only the girl herself can decide whether she wants to pursue happiness in this world or, if she ever finds out about her past, return to the parallel worlds to claim her throne.Features  A lot of new features have been added to Princess Maker 5. The player's daughter is more realistic than ever with changing interests depending on what she is currently doing at work or at school, and will interact with the environment of her room differently because of her hobbies. Certain small events triggered will prompt you to help her choose a course of action, which will eventually change her disposition to those around her. She can also fatten, grow taller and show bust size more significantly than before. Events based on these physical stats as well as her hobbies will appear once certain conditions are reached. She will also be able to grow cavities depending on the kind of items the player feeds her. There are more items than ever to increase stats and decrease stress, but she should watch what she eats in case her weight or cavities get out of hand. Statistics have been changed as well to fit a more modern lifestyle.  The room has also become more interactive. The player's daughter will put up different posters at the head of her bed to indicate her current hobbies. The decorations on the windowsill will change depending on the time of the year. Items and furniture will be added when the player buys them for his/her daughter. And best of all, a cute little avatar of the player's daughter will be wandering around the room doing the things she loves. A system to determine the parent's profession has been put in place as well, but that is only secondary to the fact that the player can now choose to be either a father or a mother. The system to allow the child more or less freedom is also more in depth than before. The parent can choose from a total of six different topics to talk to his/her daughter about, and the effects will vary depending on multiple statistics and conditions. A different schedule system running on a weekly schedule has replaced the monthly schedule from previous games. There is a new way of getting rid of the child's stress, as the old rest and vacation system has been pushed the back burner by a free roaming system. The parent will have to take their kids out on the town and try to get rid of her stress with gifts, visits to the amusement parks, restaurants and sites around the city. If the player is up for it (and provided that this function has been unlocked), he/she can release their child to several parallel worlds to adventure. The adventure system is less intensive than the one in Princess Maker 2, but the battling system is the finest in all of the Princess Maker games so far. Some features of the older games have been taken out of this game. Festivals where contests are held no longer occur in those formats. They are replaced by individual competitions that stem from the classes or school, but there is no real prize money involved. The extra money, though, can come from various events where the player's child might be invited to help out certain characters on special days. Some of these will be triggered automatically while others depend on statistics and events.Game Mechanics Parent's Profession  Besides being able to choose whether to be a mother or a father at the beginning of the game, the player also has the choice of choosing and naming their profession. The player is given the choice of five types of social standings in terms of their profession: Educated Professional, Entrepreneur, Government, Salary man and Freelance. Each profession comes with a level of credibility, which will equal out to how much money the player can borrow before consequences. After picking one's social standings, the player can then name their profession. The chosen profession modifies the initial hidden stats of the child.Birthday and Starting Statistics  To Provide an example on how your profession will affect your child's initial Statistics: If you give your daughter the Star Sign Capricorn. Her initial Pride score is -5. If you select your job as an \"Educated Professional\". Your daughter will be given an additional 20 points in her pride which will make her pride overall 15.00 in the beginning of the game.Monthly Plan  Monthly Plan (PM5)Emily's News  A new little quarterly published by a friend of the player's daughter. It includes a headline with news that the player would probably love to know, and dates on sales, events, concerts and much more. The player can set dates with his/her daughter to go to some of these events through the news page.Status  The status of the child is broken down into five sections, three of which (Ability, Personality and Statistics) are number based, one of which is level based (Skills) and the last of which is the profile of the daughter.Ability  Represents the ability of the child. Lowest value is 0, highest value is 999. Constitution (\u4f53\u529b) Spirit (\u7cbe\u795e\u529b) Athletic Ability (\u904b\u52d5\u80fd\u529b) Intelligence (\u77e5\u529b) Charisma (\u30ab\u30ea\u30b9\u30de) Refinement (\u6c17\u54c1) Charm (\u9b45\u529b) Stress\uff08\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9)Personality, Condition and Puberty  Measured using a scale. Shows the personality attributes of the child. Lowest value is at -100, and the highest value is at +100. The closer it is to either extreme means that the personality is more slanted towards that side of the scale. Love (\u611b\u60c5) - increased by giving daughter twice a month/weekly allowances or watching romance movies, talking to Hiroko or Mori, taking music class, working as a babysitter/tutor\n{C}Morals (\u9053\u5fb3\u5fc3) - Increased by cleaning the beach, talking to Aya, giving her an early curfew, above 30 is required for Gateau to confess his love to your daughter in the Spirit World. It can be decreased by giving your daughter a late curfew, killing monsters when she goes to adventures and talking to Kousei.\n{C}Sensitivity (\u7e4a\u7d30\u3055) - increased by setting one of her monthly Etiquette plans to \"Be polite all the time\" or \"Be polite to elders first\", high Sensitivity (+40-60) enables the daughter to see a mermaid after working in the job the souveneir man offers, a cherry blossom youkai during the cherry festival in the mountains, a ghost during the \"Conquer Your Fear/Guts test\" day and Santa Claus while helping to make cakes. The mermaid increases music skill, the cherry youkai gives you a crystal (+10 refinement and grants access to fairy realm) the ghost tremendously increases your respective highest skill (+50) along with giving you an orb (+10 willpower and grants access to spirit realm) and santa Claus gives you a random item. These are not the only personality attributes available, some are simply hidden: Independence (hidden) - increased by setting Attitude in the monthly plan to \"Press your own opinion\", talking to Leona and Kousei. it is best to keep this stat low if you want to make the choices for your daughter, such as dates, meetings, marriage proposals, friendship events, scout events, birthday presents for friends, etc Flexibility (hidden) - increased by weekly allowances and having daughter be polite all the time - Needs at least +10 to trigger Emily's soulmate event. Sociability (hidden) - increased by letting your daughter have a longer curfew and by setting her study plans to either studying in moderation or prioritise playing. - Unknown effect on gameplay. Logic (hidden) - Unknown effect on gameplay. Pride (hidden) - increases if daughter does really well at an activity (gold star), decreases if she does poorly (red circle); causes her to continuosly buy things without permission (?) - Unknown effect on gameplay. Creativity (hidden) - Increases if your daughter takes on art classes. (Needs confirmation what decreases creativity as it is possible to still have 0 creativity after taking art classes) - Unknown effect on gameplay. All these stats can be seen through the fortune teller. For more information on how these personality traits affect your daughter please go here: Personality, Condition and PubertySkills  The higher the skill, the easier it is for the daughter to successfully accomplish the related task, be it work or school. There are 100 skill points for each level, once the skill points reach 100 for a given level, she advances to the next. Once the level is reached, the skill cannot decrease.

Butler is the player's butler in Princess Maker 2, 4 and  5. He is of a demon race (Olive has mentioned him to be of a magic race, though). In the Princess of Darkness ending of PM2, Lucifon mentions that he is a young nobleman of the Underworld. He also makes an appearance as Yucie's steward in Petite Princess Yucie and in Go Go Princess .Cube in Princess Maker 2  Cube first appears in PM2. According to the manual, he was sent to work for the hero by Lucifon as a token of respect for having beaten him during the demon invasion, plus as a way to take care of Cube himself after he was wounded and crippled in the war against humans. Cube lets the Father know when it is too cold to vacation in the mountains, when the Daughter needs to dress for summer or winter, when she is becoming rebellious or her health is about to falter. He can also look after her when she is sick. When Olive goes adventuring, Cube can bring her equipment while she's camped, and he automatically rescues her if she is defeated. He also plays a role in several endings. If Cube nurses her and rescues her quite a lot...Cube Marriage Ending  Olive has a hidden statistic in PM2: Relationship with Cube. This is raised every time Cube rescues her (2 points), brings her equipment (2 points), consoles her after losing the first round of the Combat Tournament(5 points), catches her stealing (5 points) or nurses her back to health when she falls sick (1 point per day). It is quickly raised (20 points) should he rescue her from a bandit that has assaulted her after she loses to him/her. The only way to lose it is to have Olive fall \"in love\" (6 points). If this statistic reaches 100, she has no superseding marriage ending lined up AND has some more stats well-raised enough (250+ Sensitivity and 200+ Charisma), then she will profess her love to Cube and they'll marry. The gods are not exactly happy, as Cube is a demon, but begrudgingly accept their love.Tips and Tricks  It's not very hard to get as long as you raise her relationship and get good Sensitivity and Charisma. Changing equipment a lot during adventures will raise it well, as will rescuing her from a bandit assaulting her or making him nurse her.Quotes Cube in Princess Maker 4  Cube first appears in  PM4 as a servant of Isabelle, Patricia's mother. The player sees him with her holding Patricia in an Oasis after a long expedition to find and rescue Isabelle from the Demon Realm. It's assumed that he began to live with the player and Patricia in order to take care of her and to educate the player on her demon blood.Cube Marriage Ending  One of the seven marriage endings (including those with unnamed characters) is Patricia's marriage with Cube.Cube in Princess Maker 5  In Princess Maker 5, Cube is the butler for one of the candidates to become Princess of the Human Kingdom. He escapes with her when assassins killed her parents in hopes of letting her enjoy a normal life. He can change into a dog in this game wich your daughter can walk in free time.Cube Marriage Ending  As with previous appearances, Cube is also a marriage candidate for your daughter if you have her work with him, be taken care of by Cube when she is ill, losing fights when adventuring or having Cube handle the assasination fights. Cube and your daughter will be forced to move back to Cube's original hometown in the demon realm however, as Cube is a demon.Cube In Petite Princess Yucie  Cube also appears in the  Petite Princess Yucie anime as Yucie's butler. He has the power to summon a magical aid by the name of Soraoto, in which he may buy magical items to help Yucie out with.External links Princess Maker 3  Languages Available In: Japanese, Korean, & EnglishProduction Plot  Princess Maker 3 takes place in an alternate world from Princess Maker 1 and 2, as characters from both games (main and side) make appearances throughout the game. The game begins with the Queen of the Faerie realm speaking to the father figure in this game, addressing the father figure by the profession he chooses. She explains that a certain faerie wishes to become a human princess, and has pleaded with her to come to the human world. She then bestows the girl on the hero, making it his job to raise her to adulthood. To help with the task, a faerie housekeeper by the name of Uzu is assigned to the hero, and thus the journey begins.Gameplay  The game is fairly similar to the first to except for a few major aspects. First, there is no 'adventure' mode. In Princess Maker and Princess Maker 2, your daughter could 'explore' and the game would become very similar to an RPG. This is not the case anymore. Second, this game introduces the Moods Mechanic, as explained below.Moods  Moods are a specific new mechanic that has been added to the game. Depending on your daughter's stats, she may enter one of these moods. Each mood affects the way each of the jobs and classes affects her stats. Some even stop her from doing certain jobs altogether. There are seven: Normal, Sassy, Rebellious, Proud, Pretty, Poor, and Sick.Normal  This mood is generally optimal. With the exception of a few circumstances, this mood is generally the best to have. When your daughter is in this mood, she can work any job and will, generally, apply herself.Sassy  This mood is among the worst. When in this mood, attending any class will reduce her Attitude stat. It also makes her slower to learn in some classes. Though she is still capable of working any job. She will also refuse to wear any of the wandering merchant's outfits, except for the Suit of Darkness. Cause: Having too high Elegance and Pride, with too low Attitude and Morality. Fortunately, this mood is fairly easy to get rid of. Buying Teddybears can increase Attitude, and is the cheapest stat-advancing item in the shop. Formula To Enter State: (Pride + Elegance) > (Attitude + Morality)X2 Formula To Exit State: (Pride + Elegance) < (Attitude + Morality)Rebellious  Also considered a bad mood. Being Rebellious prevents your daughter from performing several jobs. She will also refuse to wear most of the wandering merchant's outfits, except the Suit of Darkness. Curiously, however, she becomes a better miner and does not lose stats when sent to mine. Unable to perform jobs: Formula To Enter State: Morality < 300 AND Either Formula To Escape State: Morality > 350Pretty  A milder Mood. This mood will prevent your daughter from working in the mines but, otherwise, has very few adverse effects. Also, your daughter will never begin the game in this state. It is also possible to enter the \"Poor\" state from this mood. Formula To Enter State: Charm > Morality X2 Formula To Exit State: Charm < Morality, or become poorPoor  Another milder Mood. This mood only has a few adverse effects. Having almost no money will usually result in this mood, but only if your daughter was already in a 'Pretty' or 'Normal' mood. Formula To Enter State: Be at or very near your debt limit. Formula To Exit State: Have more than 500gSick  The very worst state. While in this state, your daughter can't do anything except for lay in bed and recover from her illness. She can't work, study, or even vacation. During this time, all of her stats will drop. This mood is only desirable if you wish to reduce all of your daughter's stats. Formula To Enter State: Allow your daughter's Stress to exceed her Vitality and Stamina. Formula To Exit State: Reduce stress to 0Occupations  A new feature in this game is the added \"Occupation\" choice before playing the actual game. Players are given the choice of one of six occupations, which will determine the daughter's disposition at the beginning of the game, starting cash, the salary paid in September, and the credit given in case the player runs out of money.Characters  Lisa Uzu Father (You)Teachers  Professor Cool Bow (School) Karkland (Martial Arts) Maichano (Dance) Pepitone (Cooking) Botra (Etiquette, Diet) Sister Madina (Church) Mocha (Art) Michell (Music)Bosses  Boss Gratin (Mine) Aren (Bar) Mariah (Market) Yuri (Nursery) Rose (Maid, Tutor) Consul (Palace Maid) Ogribi (Carpentry)Rivals  Chiya (School) Ariel (Martial Arts) Chamie (Dancing) Haitaa (Cooking) Haming (Music) Akuron (Art) Natera (Etiquette)Marriage Candidates  King Prince Faery Prince of South Country Rabbit Prince Mole Prince Cat Prince Prince of Darkness Merchant Father (You)Other characters  Traveling Peddler ArnoldEndings Overview Supernatural  Queen of Fairies Angel FairyPolitical  Ruling Queen Prime Minister LordGovernment  Consular Judge Civil ServantMilitary  Hero General Knight SoldierEducated  Palace Professor Alchemist Teacher PhilosopherEntertainment  Singer Actress Bard PerformerArtistic  Writer Dancer Painter Musician ChefReligious  Archbishop Nun CultistBoss  Boss at the Mines Boss at the Farm Financier Bank ManagerExpert Job  Architect BlacksmithWork  (See \"Job\" section above)Dark  Little Devil Underworld Boss TheifSocial Endings  Concubine MistressMarriage Endings  King Prince Faery Prince of South Country Rabbit Prince Mole Prince Cat Prince Prince of Darkness Merchant YouPrincess Maker 1  Languages Available In: Japanese, Chinese, Korean, English (partial fan translation and Refine only), Spanish (partial fan translation)Production Production History  Created in 1991 by Gainax. Feb 18, 2017 - Refine Version released on Steam by CFK.Mechanical Information Basic Gameplay  Like its successors, Princess Maker 1 is a mostly menu-based game. After entering a name and birth date for the daughter, the player is taken to the main screen (pictured above) where most of the decisions are made. The daughter starts at 10 years old and the game ends when she turns 18. The main buttons in this screen let you travel to the palace, talk to your daughter, check her stats, go shopping, change settings and the most important, schedule her activities. At the scheduling screen the player must choose three tasks for the month, each taking approximately 10 days, and can choose between education, work, vacationing, resting in the town and adventuring. Going to school is expensive, but raises her stats, some of which are otherwise impossible to develop. By doing exams, she can earn titles and go up in ranks, which will make schooling more expensive and more effective. Working also changes her stats, raising some and lowering others depending on the selected job, and earns you money. Vacationing and resting in town are the main way for lowering stress that is accumulated by classes and work, but cost money. Lastly, the adventure mode is an RPG-like mini game in which your daughter explores and faces off monsters to win experience and treasure. Your daughter does not work or go to school at Sundays. The player always starts with 500G.Plot  You play as a hero, who defeated a demonic army besieging the kingdom depicted in this game. However, you soon retire, being tired of seeing death and destruction everywhere, and decide to adopt a orphan girl who shows up one day at your house. How she turns out to be is upto you.Characters Castle Folk Conversation  Every month, you can have a conversation with your daughter. Depending on what you do and on some of your stats, it will have different effects! Be careful, some are interesting, and other need to be avoided. You won't always earn the same amount of stat, it can be +1 or it can be +10, it's all luck! So I advise you to save before talking to your daughter, especially in the first years.

The screenshots shown here are from the Chinese release of this edition. In Feb 18, 2017, CFK released Princess Maker 1 Refine on Steam.External References Olive  \"Olive Oyl\" (\u30aa\u30ea\u30fc\u30d6\u6cb9) is the default name for the daughter in Princess Maker 2.Bio  Olive descends from heaven as a 9-year old girl, floating in an orb of light. She has a  patron deity who instructs you to take care of her. Though a gift from heaven, she is a seemingly normal human. However, if properly trained, she can become extremely talented with almost inhuman speed. For example, she can paint a scene with multiple angelic figures by age ten if instructed. If trained, she can win any of the four yearly tournaments, even at a very early age (10-17). These are: Painting, Fighting, Cooking and Dancing. Notably, the fighting tournament puts her up against a famous pirate, and two veteran fighting instructors. Her biological parents' identities are unknown, although she will occasionally express a sad curiosity about her in your chats. The game itself starts with Olive at age ten, and continues until she reaches 18 at which point she leaves home, gets a job, and sometimes marries.Default Statistics Personal Statistics General Combat Social Skills Housework Skills Reputations Trivia  Olive Oyl is clearly a reference to the character of the same name in Popeye.Dragons (PM2)  To read about the enemy dragons, go here: Dragon (PM2). Olive meets the dragons in the Western Desert.Young Dragon  The Young Dragon is 1 year younger than Olive and guards the entrance to the Dragon Ruins - the inner most part of the Ancient Ruins. He will demand a 200 G toll every time Olive tries to visit the inner area, though he will turn her away if she does not have enough money. If Olive does have the money, she can choose to pay the toll, turn back, or challenge the dragon to a fight. If Olive wins the fight, she will never have to pay the toll again. Defeating the dragon in combat results in Olive gaining 200 G and a Healing Pill. This also opens the possibility of making the Young Dragon a love interest for Olive. Making him flee opens up the area without granting the above mentioned awards.Quotes Old Dragon  Getting past the Young Dragon, you can find the Old Dragon. He resides in the center of the Ancient Ruins within the stone chamber. Too old to pick fights, the Old Dragon is retired. He has no time to deal with children, so if Olive is under 15, the Old Dragon will tell her that the Desert is too dangerous for children, then send her on her way. After she turns 15, he will take an interest in her. A bit of an old lecher, the Old Dragon likes pretty young ladies full of Charisma. He will gift her pocket money equal to her Charisma. If she has low Charisma he will suggest she work on that. If Olive's Charisma is over 100, he will give her the Dragon Tights if she heeds his request and approaches him. If Olive has taken the Buxomize Pill or has a particularly large bust before receiving the tights, the Old Dragon will mention having known her father (You). On subsequent visits, he will also nickname her \"Bosom Girl\".  QuotesMarriage Proposal  If Olive defeats the Young Dragon, and meets the Old Dragon twice, they will visit at the end of the month if no other events occur. Otherwise they will visit on the end of any following month where no other events occur. Apparently the Old Dragon is the Youth's grandpa and wishes to play matchmaker. They will offer 10,000G in exchange for her hand in marriage. If you accept, Olive will marry the Young Dragon when she is 18 but her Morals go down in the meantime. After her 18th birthday, the Dragon will come to collect the marriage promise but, as he thinks Olive is not thrilled with the idea of marrying him, he tries to break it off. This fires her up, and she angrily asks him if he really loves her and if he wants to marry her no matter what. When he says that he does, she formally accepts his proposal and either says that she will pamper him like a child (beta) or asks him to get stronger and take care of her (Refine). If you decline, Olive's Refinement will go up and there will be no penalties other than the marriage not taking place. The Dragon Youth will be sad and embarrassed but won't insist, telling Olive that he wishes her luck. It is possible not to marry the Youth even if you agreed though, by marrying any other special marriage candidate. The Dragon Youth will cry and say \"That marriage was a lie. I will never trust women.\" If the marriage takes place, the Gods will be surprised and some may be a little unhappy, but will ultimately tell you that love will trascend anything and give the newlyweds their blessings. The ending adds nothing to the score itself.External links Lucifon (PM2)  Lucifon is the Prince of darkness. Olive meets him in the Western Desert. He led the army against the kingdom years ago, and retreated after his defeat at the hands of the hero.In the Western Desert  If Olive camps in the place marked \"Demon Abode\", then upon waking she will meet Lucifon. He will offer her a drink. If her faith is 20 and up, she will automatically refuse it. He will then offer her some power \"in deference to [her] spunk.\" If you accept his offer he will raise one of the following attributes of your choice: The stat increase can be anywhere from 1-45 points. However, Olive will lose some faith in exchange (anywhere from 1-10 points). Her sin will also increase by 25 points. Nothing will happen if you refuse his offer. If Olive's faith is below 20, she'll automatically cave in and drink the liquor which will increase sin by around 80 points. This is quite useful if you are aiming for one of the dark endings (i.e. Princess of Darkness), plus it's a requirement to have him as Olive's lover.Marriage Ending  It is possible to get a marriage ending involving Lucifon. If everything works out, one night he appears under Olive's window, tells her that he always knew she'd grow into a beautiful woman and gives her a love declaration. Olive is rather thrilled by the idea of marrying someone as rich and powerful as Lucifon, and to dissipate any doubts he points out that she cannot be happy either on Earth or Heaven any longer due to her Sin; this persuades her to run away with him and become his Dark Bride. She leaves without saying goodbye to her father or Cube, and is never seen again in the kingdom afterwards. To get this, Olive must have 300+ Charisma, 200+ Refinement and Sin more than double her Morality. She must also have drunk Lucifon's liquor atleast once. It is considered to be an incredibly bad marriage, and the gods will blame your sins for having let that happen.Tips and Tricks  This is surprisingly involved for an ending so bad. You need to reduce Olive's Faith to below 20 to make her accept Lucifon's drink. One convenient way is using his gifts a lot to get it low. Focus on raising her Charisma and Refinement after that, and keep raising Sin by killing monsters or accepting more drinks. If you want to avoid Sinful endings you could raise Morality to 30 and prevent Sin from reaching 500.External links Patron Gods  Olive is assigned a patron deity based on what month you set her birthday in. This patron god or goddess will watch your progress with Olive throughout her life and take part in activities involving you and her, such as saving your game, judging your actions at the game's ending, and granting Olive a stat boost when she climbs the ladder to Heaven after defeating the War God. Most importantly, each patron deity rules over one or more astrological signs that affect Olive's initial statistics and reputations. None of the signs grant any Stress, Sin, or Combat Defense.Summary Chart Combat Skills:  Note: Strength affects the value of Combat Attack after the first month is over. So these are not necessarily the effective combat attack numbers.Saturn  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: December 22 - January 19 (Capricorn) Stats Granted\u00a0: Refinement +100 Initial Stats: General SkillsUranus  Dates Governed\u00a0: January 20 - February 18 (Aquarius) Stats Granted\u00a0: Sensitivity +100 Initial Stats\u00a0:Neptune  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: February 19 - March 20 (Pisces) Stats Granted\u00a0: Intelligence +100 Initial Stats:Mars  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: March 21 - April 19 (Aries) Stats Granted\u00a0: Morality +100 Initial Stats:Venus  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: April 20 - May 20 (Taurus), September 23 - October 23 (Libra)Taurus  Stats Granted\u00a0: Charisma +100 Initial Stats\u00a0:Libra  Stats Granted\u00a0: Charisma +100Mercury  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: May 21 - June 21 (Gemini), August 23 - September 22 (Virgo) Quote when saving: \"In the name of Mercury, a record shall be made for ______'s daughter ______.\"Gemini  Stats Granted\u00a0: Intelligence +100 Initial Stats:Virgo  Stats Granted: Intelligence +100Moon  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: June 22 - July 22 (Cancer) Stats Granted\u00a0: Sensitivity +100 Initial Stats:Sol  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: July 23 - August 22 (Leo) Stats Granted\u00a0: Refinement +100 Initial Stats:Hades  (PC) Months Governed\u00a0: October 24 - November 22 (Scorpio) Stats Granted\u00a0: Sensitivity +100 Initial Stats\u00a0:Jupiter  Months Governed\u00a0: November 23 - December 21 (Sagittarius) Stats Granted\u00a0: Faith +100 Initial Stats:Strategies External links Demon Dress (PM2)  The Demon Dress is one of the dresses available for Olive in Princess Maker 2. A very hard to obtain dress that makes the wearer look more beautiful at the cost of their morals.Information Other Info How to Obtain  Head to the Western Desert. Demons will sometimes carry a Demon Dress that you can confiscate upon defeating them. The Demon Dress is worth 3000 G.Strategy Tips  Its rarity falls not only on chance of it actually being carried by a demon but also due the fact that demons are hard to kill. Demons are incredibly tough to kill because they have a very low morale to HP ratio. They have exactly 50 morale to 260+ HP.\u00a0 Because of this, they will almost always manage to escape from battle before you can kill them. You will have this problem even after maxing out the natural growth for your combat attack/magical attack. For example, even at 169 strength and 124 combat attack Olive was only doing about 67-74 damage per hit. One way of getting around this is to keep a healthy supply of grenades on hand. Since grenades do not reduce enemy morale you can basically frag the demon to death (or at least until the demon has less than 50 HP at which time you can deal the finishing blow yourself without having to worry about the demon escaping). The problem with using this method is that you can only carry so many grenades (not to mention the cost). Alternatively, if your magical attack is 180+ (all of Fay's bonuses + demon pendant trade-ins + trading combat skills with the tree elf) you can effectively 2-3 shot the demon 7 out of 9 times, giving you a much better chance of obtaining this dress. There are several difficulties that lie with this alternative method however:Trivia Petite Princess Yucie  Petite Princess Yucie is an anime based on the Princess Maker series of games.Characters  Yuushi - Main character, her appearance is similar to Lisa of Princess Maker 3. She is 17 but has not grown since she was 10. She is a Platina Princess Candidate. Grenda - Princess of Hell, she is also a Platina Princess Candidate and 17 (but trapped in a much younger body). She is very embarrassed by her father, but has a lot of self confidence otherwise (always describing herself as the fantastic and elegant princess of Hell) Kokuru - Princess of the Spirit realm, she is bespectacled and very shy (and often not noticed). She, too, is a Platina Princess Candidate, and 17 but trapped in a younger body. Erumina - Princess of Heaven, Platina Princess Candidate, 17 and trapped in the body of a younger girl. She is a perfectionist, not least because her father has excessively high standards. Beth - Princess of the Fairy Realm, Platina Princess Candidate, 17 and trapped in the body of a younger girl. Beth is determined to become the Platina Princess and will go to extreme lengths to ensure she is the winning candidate. Cube - Yuushi's magical butler, our favourite demon! Ket ShiDragon Tights (PM2)  The Dragons Tights are one of the clothing pieces available for Olive in Princess Maker 2. According to the Old Dragon they're \"popular with dirty-minded fellows\" and accentuate a woman's charm.Information Other Info How to Obtain  Head to the Western Desert. First, Olive must enter the Ancient Ruins and pass the Dragon guarding them by either defeating him or paying a toll he demands. In the center of the Ancient Ruins rests an old Dragon. If Olive is younger than 15 he will send her away, and if she's 15 or older and but has less than 100 Charisma/Glamour he will suggest she works on that. If she's 15 or older and has over 100 Charisma/Glamour, the Old Dragon will ask her to approach. If she agrees he will give her a kiss (lick). In apology to his teasing he will gift her with the Dragon Tights. The tights are worth 1200 G.Trivia Patricia Bio  This Bio is taken from the canonical ending of the game which involves the reunion of her family. Patricia Halliwell is the daughter of Isabelle, a fellow warrior whom Sir Halliwell (the protagonist) had met during the earlier years of the war betwen the demons and humans. During the 10 years of separation, Patricia appeared in front of Sir Halilwell along with cube to be raised by him and thus their life together begins. Throughout the first two years of their time spent together, there was little in discovery to her past. Living a seemingly modest life together attending classes as well as earning tuition money. It seems like it was unlikely Patricia will ever hear of her mother again. However discovery of a painting of her mother as well as bullying from boys of her being a possible makai led to her questioning her past. However it was at the third year she starts discovering her fractured past. By travelling to the dark alley for the first time she will begin the journey to discover her past... One day while at home from work or rest, she saw her doll talk, Cube tells her of how she has demon blood within her, if her demon blood is too great. The population will notice and she will not be able to live in town once she grows up. This fear becomes realised when she first meets Balrog, a man from the demon world. Despite hostile reaction by her friends she trusts him and follows him there to the demon world where her demon blood can be awakened from traveling there. Patricia then receives more clues after getting close to Prince Charles who take over the maritime company and sets up trade routes between the worlds and also humans and demon able to cross freely which was in reality a bid to allow an invasion route to the demon world. However Patricia had more concerning issues at hand which was now finding her mother. This was aid when Balrog reveals this to Patricia: he is the Demon King's son. With the help of Lee and Balrog to piece together clues as well as preventing a possible war. Patricia finally know the possible location of her mother whom she confronts at the age of eighteen... On her 18th birthday and if her trust with father is high enough, she is given the revelation that she is not her biological daughter, despite that she stills regards Sir Halliwell as the father who raised her for 8 years by himself. Patricia meets her mother for the first time in eight years and wanted to know why she was left to be taken care of by her father when she tells her the reason. Shortly meeting Patricia's father, Isabelle went to confront the demon king herself, despite striking a heavy blow and possibly ending the war. She was critically wounded and fell unconcious for 3 days and 3 nights. During that time she has received a heavy transfer of demon blood and that the magic crystal within the human realm prevents her from returning. She wanted to see her first love again but couldn't and wanting Patricia to live a happy life as a human girl decides to hand her over to her best friend to tend to. The fact that the demon king was her blood father did not help any at all. Realizing that, Patricia seeks to end this fight between the demon kin and humans and reunites her family at last. At the end of the game she has several potential choices of marraige. Either she engages in a potentially incestial relationship with Sir Halliwell, a marriage with Lee, Baroa, or Prince Charles. Or choose to live a happy life together with one of her friends.Stats  Patricia's stats are seen as strongly compressed to more general based stats for her. She has Constitution, Intelligence, Charm, Pride, Morality, Refinement, sensitivity, Temperament, Reputation, Martial and Magical Strength as well as Sin and Fatigue as negative Traits. Patricia's choices of employment has been a bit toned down to a friendlier level as she is unable to take a employment as a carabet dancer thus impossible for her to receive a role as a prostitute or an assassin. However in place of that, she now can work at a maid cafe and casino as replacement sinful jobs.Trivia Queen Ending (PM2) Description  A coach from the castle comes to the house to pick up Olive, much to her surprise. When she arrives at the castle, the King tells her that he has grown too old for his position and must retire. Since the Prince has very little experience, the King decides to hand the throne over to Olive. The Prime Minister is not supportive, but the Queen has faith in Olive. And so it is decided that she is now the ruling queen.Ranking  Amazing, That's not an easy thing to doStats Required  Refinement: 800 One of these stats should be 420:\nFighter Reputation\nMagical Reputation\nSocial Reputation\nHousework Reputation Sin must be below 500 Art must NOT be the highest stat The gap between highest and lowest reputation should be below 50Other Information  This is one of the hardest endings to get\n The better your daughter's Morals, the better queen she will be. To be a magnificently good queen, her morality should be more than 500. Be sure not to have Art as your highest stat or else you will get an art ending. You can have cooking as your highest stat, but not art. Her sin must be BELOW 500 or she becomes... another queen. The picture is a homage to Jean Ingres' painting Napoleon I on his Imperian Throne . It's also possible to get this ending and marry the prince of the kingdom\u00a0if the Daughter qualifies for both.External Links Royal Concubine Ending (PM2)  Olive joins the Royal Harem.Script  A coach arrives and takes Olive to the castle. The King welcomes her and comments on how beautiful she has become as an adult, and how all the men in the kingdom have fallen in love with her... including the King. He says he couldn't handle Olive becoming another man's, and with the Queen's passing he wishes Olive would stay until his final days. With the help of the Royal Concubine, they convince Olive to join the Royal Harem.Ranking  Adds +170 points to the final score.Stats Required  Alternatively, the Reputation stats could be the following:Determining Stats Available Marriages  NoneEpilogues  Determined by Refinement/Elegance.Other Information External Links Buxomize Pill (PM2)  The Buxomize Pill is a magic pill that increases bust size.How to Obtain  It can be purchased from the Traveling Salesman. He first appears when you have a total of 1000 G or more and there are no other events occurring at the end of the month.\u00a0 It costs 1200G.Notes  While the Buxomize Pill costs quite a bit of money, it has no meaningful in game effects beyond raising bust size. While Olive may sometimes complain about her bust being too small, buying and using this does nothing to make her happy or have any effect beyond a cosmetic change and some flavour dialogue.Trivia Princess Ending (PM2) Type  Marriage EndingDescription  Olive remains single despite all the marriage proposal she gets. Cube ands the Father try to pry answers out of her, but she says she's in love with a man whose name she doesn't know. Said man truns out to be the \"Young Officer\" that she met every January in the castle, and who actually was the Prince of the Land under a fake identity. The Prince proposes to Olive and she immediately accepts; the crowds approve of their marriage and the celebrations last for at least 10 days.Ranking  Excellent! The best marriage there is for Olive.Stats Required  Refinement (elegance in the refine version): 250+ Charisma (glamour in the refine version): 200+ Morality (morals in the refine version): 30+ Sin (Karma in the refine version): Less than 100Other Information  Olive must visit the \"Young Officer\" at the palace every January without missing a single year, unless she has a birthday on January 31st.Tips And Tricks  It is important to make sure Olive does not miss a single year of talking to the Young Officer - and she must promise to meet with him again the next year. A good way to remember to meet with the Young Officer is to set Olive's birthday to the 31st of January - to serve as a reminder to meet with him that day. This also gives you an extra month to either recover lost relationship points, or to talk to someone else. It is also important to raise Olive's Charisma and Refinement during the 8 years of caring for her. Charisma needs to be atleast 200 and Refinement needs to be atleast 250. Her Sin should be less than 100, so remember to reduce her Sin before the game ends. You shouldn't risk Olive falling \"in love\", since each time it occurs her relationship with the Prince, the father and Cube all drop by 6%.She needs her relationship to be atleast 90% to marry the Prince, but in most games it can only be raised upto 96% since she gets only 8 meetings, each of which raise her relationship by 12%. Note that you can get this with the Queen Ending, where Olive herself is appointed as the future Queen of the Realm. As long as Olive meets the requirements for both of them she will become the new heir to the throne AND marry her predecessor, killing two birds with one stone.External links Princess Maker 5 Characters Making Connections  So, your daughter has been rushing about doing all manner of things; school, clubs, exploring the town, and so much more! And yet, she is oddly alone. She may occasionally run into a person in the classroom or on the way home from school, but the friendships don't seem to be deepening the way she (or you) would like. So what's going on? The first thing to know is that your daughter will only form friendships with some people, and she will different levels of friendship with all of them. There are many ways to increase the level of affection between your daughter and these special people. Agreeing to walk home with someone, agreeing to help a person out when they are in trouble, responding correctly to a question, being in a club or class with someone, giving favored birthday presents, all will help your daughter's relationships deepen. However, one of the best ways to make friends is to have your daughter visit the person. But how does one do this? Well, on Sundays your daughter has the option of going out into town. While she is exploring the various locations, she may run across a potential friend. By talking with the person, the two will grow closer. Unfortunately, these friends travel all over town, making it a challenge to pin down where they are at any given time. However, these friends have very predictable schedules once you've found them, and they can be found in the same place each Sunday so long as they are in the same school; in other words, a person in elementary school can always be found in the same place at the same time, but this location may change when they graduate and move on to middle school. So, who are these friends, and where are they? You will probably notice that some of the time/location combinations have a pink background behind them. This is because visiting a person at this time and place takes longer than normal; there is a detailed explaination of what this means at Timing Your Visits.Friends Emily Imagawa  Emily is one of the first friends your daughter makes. Emily is a reporter for the school paper and talking to her increases your Eloquence skill. She has wavy blonde hair and wears a white headband. Her eyes are brown. If her orb has a large shimmer or higher, your daughter will be seen walking in town with her and looking at some clothes in display, this decreases Stress. Emily also has an interest in fashion. Her voice actress is Yuki Matsuoka.Locations Birthday & Favorite Presents  Birthdate: January 22Soulmate Event  Note: the requirements for the following event are a rough estimate. If you know these requirements are correct, or are aware of more requirements, please make the appropriate changes. As this is a soulmate event, your daughter must have Emily\u2019s orb shining at the absolute brightest for this event are to occur. However, state does not necessarily need to be consistent, so do not despair if her orb\u2019s light dims; simply brighten the orb again and continue on. Also, This event can only be triggered on an arranged outing on day off via phone. In order for this event to happen, your daughter must have somewhat of a carefree attitude (low or medium responsibility.) Emily will come to your house one day and ask your daughter to go with her to play. Let your daughter go. When the skies start to turn cloudy and it looks like its about to rain, Emily will ask your daughter to stay just a little bit longer. If she agrees, Emily and your daughter will be caught in the rain and run under a pavilion, where she and Emily talk about their plans for the future, ending with Emily making your daughter promise they'll be friends forever. Later, Emily will come to your house with a thank you present for your daughter: an Osaka fan. This \"martial arts weapon\" will provide the benefits of Willpower +50, Attack +1, and Critical Chance +10 when equipped.Hiroko Sakakibara  One of the first friends your daughter makes in Princess Maker 5. She loves music and her mother is the piano teacher. Your daughter might bump into her during a concert and she can be very clingy - becoming her friend causes her to constantly ask your daughter to accompany her to the bathroom at school. Surprisingly, she's a fan of Akizuki Shinya. She has short brown hair, amber eyes, and wears glasses. Her voice actress is Asami Imai. If she has a small shimmer or higher on her orb, Hiroko will give various items to your daughter such as a houseplant, vitamins, romance novels, J-Pop CDs and cream puffs. Hanging out with her may slightly increase your daughter's affection, Music skill, sociability(?) stats.Soulmate Event  Note: the requirements for the following event are a rough estimate. If you know these requirements are correct, or are aware of more requirements, please make the appropriate changes. As this is a soulmate event, your daughter must have Hiroko\u2019s orb shining at the absolute brightest for this event are to occur. However, state does not necessarily need to be consistent, so do not despair if her orb\u2019s light dims; simply brighten the orb again and continue on.

If you know these requirements are correct, or are aware of more requirements, please make the appropriate changes.

Cool clothes can make him fall for your daughter.Levels of Affection  So now that we know where and when everyone is, we're left wondering just how close they are to our daughter. Are they just getting to know each other, or are they the best of friends? We can estimate this via things like how often they are interacting (how often does the friend call your daughter?), or we can go the more direct route: we can get Cube to tell us! When your daughter is in her room and you click on her, a list of options pops up. If you click on the last option, you will get a screen with the faces of the people your daughter knows, along with some colored orbs.  \nThis is an example of what your Orb screen may look like (click on the picture to make it larger):Friendship Orbs  The first kind of orb is the blue orb, which is the friendship orb. The levels are from lowest to highest:  Shattered (fighting, no longer friends).\nCracked (in danger of losing them as a friend)\nDull (a neutral relationship),\nA small shimmer (friends),\nA medium shimmer (closer friends),\nA friendship orb with a very large shimmer; a very close friendship!\nThe highest is the orb is completely covered by the shimmer (best friends).\n*Note: Some Soulmate Events will ONLY happen during arranged outing on days off via phone (Emily's, for example).Love Orbs  There is another kind of orb; a pink orb for the boys. The lowest level to highest:   Shattered Pink crystal (heartbroken)\n Fractured (needs attention)\nDull pink (He has a crush on your daughter)\nA small shimmer (there is a bit of affection),\nAn orb with a medium shimmer.\nLarge light (always having dates together)\nHuge light (you can accept their marriage proposal, which will cause you to marry them in the end, rejecting them will make the orb fade however).Conflict of Interests  A new feature in this game is, if you are best friends with someone, another person most likely will be jealous (ex. Being friends with Hitoshi results in Ryuunosuke or Kenichi being jealous, dating/being friends with Kenichi results in Michiru getting jealous, being friends/dating with Ryuunosuke results in a jealous Miho). This doesn't mean you can't still be friends with both parties, but it will take more effort.It matters what you wear!  Certain characters like or dislike clothes, and this can make all the difference. If you are wearing clothes that a boy likes, there is a much higher chance he will develop a crush on you. (ex. Kousei likes cool/sexy clothes, Kenichi likes lolita clothes). If you're trying to boost your relationship with that special someone quickly, dressing the part will speed things up.Storyline Characters Assiette Genoise  A French foreigner in your daughter's school, she appears after Emily mentions the haunted house.

After your daughter defeats Sabayon, Assiette fully heals but becomes hostile to your daughter, believing that she and her other classmates looked down on Assiette during the time she used a wheelchair and cane. After this, she becomes \"better\" than your daughter at everything and will constantly be on top of her class during exams. She also knows Aspar and might marry him, making it impossible for your daughter to become a princess or a true princess. In reality, Assiette is a doll created by the Heaven Lord to succeed in everything and marry Aspar. She along with Alfort are the final bosses.Alfort  Assiette's butler and the final boss.Daughter (PM5)  The daughter of Princess Maker 5, her default name is Musume, which means daughter in Japanese.Bio  In a land torn apart by war, she is the last of the princess canidates- her parents have already been murdered by Gateau.

You choose wether to prepare her for her princess duties or to let her be a regular girl, ignorant of her past.Personality, Condition and Puberty  Personality Personality attributes are measured using a scale. The lowest value is at -100, and the highest value is at +100. The closer it is to either extreme means that the personality is more slanted towards that side of the scale. Love (\u611b\u60c5) - increased by giving daughter twice a month/weekly allowances or watching romance movies, talking to Hiroko or Mori, taking music class, working as a babysitter/tutor. Morals (\u9053\u5fb3\u5fc3) - Increased by cleaning the beach, talking to Aya, giving her an early curfew, above 30 is required for Gateau to confess his love to your daughter in the Spirit World. It can be decreased by giving your daughter a late curfew, killing monsters when she goes to adventures and talking to Kousei. Sensitivity (\u7e4a\u7d30\u3055) - increased by setting one of her monthly Etiquette plans to \"Be polite all the time\" or \"Be polite to elders first\", high Sensitivity (+40-60) enables the daughter to see a mermaid after working in the job the souvenir man offers, a cherry blossom youkai during the cherry festival in the mountains, a ghost during the \"Conquer Your Fear/Guts test\" day and Santa Claus while helping to make cakes. The mermaid increases music skill, the cherry youkai gives you a crystal (+10 refinement and grants access to fairy realm) the ghost tremendously increases your respective highest skill (+50) along with giving you an orb (+10 willpower and grants access to spirit realm) and Santa Claus gives you a random item. These are not the only personality attributes available, some are simply hidden: Independence (hidden) - increased by setting Attitude in the monthly plan to \"Press your own opinion\", talking to Leona and Kousei. It is best to keep this stat low if you want to make the choices for your daughter, such as dates, meetings, marriage proposals, friendship events, scout events, birthday presents for friends, etc. Flexibility (hidden) - increased by weekly allowances and having daughter be polite all the time - Needs at least +10 to trigger Emily's soulmate event. Sociability (hidden) - increased by letting your daughter have a longer curfew and by setting her study plans to either studying in moderation or prioritise playing. - Unknown effect on gameplay. Logic (hidden) - Unknown effect on gameplay. Pride (hidden) - increases if daughter does really well at an activity (gold star), decreases if she does poorly (red circle); causes her to continuosly buy things without permission (?) - Unknown effect on gameplay. Creativity (hidden) - Increases if your daughter takes on art classes.

The player is given the choice of five types of social standings in terms of their profession: Educated Professional, Entrepreneur, Government, Salary man and Freelance.

Princess is a videogame/boardgame based on the Princess Maker series of games by Gainax.Princess Maker Legend of Another World Gameplay  The game is a mirror of Princess Maker 2 as far as mechanics work. Visuals and battles are different. You, as a retired hero, are asked by the Fairy King to take care of a young girl and raise her into a becoming woman. What becomes of her is all dependent on where you send her to school, work, and who she interacts with. Rather than governed by Patron Gods, your daughter's stats rely on what element her astrological sign falls on. (Earth, Fire, Air, Water)Prologue  The world is still young, people and fairies co-exist in this vision of a primeval chaos era. There is no powerful king in this world where everyday people live for themselves. One day, a bright light appeared, and in the midst of this, it was proclaimed that the king's country was brought a long time of peace.\nThis peace would not last.\nA light shook the kingdom, And in the warm hearts of the people there was a foreboding, ill feeling. In the forest of the kingdom, a young girl was discovered. She was a great beauty, with the figure of a fairy, and claimed that she had no memories of her childhood. The girl was thought to be about 10.Characters  Hero (You) Your daughter has no default name, but she is given the name Melody Blue in Go_Go_Princess. As mentioned, she is the most temperamental of all the daughters and has a high tendency to run away, even when she is completely happy. Raphael (Your Butler) - Helps you make decisions about careing for your daughter and saves her from battle is she collapses, much like Cube. Your daughter can also marry him, but unlike Cube, he will marry your daughter even if she has an unsatisfying ending, according to the gods.Battle  The biggest difference from Princess Maker 2 and PM:LAW is the battle system. The player is given a hand of cards to choose from with assigned numbers. The Cards can be Attack/Melee, Magic, HP Restore, and MP Restore. HP/MP cards prevent both sides from attacking when they are played. The amount of HP/MP restored is randomly generated. Occasionally cards appear that may prevent the enemy from playing his hand (ghost), or add strength to the player's attack (flaming sword). The flaming sword card is only effective if the player's cards are stronger than the enemy's card. The player always wants to choose a higher number than their opponent in order to strike any damage. However, because the enemy's card does not appear until after the player selects their card, it is impossible to predict which card is the best to play. The higher the number on the player's card, the better the odds of winning each round. If the number is the same for both player and enemy, niether will take damage. If the difference between the higher and lower card is only one number, it will not deal damage.Classes  You can pay gold to send your daughter to classes to help raise her stats. Unlike work, classes don't have negative effects, aside from stress, and only add points to certian traits. Science (+ Intellegence)\nPoetry (+ Sensitivity, intellect, grace, & art)\nTheology (+ Faith, intellect, &magic defense)\nMilitary Strategy (+ Intelligence & combat)\nFencing (+ Attack & combat)\nFighting (+ Combat skills & toughness)\nMagic (+ Magic technology & magic power)\nProtocol (+ Manners & grace)\nPainting (+ Art & sensitivity )\nDance (+ Fitness, Glamour, & art)Jobs  Housework\nChurch\nTailoring\nFarming\nRestaurant\nSalon\nBlacksmithing\nCabaret\nGraveyard\nTutor\nColosseum\nBarHarvest Festival  The Harvest Festival is held during the entire month of October.

The overalls were given as Mario's clothing so his arms could be seen swinging back and forth when walking. Later Miyamoto decided to change Mario's occupation to a plumber because of his overalls and showed this in the arcade game Mario Bros., and the setting being in the sewers. Before Mario Bros. Nintendo wanted to give Mario a better name then Jumpman. So they decided to name him Mario after Nintendo of America's Italian landlord Mario Segale for their similar appearances.History in Games Girlfriend, Ape and Construction Site  Mario first appeared in the arcade game Donkey Kong which becomes the second best selling arcade game of all time.

They are all based on the traditional Nintendo characters partying for no apparent reason. The gameplay of the series revolves around the characters moving on a the board of a board game and completing mini-games to reach their objectives. The games are traditionally multiplayer.Sonic the Hedgehog  Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game character and is depicted as a 15 year old blue, anthropomorphic hedgehog that can run faster than the speed of sound. He replaced Alex Kidd as Sega's mascot and was created in 1991 by Naoto Oshima. Sonic was created to rival Nintendo's mascot, Mario. He first appeared in the game of the character's name on June 23, 1991 on the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis). Ever since then he has starred in many games. He has even been in comic books and TV shows. The Sonic series of games have sold more than 50 million copies. Sonic himself is one of the most famous video game characters of all time. As of 2005 he has been inducted into the Walk of Game.Conception and Creation  Sega had wanted a new character as their mascot and a good game to sell many copies. A division known as Sega AM8 (now Sonic Team) was appointed in creating the game. Many characters designs were made in the process. The decision came down between a blue hedgehog and an armadillo. Naoto Oshima's blue spiky hedgehog was chosen and Sonic became Sega's mascot. His color was that of Sega's logo and his shoes were inspired by Michael Jackson. Sonic's name is Sonic because he runs at sonic speed, or the speed of sound.History in Games Saving South Island  Sonic first appeared in the Sonic the Hedgehog game in 1991 on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Here he was running around South Island and encountered a robot. When he destroyed the robot a small animal came out of the remains. The animal was captured and put into the robot to act as an organic battery to power the robot. Sonic then found out he had to stop Dr. Ivo Robotnik (AKA Dr. Eggman). Eggman a mad scientist is searching around South Island for seven mystical gems known as the Chaos Emeralds to take over the world. So Sonic went on an adventure to stop the evil Eggman and his robots from getting the Chaos Emeralds. The game was also remade on the 8-bit Master System and the handheld Game Gear.Ally to Help Stop the Eggman  Sonic is on vacation on Westside Island. While he is running around a two tailed fox named Miles Prower uses his tails like a helicopter rotor to fly and keep up with Sonic. Sonic likes him and lets him join him and nicknames him \"Tails\". All of a sudden the two hear an explosion. Robots are everywhere and are searching for something. They both find out that Dr. Eggman is searching for the Chaos Emeralds to power his new weapon. A large station called the Death Egg and Eggman plans to use the Chaos Emeralds to power it. Sonic and Tails rush off to stop the crazed scientist!Mighty and Ray  After the events of the destruction of the Death Egg, Dr. Eggman is furious and seeks revenge from the blue blur. He creates an island prison and captures Sonic and his two buddies, Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel. The trio manages to break out of the cell they were put in, but immediately after their escape, they get launched to the other side of the island. Sonic, along with his fellow teammates, get across the island through dangerous traps and get to Eggman's new home turf, Eggman's Tower. Before the three can get the chance to defeat the evil scientist once and for all, Eggman escapes and sets the tower to self-destruct. Sonic, Ray, and Mighty flee the tower in the ten seconds they have before the blast while Eggman escapes to get started on his next devious scheme. This is like a scam!Trivia See also Piranha Plant  A Piranha Plant is an enemy that appears in almost every Mario game starting with Super Mario Bros. They hide in pipes and come out every now and then to try and eat Mario. There are many different types of Piranha Plants that serve as enemies.

The most famous of which is Petey Piranha.Spyro the Dragon (character)  Spyro the Dragon is a video game character from the video game, Spyro the Dragon. The game ended up becoming a series when Spyro the Dragon 2: Ripto's Rage released in 1999. Spyro comes from the Dragon Realm. To learn more about him, and his adventures, please visit the Spyro wiki.Early years  Spyro was born in the Dragon Kingdom in the Dragon Realm called the Artisons. Spyro's father \"unknown\" was a great hero, and his mother \"unknown\" was one of the elders of the land. Spyro admired his parents a lot and wanted to become a great hero like his father, with the help of his friend Sparx. Everyone had heard about the legend of the purple dragon; that the purple dragon would bring happiness to the five dragon homelands or bring destruction to them.Original adventures First adventure  Spyro was a mere civilian of the Dragon Realm. One day, however, a villainous nork named Gnasty Gnorc stole the priceless gems from the wonderful and peaceful land. Spyro was the only one who could save the geams from being destroyed by Gnasty Gnorc. He went on a rather long journey to find Gnasty Gnorc. When he eventually came face to face with him, Spyro defeated Gnasty Gnorc and returned to the Dragon Realm victorious. They used the failed Gnasty Gnorc in an amusement park for the fun of the fellow dragons. The adventure is grouped in the game Spyro the Dragon.Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!  In Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!

A bunch of \"Rhynocs\" attacked Hunter once again, however, this time, instead of freezing the world for their leader, they wanted to burn it.Future adventures  Spyro is currently not known to have any adventures in the future (TBC - To be confirmed).Trivia Battlezone  Battlezone is an arcade game created by Ed Rotberg and published by Atari. It was released June 1, 1980. The game is a first person perspective vehicular combat simulator in which the player destroys enemy tanks and other targets for points. The game uses vector graphics to produce 3D wireframes of enemy tanks, UFOs, and terrain. Some cabinets included an overlay to the screen to make the lower part of the screen appear green (gameplay area), and the top part of the screen red (radar and information). Battlezone may be the first game where objects appear to hit the player's screen (when the player has been hit/killed.)Gameplay  The player controls a tank from a first person view and uses the two joysticks to move and the button on the right joystick to fire projectiles. Enemy tanks are detected by the radar at the top of the screen. The tank can move forward, reverse, and left and right. The battlefield is a landscape with a mountainous horizon and crescent moon. One enemy tank will appear at a time on the battlegrounds. The tanks usually move slowly and can be destroyed with one shot. Enemy projectiles can be avoided by dodging them or by hiding behind indestructible terrain objects (buildings?). Faster moving tanks called supertanks are harder to hit because of their speed. Though they cannot be detected by the radar, UFOs appear as moving targets to be destroyed for bonus points and will not fire back. Occasionally, a guided missile is launched in the player's direction. It may be shot down, but if not it will hit the player and result in a lost life. The player has three lives. An extra life is awarded at 15,000 points, and another at 100,000. The enemies in the game are worth different points:Development  Battlezone was developed using vector graphics similar to Asteroids. The designers of the game are Ed Rotberg (main designer), Owen Rubin who designed the exploding volcano, and Roger Hector who helped in designing the tanks and enemy graphics. One of the two versions of the cabinet had a viewing goggle periscope and along with the 3D graphics, the game is considered the first virtual reality game. Another version, called Bradley Trainer was produced as a training simulation for the US Army's M2 Bradley IFV. Ed Rotberg did not want to work on it, but was persuaded to do so after being promised he would never again have to do work for the military. It differs from Battlezone primarily in that the player only controls the gun (which can now be aimed up and down as well as left and right), and cannot move the vehicle. Other differences include machine guns and TOW missiles for armament, and helicopters as a target. It also had a new controller intended to replicate the real controls of the IFV that ended up being used in a number of subsequent Atari coin-op games.Myths  There was a persistent rumor/myth that one could actually drive to the erupting volcano in the background, up the side, into the crater and discover a castle inside. This was false, but plans to include such a feature in future versions were inspired by this myth[9]. A similar rumor insisted if one kept driving in the same direction for at least an hour without dying, one would eventually reach the mountains and see a \"tank factory\" pumping out enemy tanks. Others involved the UFO, including one in which a mothership would attack after a set number of UFOs were destroyed.Cabinets  Battlezone was housed in a standard upright arcade cabinet with a novel \"periscope\" viewfinder which the player used to view the game. The game action could also be viewed from the sides of the viewfinder for spectators to watch. A later, less common version of the cabinet removed the periscope to improve visibility to non-players and improve the ergonomics for players who could not reach the periscope. Also, hygienic concerns with the periscope, against which users pressed their faces, may have played a role in its removal[citation needed]. This modification also was welcomed by some operators, who felt that the small windows present in the \"periscoped\" version did not attract enough attention to the game when played. A smaller version of the cabinet (known as a \"cabaret cabinet\") also existed with the screen angled upwards, and no periscope. A cocktail table version was tested as a prototype but not produced; it lacked the color overlays as the display would have to flip for opposing players. The controls consisted of left and right joysticks, which could only be moved in the Y (vertical) axis, each controlling the treads on that side of the player's tank. One joystick contained a button used to fire projectiles at enemy targets.Ports and clones  Throughout the 1980s, Battlezone was ported to several personal computers and videogame consoles (usually on the Atarisoft label), including DOS, the Apple II, Atari ST, the Commodore 64, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, and the Atari XEGS. An Atari 2600 port was also released, but has colored raster graphics due to limitations and the view is behind the tank rather than inside it. A Game Boy Port was made including a port of Breakout. An Atari 5200 port was in the works, but was cancelled when Jack Tramiel took over Atari.[10] The Atari Lynx had the deluxe port Battlezone 2000 (within that version is a hidden game with filled polygons). Battlezone was also included in Microsoft Arcade and in Atari Classics Evolved for the PSP. Activision, the video game publishing giant, released a game for Microsoft Windows inspired by and named Battlezone in 1998. Aside from the name, however, the game bears little resemblance to the original arcade game. On April 16, 2008 an updated port of Battlezone was released on Xbox LIVE Arcade. The game was developed by Stainless Games and published by Atari Inc.. It features 1080i graphics, Dolby 5.1 audio and an online mode to play against 2 - 4 friends in Deathmatch and Capture the Flag modes, and incorporates Xbox LIVE Vision support.[11] This version of Battlezone was also on the PSP, as one of the 11 games included in Atari Classics Evolved. It received an ESRB: E (Everyone) rating.

It is the first Sonic the Hedgehog game starring Sega's mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog. It is the first game developed by Sonic Team. It made the Sega Genesis become popular to the world. It helped Sega be recognized by the whole world. The game even became the pack in game for the rest of the year. As 2007 it has sold 4 million copies while its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has sold 6 million copies. Sonic 1 is said to be one of the greatest video games of all time. It has now been released on the Wii's virtual console buy it or we will come to your house and punch youStory  Sonic the Hedgehog, a fast, blue, spiky hedgehog had been on South Island for a while. While walking he encounters a flying robot. He destroys the robot and finds a small animal inside the robot. The animal had been put inside the robot to act as an organic battery. Eventually Sonic finds out what is causing trouble on the island. The evil scientist Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Dr. Eggman) is searching for the six legendary Chaos Emeralds to help in his plot to take over the world. Sonic must stop the mad scientist and his robot army.Gameplay  The player controls Sonic to play the game. The unique element of the game is speed where Sonic can run fast and get speed boosts from objects like loops, springboards, and other devices. Sonic can collect the rings in the stages. His life meter depends on how many rings he has. If he has at least one ring on him and he gets hurt he loses the rings. If Sonic were to get hurt without any rings, he will lose a life. If Sonic were to collect 100 rings he will gain another life. hi mom walk -- Push left or right on the D-pad to initiate Sonic's movement in either direction. As you hold the button down, Sonic gains speed. run -- Begin walking and hold down the button to make Sonic gain speed. After a few seconds, he'll break into a run. screech -- While running, quickly press and hold the opposite direction on the D-pad to make Sonic screech to a halt. He'll skid for a short distance, based on how fast he was moving. look up -- While standing still, press up on the D-pad to make Sonic gaze to the sky. As you hold up, the camera pans upward, giving you a view of Sonic's overhead surroundings. crouch -- While standing still, press down on the D-pad to make Sonic duck down. As you hold down, the camera pans downward, giving you a view of the stage beneath where Sonic stands. spin -- While moving, press down on the D-pad to make Sonic curl into a rolling attack. He'll remain in this position until you jump or slow down. The speed of Sonic's movement while in spin mode is based on how fast you're moving when you launch it, and also on the terrain Sonic rolls along. spin jump -- Press any button at any time to make Sonic leap into the air with a spin attack. The height of the jump is proportional to how long you hold the button down. push -- Certain blocks can be pushed by running up against them. Continue holding the D-pad against the offending cube to have Sonic push it along the ground.Items and Power Ups  Ring (\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0) -- As long as Sonic has some of these, he won't lose a life if he takes damage. Sustain a hit and all your collected Rings will scatter, giving you a brief opportunity to grab a few back before they disappear. (Note that Rings will not protect Sonic from getting smashed or falling off the screen, both of which result in instant death.) A 1up is awarded for every 100 Rings collected and each Ring is worth 100 points at the end-of-Act score tally. Item Box -- In each stage, you'll find a number of these power-up bearing monitors. Pop them open with a spin to procure one of five power-ups: Big 10 Ring - Worth 10 Rings Sai Start Marker -- These hold your place in a stage: should you lose a life, you'll start back at the last Start Marker you crossed.

(They stop dispensing points after the tenth hit.) spring -- Leap onto the broad side to catapult Sonic into the air. The yellow ones send him flying a short distance and the more powerful red ones send him farther. spikes -- Don't touch the pointy side, stupid. They're usually found in sets of three, but that's not a steadfast rule. Sometimes they're just lying out in the open, and sometimes they pop in and out of the ground (or the ceiling, or the walls). switch -- Jump on the button to cause a change in the nearby scenery, usually necessary to proceed. air bubbles -- Large, oxygen-filled bubbles periodically rise from these clusters: tag one to fill Sonic's lungs with air and prolong the time you can spend underwater. bonus points -- As you approach the bonus plate at the end of an Act, leap into the air to find invisible bonus points that are added to your score. They can be worth 100, 1000, or a sweet 10,000. bonus plate -- These signs can be found at the end of each first and second Act. Cross them to end the stage. Special Stage ring -- These giant Rings appear above bonus plates when you cross with at least 50 Rings on hand. Jump in to warp to the Special Stage.

Green Hill Zone -- Sonic's first steps into the tropics introduce the visual staples that remain trademarks of the series to this day: checkered hillsides, palmtrees, loop-de-loops, etc. Overhanging ledges crumble as you stand on them, so don't stick around unless you're looking for a quick trip down. Rotating logs are adorned with a spiral of spikes, so time your movement accordingly.Behind the Scenes  In April 1990, Sega challenged its employees to come up with a game that would demonstrate the power of their 16-bit Mega Drive console along with a character who could become the company's official mascot. An enthusiastic young staff in the AM8 R&D division began brainstorming ideas, and the final consensus was that the game should be fast and simple. The lead character needed a strong personality and a unique look, and toward this end designer Naoto Ohshima created a series of preliminary sketches ranging from bulldogs to bearded samurai. In the meanwhile, lead programmer Yuji Naka (who had previously worked with Ohshima on Phantasy Star II) constructed a high speed graphics engine with numerous layers of parallax scrolling: exactly the sort of visual tour de force Sega was looking for to separate the Mega Drive from other systems available at the time. As the game began taking shape, it became evident that a full-time lead designer was needed to coordinate the project, but none of the staffers were free to take the responsibility. World politics, however, produced a quick fix: Hirokazu Yasuhara was scheduled to move to the US and join Sega of America product manager Mark Cerny in establishing a Western-based R&D group. However, the start of the Gulf War postponed Yasuhara's scheduled departure by three months. Naka, seeing that Yasuhara was free, asked him to fill in as a temporary director until a permanent replacement could be found. The delayed traveller agreed and became quite engrossed in the project, drawing out detailed level maps on paper. In the end, Yasuhara's departure was postponed a full year and he remained with the Sonic project all the way through. Among the early concepts was that of a speedy rabbit character with the ability to pick up and throw objects using his long ears. This idea was ultimately rejected because the team felt that the extra mechanic slowed the game down. Eventually the idea of a rolling attack was formed and from this concept Ohshima narrowed the potential heroes down to an armadillo and a blue hedgehog. The hedgehog won out due to its \"spiky\" nature, but it wouldn't be until the very end of the project that a suitable name was chosen for Sega's edgy new star. (The runner-up armadillo, Mighty, was revived several years later for a starring role Sega Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic's coin-op debut. The long-eared rabbit reject, meanwhile, rose from the ashes as cult favorite Ristar the Shooting Star.) With all the energy being put into perfecting the game's look and feel, the enthusiastic staff decided that professional talent from the music industry should be tapped to compose the accompanying soundtrack. Sega approached up-and-coming Japanese pop band Dreams Come True, and successfully wooed band leader Masato Nakamura. Dreams Come True was preparing a tour to promote their third album, Wonder 3, and Sega stepped in as a sponsor for the campaign. Sonic was painted on the sides of the tour trailer and pamphlets advertising the game were handed out to concert-goers, offering a glimpse of the game even before media coverage. Despite strong enthusiasm for the project in the studio, it drew only scorn and concern from Sega's American marketing division. Sonic was conceived as a global mascot, and key players on the US side felt that the character lacked the appeal needed to achieve success in the Western market. In those days there was a large rift (almost a rivalry) between the home and overseas branches of the company, but the Japanese office had the final say, and Sonic was released without changes. Despite Sega of America's predictions, the game became an instant hit in the US, catapulting the company from an also-ran in Nintendo's shadow to the market leader. (Ironically, Sonic achieved only modest success in Japan, a trend which continues to this day.)Jade  Jade is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. She first appeared as a secret, unplayable character in Mortal Kombat II, and first became playable in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.About Jade  Jade is a childhood friend of Princess Kitana. While her motives were unclear, she served Shao Kahn alongside Kitana and Mileena as his personal assassin. When Kitana finally turned against Shao Kahn, Jade was ordered to capture her for the Emperor. She ultimately chose to join her friend and has since loyally assisted Kitana in her quest to free their native realm and restore its beauty. Now residing in the freed Edenia, Jade is a General of the Edenian Army and continues to dutifully serve Kitana and her mother Sindel. As a female assassin adorned in a green skin-tight outfit, Jade was initially very similar in appearance to Kitana and Mileena, the only noticeable difference being her darker skin. She appeared first as a hidden, unplayable character in Mortal Kombat II whose moveset were mostly like Kitana's including the use of the fan blade weapon. To reach Jade, the player would fight a one-player game on the match just before the \"?\" on the map of the mountain. If the player won at least one round of the match using only the Low Kick button (no punches, High, or Block button presses), they would immediately be warped to Goro's Lair to fight Jade. The player did not have to win the match -- only one round -- to fight Jade. Jade would later become a regular character in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Her main weapon of choice is a metal staff, but she also uses razor-edged boomerangs (dubbed \"razorangs\") as well.Storyline  It is assumed Jade was the back-up plan of Shao Kahn during the second tournament, in case his own warriors would fail to withstand the fury and anger of the Earthrealm warriors. In fact, although she was not present in the first Mortal Kombat tournament, she was hiding in the shadows and watching the events unfold. From there, she would have to return to Outworld and report to Shao Kahn. Like Kitana, Jade's origins lie not in Outworld, but in the realm of Edenia. While it is not certain whether or not her parents made any significant contributions to Edenia, it is known that they were loyal and faithful subjects who loved King Jerrod and Queen Sindel. Aside from the fact that she has been Kitana's friend since childhood, there isn't much information on Jade's background and early life. Jade eventually grew up and became one of Shao Kahn's personal assassins. At the time of Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Kitana had been sentenced to death after being tried for treason for murdering Mileena during the events of Mortal Kombat II. She escaped the evil realm and fled to Earthrealm. Shao Kahn became enraged and appointed Jade and Reptile to venture into Earthrealm and capture her. Jade was assured that Kahn wanted her back alive, but Reptile was secretly told to bring Kitana back by any means necessary, including and especially killing her. The two then ventured into Earth to find Kitana. However, Jade found herself torn between loyally carrying out Kahn's orders and betraying her friend or joining her against the Emperor. She ultimately decided to help Kitana and thwarted Reptile's assassination attempt. With his defeat, the path was cleared for the two women to join Raiden and his Earthrealm combatants in the battle against Shao Kahn and his forces. Of immediate importance, however, was Kitana's personal mission to reach and warn the resurrected Queen Sindel about their true past together. Jade's assistance had made that possible. With Sindel's memories recovered, she too would turn against Shao Kahn. Shortly afterward, Kahn was defeated by Liu Kang. After Kahn's defeat, Kitana would go on to free Edenia from Outworld. Jade was not present during the events of Mortal Kombat Gold. It was at this time that Tanya betrayed Edenia to Shinnok and earned Jade's wrath. In Mortal Kombat: Deception, it was revealed that Jade had attempted to join Kitana and her allies in the battle against the Deadly Alliance. She had arrived too late, finding her friend's body lying on the ground with the other Earthrealm warriors. Heartbroken, Jade knelt beside her fallen friend's side and noticed a large creature approaching. She then hid in the nearby shadows and witnessed this evil menace, Onaga the Dragon King, resurrect the bodies of Kitana and her fallen friends. While they were resurrected, they were also placed under an evil spell and were told to meet up with the force controlling them at the Living Forest. Jade followed in secret, only to discover that they were going to invade Edenia and hold Queen Sindel prisoner. Jade returned to Edenia to find Queen Sindel behind bars and guarded by her own daughter. Sindel could have fought for her freedom, but she couldn't bring herself to attack Kitana. Jade attacked Kitana and managed to trap her in a cage of her own while she freed Sindel. Kitana then began shouting for the guards to capture them, forcing Jade and Sindel to flee to the portal into Outworld. Before they went through the portal, Jade caught a glimpse of her enemy, Tanya, standing next to Onaga. Currently in Outworld with Sindel, Jade has made it her personal mission to assist her Queen in rescuing Kitana from the Dragon King's spell and to seek justice (or perhaps vengeance) against Tanya, who has betrayed Edenia yet again. In Jade's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon ending, she is given great power by defeating Blaze. Through sheer will she opens the Pyramid of Argus. All of the darkness in the realms is drawn into it, where it is sealed forever. Jade is regarded as a hero, and the pyramid stands as a testament against anyone who wishes to do harm to Edenia.Biographies Combat characteristics Powers and abilities  When she was first introduced in MKII, Jade was the only secret character possess an outright special ability: an absolute immunity to projectile attacks. Any projectiles thrown at her would fly harmlessly pass her. Aside from that, her style of combat was identical to Kitana's, wielding a pair of copper fans during gameplay When she was made playable, she displayed slightly more aptitude than her other counterparts. Unlike Kitana and Mileena, Jade wielded two weapons: a steel, sharp-pointed staff and a supply of 'razorangs' (a portmanteau of 'razor' and 'boomerangs'). She displayed the most effectiveness with the staff, preferring weapon combat over hand-to-hand combat. During one of her Fatalities and her win pose, the staff left behind purple energy trails, hinting at magical properties. The staff has also been redesigned twice, first displayed as mentioned above, but in Deception, given a larger spearhead at one end whilst in Shaolin Monks, it is a simple iron staff with no sharp ends. She also displayed skill with the razorangs, able to retrieve her weapons as they returned to her without cutting herself and can alter their trajectory at will. Jade is able to emit a 'force rejection field' around her which seems to cause projectiles in particular to fly right through her like air.Signature moves Fatalities Other Finishers: Endings Appearances in other media Film  Despite her portrayal as a \"good\" character in the games, Jade appears in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (portrayed by Siberian supermodel Irina Pantaeva) as a character who remains loyal to Shao Kahn until her death. After failing to seduce Liu Kang and leading the other warriors to an ambush (not before testing Liu Kang and leading him to the Temple of the Elder Gods), Kahn himself has her eaten and swallowed by a living gargoyle in his palace due to her alleged failure at keeping the Earth Warriors from escaping. There is also little to no indication in the movie that Jade and Kitana know each other from the past. Instead, Kitana glares at Jade when she betrays the group.Literature  Jade appears in the novelization of both feature films. Her role in the first novel is very small, appearing only on one page before being tricked by Sonya and defeated with a single blow. It is interesting to note that instead of fighting with any of the three weapons she uses in the games (fans, staff or razorangs), Jade displays great proficiency with a pair of half-moon daggers, capable to moving them so fast around her that she can shield herself from attack. Jade's role in the novelization of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is expanded, and a history between her and Kitana is hinted at, as Kitana is disgusted by her arrival. She fakes subduing Sindel and lures the Earth Warriors into a trap, distracting them long enough for the Extermination Squads to get close, before escaping. Despite Sindel's testimony to Jade's loyalty, Shao Kahn has her devoured by a living stain-glass window for allowing the Earth Warriors to survive. Jade doesn't appear in Jeff Rovin's non-canon Mortal Kombat novel.Comic books  Jade has a minor role in Malibu Comics second series Battlewave. Since her participation in Mortal Kombat II wasn't revealed during production of the comic, Jade's portrayal and personality is highly different from her in-game canon story and traits. In the comics Jade is an evil assassin under Shao Kahn's command, and shows no relation or ties with Kitana besides their shared looks. She is always paired with Smoke, possibly due to both of them appearing on the background of the Living Forest stage in Mortal Kombat II. Jade and Smoke attempt twice to kill Jax (and later Johnny Cage) before they arrive in Outworld, but both times they fail to do so. Later they try to redeem themselves by killing Raiden during his fight with Kano (the third issue of the mini-series Rayden and Kano), only to be stopped by Kano himself.Character development  Jade's introduction to the Mortal Kombat series is quite similar to that of Reptile's. She was simply an extremely fast palette-swap of Kitana who could not be harmed by projectiles and, in all ports of MKII, (except for Sega Genesis/Megadrive, where she had Kitana's skin color) had brown skin. In the first Mortal Kombat, Reptile made his appearance as a green-colored version of Scorpion with both Scorpion and Sub-Zero's abilities. When Jade made her first non-secret appearance in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, she was given her own attributes and storyline. The same happened for Reptile when he made his first non-secret appearance in Mortal Kombat II. Jade's name was not superimposed over her MKII energy meter; its inclusion was likely forgotten by the programmers during production. Jade could be seen peeking out from a tree in The Living Forest Arena in Mortal Kombat II, as could another secret opponent Smoke. It was then further suggested in the comic book series that Jade and Smoke were in fact assassins working for Shao Kahn. However, the comic books were considered to be non-canon. Jade also made an appearance in the game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks as an assassin that fought alongside Mileena and Kitana. Her appearance sparked some controversy about the validity of the game's story, compared to established Mortal Kombat canon. After battling her, she is stabbed in the eyes with Mileena's sai by the player and dies.Trivia Jade Gone Wired  Much like Sonya, Chun Li, and perhaps even Ms. Pacman, Jade has become a renown female character from video gaming. Her beauty accounts for this.  Presumably, the initial reaction of most fans would be, FLAWLESS VICTORY.Character Relationships Pong  Pong is an arcade game that was released in 1972 by Atari Inc. The game is Atari's first game and helped start the video game industry. Atari's president Nolan Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn to create a game for a training exercise and they liked the game so much they decided to manufacture it. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied Pong's gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. Several sequels were released that built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features. Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, and has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions.Origin  Nolan Bushnell had played the electronic ping pong game on the Magnavox Odyssey in Burlingame, California. He hired Allan Alcorn who is good in computer science. Alcorn's assignment was to create a game based off the ping pong game as a warm up exercise. Bushnell looked and played the game and Atari manufactured it.Gameplay  The game is a 2-d sports game played in a simple way. The player uses the paddle to knock the ball back and forth and must get the ball past the other paddle to get a score. The score is represented by digits on top of the screen. The control is a dial.Lawsuit from Magnavox  Ralph Baer the inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey, the fist video game console, got Magnavox to sue Atari, Balley , and Midway. Magnavox and Sander Associates claimed that Pong and the other variations were copied from the ping pong game on the Odyssey. The judge had a look of the circuitry of a cabinet of Pong and saw a demonstration of the ping pong game on the Odyysey and ruled in Baer's favor.Popularity  Atari decided to first put the game in a bar called Andy Capp's Tavern. A few days later the game was acting out of control. Workers worked on the machine to find out what was wrong and the reason was that it was full of quarters. Soon many more people came to the bar just to play the game. Atari decided to manufacture more machines and pretty soon Pong became a very successful game. Atari soon released a home version of the game and it became a popular hit. Many other companies made different games that were different variations of Pong. The game became known worldwide and was a huge success making many copies on game consoles. Home Pong was an instant success following its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000 units were sold that holiday season.[25][26] The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award.[26] Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones to capitalize on the home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models.[25] Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves\u2014they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey.[27] The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's Pong consoles are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare.[28] Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.Sequels and Ports  Bushnell felt the best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years followings the original's release: Pong Doubles, Super Pong, Quadrapong, and Pin-Pong. The sequels featured similar graphics, but included new gameplay elements; for example, Pong Doubles allows four players to compete in pairs, while Quadrapong has them compete against each other in a four way field. Bushnell also conceptualized a free-to-play version of Pong to entertain children in a Doctor's office. He initially titled it Snoopy Pong and fashioned the cabinet after Snoopy's doghouse with the character on top, but retitled it to Puppy Pong and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action. Bushnell later used the game in his chain of Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. In 1976, Atari released Breakout, a single-player variation of Pong where the object of the game is to remove bricks from a wall by hitting them with a ballOriginal Cabinet  By November 1972, the first Pong was completed. It consisted of a black and white television from Walgreens, the special game hardware, and a coin mechanism from a laundromat on the side which featured a milk carton inside to catch coins.Dig Dug  Dig Dug is a an arcade game released in 1982 by Namco. The game play takes the character Dig Dug to go underground to kill monsters.Gameplay  The player controls Dig Dug to go underground. He will travel through the ground to defeat the underground dwelling monsters. Dig Dug must use his weapon to inflate the monsters to make them pop or crush them under a falling rock. The enemies can follow through the tunnels or travel through the soil by becoming transparent. The action button must be pressed four times in order to kill an enemy. If an enemy is left partially inflated it will regenerate and come back to attack. Leaving an enemy inflated under a rock can help crush them by using the rock. More points can be awarded if killed further down in the soil. Killing Frygars horizontally reward more points since that is the only way they can breathe fire. If an enemy is killed by a falling rock than more points are awarded going from 1000 to 1500 to 2000. If Dig Dug causes two rocks to fall fruits appear on the screen for bonus points. The last enemy of a level will try to escape by going to the surface. If the enemy is able to go off screen then the player advances to the next level. If the player drops a rock on a foe at the same time he pumps it to death, a glitch will occur whereupon all enemies will promptly disappear, but the game will not progress and the player will be free to dig through all dirt. Attaining the next level of play will then remain impossible, but the glitch can be resolved by forcing a rock to drop. Level numbers are represented by flowers in the top right of the screen and each new level is noted at the beginning of each stage on the bottom right (as seen in graphic above). In successive levels, more monsters appear on each screen and they move more quickly. A level is completed successfully when the last monster is dispatched or succeeds in fleeing. In the coin-operated version the game ends on round 256 (round 0), since this board is unplayable. At the start of the level, a Pooka is placed directly on top of where the player starts, with no way to kill it (this is an example of a kill screen).Main Character  Although Namco has officially given the character of the original Dig Dug the name Dig Dug, in other games where he makes an appearance, the protagonist goes by the name Taizo Hori, and is the father of Susumu Hori, the main character in the Mr. Driller series. He is also the ex-husband of Toby \"Kissy\" Masuyo, the heroine of Baraduke. His name is a pun on the Japanese phrase \"Horitai zo\" (\u6398\u308a\u305f\u3044\u305e) or \"I want to dig!\" Many American gamers learned of his real name via the Nintendo DS game Mr. Driller Drill Spirits, where he is also a playable character. He is additionally featured in an unlockable gallery of Mr. Driller items in Mr. Driller 2. In the Mr. Driller series, Hori is known as the \"Hero of the Dig Dug Incident\". In Japan, he is also the Hero of the South Island incident and is the honorary chairman of the Driller Council to whom most of the characters answer. This contrasts greatly with the PC remake Dig Dug Deeper, where the hero is simply named Dig Dug.Versions and Ports  Atari obtained the license for home versions of Dig Dug, and then released it for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Apple II, Atari 400/800, Commodore VIC-20, Commodore 64, IBM PC, and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. Namco ported Dig Dug to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, but it was not released in North America. A Gameboy version was released in 1992.Legacy  A 1985 sequel to this game, the overhead-view oriented Dig Dug II, was much less common and met with less success in the arcades. Another sequel, Dig Dug: Digging Strike, was released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS. This combined the side-view play of the original with the overhead play of the sequel and added a narrative link to the Mr. Driller series. A 3D remake of the original, entitled Dig Dug Deeper, was released for PC in 2001 by Infogrames. The original Dig Dug was released for the Xbox 360 console via Xbox Live Arcade on October 11, 2006. The original Dig Dug is also available for play via the GameTap subscription gaming service, and was shown in one of the television commercials for the Gametap website in 2005. [1] It was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on June 9, 2008 and in Europe on August 29, 2008, at a cost of 600 Wii Points.[1] On April 30, 2009 Namco released Dig Dug Remix for iPhone OS, which allowed players to play the original game along with a remake with big boss battles and enhanced graphics among other features.[2] Dig Dug was rated the sixth most popular coin-operated video game of all time by the Killer List of Video Games website.[3] It has been said that the music for the game show Starcade was inspired from the music for Dig Dug.[4] In the video for the song \"We Are All Made of Stars\" from electronic musician Moby, a scene is depicted where a sprite of Moby himself, dressed as an astronaut, is in the middle of a Dig Dug session.Ms-Pac-Man arcade machine.jpg David Crane  David Crane (born in Nappanee, Indiana, United States) is a video game designer and programmer. Crane started his programming career at Atari, making games for the Atari 2600. After meeting up with co-worker Alan Miller in a tennis game, Miller discussed with him a plan he had to leave and found a company that would give game designers more recognition. From this meeting, he left Atari in 1979 and co-founded Activision, along with Miller, Jim Levy, Bob Whitehead and Larry Kaplan. His games have won many awards while he was at Activision. At Activision, he is best known as the designer of Pitfall!, a game that stayed at the top of the charts for 64 weeks. He used to have a personalized license plate that had Pitfall as the letters on it. Crane maintained that the Atari policy of relying on mangled adaptations of arcade games (which benefited of highly-advanced 8-bit graphics which only the ColecoVision at the time was able to partially recreate) would have only resulted in a glut of cheap, unappealing games (which is exactly what led to the Video Game Crash of 1983), while instead considering the strengths and weaknesses of the 2600 machine and tailoring new games to them would have yielded positive results. The reasoning was that while the new games would have lacked the instant-promotion of an already-known name, word of mouth among video gamers, being a young and highly-social group, would have gradually made up for it if the game was good. In 1986, Crane left Activision to co-found Absolute Entertainment with Garry Kitchen. The two of them left mainly because of Jim Levy's departure, and the way the newly appointed CEO of Activision, Bruce Davis, treated video games more like commodities rather than creative products. Although Crane worked for Absolute, he did all of his programming at his home in California. For Absolute Entertainment, he was known for A Boy and His Blob, a successful NES title following the adventures of the protagonist and his companion, a shape-shifting 'blob', and Amazing Tennis. In 1995, Absolute Entertainment was dissolved, and became a defunct company. In 1995, he co-founded Skyworks Technologies and currently is that organization's Chief Technical Officer.JohnnyLightning Welcome!

I am Robot Master (did I do the link right?) and I made an article about OUR beloved NES. I am just using my phone to visit this site. I'm sorry but the article is not precise because I just used my observing skills to observe and record the specification. Also, since I am new and don't know how to style my article, I just used my primitive knowledge of HTML like  and  and\n. Please improve it, and help provide others the knowledge about all our favorite consoles. I also want to have every Nintendo console, I played the NES of my cousin before, have the motherboard of a destroyed SNES, and the Project64 emulator for playing N64 games on my PC. I want to let you know that I will support you as long as I can and good luck, more power!Reply by Kyle Alexander aka Robot Master  I am trying to learn how to use wiki markup language. I want to help. And I assure you, no matter what happen, that I will be always here to help you build your wiki. It's just a shame that I use my cellphone with the UCWEB 5.0 WEB browser to visit and edit wikis. It's hard to make long articles because my phone hangs or restarts. I first tried to help in Wikipedia, but they refused because of the server IP of UCWEB, but since I can help here, I helped here. Oh, and you'll have Mega Man articles later in no time. Good luck!

PacBoyCraZ  Talk Page 01:13, March 3, 2010 (UTC)Okay, sorry, I'm back  Yeah...sorry about that. I'll do some more editing around here =] (PS--the wiki looks awesome--very professional =D) --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.SFII  For the Street Fighter II article, can I...say...make seperate articles for Hyper Street Fighter II, Super Street Fighter II, etc.? The original SFII article could be left the way it is, but I just want to add something like see the main article for the game here or something. This isn't important, just a request =] --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Re:  Hello, sorry I wasn't in. I was hanging out with my friends throughout the weekend and week. PacBoyCraZ  22:00, March 13, 2010 (UTC)Couple of Questions  I've just been curious about a few things for awhile... I think that's all I wanted to ask. Yeah, I know, \"couple of questions\" is misleading. And I know some of my questions may be hard to understand, but I suck at putting questions into words. X( Thanks in advance. =] --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Thanks!  For the answers and the bureaucrat thing. Creating templates for the games will be no problem. =) --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.New pages  Hey Smith, the new pages you made have many red links on them. Can you either remove the links or create the articles? PacBoyCraZ  03:14, April 2, 2010 (UTC)Admin  If i make more than 50 edits on this wiki do i become an admin, this is true right?. Neffy545 03:17, April 6, 2010 (UTC)  It's UxieLover from the Spyro wiki. Gracias for inviting me here. We should have a better featured video, y'know! This is Spyro's Dance: Seymour Boss Theme (FFX). It has scenes from both Kingdom Hearts II and Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!. Is this a good video to be featured? Uxie1994 12:17, August 22, 2010 (UTC)Nathan Drake  Nathan \"Nate\" Drake is the main protagonist in the Uncharted series of games and is playable as the main character as well as playable in Uncharted 2's multiplayer mode.Fortune Hunter \u00a0  In Uncharted:\u00a0Drake's Fortune, Drake is portrayed as a normal guy seeking fortune. When he realizes that his ancestor, Sir Francis Drake, might have found the treasure of El Dorado, Nate embarks on an adventure to find El Dorado. He usually wears a ring on a string around his neck, where he finds the coordinates of his ancestor's coffin. When he fishes it out of the ocean along with a journalist, Elena Fisher, who's focused on getting a good story, they find that the coffin's empty except for a diary. Soon after, pirates attack them and their boat and while the boat is at the brink of destruction, a friend of Nate's, Victor \"Sully\"\u00a0Sullivan, picks them up. After ditching Elena so nobody else would get involved in finding the treasure, Nate and Sully go to the said destination of El Dorado, only to find that it was taken years and years before them. After finding a half-sunken ship, Nate goes to explore and finds where El Dorado should be. By accident, Nate sets a torpedo in the ship and quickly escapes only to see other treasure hunters (Atoq Navarro and Gabriel Roman and their men) that are also looking for the treasure of El Dorado. After Navarro shoots Sully in the chest, Drake tries to attack only to be interrupted by the explosion of the torpedo Drake set while he was in the ship. Convinced that Sully's dead and he's out-numbered, Drake runs and, on his way, bumps into Elena Fisher, who's mad at him for ditching her at the dock. After seeing that Nate's being chased and Sully's dead, they escape the island and go on a journey to find El Dorado.Among Thieves\u00a0  In the sequel, Drake starts working with thieves Chloe Frazer and Harry Flynn to find Marco Polo's ships, which disappeared mysteriously while Polo refused to give an explanation. After breaking into a museum for an artifact of Polo's, Flynn takes the artifact for himself, sets the alarm, and frames Drake for stealing the artifact. Drake is imprisoned for three months at an Istanbul jail before Sully and Chloe release him. The three then go on a journey to find Marco Polo's ships and solve the mystery. After awhile, Sully tells Drake that he and Chloe should just go on the journey, stating that he's not in the right shape for it. After realizing that Marco Polo was after the Cintamani Stone, Chloe and Drake set out to find it before Zoran Lazarevi\u0107, who also wants the treasure, while Chloe's still pretending that she's on their side. While there, Chloe and Nate bump into Elena Fisher and her cameraman, Jeff. Elena says she's there to prove to the public that Lazarevi\u0107 isn't dead. The reunion gets interrupted by an enemy chopper, causing the group to run. The group is then ambushed by Lazarevi\u0107's men outside a temple, where Jeff is shot. Nate, Elena, and Chloe take the wounded Jeff with them, but Chloe points a gun at the three while Flynn and Lazarevi\u0107 show up. Lazarevi\u0107 then kills Jeff and Nate and Elena have no choice but to run, still going for the Cintamani Stone.PacBoyCraZ welcome.  hey as u see i need help, and if u can create and edit any video game article and character u want. GAME SAGE Jonathan Smith (JohnnyLightning)nice but...  nice work on pac-man's page but when editing his history make it in the order of the games he's appeared in by date and talk of his adventure he must acomplish in the games. also create some pac-man games. GAME SAGE Jonathan Smith (Talk) (JohnnyLightning)good job  hey keep up the good work and see if u can create enemy articles too. good job. GAME SAGEJonathan Smith (JohnnyLightning)Testing signature  TiBiT PacBBoyCraz() TiBiT PacBBoyCraz()No offense  But you don't seem to know your stuff. I guess you're mostly a Namco fan, so it's understandable, but Luigi's first appearance was NOT Super Mario Bros., it was Mario Bros. for the arcade. And Shigeru Miyamoto didn't create Kirby, Masahiro Sakurai did. - BattleFranky202 06:04, October 4, 2009 (UTC)Can't edit user page?  The page is not protected and a test edit I made to fix a typo went through fine. When you say you \"can't edit\", what do you mean?

But as for here there isn't much I can do since many of the games here were before my time... -The Forgotten Beast 17:46, October 9, 2009 (UTC)im still here  dont worry im still here, and good job editing and when you make a new article of a game or character upload an image on the article and a image of the character in his current game. GAME SAGE Jonathan Smithnot bad  thats not bad but add consoles of the past and present instead of controllers. Jonathan SmithThanks  But if I'm not editing for a while, that means school is taking over. I have to hand in my high school application and I have a billion tests + homework. Btw, I like your new user page. It's awesome. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 22:11, December 3, 2009 (UTC)Hi Again  I'm in middle school too--8th grade, and high school next year. Good luck in your tests and I hate science too...and math... =/ what consoles do you have, anyway? --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 00:19, December 4, 2009 (UTC)Damn!  I can totally connect to the damn section of your page. One time, I was playing Sonic Heroes on my PS2, and I collected all seven chaos emeralds and I defeated all four Egg Emperors AND got up to Neo Metal Sonic, the final boss. Then, the next day, when I was going to play that file, the file terminated somehow. I still have no idea how it was deleted from the memory card, but I was so pissed. And I hate special stages too, so you can imagine how much of a nightmare collecting those Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic was. Because of that, I never got around to defeating Neo Metal Sonic as Super Sonic. =,[ BTW, you have Mario Kart Wii? Sweet! We should exchange friend codes sometime. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 19:48, December 23, 2009 (UTC)I made my own \"crap\" section  Anyways, Merry Christmas!! =) --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 19:49, December 24, 2009 (UTC)OT: What game would you want that doesn't exist (yet)  Did you ever want a game so bad...but the only problem was, it didn't exist yet? What game do you want to exist? I really want The World Ends With You 2 to come to life! I just feel like Neku's/Shiki's/Joshua's/Beat's stories aren't over yet! I mean...I don't own the first one yet (I just ordered it now with a Christmas gift card, though) but did you see the story! Damn! I was like, WTF when I saw that Neku was actually going to kill Shiki! Sonic Adventure 3 would be nice too, but...probably never going to happen. So...what's your opinion on a game that should exist? BTW, about the Tekken thing, they did make Tekken 6 for PSP, but the PSP version is really unpopular compared to the PS3/360 ones. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 05:17, December 29, 2009 (UTC)Good Call  Crash and Spyro need a comeback. I think Naughty Dog should take Crash back. They didn't have to leave for Uncharted. I feel guilty whenever I play that game now =(...Anyway, I've never played Pac-Man World, but looking at pictures of it, damn it looks fun. I guess it's just one of those games that needs more recognition...I think I'm gonna buy Pac-Man World 2 now =] --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 02:35, December 30, 2009 (UTC)Crash and Spyro should return...  In a crossover. Like the next Super Smash Bros. as secret unlockable characters or something. Crash/Spyro definitely have the potential to be really good games, it's just the new creators that keep screwing the job up. I just looked at the Crash website and their latest news was a Crash game that came out in 2008 (Mind Over Mutant I think?). I think Nintendo should buy Crash and Spyro. Just look at games like Mario Galaxy, Metroid Trilogy, and Zelda Spirit Tracks. They're unbelievable! Anyway, did you see that trailer for Project Needlemouse? It looks like it has a lot of hype surrounding it, and if Sega doesn't make a good game out of Project Needlemouse...Sonic might as well be gone for good. Gosh, what is up with all of these long-time mascots dying??? --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 22:31, December 30, 2009 (UTC)Crash in 2010?  Yeah, I think there is going to be a new Crash game. The Crash team is supposed to make a game for PS3/360/Wii/PS2 or something like that. That's the only information I could find on it though. They must really want to keep it a secret. =/ --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 23:00, December 30, 2009 (UTC)Can this mean Crash in High-Definition?  If it's going to be a PS3 exclusive, they're probably going to make a return for Crash in HD. This should be interesting. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 23:17, December 30, 2009 (UTC)Now that I think of it...  Naughty Dog has been really successful so far. I've never played Jak and Daxter but I've heard a lot bout it (thinking about getting Daxter/Lost Frontier on PSP). I play the Uncharted series, though, and those games make you feel like you're in an action movie. With all of the awards/success of Naughty Dog's games, I don't see why they would hesitate to bring Crash back. Isn't he everybody's favorite bandicoot? --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 23:49, December 31, 2009 (UTC)Everything's starting to look updated graphics-wise...  But if Crash Bandicoot returns on the PS3 with Naughty Dog as the creators/developers (if Naughty Dog is the creator, it should be on the PS3 because isn't Naughty Dog owned by Sony or something?), yeah it probably would look like Uncharted. Oh yeah, and since you have a PS3, you can add me to your friends list if you want. My PSN is rubberdux54. I'm not on right now though. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 22:12, January 1, 2010 (UTC)YO  ok but ill help to and make sure when you do edit the series make sure to write in a professional way as adding to the story (not in a fan way) and add things about the development team and critical praise. oh so u know theres been rumor that Naughty Dog is going to develop a new Jak and Daxter game for the PS3 sometime in the future. GAME SAGE Jonathan Smithyeah  yeah i like ratchet and clank better as i own three games and one j and dSuperheroes  Spider-Man was my first favorite, then I played Ultimate Spider-Man and Ultimate Alliance and Human Torch became another favorite. Also, Venom > Carnage. I hate it when people say Carnage is better. Batman is impossible not to be a favorite, (I need Arkham Asylum already!) that was when I started liking Nightwing. He was the first Robin before Tim Drake and that other guy. He was just awesome. They should just make a Nightwing game already...He's barely in any game except Lego Batman and Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 17:35, January 8, 2010 (UTC) I recommend Ultimate Spider-Man over Spider-Man 3, actually. I know Spider-Man 3 came out later, but Ultimate Spider-Man was just so fun! You even get to race Human Torch if you go to Baxter Building! I actually wanted to get the Spider-Man game for Playstation, but then I found out neither my PS2 or PS3 had backwards compatability...ugh...--Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 22:50, January 8, 2010 (UTC) You actually beat him??? How?? I never could beat him the last time, I got close though. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 23:09, January 8, 2010 (UTC) You rated R&C 1,000,000... O.o damn, must be really good...Yeah, maybe I'll get the first R&C first. If I like that one, then I'll buy the others and play them in order. If not, then I'll just skip to R&C Future and get Secret Agent Clank/Size Matters for the PSP. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 03:55, January 9, 2010 (UTC) I love Zelda ^_^ My first Zelda game was Four Swords Adventures. It was okay, but then I bought Ocarina of Time...I fell in love with it. So yeah, then I got Spirit Tracks (multiplayer is hilariously fun) and I'm planning to get Wind Waker/Twilight Princess soon (Link's awesome!). But I know I have to pick up a Crash/Spyro game, and I have to start playing one of those really bad. I think I'm going to download the first Crash Bandicoot on PSN, because I know they have it there, and I still have a gift card left over from Christmas. Oh crap, wait a minute...Army of Two: The 40th Day is going to be released on Tuesday??? Already??? D= Wow, I'm screwed. I hate it when things like this happen... --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 02:07, January 10, 2010 (UTC) No pressure. Right now (instead of focusing on Army of Two) I'm going to focus on getting games I should have gotten a long time ago. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 02:42, January 10, 2010 (UTC)Games  Pac-Man World 2, Crash Bandicoot (PSN), Spyro the Dragon (PSN), Ratchet and Clank (the original). I don't have much money left, just a gift card left over from Christmas, so that's all I'm planning for now. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 20:43, January 11, 2010 (UTC) I'll be using PSN a lot too, and Virtual Console. But do you think that, in the future, game companies are going to make games only available through download? Like, you can't go out to GameStop to get a used copy or something? That would suck for me, because I always buy/order used games for cheaper. =( --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 00:53, January 12, 2010 (UTC) Yeah it would suck! Like, imagine not owning the cases and manuals and cover art and all that stuff...I hope they don't actually decide to do that. It would suck all the charm out of owning discs.--Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 01:07, January 12, 2010 (UTC) Instruction manuals would probably be downloadable along with games, like they are now...I hope they won't expect everybody to know what everything is/controls all ready...I've noticed instruction manuals are getting really lazily done now though. For example, the Ultimate Alliance 2 one was like...two pages--I'm not even joking! XD Also, the one for Mario Party 8 was really big, but that was just because it had a section for four different languages! But, if it is decided that games are going to be downloadable instead of bought in stores...the thing I would miss the most would be the cover art. Sometimes it's nice to have official artwork from a game, and it sometimes makes the game appeal to you more. To have that gone would just suck. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 02:45, January 13, 2010 (UTC) I decided I'm going to order the codes and get them in my e-mail to download instead of downloading them directly from the store, since I found out it's cheaper that way (I think $10 in the store and $6 on Amazon). I'm definitely going to order them tomorrow along with Pac-Man World 2. If my math is correct, I can get all three with one card. =] Yeah, I'm going to treat myself after school tomorrow. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 01:35, January 14, 2010 (UTC)Opinions  Unbelievably, I managed to get both Army of Two: The 40th Day and Crash Bandicoot, yet I still have money to spare on the games I was planning to get! Turns out though, Army of Two isn't that good. It's okay, but after playing it for a few hours, I went right back to Modern Warfare 2! It looks to me like EA was a little over-confident with what they were doing--the characters look (uncomfortably) different and the game's kind of different (from its prequel) itself. Shooting mechanics-wise, it's okay. Story-wise, it sucks ass! XD The gameplay's fine, just it could have been better, I guess. As for Crash Bandicoot, that game is HARD! It looks like a friendly enough game, but when I played it, gosh did I get frustrated! Crash: (getting run over by a giant rolling stone) Whoa! Me: DAMMIT! I like it ^_^ Kudos to you, Crash--you may look friendly, but you are one deadly bandicoot! I'm up to the Native Fortress--the place where you have to keep jumping up and up on those bouncy boxes. I hate it when I fall all the way down! Argh, frustrating stuff. Thanks for the reccommendations on the games. =] --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. 21:40, January 20, 2010 (UTC) Yeah, that one was funny! With the grandma playing the PS3 and the kid wanted her to get off, since it was his. The problems the people on the commercials have are always funny. -- Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. Guy 1: These are the gravity boots from Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, and Lou here is going to try climbing up this wall. Guy with Gravity Boots: Alright, here we go...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! (blasts off into the air) Guy 1 to Guy 2: Dude! I thought you knew how to work that thing! Guy 2: Is that him? Guy 1: That is a PLANE! Then there was the one that turned the guy into a chicken, and the \"devestator\" one...and also the \"shock blaster\" one. Lol, they were all so hilarious! =D -- Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.LISTEN UP  alright i got an important job for you. all the characters and items of the wiki, i want u to put them in categories relating to their series. like for hover boots goes to Ratchet & Clank items category. and if one article already has that kind of category go to one that edoesnt have it. and teach me how to put images in the background like those pacman images on the pac wiki. GAME SAGE  Jonathan SmithBreak is here!  Happy mid-winter recess!!!! Also, check out this collection of old Sonic commercials. They're not supposed to be funny, but I find them funny. Marketing strategies were very silly back then...I mean, just look at the one for Sonic & Tails 2 (Sonic Triple Trouble)! It should have a seizure warning before it starts, lol! Here's the video! Hope you have an awesome break! --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.about bearucrat  if you can make 70 more edits as i have said adding categories such as for hydro thunder goes into midway's games and liu kang goes into mortal kombat characters and fighting characters. each category you make, make sure it goes apart of a certain video game or genre depending on what it is as a character, level, game, or item. if you can do this, i'll make you a bureaucrat. and you must edit here for most of your time as you will be second in command. when you make your 70 edits on the job i have aquired you to do you will become one, but remember you must keep up your responsibility when i make you one.Hello ^_^  I'm especially excited about Sonic 4. Episode I will be downloadable on PSN, Xbox Live, and WiiWare. I'd say to download it on PS3, though, since it'll probably have better graphics. There's a lot of hype surrounding it though, so if it's another screw-up (Sonic 06 had a lot of hype surrounding it and just look at it) then it would be gameover for Sonic. I still have hope though, even though a lot of people don't. =/ On a higher note, Mario Galaxy 2 is coming out in April! You get to ride a Yoshi!! Also, isn't a new Crash game supposed to come out this year? I have to admit that (don't laugh) I still haven't beaten Crash Bandicoot. Do you know how many times I tried?? You have to be a freaking god to beat that game!!! Anyway, I'm still trying. I'm determined to kick Cortex ass. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Hey!  Hey, it's been a while, hasn't it? =) My birthday's coming up (next month) and I know I'm going to get A Crack in Time! (Additionally, Phenoix Wright: Ace Attorney and Final Fantasy XIII) Anyways, I tried adding you on PS3, but there was some sort of error. Something with \"udon\" in it? Idk, I forgot (I'll try adding you again in the future, maybe), but I got Sega Racing (for PS3)! And let me tell you that it is really easy to get trophies in that game! I got 38% trophies already and I didn't even play much! But yeah, it's better than I expected--it's not just a Mario Kart clone, it's actually pretty fun. I have nothing else to say, other than TGIF!!!! --Hustle. Loyalty....you know the rest.Okay, whenever you're PS3's internet stops screwing around  About Nintendo Racing, that would be awesome! I was actually just thinking about Nintendo Racing too! Like Super Smash Bros., but racing instead of battling! I was just stuck on what Link would ride. A car seems too far off, so I was thinking either horse or train as reference to Spirit Tracks. But imagine Link riding a bike? =D He would kick ass on a bike...anyway, about Sega Racing, I barely recognize anybody either! =D Sonic characters are obvious, and I only know who Beat is because I kicked ass as him in Sega Superstars Tennis. A few others were obvious too (like Alex Kidd--everybody knows the poor guy was replaced by Sonic) but when I saw everybody else, it was just a big blank. You learn to like them though. Like Opa-Opa. He's some weird spaceship thingy from a game called \"Fantasy Zone\" or something, and he grew on me. But I can't wait to get A Crack in Time. The weapons'll be a stretch from Call of Duty, lol. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Belated Response  Awesome! I never played the first Modern Warfare, but I heard a lot of good stuff about it. My sister just ordered Pac-Man World 2, Spyro: A Hero's Tale, Viewtiful Joe, Bioshock, Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, Jak & Daxter, and Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour. I also pre-ordered Final Fantasy XIII, which I'm expecting on Monday. I never gave up on Pac-Man World 2. =D It's really weird, because the last Pac-Man games I played were Pac-Mania and Ms. Pac-Man. I can't wait to try this one. Any other game recommendations, let me know (Star Fox is next).\u00a0;] Also, I won't be around too much this month. I have a Science lab report due Wednesday and the whole exit project (display board, powerpoint, and lab report) due at the end of the month, I have a Social Studies 6-page report (size 12 font, yes X[) due Tuesday and I didn't even start it, the Social Studies exit project (powerpoint and report) due at the end of the month, and a math project on coordinates/y-intercepts/slope and all that crap due Monday. Forget math, my sister has all the answers. Everything else will keep me busy though. BTW, when you get Modern Warfare (for DS or PS3, either one) tell me how good it is. I wanna know.=) --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Response  Hey, cool! A game review section! =D Anyways, other than a PS3, I have a Sega Genesis (2nd model, came with Sonic the Hedgehog 2), PlayStation 2 (Slim), Game Boy Advance (I have 2. 1 Blue and 1 Silver), Nintendo Wii (which I play GameCube games on--Zelda Four Swords Adventure, Chibi-Robo, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut, Luigi's Mansion, Ultimate Spider-Man, etc., etc.), Nintendo DSi (I used to have a Lite, but I traded it in for $70 off my DSi purchase--its blue because I got it a couple of days after it came out, there weren't many color options), PSP (first model, has to be my least used game system) and yeah, that's about it I think. I used to have a Nintendo Entertainment System, which came with Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. I had more games for it, but it was given away when I was younger, sadly. =( I loved playing Super Mario Bros. on it, I hated Duck Hunt though. For one, I had a love for ducks when I was younger. Seriously, I was obsessed with ducks. And for two, I was too young to undestand how to play. But I have Super Mario Bros. on Wii Virtual Console now, so it's all good. Another game system I used to have was a Sega Dreamcast which was also given away. The last game I played on it was, I don't know the exact name, but it was an NBA one. Yet another system I used to have was the Game Boy Color, which was given away to my cousin in Europe while on vacation. None of my game systems broke, they were just given away, and it sucks to know what I could be playing right now if it weren't for giving away those systems X( About Blu-Ray, my old, 80gb, fat PS3 has blu-ray too. I know because I watched Wall-E on it. =P The only thing I watched on my PS3 was Wall-E, unless two episodes of South Park I bought off PlayStation Store count. It's just that the newer models don't have backwards compatability. Mine isn't so new, but it doesn't have backwards compatability, which means I can't play PlayStation or PlayStation 2 games on it, which sucks. I was going to sell my PS2, until I found out there was no backwards compatability =) I also love the Mario sports games, though. Mario Super Sluggers, Mario Golf Toadstool Tour, Mario Kart Double Dash, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart DS, Mario Party DS, Mario Party 8, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, all of them are awesome, as well as the main ones like New Super Mario Bros DS, New Super Mario Bros Wii, Super Mario Galaxy, etc. Mario Galaxy 2 is going to be awesome too, I know it. You can ride Yoshis! =D --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Hey again  I got Pac-Man World 2 (FINALLY!). Why finally? Because first of all, I put actually buying the game on hold for awhile. Second of all, when I originally ordered it, my order was cancelled by the seller. After ordering it from a different seller, I finally got the game. Who knew it would be so hard to get a copy? =) Anyways, right now I'm having trouble in Final Fantasy XIII. I've decided to take a break from the main story for a while (can't defeat that guy that looks like a pope >=() and fighting a ton of enemies to no end. This way, I get CP (Crystogen Points--points that allow you to upgrade your characters) and components (depending on what type, this can be either something pointless that you'll feel safe selling, or something you can use to upgrade your weapons and accessories). After fighting enemies and enemies until I max out my whole party (at least how much I can, I can't develop as far as maxing out at the moment) I'll be pumped for that boss. I was pissed too, because I got so far and so close to beating it, but he put the damn doom clock on me (a clock which times you--if you can't defeat the boss in time, it's game over) and I panicked. Anyways, enough of explaining my frustration on FF. Right at the moment, I'm frequently playing Sega Racing (trying to get a platinum! so close!), Call of Duty: World at War (online/offline Nazi Zombies and offline multiplayer), and LittleBigPlanet (online with friends, just got the Sonic the Hedgehog pack). This gives me time to (dum dum dum!) play Pac-Man World 2, Viewtiful Joe 2 (the seller sent me 2 instead of 1, but they seemed like a nice person so I let it go. Plus I didn't want to pay shipping for sending it back.), BioShock, Jak & Daxter, Spyro: A Hero's Tail, and I think that's it. I ordered Sly Cooper, but the disc didn't work, so I got a refund and I'm going to order it again. From what I played before it froze, it seems really fun. Maybe I can even catch up on games I still didn't finish, like Dead Space/Battlefield: Bad Company/New Super Mario Bros. Wii/God of War Collection/Pokemon Platinum/Donkey Kong Country/Majora's Mask/Kingdom Hearts/etc, etc. Aaaaaahhhhh...spring break... From what I've seen of Pac-Man World 2 so far, it seems really awesome. I also had some other person I know tell me it's a good game, and they told me it took them 8 years to unlock everything =O Anyways, I think I'm going to like the arcade. I didn't know the game had an arcade area, and it's a nice little surprise. The whole Pac-community thing looks really comical (in a fun way), and the graphics are really good--I mean, Kingdom Hearts had good graphics, but...it's Pac-Man! Really, I think I'm going to like this game. Kudos to you for introducing me to it. It's sad too, because before you mentioned it, I never heard of it. I mean, think about God of War and Kingdom Hearts. I know a fan of those games might hate me for saying this, but I think those games are <gasp> over-rated. It just depends on popularity, I guess. Sonic Heroes, for example. Many people hated that game, some people like it, others (including me) think it's okay. But Sonic Heroes is popular. Pac-Man World 2 looks a lot better than Sonic Heroes, but does it get its well-deserved attention? Sooooooooooooo...how's Modern Warfare? ^_^ --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Sorry for the late response  I've just been savoring the last moments of my break. I bought Aliens vs. Predator with Easter money, on somebody's recommendation. Campaign mode sucks horribly (plus, dark rooms in video games make me feel nauseous...Dead Space and BioShock were nice in executing that, but Aliens vs. Predator? Ugh...) But online play is really fun if you have a friend to play with, and if you get passed the long loading time. Probably not worth the 60 bucks, but I had a good time playing with the guy that recommended it. Then we got bored of it and started playing Nazi Zombies, hehe. Anyway, Final Fantasy is awesome and way better than I expected, but that's my opinion. You should make your opinion your first priority, so I guess I'm saying don't let my interests get in the way of yours. ^_^ But just a few games I would recommend that I thought were a blast are LittleBigPlanet, Final Fantasy XIII (of course), Call of Duty: World at War (very underrated compared to the Modern Warfare series. =(), and that's my favorites I think. =) I got a platinum in Sega Racing, too. I forgot to mention that. ^_^ Hope we can become PSN friends soon. --Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.Controller.jpg Centipede(video game)  Centipede is a shooter arcade game released in 1981 by Atari. Two key designers were Ed Logg and Dona Bailey. It was also one of the first arcade games to have a female player base. The game became a really popular game and included numerous sequels, (Millipede) clones, ports to consoles chicken cheese.The player controls a gnome shaped head character on the bottom of the screen using a trackball. The player uses the button to fire at a huge centipede at the top of the screen that is moving left and right. Mushrooms cover the level and when the centipede hits one it descends one level and continues and the mushrooms take four shots to be destroyed. More mushrooms are created when the centipede is hit by a projectile. When the centipede is shot in the middle segments it splits in two. Both pieces act on their own. Once the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen where the player is it will move back in forth in front of the player. A new segment is added to the centipede in the time it is at the bottom of the screen. Each time a centipede is completely destroyed a new one forms at the top of the screen and the head segment is faster each time and the new centipede is smaller than the last. Smaller enemies include fleas who leave mushrooms behind when less than five enemies are on the screen each time. Spiders walk toward the player to do harm. The scorpions can poison mushrooms and when the centipede hits a poison mushroom it runs straight into the player's direction.Enemies Legacy  Centipede was followed by Millipede in 1982, a somewhat less successful arcade game. In 1992, Atari Games developed a prototype of an arcade game called Arcade Classics for their 20th anniversary. It included Missile Command 2 and Super Centipede. In 1998, Hasbro-owned Atari released a new version of the game for the PC, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. This version looks and plays very differently to the original game, with free movement around the map, 3D graphics, and a campaign which can be played in single-player or multiplayer mode. The original version of Centipede is available in this version, albeit with slightly updated graphics.Sequels  Centipede was followed by Millipede in 1982, a somewhat less successful arcade game.

The game was released in 1981 and has become a popular and classic game. There have been many remakes and sequelsHow the game was played  The player takes control of Frogger and must get him past the cars and trucks. Jump on the turtles and logs and into one of five frog holes. One of the holes might contain an alligator or snake. Catching bugs and escorting lady frogs will give bonus points. Many ways dying include, hit by traffic falling into the river, eaten by alligator or snake, or riding a log or turtleDevelopment  The game was developed by Konami and licensed and published by Sega/Gremlin. Konami was going to name the game \"Highway Crossing Frog.\" Sega wanted the name to be something unique so it was named Frogger.Enemies  Cars, Trucks, Buses, Vans, Taxis and Bicycles- They go on the highway and can run over the frog. Dont forget swaggy P Snakes- will try to eat the frog. Alligators- Swimming in the river and will eat the frog. 'Otters- Block the way to the river.Later versions  \u00a0Frogger 3D is the first game to reveal Froggers actually form. It is also the first 3D version of the games.

For the game, see Frogger. Frogger is a video game character and main character in the Frogger series created by Konami.Fictional character biography In the swamp  Frogger was born in a swamp in some unknown land. Frogger was named and raised in the same swamp, and shared a relationship with many of the animals (however, some weren't a good relationship such as constantly eating dragon flies). Frogger later left the swamp.Crossing the road  Main article: Frogger The Frogger games are about the character Frogger trying to cross the road and eat dragon flies. However, once Frogger managed to cross the road without getting hit by a car or truck, he must cross the river. Frogger is not familiar with cleaner rivers, thus crossing the river was difficult for him. Frogger crossed the river by leaping onto logs and alligators, cautiously making sure he didn't go near an alligator's mouth. Frogger eventually crossed the river and advances to other places. Frogger's adventures become endless.Frogger 3D  Frogger 3D is the first time that Frogger's appearence is really noted. In Frogger 3D, Frogger must get across the river as he originally does.

Well, I like your question. I have wondered for days when the next Pac-Man World game will come out. I also want a game that has a lot of difficulties but I can actually succeed in it, maybe another Sonic the Hedgehog game. I would really like to see the Spyro series return and I'm expecting another Crash Bandicoot game to come into action. But your question is something I must really think about though it is something I think a lot about. Sorry if I'm being confusing. 24px  24px  23:36, December 29, 2009 (UTC)Trivia  In your trivia section, you said you like Human Torch and Spider-Man as your fav Marvel characters.

Crash is difficult! Those stones are like, wierd! I always get through them, the controls are what's difficult. I got it for my PS1 but I play it for PS2 because my PS1 broke. I always forget that on the disc the analog doesn't work and I'll end up dying half of the time.

Those Sonic commercials are funny!!!! The Sonic 2 one is hilarious! I can't believe it, that commercials were so dumb back in the 90's! Maybe 19 years from now, kids will be laughing at our game commercials!!! I laughed for a while. The Sonic 3 one should have a siezure warning!

I'm glad you mentioned that. This is going to be the first original Sonic in three-dimension you know. I'm excited, I can't sit still! If it comes out for the PS3, I'll get even more excited!!!

Sonic 4 is goin' to be big, I'll tell ya! I can't wait! I have NONE of the originals, NONE! Sonic 4 will give us the chance to relive those Sonic 1,2,3 moments I'm hoping. I'm only 13, I was born three years after Sonic 3 came out. I played it though. I can't believe you're already at Cortex! I'm stuck in Crash Bandicoot, and Crash Mind over Mutant! And I'm on level 8! That's pretty high for me, the game I've made the moste progress in so far is Spyro 2. Oh yeah, and the new game comes out this year, and it's called Crash: Mutant Island. Don't ask, I really don't know much about it, but this might help. By the way, I saw that you like Uncharted! Which Unchated's do you have? There's only two that are available, but there is a rumored Uncharted 3 that might come out in 2012. It should be about the Templar's Treasure if you ask me, or maybe Columbus.

The only Sega game I play is Sonic, I'm not familiar with the other dudes really, but hopefully I'll get into them. Mario Kart was good, you'd expect it to be similar though. Here's a good idea, Nintendo Racing! It's like Sega Racing, but it's got Mario, Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Metroids, Star Fox, Donkey Kong, and as a bonus, Sonic! And my internet on my PS3 is all screwy, my dad and I are working on that. I'll tell ya when and you can go ahead.

Sorry I haven't been in, my friend and I hung out non-stop. I truly intended on edited, and I probably won't be doing much for a while. But I never thought of it being like Smash, it should be called Smash Racing!!! I'm surprised they put Alex Kidd in, everyone forgot him, I tried looking up a Wikia site about it, none! You can ask the guys at SEGA if they knew who Alex Kidd was, they'd probably forgotten XD! I'd be like, \"Dude, it was only 1990, it wasn't that long ago, if you can remember Sonic in 1991, Alex probably isn't bad unless you have siezures or something.\" But that's just me. Sonic Racing better be good, I want that for my PS3! As of now, I only have three PS3 games and 24 PS2's, a few Wii's, and some GameCube's, about six. DS, probably twenty, GBA, probably twenty. Oh well. PS3's kind of tough 'cause it's still new yet, five it another month for it to soak in. My friend has a 360 and a Wii and a broek PS2. On his 360, he has Halo 3, GTA Episodes from Liberty City, GTA IV, Saint's Row and Saint's Row II (if you know what Saint's Row is) and a few others which we haven't really broken in yet. Well, I suppose Ratchet and any soldier from Call of Duty would be cool, if it was MW2. That game is mad awesome! So is ACiT. I've only got Call of Duty 3, got it three or two years ago for my eleventh birthday for my Wii and I'm on the last level. I'm trying to get more GC's, they're pretty good. I got Star Fox Assault by Nintendo, if you've played it before, you'd know how good it is. I'm only on the seventh mission anyway. Sorry for the long, detailed message, PacBoyCraZ  02:02, March 10, 2010 (UTC)Message  Don't forget that we both like games and both have a PlayStation 3! Anyways, I find your question interesting (as usual). What game systems do you have other then a PS3? You can get Pac-Man World 2 for the GameCube and PS2, not sure if it will play on my PS3, I have the new Blu-Ray one. I enjoy the Mario adventure games and racing games most, you know, Mario Bros. series and MarioKart series. They're good, I do however enjoy Mario Tennis that I play at my friend's house on his GameCube! I have numerous Mario video games, some just aren't finished yet. I'll get to that, but it's gonna take me a while. In R&C A Crack in Time my favorite weapon is the Sonic Eruptor. Either that or the upgraded version of the Constructo Gun thingy. I can't be too specific about the Constructo, but the Sonic Eruptor shoots out a big blast spreading everywhere! I like the Bomb Glove, but the Sonic Eruptor takes enemies out quicker, expecially when you're facing a bunch of them. Also, go here. PacBoyCraZ  22:04, March 20, 2010 (UTC)Re:  Wow, it's been a while! Hey, I didn't get MW yet\u00a0:(. I couldn't find it in two GameStops and JustPressPlay. I've been frequently playing video games now, more often then usual, like six hours aday! That explains my inactivity, add friends and homework to that and I'm basically holding onto Wikia as best as possible. I didn't get FF yet either, I'm looking into it. Sly Cooper, that's my next game! I'm getting the first one, then after I beat it, the second. My most recent PS3 game is Lord of the Rings: Conquest (I don't know if you're into that kind of stuff). I'm beating it, almost, I'm on one level that is so difficult, I just wanted to smash my controller, then I relized that meant that the game wins, so I'm gonna have a staring contest with it later XD! Well, I don't have much to say, I have my spring break coming up, I only have four days\u00a0:(. Thanks for checking in! PacBoyCraZ  00:48, April 1, 2010 (UTC)Hi  Heh. You'll find I'm a big time Star Wars fan. I edit on practically all SW Wikia's and follow anything Star Wars. Lord of the Rings, I got into that when I was seven or eight, I dropped interest for a while, and now I'm picking it back up. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are great series, I highly recommend them, but nothing to get in the way of your interests. I hope to get into FF, but thing will be different. We both seem to like Marvel (from what we've spoken about). My dad is a Star Trek fan, SW fan, and Lord of the Rings fan, he got me into the two and Star Trek, well, I may get something to do with that. Ciao! PacBoyCraZ  03:12, April 2, 2010 (UTC)Mortal Kombat  Mortal Kombat is an arcade fighting game developed and published by Midway. The game was created by Midway workers Ed Boone and John Tobias. Mortal Kombat was created to challenge Capcom's popular fighting game, Street Fighter 2. Boone and Tobias originally wanted to make a fighting game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme said he had a contract with another game company to be in a fighting game but was never released. The game was also known for leading to the creation of the ESRB rating systemStory  For the past 500 years Goro, prince of the Shokan has been the champion of Mortal Kombat. He and his master Shang Tsung have won nine Mortal Kombat tournaments against Earth Realm. If they win the tenth tournament they are able to invade and take over Earth Realm. The fighters of Earth must win the tournament or they and Earth will be doomed.Gameplay  Mortal Kombat plays similarly to its rival, Street Fighter 2. Control setup was divided into four buttons and a joystick. With the buttons consisting of High Punch, Low Punch, High Kick and Low Lick, kombatants could attack one another in different regions of the body. By repeatedly tapping either Punch buttons, the fighter would continue to attack in a flurry of punches. Unlike Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat allowed for variations of physical attacks by holding down the joystick in a certain direction and pushing an attack button. Holding down joystick while pushing any of the punch buttons would unleash a powerful uppercut that knocks opponents in the air. By holding the joystick the direction opposite to face and pushing High Kick would allow for a high-reaching, quick roundhouse kick and pushing Low Lick would allow for a sweeping kick that knocks the opponent off their feet. There was also the introduction of the Block button, allowing players to defend at anytime instead of just holding the joystick in the opposite direction face to the opponent. The basic rules of fighting games apply to this as well: first to deplete their opponent's health bar wins. Each match is divided into best 2 out of 3. Unlike Street Fighter, characters were not unique in their speed and size, but the reach of their attacks as well as special attacks, which could be performed through button commands. These attacks ranged from projectiles to rendering the target immobile. What visually set Mortal Kombat apart from other fighters and made it innovative was its use of blood and digitized actors instead of hand-drawn sprites. Being the first game to do so, this gave Mortal Kombat a far more realistic look. As kombatants attacked one another with powerful attacks, blood would spew forth, adding to the violent nature. Mortal Kombat was also famous and innovative for its finishing moves called Fatalities. At the end of the last round, the winner would be prompted with the message FINISH HIM!!. By entering a specific command for a character, the winner would kill the loser in a gruesome manner. Each kombatant had their own Fatality to perform. This act of extreme violence single-handily sparked a major controversy in the video game industry.Characters  The characters of the game later star in the other Mortal Kombat games. The sprites of the characters are digitized versions of actors to portray the characters instead of hand drawn to make them more realistic. Mortal Kombat is the first video game series to do this. Most of the characters in the game are inspired by various movie characters. In addition, the game is also the very first to feature a secret character, who can only be fought after certain conditions are met.Main Characters  Liu Kang- The main protagonist. A Shaolin Monk chosen by the Temple of the Order of Light to participate in Mortal Kombat though he has come to avenge the death of the late Great Kung Lao. He is the first of many Bruce Lee pastiches to appear in fighting games. He is the most balanced character in the game. He can fire flame-elemental projectiles and has a Flying Kick that propels him forward. Johnny Cage- A Hollywood movie star who enters the tournament to prove his abilities are real. His design and moves were modeled after the main protagonist of the movie, Bloodsport. Thus, he is most infamous for his Ballbreaker move where he splits his legs and jabs at the opponent's genitals, paralyzing them a good deal. He was originally to be the main protagonist and was based on actor Jean Claude Van Damme. Raiden- The Earthrealm's God of Thunder. He descends upon Earth to guide the Earthrealm warriors in this last chance to save Earth. Though he is a playable character, Raiden is not actually allowed to participate in Mortal Kombat due to his godly status as Gods are forbidden to directly interfere in the affairs of mortals, thus he has taken on a mortal form. He is easily distinguishable by his straw hat and electricity constantly crawling about his body. He is inspired by a character in the movie Big Trouble in Little China whom went by the name of Thunder, who also wore a straw hat, albeit larger. Sonya Blade- A U.S. Special Forces agent who enters the tournament to capture Kano. She is the game's only female character and participant. Scorpion- Formerly known as Hanzo Hasashi, the fallen Shirai Ryu ninja returns to avenge the death of his family and clan, whom he believes were taken by the rival Lin Kuei warrior, Sub-Zero. Scorpion is easily distinguishable by his yellow-colored outfit and his famous Spear attack which he uses to grapple enemies from afar and reel them in for a free hit, which is accompanied by either GET OVER HERE or COME HERE Sub-Zero- A member of the Chinese warrior clan, Sub-Zero has been sent to assassinate the evil sorcerer. Possessing control over the element of ice, Sub-Zero lives up to his namesake on a deadly level. He is easily distinguishable by his blue-colored outfit. Kano- Leader of the notorious Japanese criminal organization, the Black Dragon, Kano has come to plunder Shang Tsung of his vast riches. Kano fights with a pair of energy knives and a bizarre move known as the Cannonball, where he curls up into a fetal position and propels himself at an enemy. He is modeled after a promotional poster of Terminator 2: Judgment Day.Boss Characters  Reptile - The very first ever secret character to appear in a fighting game and has since inspired others to insert new challenges. Reptile appears as a green-clad ninja, identical to Sub-Zero and Scorpion. In terms of gameplay, he is literally a fusion of the two, possessing twice the speed as well as their special attacks and finishers. To fight him, one must be at The Pit, perform a Double Flawless without blocking and then perform a Fatality. Goro - Prince of the proud Outworld race of Shokan. Boasting a set of four arms, towering strength, overwhelming power and an unwavering loyalty to Shang Tsung, he has held the champion title of Mortal Kombat for many ages. Shang Tsung -Grandmaster of the Mortal Kombat tournament and the main antagonist of the game. Shang Tsung is a cunning and powerful sorcerer boasting powerful dark magic, which he uses in the form of damaging skull-shaped projectiles and the frightening ability to morph into and mimic the forms of other fighters. With the aid of Goro, he aims to win the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament and throw Earth back into an age of darkness once again.Fatality  In other fighting games, defeating an opponent would mean to knock him out unconscious to precede. In Mortal Kombat there are new special moves called Fatalities. At the end of the last round of a fight the screen will go dark and a voice says \"FINISH HIM!\", then using certain button commands a player can kill his opponent in a gruesome way.Reception  Mortal Kombat upon its debut was met with critical acclaim for its daring approach and solid gameplay. Its success led it to become a full-blown series, marked by successful sequels. It was awarded by Electronic Gaming Monthly as the Most Controversial Game of 1993.Ports  With its major success apparent, Mortal Kombat was later ported to home consoles. Due to its violent content, it was considerably toned down. It was also one of the factors in the Console War mythos.", "Epic Rap Battles of History Wiki": "Epic Rap Battles of History Wiki Frank Sinatra vs Freddie Mercury  Frank Sinatra vs Freddie Mercury is the twenty-second installment of\u00a0Epic Rap Battles of History\u00a0and the seventh episode of Season 2.
