In the primeval beginnings of the war, the Swordwrath served as the only hand-to-hand combat unit, being rather light and more cost-efficient than the pricey Archidon. Their reign was short-lived, however, as they were soon superseded by the well-trained and tactically well-rounded Spearton on the battlefield. Even after their status had diminished, they still remained powerful and their following lively due to their dispensability and strength. While their most notable inclusion was in that of the Order Empire, it is most likely that the Swordwrath was originally devised by the country of Swordwrath. They are followers and believers of the 'Way of the Sword'.History Stick War  As the Order began to become an active participant in the warring conflict, so did they proceed in entering the realm of military dominance. The once peaceful nation, attacked on all sides, began their conquest after developing a basic weapon of protection, the Swordwrath. The Swordwrath, as their only source of strength during their conquering of Archidonis, would soon play a key role on the battlefield. Once reaching the field of Archidonis, two Swordwrath are created (a mandatory action caused by the tutorial) and sent off to order an attack. The fight then goes on by the Player's request, and the battle is eventually won. After this battle is won, the Swordwrath's destiny is built upon by the Player. No pivotal role is played again by the unit, and it's use is completely optional throughout the rest of the game.Stick War II: Order Empire  During the tutorial, three Swordwrath are required to be built, and are forced to kill an opposing Swordwrath and Spearton. Throughout the rest of the game, the Swordwrath have no canonical relevance in the Stick War: Order Empire.Battlefield Abilities Rage  Rage is a Swordwrath's only ability. Researching it costs 50 gold and 50 mana. It takes 60 seconds to research. It can first be performed in Stick War: Order Empire. When activated, a Swordwrath will lose some of their health, glow red and have their movement speed and attack rate greatly increased, which is the equivalent to increased damage. The Swordwrath will also let out a war cry to audibly indicate its usage to both you and the enemy (if the screen is close enough).\u00a0A Swordwrath cannot use Rage if it's health is too low. A group of Swordwrath using rage is ideal for chasing a retreating enemy. A large group of Swordwrath can easily raze through a group of units. Rage can also be used to retreat as well, using its speed boost to run away. Rage, in the terms of Stick War: Order Empire, is the first unlockable ability, falling second on the ability tree. However, technically the Castle Unit is first, being set as the default ability in the game. Of course, Rage can be performed without need to unlock the ability in Stick Empires, with the ability tree being absent from that game entirely. Merics can heal the health lost from Rage, so using Merics with Swordwrath that have Rage is a good way to compensate for the lost health. A mass of Raging Swordwrath, combined with many\u00a0Albowtross\u00a0with Blazing Bolts, is a potential counter to a mass of\u00a0Shadowrath, but one must act quickly to amass enough swords and albowtrosses and make good use of Miner Walls and Castle Archers before the ninjas come and slaughter your army. When facing a ninja mass as Order, one must often assume a defensive position (turtling). A good way to counter a mass of Raging Swordwrath is to use lots of\u00a0Bombers\u00a0(as Chaos) or to have a\u00a0Magikill(as Order). Electric Wall can kill Swordwrath in less than a second, and Swordwrath cannot touch Bombers, and the Bombers' AoE will slaughter the mass of Swordwrath. As Elemental, you can try doing\u00a0Scorch\u00a0or having an\u00a0Infernos. Scorch can blow up Swordwrath, and\u00a0Vastolis\u00a0can annihilate them as well. Rage can be used for other purposes as well. For example, a player can use Rage on Swordwrath to make them get to an area faster. Rage can also be used to escape faster, or to chase down an enemy army.Strengths (Stick War)  Swordwrath are often seen as the low-grade alternatives to the Spearton or Giant, but can be superior if utilized correctly. Being the lowest cost for a unit in the entire game, the Swordwrath's price tag can be attractive to the early-to-mid tier Player. This is quite understandable, as the fundamental trait of the Swordwrath is its nature as a cheap cannon-fodder unit. In larger masses, which is easily achievable due to their price, they stand their chance against smaller groups of more powerful units as well. They are versatile on the battlefield during low to mid level stages, and often make up the bulk of a force, whether CPU or Player-based. When Player-controlled, the Swordwrath can serve as a detrimental distraction towards an enemy force. When the enemy is garrisoned, simply passing through their territory in a zig-zag path will evade all Tower Archer fire and give time for your force to build up an economy. When a giant is deployed, first sending the brunt of your force as a diversion, you can then move behind the Giant and deal damage towards the unit while in a vulnerable stance. This can also be performed with a Magikill Minion or Spearton, but the Swordwrath provides a more effective, quicker path to slaying the Giant.Drawbacks (Stick War)  Swordwrath are, to put bluntly, very fragile in combat. While standing the best chance against a Spearton, they are outmatched as stand-alone units by every other class. The Giant, when confronted my a mass of Swordwrath, will tear through their ranks with ease. The Spearton can take on 3 - 5 Swordwrath without death. The Magikill will summon Magikill minions until the Swordwrath passes. As the cheap nature of the Swordwrath goes, it will suffer tremendously from it. Even at the maximum upgrade capacity, the Swordwrath cannot stand against a Giant, their biggest weakness point. Unless Player-controlled, the AI of the unit refuses to take the rear of the Giant, causing the bulk of the force to stand in the front of the creature. This will wipe waves of Swordwrath within seconds, and gives little time for recovery on the Player's part. Spearton also serve a greater purpose as a well-balanced fighter, as even with the Swordwrath's strength, the Spearton carries more defense and similar strength.Strengths (Stick War: Order Empire)  Swordwrath are now, due to a buff in health, more durable than the previous game. Archidons are extremely weakened by this, as now headshots cannot occur, meaning that Swordwrath suffer a flat damage rate and cannot be picked off nearly as fast as they were before. Because of this, they are efficient in low to mid-game levels, and can carry a team throughout those levels. Magikill also have since lost their ability to summon minions, eliminating the issue of overwhelmed Swordwrath. Late-game, Swordwrath can be swarmed, applied Rage, and rush the enemy statue for a quick take-down. As similar to before, the Swordwrath is also often used as a meat-shield for ranged units, though it isn't the most flattering title. In addition to this, it is possible for Swordwrath to be spawned in to wipe the enemy's economy early-round, which could lead to very quick matches. This is risky though, as it leaves your Miners vulnerable to invasion.Weaknesses (Stick War: Order Empire)  Swordwrath, along with other units, suffer from the new user-control mechanic, where rather than controlling the character with WASD or arrow keys, you simply tap for actions. This makes evading ranged hits or formulating a strategy mid-battle almost impossible, making all strategies from the first game not applicable. On top of this, Giants are still one of the biggest weaknesses to the Swordwrath. Now with no proper user-control, however, the AI of the Swordwrath will force it to face the Giant and fight in a swarm, making a horde of Swordwrath easy to eliminate.Appearance  Swordwrath are generally described as stick figures, assumably men, wielding swords. These swords vary depending upon which upgrade the Swordwrath receives, or in the case of Stick Empires, which sword is purchased. Depending on what image they are shown from, some will depict the Swordwrath with headgear, the most famous of these is the Stick War: Order Empire title screen. Often depicted in concept art is the inclusion of a Swordwrath's eyes, which infuse both the bulbed, rounded open eyes of a Miner with the slanted, squinted gaze of an Archidon.Armory Cosmetics (Stick Empires) Swords  These swords are purely cosmetic, and do not change the statistics of the Swordwrath. Default Sword: A simple short sword. Costs nothing. Club: Reference to the original Clubwrath. Costs 25 Empire Coins. Katana: Costs 40 Empire Coins. Greatsword: Costs 50 Empire Coins. Machete: Costs 60 Empire Coins. Claymore: Costs 75 Empire Coins. Wooden Sword: Costs 100 Empire Coins. Leafblade: Costs 125 Empire Coins. Stone Blade: Costs 125 Empire Coins.

Type-1 Energy Sword: Reference to Halo. Costs 600 Empire Coins. Golden Sword: Costs 750 Empire Coins.Etiology  Swordwrath is a compound of the word sword, a bladed weapon intended for slashing or thrusting, and wrath, a feeling of anger or rage. The word sword originates from the Old English word sweord, the Dutch word zwaard, and the German word schwert. The word wrath originates from the Old English word wr\u01e3ththo and the English word wroth.Notes References Magikill Appearance  The Magikill wears a large pointed hat, with multiple dandelion yellow and navy stripes across it. Along with the hat, the Magikill, specifically in the 2nd game, has a grey beard. Oddly, when the flames of the stick ignite, the hat's tip ignites as well. That only happens after the Magikill is upgraded completely.Strengths (Stick Wars)  The main ability that came to use in the first game was the Magikill's ability to summon Magikill Minions to attack the enemy. The units can become a great pain for the other army, giving your army enough time to ambush the enemy. The free minions can replenish your dwindling army as well. The Magikill are powerful when defending itself of close range attackers.Weaknesses (Both Games)  With their powerful abilities come several downsides. For one, they are slow and also ineffective in long range combat. Their slowness allows a quick Swordwrath to sneak up while they are in the process of stunning for the kill and possibly attacking their backs in just one hit( Note that all units except for the giant\u00a0have the same weakness). This can be further supported with the Magikill's straight line range, so by controlling a swordwrath and going to the extreme bottom of the field would fool the Magikill into stunning in empty space. Another weakness is distance: a magikill is incapable of stunning Archidons and can be killed with carefully fired arrows if the archidons are aided by Swordwrath. Not only that, they are expensive and take a long time to load.\ufeff Non-Player controlled Magikills have a tendency to get into a pattern when they meet face to face with any unit: Summon, Stun, Summon, Stun and so on. This greatly hurts the efficiency of Magikill's both abilities, because Magikill's attacks are fast striking but slow reacting, meaning that by mixing two tasks into one can cause disturbance in the army's unit defense. In this kind of case, not even fully upgraded stun timing help, so it is advisable to either control the Magikill for it to work your way like repeated stunning or summoning and at the same time enabling deficiency in Archidon attacks, or by summoning multiple Magikills at once so that some can summon while some stun. This weakness works especially for enemy Magikills, since their stun time is possibly the lowest upgraded in all difficulties. Just look out for multiple enemy Magikill units.Stick Empires Stick War Games  Magikills in stick wars 2 and stick empires recieve a redesign and new abilties. For one, magikills are updated so that they have noticably long beards. The magikill's spell casting method also looks different, as now when he casts a spell it almost looks like he was throwing his wand. The minion summoning ability of the magikill was also ommited, probably because the gamemakers think that is too cheaty. Magikills are one of the 2 units of the order empire capable of poisoning units, the other being the Shadowrath. Contrary to the previous stick war sequel, magikills are capable of long range attacks (other than their regular one).Abilities  Magikills have 3 abilties in total. The first is 'blast', a spell that causes an explosion within a small range of selected space. This spell has the shortest range but has the highest damage, potentially killing any archidon or swordwrath in the way. The second spell is called 'poison spray', which poisons all enemies within the range of the spell. This spell alone does not cause instant damage, but can be very useful especially if the enemies have no merics and the battle lasts long. The final ability of the magikill is the 'magikill's electric wall'. This spell enables the magikill to cast a spell that forms a damaging electric barrier, damaging any nearby units that stand within them. This can be used to kill mobs of units especially if they continue to stand within that barrier.Weaknesses  Even with the long range attacks, magikills alone do not stand a chance against even a archidion. Magikills will still have weaknesses over long range, since the magikill was originally designed to be a melee range unit. What damage it can cast from its normal attack would not kill either, so early research of the 3 abilties and a huge mana pool is recommended. Even so, magikills themselve take a considerably large amount of mana to train, which makes it more of an end-battle unit.Trivia Giant  Giants (jIE-ants) are large humans known for their crushing power. Their race pledged\u00a0allegiance to the Chaos Empire, having an enslaved counterpart on the side of Order. Initially residents of No Man's Land, until they were either enslaved or under the command of Medusa, used in her military campaign against her bitter rival. Giants are powerful soldiers, under the solemn command of Medusa and her equally strong force. They are the single most expensive unit within their empire, but make up for their heft price tag with sheer power and durability. During the Chao's failed military campaign, the Giant's use was not ever superseded by another unit, up until the very death of Medusa herself. They are not followers of any known 'way'.Abilities  Giants are siege units used to \ufeffdeal very heavy damage to a statue and other Giants (480 damage for your units and enemy Giants on easy, 516 on normal, and 648 for insane) and has a large amount of health. Their attack is also vertically ranged, which means they can damage the units in front of them and those beside the victim out of the Giant's sight which gives them an advantage. They attack using either a spiked club or using a body of a regular-sized person, which is probably a disarmed swordwrath. In Stick War 2, enslaved giants in the Order empire throw huge boulders at the enemy but do not have a club or dead body, which only Chaos Empire giants have. Giant growth could also prove extremely effective for clearing out large mobs of units since they can survive much longer. Enslaved giants hold a huge advantage over the Chaos giants due to their long range capabilities. However, the Enslaved Giant is beat in terms of attack power.Attacking style  Giants are one of the three units that have different attacking styles, the other two being Swordwrath (minions included and Speartons). The two attacks mentioned earlier affects the rate of attacking. Swinging their club takes a while for the impact to land, but the Giant can react much faster. Using the person it holds to attack allows quick impact, but reaction takes longer. In stick empires, the Enslaved Giants have only one attacking style with both fast reaction and impact time, which is just launching boulders at enemies as if they were missiles.Weaknesses  In Stick Wars 1, you only need one swordwrath to defeat a giant by itself, as you can do a leap attack, right after the giant starts their attack animation, which deals damage to the giant while making the giant miss its attack, due to the leap attack making you move forwards. This also works in Stick Wars: Legacy. A giant can easily be swarmed by several Swordwrath or Speartons. Since the giants can only attack from one side at a time, mobbing could prove lethal. Which goes to show that it's best to use Giants only to smash statues, so as your last attack send a wave of all units at the enemy along with a Giant so your units can attack the enemy to prevent the Giant from dying and use your giant to attack the enemies giant, smash his units, kill the Giant and destroy the enemy! Giants are also the type of units that can be fooled to continue on while a swordwrath attacks, similar to how a parasite absorbs human nutrients without knowledge.But giants are most well known (especially in Stick War 2) for being incredibly slow units. In fact, giants are the slowest units in the games (with the exception of miners in stick war 2) and take quite long to react to enemy attack. Enslaved giants in stick empires also lose their\u00a0 'area of effect' damage ability, which can pretty much encourage swordwrath mobbing, especially if your whole army is comprised mostly of giants. A chaos giant has several major weaknesses, using a spearton, swordwrath, or (recommended) shadowrath, you can avoid the giant's blows, it takes time to strike with each heavy blow. so moving behind the giant when it strikes allows you to constantly damage while not taking any damage yourself.Real-world Counterparts  Note: The section is an excerpt from Wikipedia, and is available under the Creative Commons Public License. Giants\u00a0(from\u00a0Latin\u00a0and\u00a0Ancient Greek: \"gigas\", cognate\u00a0giga-) are\u00a0beings\u00a0of human appearance, but of prodigious size and strength common in the\u00a0mythology\u00a0and\u00a0legends\u00a0of many different\u00a0cultures. The word\u00a0giant, first attested in 1297, was derived from the\u00a0Gigantes\u00a0(Greek:\u00a0\u0393\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2,\u00a0G\u00edgantes) of\u00a0Greek mythology. In various\u00a0Indo-European mythologies, gigantic peoples are featured as\u00a0primeval\u00a0creatures associated with chaos and the wild nature, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they\u00a0Olympian,\u00a0Celtic,\u00a0Hindu\u00a0or\u00a0Norse. Giants also often play similar roles in the mythologies and folklore of other, non Indo-European peoples, such as in the\u00a0Nartiantraditions. There are also accounts of giants in the\u00a0Old Testament. Some of these are called\u00a0Nephilim, a word often translated as giant although this translation is not universally accepted. They include\u00a0Og\u00a0King of\u00a0Bashan, the\u00a0Nephilim, the\u00a0Anakim, and the giants of\u00a0Egypt\u00a0mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11:23. The first mention of the Nephilim is found in Genesis 6:4; attributed to them are extraordinary strength and physical proportions. Fairy tales\u00a0such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\" have formed the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent monsters, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat the livestock. The antagonist in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals, like those of\u00a0Jonathan Swift\u00a0and\u00a0Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.Miner  - Stick Empires Profile Slogan The Miner is a relatively passive unit, lending it's allegiance to many empires throughout it's lifetime. Similar to the Swordwrath, the Miner is found in every tutorial stage in the Stick War series, due to sheer necessity and their basic ability.Abilities  The miner is the only unit capable of mining gold for the army. Their bags can be upgraded to hold more gold and their pickaxes can be upgraded so they can mine faster. Without them you cannot have units. Miners are very weak and have no way of defending themselves. However they are capable of defense in Stick War\u00a0: Order EmpireWeaknesses  Their major weakness is that they have absolutely no way to defend themselves. They can also only mine at rock formations that are littered around the battlefield. Also, a miner that has just come out of a fort is prey for a Swordwrath, or other units.Stick Empires  In Stick Empires,they made major changes to the miner. His bag now always carries 75 gold,can pray to collect mana,and can attack in self defense. They still have many of the same traits from the original, but these differences make the miner much more powerful. The latest patch increases their speed.Abilities  Miners now have 2 abilities to research, the first being 'Miner hustle', which can increase the miner's speed and health, which can potentially kill even a spearton given you have enough miners to outlast that one unit. The second ability is called 'Miner wall', allowing the miner to build a protective wall against the enemy army after being researched, The miner wall is made so that you have enough to even churn out a single unit to wall the enemy forces.Weaknesses  Even with the new attack,the Miner still does very little damage, so he's still open to attack. A miner that has been assigned to mine/ pray with continue unless you tell the miners to attack. They are also able to be killed instantly by Shadowraths that use shinobi I or II.Fun Fact: The Miner has a Chaos Empire counterpart, known as Enslaved Miners.  \ufeffMagikill Minion Appearance  The Magikill Minion wears no clothing, as replicating the likes of the Swordwrath. The Minion wields a small pitchfork, and is slightly smaller than the average unit.Strengths  The Magikill Minion, summoned from the Magikill, costs virtually no gold or population. Along with being completely free, the Magikill Minion is a somewhat strong offensive unit. The ability to overwhelm single units with sheer numbers is useful, as well as the fact that speed upgrades placed onto your Swordwrath applies to the Magikill Minion too.Weaknesses  The Magikill Minion unit is weak in defenses and health, along with losing against any unit in the game.Archidonis  - Narrator, The War Begins Archidonis was a country, primarily of Archidon, that ruled over land near the Order Empire. While their ranks of Archidon proved effective against the Order and their Swordwrath, their numbers were far too small and they were eventually overtaken by their rival.History Stick War  Archidonis were one of the many aggressive nations that continually attacked the Order, as they were a nation of knowledge and peace. However, Order began a revenge conquest in reaction. Order and it's small group of Miners had marched from to Archidonis to initiate conflict. While Archidons were the superior unit to the Swordwrath, without cover from melee units, they eventually would fall to ranks of Swordwrath. Their statue was soon overtaken, and the Archidonis fled from their home__land and ran for the hills. Once again, however, some members of the nation pull through, deciding to form a coalition with the failing Swordwrath country. The new-formed coalition then takes over the neutral land of Pertland. Through the conquest of the Order, their ranks stop to free the citizens of Pertland, eliminating the coalition between the two countries. Later in Westwind, Archidonis repeats the coalition process with the Speartons, and again fails in bringing down the Order. Small fragments of what was left from the Archidonis country team up with all other countries to destroy the Order in the final battle. The Order eliminates these units as well.Stick War II: Order Empire  Archidonis, now known simply known as the Archidon Empire, return in hopes of reclaiming lost land and gaining their revenge against the Order Empire after the events of the original game. In response, the succeeding Order begins their second conquest over Inamorta. After the Order marched through the Spearton Empire, their ranks had reached Archidonis. When the gruesome conflict subsided, the Order Empire had once again claimed victory over Archidonis, and their remaining fleet fled for the hills. The Archidonis and their remaining fleet, led by the Magikill, are among the rebel empires that eventually ally with the Order, forming a united coalition to end Medusa and her hellish reign once and for all.Notes Stick War II: Order Empire  Stick War II: Order Empire is an entry in the Stick War series. It is the third (though canonically second) game in the franchise, refining and building upon it's predecessor.

Welcome to stick war wik! Comment and tell me more about stick war. I will try to make your comment[s] into a strategy, walkthrough or something else... Anyway, the mission to this game is to win the game by completing the levels and the mission to my wiki is to read, learn and edit! Make my wiki the best stick war wiki in the whole world! There is another stick war wiki but it only have nonsense about bad words. (Strange...) Anyway, this wiki tells you about stick war strategies and walkthrough to beat the game. Stick war 2 is still under development so all we do is to hope that it will soon be here. After it is completed, this wiki shows you stick war 2 strategies and walkthrough too!\u00a0:D So what would be a good game without a good twist?Items for the Stick War characters Miner: flaming spearton  flaming spear flaming helm flaming shieldduel sword\u00a0  fire sword wings birds\u00a0 shadowMax Upgrade Spearton: Magikill: Magikill Minion: monster  machine gun mace sackNative  The Native are humans that have pledged their allegiance to the Native tribe, seeming to be the warriors of their legion. They are some of the few units responsible for the Native ambushes but do not seem to take part in usual battle otherwise. They are presumably followers of 'The Way of the Spear'.History  During the Order's march to Swordwrath, a tribe of Natives ambush their ranks. Haulting their pursuit of Swordwrath, the empire is forced to fend off Native attack until sunset. Order struggles, but pulls through and survives until sunset, eliminating the waves of Native. These Natives are never seen again after the ambush fails.Battlefield Abilities Strengths (Stick War)  The Native are identical in statistics to the Spearton. This makes them well-off in combat and durable toboot. Swordwrath, with their basic clubs, cannot fight these units alone and require a group of three comrade Swordwrath or an Archidon to slay a Native.Weaknesses (Stick War)  Natives suffer from small numbers, which makes for Swordwrath massing and Tower Archer fire. A group of nine Swordwrath can surely kill three Natives, and three to four arrows from a Tower Archer will kill one of them. These units are all either extremely cheap or free, making the biggest downfall to the Natives sheer numbers.Etiology  The word Native is derived from the Latin\u00a0word nativus.Notes References Stratregies  Please choose a mode to read about the strategies. Normal Mode Hard Mode Insane Mode \ufeff \ufeffSpearton  - Stick Empires Profile SloganSpearton Controls Stick War  ** SPACE to attack. ** Q to block. ** F to throw spear. ** WASD or Arrow keys to move.Appearance  Speartons, used throughout the entire Stick Wars series, and have continued to use the same weapons and clothing. Their attire consists of the gold helmet, with a burgundy Mohawk attaching to the top of it. The Spearton uses a spear, with a tip that is made preferably from either copper or gold, and a golden shield.Strengths (Stick Wars)  The Spearton has been shown multiple times before to prove powerful as a heavy unit, able to tank damage from every other enemy. As well as being highly defensive, the unit is extremely powerful, with the initial throw of his spear being able to immediately slay a Swordwrath or Archidon. Originally in Stick Wars, the Spearton would automatically head towards the front of your fleet. This might be due to the Spearton being the leading role of the Order. The unit is reasonably fast, along with the ability to deflect arrows or initial attacks while walking, unlike any other unit. Although very few, the Spearton is ineffective against Giants, as they've been able to stun Speartons until death. Along with the obvious Swordwrath massing, there aren't too many other weaknesses to the unit.Strengths (Stick Wars 2: Order Empire)  The Spearton has remained with the same advantages, but dimmed down to allow fairer gameplay. The unit is about as defensive as before, along with being able to block a bit faster, but besides that. Not much has improved.Weaknesses (Stick Wars 2: Order Empire)  The Spearton has grown to more than a few weaknesses, the biggest being Giants, Swordwrath massing, Albowtross, and Magikill.Trivia: Insane Mode WARNING!!!  INSANE MODE is only for experts who know how to play very well. If you are a beginner, please go to the easy strategy. The following strategies below is only for insane. But you still can use it for hard and normal mode. Wish there was an Easy mode.Archidonis  Melee VS Ranged Madness! The bowmens takes a bow that shoots out fire and easily ticks your army out. Try buying a few miners and buy one clubman. Control that clubman you trained. Remember this, when you control someone, the stickman attack and defence rise. Another reminder: If a clubman is defending, it cannot attack. Do the zig-zag technique so some of their bowman attacks misses that clubman. Try dotching and defending their attacks while your miners get some money from the gold. If the clubman dies, big trouble. You may have to restart the level. If it survives, quickly train lots of clubman and start attacking. You still control the clubman and followthe others. Do the zig-zag technique to dotch those attacks. Ta-Dah! Mission completed.Normal Mode  For newbies, start with normal mode.Archidons  When you first play this game (on normal mode), you battle against Archidons,\u00a0enemies with archers that\u00a0shoot at you from quite long distances (also known as ranged attacks.) All you have are Swordsmen to attack them and must be near them to attack (also known as melee attack). You see that they take the basic bow to attack your army and statue. All you have to do is to get a miner or two, and then get a few Swordsmen and get ready to attack. This should finish them.Survive until the sun sets  You just got a new unit that you unlocked during the battle with those Archidons, and you are so excited to try them on this level. But this misson is nearly impossible to beat if you fight\u00a0these enemies with arrows. The enemies have\u00a0big shields and a long spear used to stab and destroy your army. The objective of this level\u00a0is to defend until the sun sets, and NOT to destroy a statue. The only problem is your army isn't strong enough, so you have to learn to use the outnumbering method. Reminder: three clubs are better than one spear.  Can't defend properly? You will have to learn an extra method. At least it's better than nothing, right? Use the \"Garrison Mode\". It will keep your army safe and you can strike back after a few seconds. Reminder: Enemies can also man their fort, so when they do this method, you better reserve some gold. For every three units, one garrisoned Archidon will strike the enemy. It means if you have a maximum number of units (20 men,) you will get six garrisoned Archidons.Swordwrath  You will learn about the almighty headshot from Archidons! The Swordwrath are only equipped with swords. Although it can slice your Archidons and Swordsmen, the Swordwrath still have a lame defence. It means one headshot or two equals to one kill. So now that you know that this mission is best to use Archidons, right? And you are going to make your army all Archidons, right? But it's a bad idea using only bowmen, because it may take forever to destroy the Swordwrath statue, so you better train some of your own Swordwrath( I called them swordsmen before, but I am going to call them \"your Swordwrath\" from now on.) Reserve some money for backup just in case the Swordwrath come back to defend. After you beat this level, you will have a sword upgrade for your Swordwrath to face the Speartons.Speartons  There seems to be no ambush after defeating the Swordwrath with your army, yeah? This time your going to have to face the Speartons. Speartons are heavy infantry that have armour from head to toe, and your army of Swordwrath and Archidons are not powerful than Speartons, so you must use the outnumbering method you learned on the second level because three clubs (OR should I say three swords?) are better than one spear. The Speartons' helmet protects them from headshots and minimizes damage from your Swordwrath. They can throw their spear at your trained soldiers and cause a lot of damage.Swordwrath Counter  So you think everything is over, right? The Swordwrath are just going to surrender their land? Well, in this level, this is one of those \"Survive Until the Sun Sets\" all your units: Archidons, Swordwrath, and Speartons. Also try to get some miners, too, because you'll need a lot of money if you are to survive this level. I said you need money because after you kill one Swordwrath unit, another will come out. Train a medium group of archidons first, then get speartons to block.Magikill  The Magikill is powerful as they are mage. They can stun your speartons and swordwrath out and their minions will finish you. Sadly, they cannot stun archidons, which is the key to beat this level. Do as battling the swordwrath, until you get enough archidons and a magikill get near, then send out swordwraths to mob and kill it. Once you do this, you canget rid of these mages.Free Pertland  This time is swordwrath and archidons combined. So beware of arrows when fighting a swordwrath. Get your swordwrath close up to their archidons and get your archidons far from their swordwrath. Or you can use speartons and archidons if you want.Stick war.jpg Walkthroughs  Best Walkthroughs.

Happy editing, Sarah ManleyFanon: Order Native  Order Native are similar to a default Native, but belong to the military of the Order.", "Day R Wiki": "Day R Wiki ", "DayR Wikia": "DayR Wikia ", "Advance Wars Wiki": "Advance Wars Wiki Advance Wars: Days of Ruin  Advance Wars: Days of Ruin (Advance Wars: Dark Conflict in Europe) is the fourth and latest game in the Advance Wars Series of games. It involves a new list of COs, Forces and many changed Units. It has a much darker tone and feel than the previous games, as well as having a storyline that is independent from the other games. Several details distinguish each version, such as differences in the names of the factions, characters, and units, as well as significant dialogue changes. This is due to Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe receiving Japanese copies of the game to translate independently, resulting in unique versions for each region. The setting is a post-apocalyptic world, one that's been devastated by meteor strikes. The objective is same as ever, to win battles involving different Forces.Gameplay  The gameplay, while keeping the same formula as previous Advance Wars, differs from previous Advance Wars games. Unlike previous installments, the developers kept the game in a more balanced and competitive environment. The CO System has been altered dramatically. Here are a couple of changes: The following units have been removed: The following units are new to the game: The following units have been revised: DoR allows players to level up a unit each time your unit destroys another unit. The maximum level a unit can be is Veteran. When units join together, the highest unit level is applied. The boosts are as follows:Plot  The plot of Days of Ruin is considerably darker than, and unrelated to, the plots of previous games. 75% of mankind has been killed off following devastating meteor strikes, which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun. Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them. Following the disaster, which obliterated much of the warring nations of Rubinelle and Lazuria, a young cadet from the Rubinelle military academy named Will escapes the ruins of the academy's mess hall and is confronted by The Beast, a former sergeant gone rogue who leads a small band of raiders. Will is rescued by Brenner and Lin of Rubinelle's 12th Battalion (nicknamed \"Brenner's Wolves\"), and takes on the group's cause of saving as many survivors of the meteor strikes as possible. During a search, Will discovers a mysterious amnesiac who does not remember her own name, but somehow knows detailed military information. Will later dubs her Isabella, and she becomes a vital part of the battalion as they put an end to the Beast's reign of terror. One year after the meteor strikes, the 12th Battalion comes into contact with the New Rubinelle Army, and learns of the war raging between the Lazurian Army and the NRA. Brenner reluctantly sides with Greyfield, leader of the NRA, and advances on the Lazurian force, eventually defeating them at Fort Lazuria. Distraught by the ruthless execution of the Lazurian commander, Forsythe, Brenner and the 12th Battalion break the Lazurian prisoners out of an NRA internment camp before they are also executed. While the group escapes, Brenner stays behind and hides in an abandoned city to buy them some time. An infuriated Greyfield orders the use of a new weapon which completely destroys the city, killing Brenner and the NRA troops searching for him. As they retreat, they desperately fight off Greyfield's encroaching armies. Will, who was placed in command of The Wolves following Brenner's death, remembering something that Brenner said earlier, decides to take the fight to the NRA, and make Greyfield and Waylon pay for Brenner's death. Hearing from Caulder himself that Greyfield wants to use The Caulder Missiles against them, Lin leads a force against Greyfield, preventing him from launching the missiles and defeating the NRA once and for all. In the process, Lin personally shoots and kills Greyfield, avenging Brenner's death. The 12th Battalion is unexpectedly attacked soon after by Intelligent Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with weapons of mass destruction. Caulder, leader of the IDS, had taken advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease, the Creeper, for the sole purpose of studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber, The Great Owl, the battalion survives and eventually pursues Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the city of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict, begins to flourish in the new-found peace. The sun is seen rising above the nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving hope of a brighter future.Forces  Advance Wars: Days of Ruin features four new forces:Commanding Officer  Commanding Officers (Commanders or COs for short or Syogun in the Japanese versions) are the main characters of Famicom/Advance Wars. They are the leaders of each Force and generally the only characters to speak throughout the game. During each battle, the player assumes control over a CO's actions. Each CO has their own special attributes and certain COs are more suited for different kinds of battles than others. See Category:Commanding Officers for a full list of COs.Gameboy Wars Advance/Advance Wars  In the original game there were 11 COs. Each CO had a unique power which they could use once their power gauge was full, often with battle changing effects. In campaign, only Andy, Max, and Sami were playable until the last mission where anyone else could join in (except Sonja) if the player completed certain missions with certain COs.Red/Orange Star Green Earth Blue Moon Yellow Comet Black Hole Gameboy Wars Advance 2/Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising  In addition to the COs from the previous game, 8 new COs have been added. Orange Star, Blue Moon, Yellow Comet, and Green Earth each got one new CO and Black Hole gained four. Each CO now has a unique super power/special break in addition to their regular powers/breaks.New COs Famicom Wars DS/Advance Wars: Dual Strike  9 new COs were added to the roster. All of the new COs make an appearance in the campaign.New Allied COs New Black Hole COs Famicom Wars DS Ushinawareta Hikari/Advance Wars: Days of Ruin/Dark Conflict  In the fourth game, CO's changed slightly. Each CO has a command zone, which affects any of their units within it. The effect and size of the CO zone varies from CO to CO.Independent Legion/12th Battalion Sapphirus Federation Army/Lazurian Army NRA (New Rubinelle Army) IDS (Intelligent Defense Systems) Trivia  Historically, COs are usually generals, but can be as low as lieutenants in small groups. In the Famicom/Advance Wars games the exact rank is unknown for most COs, but is quite varied for the ones that are known.Sturm  Sturm\u3000(Japanese: \u30d8\u30eb\u30dc\u30a6\u30ba, Hell-Bouzu) was a CO and ex leader of Black Hole. He appears during the first two Advance Wars games as the main villain. In the first game he is the only Black Hole CO apart from Clone Andy, though in the next game he is joined by several others who serve him. Not much is known about him other than that he is an alien who enjoys war and hates peace. He is pure evil, bent on conquering the world, and lacks any respect for his enemies, constantly calling them \"worms\". He lacks compassion and does not value life, even willing to destroy Wars World rather than be defeated.Advance Wars  In the original game, Sturm is the real mastermind behind the conflict. He manipulated the other forces with the Clone Andy, using him to frame Orange Star for the attacks on the other nations. Fortunately they realized their error and faced Sturm, defeating him and forcing him to retreat. During Campaign players only fight against Sturm twice, on the final two missions, despite him being the one responsible for the outbreak of war. Sturm noted that he underestimated the forces of Wars World, but survived the battle and escaped.Unlocking  To unlock Sturm you must first unlock every other CO (Except Nell), then he will become available to buy for 100 Coins.Statistics  Sturm, who is widely seen as a very powerful CO, with overwhelming overall unit averages, is actually quite the opposite. In Campaign, he is more powerful than in VS. Mode, in which he has been weakened. He is more of a defensive CO and does not focus strictly on firepower. In VS. Mode his Units stats are 80/120 while in Campaign mode his units are 130/80, so they possess low firepower, making Sturm a CO not to be used to overwhelm the opponent or to rout your enemies, which can be frustrating for those who try to win in that fashion. Sturm is to be used defensively and very strategically when attacking. Also, Sturm's Units are not affected by any Terrain and can move quickly through features such as Mountains (Infantry), Woods (Units with Tires), Plains (Units with Tires) and Reefs (Naval Units). This allows for quick invasions with stealth. Oddly, a CPU-controlled Sturm has a tendency to create T-Copters with Infantry on the first day of VS. Mode, which other CO's do not usually do.CO power  Sturm's CO power is Meteor Strike. It deals 8 damage to all enemies units in an 3 squared-radius diamond (it is unable to drop the HP of enemy units below 1) and makes so his units stats are 150/90. When playing as Sturm you may not choose where to target with it, it's chosen automatically. The playable version's Meteor Strike is weaker than what he had in the campaign, dealing only 4 damage and makes his units' stats 90/144. The target will be chosen by finding the biggest amount of fund damage the meteor can do (for example, a full hit point Rocket unit costs more than a 9 hit point rocket, so he will choose the first), with the cost of his units being decreased from this calculation (since the meteor WILL damage his own units).Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising  Sturm returns in the second game, again the leader of the Black Hole forces though this time he's brought some other Black Hole COs with him. This time Sturm attempts to overwhelm the allied nations by force and by his command the Black Hole army invades the allied home nations, making use of new weapons including factories and pipe lines used to fuel the invasion forces led by these Black Hole COs. Sturm stays in Black Hole territory himself. Again he is defeated by the Allied Nations when they repel the Black Hole offensives and attack Black Hole's headquarters. After the final battle he attempts to detonate a bomb to take the other forces' COs down with him, but is prevented from doing so and killed by Hawke. His units are stronger overall, boasting 120% attack and 120% defense across the board. Sturm's units retain the ability to move across all terrain unimpeded except when it is snowing.Unlocking  To unlock Sturm\u00a0in the second game you must get an overall rating of S in the Normal campaign or Hard campaign, then he will be purchasable from Hachi's store.CO power  Sturm\u00a0does not have a CO power.Super CO power  Sturm\u00a0retains his CO power, Meteor Strike, from Advance Wars, as his Super Power. It now boosts his units' offense and defense to 140% and 150% respectively, in addition to the same area damage (8 damage within a diamond with a radius of 3 squares).Quotes Advance Wars  \"Hmm\": Missions \"Enigma\" during his 1st turnBlack Hole Rising  Campaign \"Hawke... you... traitor...\": His last words before he died Power \"You will tremble before my power!\" \"Fear is all you have left...\" \"You shall not survive!\" \"Prepare to embrace darkness!\" \"Such power... I regret crushing it.\" \"Burning earth!!!\" Victory \"My name is Sturm. Hear it and tremble.\"Tactics  There's a reason Sturm is banned from most competitive settings. In AW2 Sturm's units receive a powerful boost without drawbacks, but Sturm's most devastating power is the ability of his units to move through any terrain without a movement penalty except when it is snowing. This allows Sturm to completely dominate the capture phase and often win the game in the first few turns. Alongside this, Sturm has the absolute hardest hitting Super CO Power in the game. It deals 8 damage in a 4x4 radius to all units, regardless of Sturm's units or not. This is very broken, as the game's programming has the meteor aim for the most expensive troop that is on the field, or an equivelent of. As such, Sturm's power can entirely decimate an army, and there's not much to do about it. This is why Sturm is one of the absolute best COs in the game, only being closely matched by Hachi.Trivia Commanding Officers  Category for Commanding Officers and related articles.Black Hole  Black Hole is one of the five main forces of Wars World. It features in Advance Wars, Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising and Advance Wars: Dual Strike as the main enemy in all three games. Black Hole is an aggressive force that seeks to dominate Wars World. Its COs have an evil intent and are highly destructive, not really caring how many units they lose as long as they can achieve their goal. In the original Advance Wars the head of the Black Hole army, Sturm, caused the other nations to go to war with each other by deceiving them. In the end however his scheme was discovered, foiled and Black Hole was defeated. In Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising Sturm is assisted by other COs - Adder, Flak, Lash and Hawke - in invading the other nations. Black Hole is also armed with new technologies such as the large factories, Black Cannons and Minicannons. However, allied nations manage to defeat Black Hole once again. Sturm attempted to use a bomb to destroy both him and the Allied Nations COs, but was killed by Hawke before he could detonate it. In Dual Strike, Black Hole is lead by Von Bolt and his Bolt Guard, Jugger Koal/Zac and Kindle/Candy. Hawke and Lash from the previous games return but they're deserted from the Black Hole army when they discover Von Bolt only wishes to destroy the land to sustain his own life, not conquering Wars World. Flak and Adder also make an appearance, not in the campaign. They appear as playable characters for the war room, combat and survival.CO's  Black Holes commanding officers are:Trivia Hawke  Hawke (Japanese: \u30db\u30fc\u30af, Hawk) (known as Maverick in European version of the game) is a Black Hole CO, first appearing in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. He is the second to last Black Hole CO to appear, appearing in Green Earth. Hawke is a ruthless and intelligent CO. He is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve victory, even sacrificing the well being of his troops. He is a very talented CO, devising brilliant plans and entrusted by Sturm to command the rest of the Black Hole COs. All of his units are stronger than average (110% firepower to be exact). However, he has the second longest CO meter in the series. He will stop at nothing to achieve his objectives.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising  Joining Black Hole with no told reason, his task was to attack Green Earth by the order of Sturm at the first dialog box. During the war, Hawke was second in command of Black Hole's army, only taking orders from Sturm. He then attacks and gets a great deal of land, until Jess comes, teams up with Eagle and Drake, counterattacks against Hawke, and destroys a factory. He then retreats back into Black Hole territory when Orange Star, Blue Moon, Green Earth, and Yellow Comet team up to attack Black Hole and end the war. However, Sturm attacks and tries to destroy everyone, but Hawke steps in and kills him personally using his CO power. He then gives some words and leaves. If you play Hard Mode, you can actually play against him with Andy. He claims of wanting to test his skills, in which Andy showed and gets the best of him.Advance Wars: Dual Strike  In Dual Strike, Hawke is still with the Black Hole army and retains his Machiavellian nature, although he is not as high-ranking of an officer as he was previously. At first, he doesn't even know who the new leader of Black Hole is, due to another taking up the lead after the vacuum of power was created from the assassination of Sturm. After the Allied Nations fights him, he questions Kindle about who the new leader is, where she teases him about it before leaving. Later on Kindle heads to Von Bolt and tells him about Hawke's restlessness and his questioning, and suggests a quick ridding of him and Lash. Upon being discovered after trailing Kindle to Von Bolt, Hawke has a short conversation with the new leader, right before Kindle gives the command to kill Hawke and Lash by sending Oozium 238s to kill them. The duo flees and is saved by the Allied Nations, and for the sake of survival, they decide to join them in their efforts to defeat Black Hole. They finally fight and defeat Von Bolt in his own secret base. After the COs defeat Von Bolt he tries to destroy them with the giant Oozium. However, Hawke comes and uses the chair to prevent Omega Land from being destroyed. Although the Allied Nations seemed to believe he perished in the aftermath, Hawke survived the ensuing destruction, as noted by Kindle in a comment during the ending. Kindle also mentioned that he escaped with Von Bolt's Chair intact, and they notice that Hawke chose to restore Omega Land to its former state, as opposed to using it to build an army of his own. Hawke is not actually seen at the ending of Dual Strike.CO Powers  All units are powered up to 110% in offense. However, his CO power meter is larger than most other CO's. (It states in Black Hole Rising that his CO Guage charges slower however this actually isn't the case.)Normal CO power  Black Wave - All Hawke's damaged units recover 1 HP. In addition, all enemy units suffer 1 HP and gain +10% to offense and defense. (Attack bonus is available in Dual-Strike only)Super CO Power  Black Storm - All Hawke's damaged units recover 2 HP. In addition, all enemy units suffer 2 HP and gain +10% to offense and defense. (Attack bonus is available in Dual-Strike only)Tag Breaks  Hawke has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  His units are 110/100 on a daily basis. This daily ability affects all units in all circumstances giving him a slight advantage over most CO's. Also, none of his units suffer from weaknesses. While it's a myth that Hawke's power meter charges at a slower rate than other CO's, it is true that he has one of the longest power meters in the series (equal to Eagle and just 1 star smaller than Sturm's and Von Bolt's). Since his regular CO Power costs 5 stars, it's often more economical to just be patient and get the full effects of his Super CO Power. His Super CO Power costs 9 stars, but it is one of the strongest in the game. It essentially like a combination of Andy's healing and the damage that Olaf/Drake deal. It affects the entire map and not the areas where there's combat going on. The higher the unit counts, the stronger the effect. This 4HP swing adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Your formerly 6HP unit is now on equal footing with the enemy's formerly 10HP unit. Or, if both of your units were at 5HP, yours becomes 7 and their's becomes 3, giving you an easy advantage in combat.Quotes Black Hole Rising  Power \"This is the end.\" \"Farewell.\" \"I give you credit for pushing me this far.\" \"To be defeated is to lose everything. Are you prepared for that outcome?\" \"Victory goes to the better combatant. It's a simple truth.\" \"Impressive....\" \"I will remember your skill!\" Victory \"You're not weak--I'm just way too good!Dual Strike  Power \"You have inspired me to take action.\" \"You leave me no choice.\" \"...

It's like the incarnation of his twisted desire.\" (with Lash) Hawke: \"Lash. I'm sorry. I have mistreated you. Had I not strong armed you into this... you would not have been called a traitor. I made excuses. Used you to my own end, so that I could continue to live.\" Lash: \"Aw, that's OK. Don't worry about it. I wouldn't be doing all this if I didn't like it, ya' know? I'm not an easy chick to push around... I only do what I want to do. And I'm here now because I want to fight with you... So let's fight!Von Bolt  Von Bolt (Japanese: \u30d8\u30eb\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8, Hell-Bolt) is a Black Hole CO. He began as an elderly CO from the countryside who somehow managed to escape from the nursing home. After Sturm's defeat in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising he became the leader of Black Hole. He is the creator and leader of the Bolt Guard, whom he favours over the other Black Hole COs. His first and only appearance to date is in Advance Wars: Dual Strike where he is the main villain. Just like his predecessor Sturm, he is defeated by the Allied Nations. Unlike Sturm however, his goal was immortality. Above all he feared his own death and sought to prevent it at any cost. His goal was to use his Black Crystals to steal the lifeforce of the earth itself, and use it to keep himself alive. His chair contains technology designed to prolong his life indefinitely, though it requires a power supply. He also created the Oozium 238 as a means of defeating those who opposed him. He profoundly hates young people (that should cover all of the Allied Nation's COs!), which is apparent after he complains about Jake's \"hipster slang\". He was defeated by the Allied Nations who, along with Hawke and Lash, fought a long campaign against him. At the end of it all Hawke shot his chair and used its remaining stored energy to heal the land. Faced with his own mortality and without his chair to sustain him, he presumably died shortly afterwards. However, you can choose to have Jake shoot the chair instead, after which, Von Bolt is forced to pay for his crimes, even if it's just \"sweeping the streets\", to quote Jake.CO powers  Von Bolt's units receive a constant 10% boost in firepower and 10% boost in defense.Normal CO power  None.Super CO power  Ex Machina - Deals three damage and immobilizes all units (for one turn) within a 5X5 area. Where the lightning bolt strikes is determined by an algorithm that is based on where it would likely cause the most harm.Tactics  Von Bolt lacks a CO Power and his Super CO Power is a bit pricy (at 10 power meter stars) for what you get out of it. However, his superior day to day abilities alone make him a viable CO and they cannot be underestimated. Stats of 110/110 for all units is significant. That's an overall net +20% boost with no downsides. Most CO's receive an overall weaker net boost (i.e. Hawke), receive a net 20% boost only in specialized areas (i.e. Eagle/Jess/Drake), have a downside that comes attached to their boosts (i.e. Grimm, Kanbei) or don't even have a daily boost at all (i.e. Adder, Andy). Ex Machina deals area damage of 3 HP per unit to a 13-square area, targeting the greatest concentration of enemy funds. This area attack damages enemy and friendly units alike; however, enemy units are paralyzed for one turn. It varies on its usefulness. If it's used within attacking range of your units, it means that enemy units are vulnerable to being destroyed and cannot escape. But even if it's used far away from your units, it still causes financial damage to the opponent and hurts their mobility. However, if the opponent has mostly weaker units that are spread out over a wide area, Ex Machina is not very effective considering how long it takes for it to charge.Tags  ALL Allied Nations COs: 90%Quotes  Switch \"Hehh hh hhh!

She is one of the first CO's played in the games, debuting in the eighth mission of the first game.Personality  Sami is pretty calm and lively most of the time, sporting a somewhat \"happy-go-lucky\" attitude, similar to Andy. However, she is not one to be crossed with, and can easily get angry in the right situation. This is best shown when fighting Sonja in Advance Wars, where she almost goes berserk on Andy for being tricked so easily. She's also outspoken and doesn't hesitate to be rude when angry, as shown in Advance Wars 2, where she is cornered by Adder, who tries talking her into surrendering. Her response is shown to be quite \"inappropriate\", to the point that one of Green Earth's soldiers doesn't feel \"comfortable\" reading it out loud, and Eagle starts laughing upon reading it. Sami also seems to be a bit of a suck up to her superiors (specifically Nell), as noted by Andy. Despite all this, she is shown to be caring of those close to her, like in Advance Wars when she refuses to leave Eagle behind to fend off Sturm's forces, or in her talk with Eagle before the final mission of Advance Wars Dual Strike, where she refuses to accept Eagle's promise in the case he dies, stating that making a promise like that means one of them will most certainly die.CO ability summary  She is a graduate of special-forces training, giving Infantry and Mech units an extra firepower boost when under her command.Advance Wars CO abilities  Infantry and Mech units get a 20% firepower boost and a 10% defense boost. As well as a firepower boost, all of her foot soldiers capture at a rate of 150%, always rounded down. This means an unhurt Infantry will reduce a property's capture number by 15 points instead of 10, and an Infantry with 6 hp will reduce a property's capture number by 9 rather than 6. In comparison to her special-forces when measured against generic 100/100 stats, her non-infantry Direct Combat units are slightly below average. Sami's Indirect Combat units are equal to the generic stats. Transports have an extra space of movement.CO power  Double Time - Increases movement range and firepower of Infantry and Mech units by one space and 50% respectively. Has the shortest charge meter in the game.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising Storyline significance  Sami returns in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising as a well-trained and intelligent special-forces commander. After successfully liberating Orange Star with the help of her comrades, she later makes cameo appearances in other missions later in the Campaign.CO abilities  Infantry and Mech units receive a 30% firepower bonus and capture 1.5x on a daily basis. Sami's indirect capabilities and deployment costs are equal to normal stats, while non-infantry direct units suffer from a slight firepower reduction of 10%. All transport units boast +1 movement. The in-game description also states her foot soldiers move farther, though this is not the case.CO power  Double Time - Increases movement range by one for all Infantry and Mechs, and their firepower is raised to 150%. All units receive a +10% defense bonus.Super CO power  Victory March - Increases movement range of Infantry and Mech units by two spaces. All foot soldiers have 180% firepower, and allows any such unit to be able to completely capture any unallied property in one turn, regardless of unit health.Advance Wars: Dual Strike Storyline significance  Sami again returns in Advance Wars: Dual Strike, offering aid to Omega Land late into the war. She plays a significantly smaller role in the Campaign's plot, though her personality and abilities remain somewhat intact.CO abilities  All Infantry and Mech units have 120% firepower, reduced to their original levels in Advance Wars.\u00a0Non-infantry Direct Combat units retain their small firepower reduction of 10%. Foot soldiers still capture at 150%. However, her transport unit movement bonus has been removed.CO power  Double Time - Increases movement range by one for all Infantry and Mechs by 1 space, and their firepower is raised to 160%. They also receive a +10% defence bonus. All other Units get a 10% boost in firepower and defence.Super CO power  Victory March - Increases movement range of Infantry and Mech units by 2 spaces. All foot soldiers have 190% firepower and may capture in one turn, regardless of HP.Tag Breaks  Sami has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Quotes Dual Strike  Switch \"Leave it to me. I'll work something out.\" \"Roger! Advance to the front lines!\" Power \"Hooya!\" \"A commando never gives up!\" Campaign, Pre-Battle Final Battle \"Yowza! I wonder what that gigantic oozium is going to do to us.\" (with Eagle) Eagle: \"I want you to promise me something, Sami. Promise that if we both return from this battle alive...\" Sami: \"Oh no you don't! Stop it right there! If two people make a promise like that, one of them is going to end up dead! You might as well tell me that you're two days away from retirement! Save the promises for later, OK? We'll talk when we get back in one piece.\" (with Sonja) Sami: \"Fiddlesticks! This will be it for the Omega Land war! I mean, I'm glad for peace and all... But I have homework to catch up on! Hey, Sonja? Teach me math again, OK?\" Sonja: \"You're insanely confident at a time like this. It's funny... but I feel the same. Calm. Completely at ease. I feel like there's no way I can lose if I team up with you! We're going to win!\" Victory \"Area secured!\" (with Eagle) Eagle: \"Our victory is secured.\" \n Sami: \"Ha! That's my Eagle!\" (with Sonja) Sonja: Our chemistry is fantastic. \n Sami: Well, we go back a long. I'm sure that helps. Sami: Don't ignore us because we're girls! \n Sonja: Our team is second to none.Trivia Tactics  Sami strategies usually evolve around gaining an economic advantage through her superior capture rate. In the early game, when both sides are attempting to gain sources of funding by capturing cities, Sami's 150% capture rate allows her infantry to capture property even under attack from enemy infantry or tanks, as most early units cannot reduce her infantry below 4 HP (the threshold to prevent a two-turn capture) by themselves. Meanwhile, her powerful infantry can severely disrupt enemy infantry during the capture-phase. Likewise, Victory March can often turn the tide for Sami by giving her a funding advantage that will last at least two turns even in the ideal scenario for the opponent--the opponent must have a 10 HP infantry within capturing range of the lost city and it must not be attacked and can capture an HQ in that turn with any one infantry as long as there aren't any units on the HQ.Eagle  Eagle (Japanese: \u30a4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb) is the commander-in-chief of Green Earth. He is a playable CO in every Advance Wars game except Advance Wars: Days of Ruin. He debuts in the first game as one of the primary antagonists, but later becomes a powerful ally against Sturm. Eagle first joined the Air Force in honor of his father, likewise an Air Force officer. He is the leader of Green Earth, and is held in high regard by the citizenry. Despite the fact that Drake is almost his polar opposite, the two are steadfast friends. He often argues with Jess about how to defend their homeland, and will forever hold a grudge against Hawke for his role in the invasion of Green Earth during the events of Black Hole Rising. He sees Andy as his main rival as a result of their battles during the original Advance Wars, when a clone of Andy was used to frame Orange Star for Sturm's attacks on Green Earth. Over the course of the three games that he was involved in, he has developed a strong relationship with Sami of Orange Star.CO Ability Summary  Eagle\u00a0receives a 20% firepower boost with Air Units (15% in Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2). In addition, his air units burn two less fuel per turn. However, his Naval Units are 10% weaker than the baseline. His Land Units have no special bonuses or penalties. In Advance Wars: Dual Strike, Eagle's powers in general allow his units to move again. His CO power, Lightning Drive, imposes an offensive penalty on the second move. His Super CO power, Lightning Strike, boosts both offense and defense in addition to the additional turn.Advance Wars Storyline Significance  Eagle begins the game as a recurring antagonist. As the player, in control of Andy and the Orange Star forces, fights their way through Blue Moon and Yellow Comet, Eagle harasses them on occasion. He appears to hold a grudge against Andy. Once Orange Star's military reaches Green Earth, Eagle reveals the reason for his grudge: Andy was seen leading an army of Orange Star troops on a sneak attack into Green Earth's territory, killing many of Eagle's men. Eventually, it is revealed that the \"Andy\" that Eagle saw was actually a clone created by Sturm, and Eagle joins forces with Orange Star. He begins to see Andy in a new light, as more of a worthy opponent than an enemy to be destroyed, and by the end of the game the two are more \"friendly rivals\" than enemies.CO Abilities  Eagle is a specialist with air units, granting them higher firepower and greater fuel efficiency. All ground units are standard, while naval units suffer from a crippling reduction in power.CO power - Lightning Strike  Allows all of his non-infantry Units that have already moved to move again at the cost of reduced attack and defense.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising Storyline Significance  Eagle alongside Drake and Jess battles against Hawke during Black Hole's attempted takeover of Green Earth.CO Abilities  Eagle's air units receive a 15% attack bonus and a 10% defence bonus. His naval units suffer from a 30% attack penalty.CO Power - Lightning Drive  Increases the attack and defence of his Air Units by 15% and 20% respectively.Super CO power - Lightning Strike  All non-infantry units may move again. His air units have 130% attack and defense. All other units have 110% defense.Advance Wars: Dual Strike Storyline Significance  After the Black Obelisk is destroyed and Black Hole mounts a counterattack, Eagle is one of the Macro Land COs who arrive to reinforce the Allied Nations troops in Omega Land, along with Grit, Sami, and Sonja.CO Abilities  All Eagle's flying units have 120% attack, but his naval units have 90%. His air units use 2 less fuel each day compared the baseline.CO power: Lightning Drive  All his non-infantry units can move and attack again, but their firepower is reduced. Aircraft attack at 70%, vehicles at 60%, naval units at 55%. Standard 10% boost to attack and defense is applied to units moving for the first time.Super CO power: Lightning Strike  All non-infantry units may move for a second time. All his units receive the standard 10% bonus to attack and defense.Tag Breaks  Eagle has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  Eagle is good for campaign missions and War Room maps with Airports in them. In competitive play, him having strong B-Copters is good and naval units aren't used much, so he has no real weaknesses. If Eagle players grab bombers though, the game is pretty much settled. Eagle has one of the largest power meters in the game, equal to Hawke's and only 1 star less than Sturm's and Von Bolt's. However, his Super CO Power is very much well worth it. It essentially lets you repeat your entire turn. You can move twice and attack twice (Cannot move Infantry twice unfortunately). This is extremely useful when attempting to take down indirects, seeing as the opponent will often try using infantry or Weakened vehicles to stall your own troops to take a few shots with their indirects and damage your land vehicles. While his regular CO Power has a firepower penalty, for only 3 stars, it's an incredible deal. Even with the reduction in effect, your high HP units should be able to take out the enemy's damaged units much of the time. Another benefit to both of his powers is that you can use the extra movement to retreat as well. You can attack the opponent recklessly and then use either of the two powers move your units into a position where they can't be fired at. Sometimes air units rarely enter into play in Advance Wars, so therefore Eagle must rely on his powers to gain an advantage over his opponents. Fortunately for Eagle players, the ability to take a double turn after a while or during a major push is extremely powerful even when it applies only to non-infantry units, as it equates essentially to the largest attack and movement boosts in the game by far. This means that his Super CO power can often win the game outright by giving the Eagle player insurmountable material (unit count and strength) and positional advantages. Meanwhile his CO power creates opportunities for the Eagle player to employ hit-and-run tactics, attacking with his direct units and withdrawing from the range of enemy indirects, or to overwhelm his opponent numerically by doubling unit production on turns where the CO power is invoked. For all the reasons mentioned above, Eagle is one of the better CO's in the series.Quotes Black Hole Rising  Power \"The Eagle soars above you!\" \"I have no interest in underlings. Begone!\" \"All units, ready for attack! Don't even give them time for regret!\" \"Speed is the lifeblood of battle!\" \"Do you think you can keep up?\" \"Heh heh... Impressive!\" You had almost overtaken me. Almost!\" Victory \"Another victory! Was there ever any doubt!\"Dual Strike  Power \"Maybe you're not so bad after all...\" \"You're not even worth my time!\" \"Checkmate!\" \"Death from above!\" \"Fear the skys!\" Switch \"You're wasting my time.\" \"This ends here and now.\" Campaign, Pre-Battle Final Battle \"Humph! I don't like this at all! That thing is giving me the willies! (with Sami) Eagle: \"I want you to promise me something, Sami. Promise that if we both return from this battle alive...\" Sami: \"Oh no you don't! Stop it right there! If two people make a promise like that, one of them is going to end up dead! You might as well tell me that you're two days away from retirement! Save the promises for later, OK? We'll talk when we get back in one piece.\"Trivia Nell  Nell (Japanese: \u30ad\u30e3\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3 Catherine) is an Orange Star CO. She is also the player's instructor in field training and assists the player in Campaign by giving hints and strategical advice. Her little sister Rachel takes Nell's place as the player's advisor in Advance Wars: Dual Strike. Nell attended military school with Grit and Max.Physical Appearance  Nell looks like a typical womanly businesswoman. She has wavy blonde hair, violet eyes, pink lips and pale peach skin. She wears a bright purple business suit and bright purple heels. She also has a mole on the left side of her face, near her left eye. Nell also has another outfit which is unlockable in Advance Wars: Dual Strike. Instead of wavy hair, her hair appears straighter. She wears a bright purple headband, gold earrings, a gold necklace and gold-colored strappy sandals. Also, instead of a bright purple business suit, she wears a bright purple dress with layered frills at the bottom. Despite all these changes, her facial features and skin color remain the same. (See gallery below for an image of this outfit).CO abilities  Nell was born under a lucky star, giving her units a Luck bonus of 15% instead of the standard 10%.CO power  Lucky Star - Increase Nell's Luck to 60%. All of her units also get a 10% boost in defence, and in Advance Wars: Dual Strike they also get 10% boost in offence. Interestingly, in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising her units are stated to damage multiple foes, though nothing of this sort ever actually happens.Super CO power  Lady Luck - Raises Nell's Luck to 100%. All of her units also get a 10% boost in defence, and in Advance Wars: Dual Strike they also get 10% boost in offence. Interestingly, the in-game info of Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising states her units to damage multiple foes, though nothing of this sort ever happens. Fair Warning:\u00a0Bear in mind, luck is still luck. That damage counter may actually be right, and that could spell the end of your brave little recon.Tag Breaks  Nell has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  Of the 3 luck-based CO's (herself, Jugger and Flak), is it generally understood that Nell is the best because she is capable of inflicting lots of additional damage via luck, but does not suffer from any potential damage output penalty. Her daily ability also allows her units to inflict 1 or 2 additional damage. Keep in mind that this a damage buff and not merely a firepower buff, so regardless of the enemy unit's defense, your unit can still damage it. Many players have deemed her a powerful CO due to her ability to possibly kill a Megatank with an Infantry during her Super CO Power, but she does have weaknesses which are often ignored.. The issue with CO Powers that are based on combat is that they are situational. If your Super CO Power becomes active during a turn when there's not many enemy units to attack at the moment, you'll get a mediocre outcome if you use it immediately and your opponent will be a turn ahead of you (in terms of charging their power meter). The fact that her powers are luck-based, makes them even less reliable.Quotes Dual Strike  Power \"Don't hate me just because I'm lucky!\" \"Pull together, everyone!\" \"Everything will work out!\" \"This will bring me luck!\" Victory Ha! Too bad for you! ...And that's how it's done. (With Rachel) Rachel: \"Not bad, huh, Sis? Whooo! Yeah! We rule! Yeah!\"\n Nell: \"Excitable, aren't you?\" Nell: \"Huh. We won. Lucky us.\"\n Rachel: \"Don't be such a downer, Nell. Smiling won't kill you!\"Trivia Grit  Grit (Japanese: \u30d3\u30ea\u30fc, Billy) is a Blue Moon CO. He appears in the first three Advance Wars Games and is an Indirect attack specialist. Although he generally displays a laid back personality and is quite lazy \u2014often leaving him at odds with his more serious-minded superior Olaf\u2014 he is rather intelligent, working on occasion with Sonja behind the scene. He also went to school with Nell and Max.Personality  Grit is shown to be extremely calm, always slacking off and napping in the middle of work. However, unlike most other COs believe, Grit is much smarter than he looks. He, alongside Sonja, is one of the first to notice something's not right in Advance Wars. In Advance Wars 2, when talking to Colin, he explains that being relaxed and careless aren't the same thing, as being too anxious can result in making a mistake, which is probably why he always sports a calm atitude. Although he is a CO, Grit is shown to not really care about countries or wars, and doesn't really care what country he serves. However, when talking to Adder in Advance Wars 2, he states that Adder is his number 1 enemy because of the way he treats the people, showing he cares more for the common man than he does anything else.Advance Wars  Grit appears as the second Blue Moon CO fought by Orange Star, he is ordered to halt Orange Star's forces from advancing further into Blue Moon territory. He criticizes Olaf and the war, stating that much of the Blue Moon territory he is defending had been seized from Orange Star to begin with. He fights Andy twice and is revealed by Nell to have formerly been from Orange Star. Later on, he is angrily confronted by Max for his betrayal and beaten. Nell assumes Grit left Orange Star after realizing that Max had feelings for her and wished not to get in the way. He says it was not his real reason but assures her his true reasons are good. He is later revealed to be working alongside Sonja of Yellow Comet to find the mastermind of the conflicts that have engulfed Wars World. He joined Blue Moon to discover who had been manipulating Olaf. With the defeat of Sturm and the end of the conflict, Grit no longer has a reason to stay in Blue Moon. Despite this, he decides to stay and help Olaf rebuild.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising  In mission 10, \"Tanks!!!\", Adder proposes an offer to Grit to join the Black Hole Army, because he sees Blue Moon as a waste of his abilities. Grit, who is disgusted by Adder's ways of treating people, defeats him, ignoring the offer. Grit also declares him to be his number-one enemy.CO abilities  In Advance Wars the range of his Indirect Combat units is increased by 1 and his Infantry, Mechs, and Direct Combat units have 80% firepower. In Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising and Advance Wars: Dual Strike, the range of his Indirect Combat units is increased by 1 and they have 120% firepower. His non-infantry Direct Combat units have only 80% firepower, however.CO power  Snipe Attack - Increases the range of all of Grit's Indirect Combat Units by 1, as well as increasing their firepower to 150%(160% in Dual Strike) and defence of all units to 110%.Super CO power  Super Snipe - Increases the range of all of Grit's Indirect Combat Units by 2, as well as increasing their firepower to 150%(160% in Dual Strike) and defence of all units to 110%.Tag Breaks  Grit has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  With Grit, your best bet is to focus on deploying indirect units. Due to his increased range, his Artillery's are very threatening because they are like Rockets but for less than half of the price. His Rockets essentially become like Battleships. Grit is best used defensively in maps with chokepoints (narrow areas). He also excels in certain campaign missions with lots of pre-deployed indirects such as Ring of Fire and Verdant Hills (Hard Campaign) Initially, many people thought Grit was one of the most powerful CO's in Dual Strike. Gipface, a competitive Advance Wars player with the highest recorded rank in Days of Ruin, has written at length about Grit's weaknesses and why he thinks Grit is actually the worst CO in the game. Grit suffers from the following disadvantages in Dual Strike:Quotes Dual Strike  Change \"...Hm? Oh sorry, I spaced out there.\" \"Keep y'all distance, or you might get hurt.\" Power \"Aw, shucks. I was hopin' it wouldn't come to this...\" \"Let's do some target practice!\" \"Y'all leave me no choice. Time to bring out the big guns!\" Campaign, Pre-Battle Final Battle \"Well, shoot! This'll be one heck of a story for old man Olaf.\" (with Max) Grit: \"Evenin' Max. You know, we go back a dog's year... and we ain't gonna end it in a place like this! Don't you be doing anything crazy now, you hear?! Aw, shucks... I'm wastin' my breath.\" Max: \"Ha ha! You know me too well, my man! Listen, Grit. Stopping and thinking just isn't in my nature. I only push ahead! I'll trust you to watch my back!\" Victory \"I wait like a snake in the grass... then I strike!\" \"I hope they don't come any tougher. That was harder than college!\" (With Olaf) Grit: \"Hey, if you want to fight the next one, I'll just nap...\"\n Olaf: \"Grit, you little..!\" Olaf: \"Oh, Blue Moon! My home and native land!\" Grit: \"Does he always have to sing?\"Trivia Notes  Although originally an Orange Star CO, he changed to Blue Moon shortly before the start of the first game, due to Orange Star's attempted invasion of his hometown. Later on, Olaf attacked his hometown as well. Grit held him off, with a few indirect combat units and a Recon. Olaf was so impressed, he made Grit a Blue Moon CO.Andy  Andy (Japanese: \u30ea\u30e7\u30a6 Ryo) is an Orange Star CO. He appears in the first three games. He is the protagonist of the first two games. In the Campaign of Advance Wars: Dual Strike, however, he is not seen at all. Although he is mentioned in Mission 2, Mission 3, and you fight his clone in Mission 26.Advance Wars  Andy is first introduced at the start of the normal Campaign and is the first controllable CO. He first becomes playable in mission one against Olaf, who seems to attack for no reason. Shortly afterwards he meets Grit and Eagle. After defending the first country, Orange Star, Andy and his new partner, Max, move into Blue Moon to find out why they were attacked. They find no answers in Blue Moon, so they travel through Yellow Comet and are stopped by Kanbei. After beating Kanbei (and if you beat him quick enough Sonja) in some fairly difficult missions, they move into Green Earth, where they run into Eagle and Drake. Halfway through Green Earth it seems that there is more going on than meets the eye. These thoughts are confirmed when they move into Black Hole and run into Clone Andy and Sturm. During the final battle he ignores Sonja's warnings, determined to defeat the one that hurt her. By the end Andy and Eagle become friendly rivals instead of enemies.CO abilities  Andy has no advantages or disadvantages. As Mister Average, Andy's units are the standard by which other COs' units are measured.CO power  Hyper Repair - Restores 2 HP to all of his Units and increases their defense by 10% (And offense by 10% in Dual Strike).Super CO power  Hyper Upgrade - Restores 5 HP to all of his Units, increases firepower by 20%, defense by 10%, and movement by 1 space. In Advance Wars: Dual Strike',' firepower increases by 30% instead.Tag Breaks  Andy has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  He has no day to day abilities, which means he has no weakness but also no strength. His regular CO Power, at 3 stars, is pricy for what you get, unless you have lots of expensive units that are damaged. His Super CO Power, however, is very strong and Andy is a viable CO for that reason alone. Healing all units by 5HP makes most of your damaged units able to fight full health enemy units again. For this reason, the player should retreat their damage units and save them for later, when the Super CO Power can be activated. The opponent should try to destroy Andy's units outright (and not let them survive) if they want to avoid being ovewhelmed by this power. The firepower boost, buffed even stronger in Advance Wars, on top of the +1 movement boost, gives him an advantage in almost any situation (for that turn). Andy is a great counter to damage CO's (such as Rachel, Olaf and Drake). However, a player using a damage CO will often wait until Andy has used his Super CO Power already before using theirs.Quotes Dual Strike  Changing CO During Battle \"It's my turn now!\" \"Time to roll up my sleeves!\" Power \"I've got parts to spare!\" \"I'm not giving up!\" \"Time to roll up my sleeves!\" \"I haven't even cranked the engine yet!\" Victory (with Max) Max: \"I'll crush all enemies!\"\n Andy: \"And I'll fix all allies!\" Andy: \"Let's do it, Max!\"\n Max: \"Yeah! We'll break their lines like toothpicks!\" Andy: \"If it's a tag battle...\"\n Max: \"We're the best!\" (with Hawke) Andy: \"We won! Wahoo!\" Hawke: \"Impressive, I can see why you beat me last time..\" Hawke: \"All too easy.\" Andy: \"You call that easy?\" Hawke: \"Perhaps you should join Black Ho--no, Never mind.\" Andy: \"What? Come on, what? Now it's going to bug me.\" Andy: \"Hey, we're friends now! Come on, let's shake!\" Hawke: \"Err...No. Trusting is hard.\"Tactics  Not having a Day-to-Day advantage or disadvantage means the Andy player is encouraged to be flexible in tactics and strategy. Unlike some CO powers, which are only useful in certain situations, Andy\u2019s power is useful on almost any map. Andy's Super CO power is vastly superior, meaning his CO power should almost never be used.Orange Star  Orange Star, known as Red Star (\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc) in Japanese iterations, is one of the five main forces of Wars World. It is featured in all installments of the series, with the exception of Advance Wars: Days of Ruin/Dark Conflict. In all games it is the first country playable in Campaign mode. They are also a member of the Allied Nations. Also, they have the second highest number of COs, after Black Hole. The other three Allied Nations factions have 4 COs currently, but Orange Star has seven (not including Super Famicom Wars' Yuan Delta). With the exception of Jake, the forces of Orange Star is direct warfare, excelling in frontal assaults.COs  Orange Star's Commanding Officers are:Former COs Trivia Lash  Lash (Japanese: \u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8 Cat) is a Commanding Officer in the Black Hole Army who first appears in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. She is a technological genius and is responsible for the majority of the advancements in military technology throughout the series. Flak, a fellow Black Hole CO, is often the target of her many experiments and a guinea pig to test out many of her designs. She ranks above Flak but below Adder. Though no mention is made of her past, it is certain Lash has spent most her time tinkering and inventing devices of warfare. Outwardly, Lash\u2019s demeanor is particularly childish and socially underdeveloped. Lash takes a special interest in Sonja, claiming they both \u201cfeel the joy that war brings\u201c. On the battlefield Lash has a devil may care attitude towards each fight, concerned more with 'playing games\u2019 than the lives involved. She cares little for battles where there is not much fun to be had; in \"Reclamation\" she prepared to withdraw her forces before the battle even began, simply because she thought that\u00a0Colin wouldn't be any fun to fight. She seems to revel in destruction and mayhem, viewing the outside world as a place to test her creations; and as an antagonist equally brash and incorrigible. In the \"Toy Box\" mission in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, she is responsible for destroying Olaf\u2018s home town. In Dual Strike, a form of character development occurs for Lash/Kat during the mission \u201cMuck Amok\u201d, she and Hawke leave the Black Hole Army. After Von Bolt is confronted by Hawke, the order is passed to have them executed. They are saved by the Allied Nations who allow the two to join their ranks and stop Von Bolt. Shortly afterwards, a reference is made towards \u2019socializing\u2019 Lash when Jess declares, \u201cThis is a good opportunity for me to teach you some table manners\u201c. Another subtle hint made during the epilogue suggests that a change is happening in her personality when she declares, \u201cWell, I guess I do care a little bit\u2026 \u201d.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising CO abilities  Each terrain defense star will add 10% to her units' attack power, excluding Air Units since they don't get terrain benefits.CO power  Terrain Tactics - Terrain movement penalties are reduced to 1 for all units, ignoring bad weather (except snowfall), and all units gain +10% defense.Super CO power  Prime Tactics - Terrain movement penalties are reduced to 1 for all units, ignoring bad weather (except snowfall). Terrain defense stars are doubled, allowing ground and naval units to have improved firepower and defense. Units also gain additional +10% defense.Advance Wars: Dual Strike CO abilities  Each defensive star will add 5% to her Units' attack power, excluding Air Units, since they don't get terrain benefits.CO power  Terrain Tactics - Units only use 1 movement point per square. They also get a 10% bonus to offence and defense.Super CO power  Prime Tactics - Terrain movement penalties are reduced to one, Units gain +10% to attack and defense and double Terrain starsTag Breaks  Lash has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  In Advance Wars 2, Lash was one of the strongest CO's. On a daily basis, units were 110/110 on Plains, 120/120 on Woods, 130/130 on Cities, and 140/140 on Mountains/HQ. These bonuses are doubled during the Super CO Power. However, in Dual Strike, she became one of the weaker CO's when her offensive terrain boosts are halved. This means that, on average, her stat boosts are weaker than other CO's which also powers which boost stats.Quotes Black Hole Rising  Power \"Can you survive my attack?\" \"Tee hee! C'mon!

Wow, you're a genius!\"Advance Wars: Dual Strike  Advance Wars: Dual Strike, known as Famicom Wars DS in Japan, is the third game in Advance Wars; a continuation of the Famicom Wars series; and the first on the Nintendo DS. It is set in Omega Land, and as usual, features several new features, most predominately the ability to play two COs at once.Plot  Advance Wars: Dual Strike stars two new characters: Jake, and Rachel (Jake's advisor). These are the primary protagonists of Dual Strike and members of the Orange Star Army, and are accompanied by several other new protagonists, including Sasha, Grimm, and Javier, members of the Blue Moon, Yellow Comet, and Green Earth Armies respectively. The Black Hole Army has returned under a new commander, Von Bolt. He is accompanied by his Bolt Guard: Jugger, Koal, and Kindle, along with Hawke and Lash from the original Black Hole Army. Using a new technology called a Black Obelisk, Von Bolt is draining Omega Land of its energy to give him eternal life, and is also starting to use this power to produce a bio-weapon named Oozium 238, a strange slime-based monster that devours anything in its path. However, Hawke notices the energy draining (which also is turning Omega Land into a desert) and questions its use. After uncovering Von Bolt's plot, Hawke is betrayed and Von Bolt attempts to swarm Hawke and Lash with Oozium 238. After the Allied Nations\u2019 COs save Hawke and Lash, the COs, along with Hawke and Lash, begin to turn the tide against the Black Hole Army. Both Hawke and Lash provide valuable intelligence of the Black Hole weaponry and its plans for Omega Land. With this information, the Allied Nations slowly corner the Black Hole Army, leading to a battle in the middle of the Crimson Sea. After destroying the last Black Obelisk, the Allied Nations proceed to the final battle where they fight Von Bolt and a giant oozium known as the Grand Bolt. After destroying the Grand Bolt, Hawke (or Jake, based on the player's decision) destroys Von Bolt's life support chair, supposedly causing both Hawke and Von Bolt to die in the aftermath. With the Black Obelisks gone, Omega Land begins returning to normal. However, Hawke is revealed to have stolen Von Bolt's chair and escaped, leaving Von Bolt either dead or barely alive.Gameplay  Gameplay in Dual Strike is relatively unchanged from the first two Advance Wars titles. The player takes the role as a CO of an army (more often than not, the Orange Star Army). The player moves the army across a 2D tactical map. If able, the player can then attack an enemy unit, capture a base, or other different actions. To win a battle, usually the player must either eliminate all of the enemy troops, or capture the enemy's base (certain maps have different objectives, however). Troops vary in strength, movement, and attacking style. Infantry, for example, can capture bases, but are fairly weak, while Rocket Launchers can hit units from far away, but are defenseless in a head-to-head battle. Terrain also effects the gameplay. While the main terrain is plains, there are also cities, forests, mountains, and other usual geographical features. Depending on terrain, the gameplay shifts slightly. Forests, for example, offer better defense, but are hard to navigate through. COs (commanding officers) also have different tactics. COs offer different strengths and weaknesses. Colin, a Blue Moon CO, can buy units cheap, but at the cost of weak firepower. While Sonja, a Yellow Comet CO, can keep the number of units left in a group a secret, and has one more space of vision in fog of war. New in Dual Strike are Tag-team battles. In certain battles, a player can pick two COs to lead one army, alternating at request. Once both power meters are filled, they can launch Tag Power. Here, the leading CO gets the added boost of a Super CO power. Once the first CO is done, instead of ending a turn, the player changes CO. Once this happens, units may move again, now with the benefits of the second CO. Depending on the CO, the player may get an extra boost. Pairings usually happen between either very close family of friends (Sonja and Kanbei, Colin and Sasha, etc.), or between COs of different tactics (Max and Grit, Eagle and Drake).Sasha General  Sasha (Japanese: \u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3) is a Blue Moon CO and the older sister of Colin. She's normally ladylike, but becomes daring when she gets angry. Being the heiress to a vast fortune, she gets extra Funds from bases under her control. She has no weaknesses (or strengths, for that matter). She often watches over Colin, ensuring that his worry doesn't get too out of hand (but does come across as both domineering and heavy-handed with Colin). Also appears to have a thing for Jake in Dual Strike.CO abilities  Sasha gains additional 100 Funds from each property under her control.CO power  Market Crash - Reduces the enemy CO's Power Meter by approximately 10% for every 5000 War Funds she has and gets a 10% boost to attack/defense.Super CO power  War Bonds - Turns 50% of the damage Sasha's units deal into War Funds, and gets a 10% boost to attack/defense.Tag Breaks  Sasha has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  In the Campaign Mode (both Normal and Hard), she is one of the best CO's to use since her CO Power can shut down enemy Tag Breaks by herself while your other CO's in the missions are free to use theirs. Eventually the enemy will be able to use their powers, but by then, the player will have gained a tactical advantage. In a 1 vs. 1 battle, she is one of the worst CO's. Her CO Power reduces the power of the enemy CO's meter, but using your CO Power also reduces your meter by 2 stars. Thus, you are essentially using up your power meter to reduce the opponent\u2019s power meter. Her Super CO Power is situational since there may not be many opportunities to inflict damage during the moment it becomes active. You can delay using it until a better moment, but each turn you wait allows the enemy to charge their own power meter faster than you. On the upside, the slight income boost does allow you to be the first player with a Tank on the field (giving you a slight early advantage). If you are playing a tag battle, she can be used very effectively with Colin. Sasha\u2019s power will allow you to gain lots of funds, which can then be used to greatly increase the firepower of your units during Colin\u2019s power. In addition, the pair will gain a 30% firepower boost when using a tag power together.Quotes Dual Strike  Switch \"I won't back down!\" \"You won't like... what I'm about to do.\" Power \"You've made me very very... upset.\" \"I'll keep fighting until peace is restored.\" \"I won't go easy on you!\" Campaign, Pre-Battle Final Battle \"I sense something... terrible... but I must put that feeling aside!\" (with Colin) Sasha: \"Don't push yourself too much, Colin. I need you to come home alive.\" Colin: \"I know, Sis. I want you to be safe, too. We'll go home together!\" Victory (with Colin) Sasha: \"Say something clever, Colin. Colin: \"Um... Don't mess with the best! Oh, that was lame.\" Colin: \"H-how was that sis? Sasha: \"Meh. Good. Not great. I can do better.\" Sasha: \"Our sibling bond is unbreakable!\" Colin: \"Yepp, that's why we're the best!\"Tactics  Sasha's primary strategy is to outfund (and thus outbuild) the other guy. Spamming her normal CO power will allow her to foil enemy CO powers. As she slows down, she should still have the ability to block SCOPs.Rachel General  Rachel (Japanese: \u30ec\u30a4\u30c1\u30a7\u30eb Rachel)\u00a0is a young Orange Star CO. She strives to follow in the footsteps of her older sister, Nell. Her Units are hardworking which allows her units to increase base repairs. She also takes Nell's place as the player's advisor in Advance Wars: Dual Strike. In the game, she appears as the first CO the player fights in the game before Jugger.CO abilities  Her base repairs are increased by 1 (due to the hardworking nature of the logistics team), so her troops can recover up to 3 HP of damage each turn.CO power  Lucky Lass - Rachel finds a penny on the floor or something, which increases her\u00a0Luck, allowing her to do up to 40% more damage. Additionally, her units get +10% to offence and defense.Super CO power  Covering Fire - Fires three missiles from the Omega Land HQ at enemy targets. Also raises her units' offence and defense by 10%. The missiles target as follows:Tag Breaks  Rachel has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  Rachel's day to day repair ability is insignificant and she doesn't have any stat boosts (aside from her CO Power, which often goes unused). However, her Super CO Power is one of the very best powers in the game, and it's so strong that she manages to be one of the better CO's in the game. If two of her three missiles hit the same area, that's essentially like a free Black Bomb for the player (without even having to purchase it or move it into position). In any event, the damage will cause significant financial loss for the opponent and make it easier to topple their units in battle. While it's true that Covering Fire is terrifying when used in smaller maps, it still is highly effective on big maps as well. Rachel excels on almost any map.Quotes Dual Strike  Switch \"Get on the ready line!\" \"Where are you looking? You are fighting ME!\" Campaign, Pre-Battle Final Battle \"We'll win. We'll win and everyone will go home in one piece!\" (with Jake) Rachel: \"You know, none of these missions have ever been easy. Even the early ones. I've cheated death a thousand times, and sometimes I got so scared that I cried... But... You've always been with me. Whether we're on the battlefield or in some meeting...

It was like... having a younger brother.\" Jake: \"Wha? A younger brother...? ...Huh.\" Rachel: \"What, you're not happy with that?\" Jake: \"No, dude, it's fine! Wait, I mean... I don't mean dude... I mean... Oh man, I'm screwing this up...\" Rachel: \"Hee hee! Well then... This will be my last order as your CO... you must make it out of this battle alive! And... Bring your report to my office when you're done... OK?\" Jake: \"...Yeah! Let's do this thing and go home alive!\" Victory (With Nell) Rachel: \"Not bad, huh, Sis? Whooo! Yeah! We rule! Yeah!\"\nNell: \"Excitable, aren't you?\" Nell: \"Huh. We won. Lucky us.\"\nRachel: \"Don't be such a downer, Nell. Smiling won't kill you!\"\u00a0 Rachel: Don't like facing sisters? You're just unlucky!\nNell: Weird... I feel a little guilty.Isabella  Isabella (known as Catleia in the European version of the game) is a CO of the 12th Battalion. She is a young girl, with blue-white hair and pale skin, rescued from a building by Will. She has no memory of who she is, though somehow knows detailed military information. Eventually she grows an attraction to Will which throughout the game becomes more and more apparent. She first appears in Stage 2, \"A Single Life\". She is barely alive, but manages to hold on long enough to get back to camp. There, the heroes (Lin, Brenner, and Will) learn that she is amnesiac, but knows detailed knowledge about the Rubinelle Military. Brenner attempts to give them a safe refuge at a town called Freehaven, but after a few skirmishes with a pack of raiders led by The Beast, Will and the other civilians with Brenner decide to stay with him and the battalion. Isabella got her name when Will finds a plastic flower in some ruins and gives it to her. She remembers what the flower is called; Cattleya Isabella. (In the European release the flower is simply called a catleia). She takes her name from this Will then dubs her Isabella because Cattleya is too hard to pronounce. After Caulder preforms his \"Fear Experiment\", the heroes learn about the virus the Creeping Derengea, or \"The Creeper\". Isabella becomes infected with the virus, since it only affects young people for some reason. Will is frightened and runs from her since he doesn't want to become infected, but is later ashamed of this act and apologizes. The heroes manage to get to a nuclear shelter constructed for Rubinelle's political elite in case of and all-out nuclear war with Lazuria. Interestingly enough, Isabella was the one who told them of its existence. Also, ever since she became infected with The Creeper, she was randomly muttering a ten-digit number; the password needed to get into the shelter. Eventually, the heroes learn who she is: one of the cloned children of Dr. Caulder. This causes the civilian opinion to turn against her. Deeply hurt, she leaves camp and surrenders to Caulder. She is placed in the laboratory on board the Great Owl. Will decides to rescue her, reinforcing the idea that he is experiencing some sort of attraction to her. As he puts it: \"I couldn't care if you came from a mother or a tank!\" When the 12th pursues Caulder to the Nest, she gives the 12th the information needed to destroy the Nest (smash the laser cannons). She has apparently comes to terms with her origins, and wishes to prove that one's origins do not dictate how they turn out.CO Ability  Her CO Ability gives a +10 attack and defense boost to all units, similar to Forsythe, starting at 2-range Her CO Power is Deep Strike, which gives her +2 movement and +2 Range to all units. This is essentially a combination of both Will's and Gage's CO Powers.Strategy  She is currently classified as the top CO in the competitive game. She may not boost the same massive power as all other units, but her versatile selection of units to boost is enough to take down what other CO's don't have for other specific units. In addition, her CO Power can get rid of chokepoints spammed by indirects, capture cities much faster, approach your opponent's units with more range. This places a lot of offensive and defensive pressure to your oppoent when used properly.Against Isabella: Trivia Sonja  Sonja (Japanese: \u30a2\u30b9\u30ab, Asuka) is a Yellow Comet CO. She is the daughter of Kanbei and an intelligence gathering officer. She specializes in intel. Her father is overprotective of her, something that often gets on her nerves. Sonja attended military academy in Orange Star with Sami though this is not mentioned in the English version of the game due to the change in colour of her uniform. She often scolds Sami for slacking in her studies. She also has a rivalry with Lash, seeing as the two are both very intelligent.Abilities  All units have their HP hidden from the enemy (no matter the damage the unit has taken, their HP outside of battle animations will always be represented by a \"?\"). All units can see one space further in Fog of War. Counterattacks are multiplied by 1.5x in Advance Wars 2 - in Advance Wars: Dual Strike, she reduces the terrain stars of her enemies by 1 instead of having better counterattacks, but her other benefits remain. Sonja has bad luck that occasionally reduces attacking power by 10% in Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2, in Advance Wars Dual Strike her bad luck is -5.CO Powers  CO Power - Enhanced Vision: Sonja enables her units to see one space further and into forests and reefs even if they're not adjacent to them. In Advance Wars: Dual Strike, enemy terrain stars are reduced by 2 during this power. Super CO Power - Counter Break: In addition to the effects of Enhanced Vision, Sonja's units now have the first strike while defending (though the animation doesn't show this). It should be noted that units dying will not counterattack, even if they should do it before getting attacked. Enemy terrain stars are reduced by 3 in Dual Strike for the duration of the power.Tag Breaks  Sonja has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  Sonja is the mistress of Fog of War. Outside of fog, one of her biggest benefits is useless, as well as her normal CO power. While her Super CO power is still useful, as well as her hidden HP (although it becomes less useful since it's easier for the opponent to keep track of the damage dealt to your units if he can see all units all the time), her bad luck can seriously complicate playing her life. In Fog of War, however, Sonja is a force to be reckoned with. Her improved vision may not seen impressive, but it can really make a diference in the heat of battle. Her hidden HP can be an unbearable nuisance to the enemy, as it is very hard to keep track of which unit you damaged when she can keep retreating and playing mind games with the opponent. When Sonja uses her normal CO power, she negates the enemy the biggest advantage of playing in Fog of War (the ability to hide your units in forests or reefs), as well as getting even more vision, meaning it becomes nearly impossible to hide your units from her. Her Super CO power makes so you not only won't be able to hide, but also means you can't go on the offensive, as she will demolish your troops if you attack her with the wrong units (for example, normally attacking a full HP Medium Tank with another full HP Medium Tank will result in the opponent losing about 5 HP while you will lose about 3 HP, but attacking a Sonja's full HP Medium Tank with her Super active will most likely result in you losing about 7 HP, since she still has 50% stronger counterattacks). In Dual Strike, she loses her stronger counterattack, but will always take one terrain star away from the opponent, meaning she changes from being an defensive CO to quite an agressive one, with her CO power taking two and her Super CO power taking three. This makes so it's best to always stay on the offensive instead of defensive. Interestingly enough, this new ability also makes so she counters Lash, by taking away her ability to use terrain stars to boost offense. As with the previous games, Sonja is primarily useful in fog of war battles. However, due to her ability to reduce enemy terrain bonuses, she is still worth using in normal battles if the enemy is held up on terrain with high defense bonuses, such as mountains or cities.Quotes Dual Strike  Power \"My brains will beat your brawn!\" \"You are a lot stronger than me but...\" \"Get me some fresh intel, stat!\" \"You can't hide from me!\" Switch \"Cover me!\" \"I'll show you how this is done.\" Campaign, Pre-Battle (Pincer Strike)- (with Lash) Lash: \"I wonder why they don't just make a ton of those cloned COs?

He has appeared in the Campaign mode of Gameboy Wars Advance/Advance Wars and Gameboy Wars Advance 2/Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, but did not make a proper appearance in Famicom Wars DS/Advance Wars: Dual Strike. He is the leader of Blue Moon and specialized in winter combat, hence his CO powers are all winter related. Although his Units are unaffected by Snow, they act as though they are travelling through Snow when Rain is present. Described to be a pompous braggart whose tactical prowess has earned him the respect of his peers and the admiration of his people. He takes his work very seriously, especially when compared to Grit.Advance Wars  Olaf first appears in the original Advance Wars. He is fought immediately in Field Training mode, in which you, the player/Advisor, are teamed up with Nell, up to the first level of the Campaign, which depicts Orange Star CO Andy and the aforementioned player taking back the land that Blue Moon conquered. Players continue to face him in the first part of the campaign, up until the player moves into Yellow Comet territory. The last possible mission to face him is Mission 7, \"Olaf's Sea Strike\". To play this mission, players need to choose Andy's path after beating Mission 3, \"Air Ace\", which leads to Mission 6, \"Olaf's Navy\". If players defeat his entire navy here it will lead to \"Olaf's Sea Strike\". Capturing his HQ instead will lead directly to Mission 8, \"Sami's Debut\". At first it is unclear why Blue Moon attacked Orange Star, but clues are given. After defeating Olaf in Mission 6, \"Blizzard Battle\" (part of Max's path), he states \"Grrr... Not again! He will not be pleased with me if this losing streak continues.\". He then orders Grit to stop Orange Star saying \"I have to go and pay him my respects.\". If beaten in \"Olaf's Sea Strike\", Olaf says the same thing but Grit, instead of just following orders, says: \"Well, well, well... Olaf's finally off to see his mysterious benefactor. Think I'll just tag along behind and see what I can see.\" Olaf is one of the 4 COs that are unlocked from the start.CO abilities  Olaf's Units move unhindered in Snow. Rain acts to him like Snow does to normal COs. CO power Blizzard - Causes it to Snow until his next turn.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising  Olaf appears again in Advance Wars 2. Along with Grit and Colin he fights to drive Lash out of Blue Moon's land. Olaf's missions are Toy Box and T-minus 15. (Neotanks!?! and Factory Blues are optional). Olaf vows to take out Black Hole because they (specifically Lash) destroyed his hometown in the Toy Box mission.CO abilities  Olaf's Units move unhindered in Snow. Rain acts to him like Snow does to normal COs.CO power  Blizzard - Causes snow to fall until his next turn.Super CO power  Winter Fury - Summons a mighty blizzard, dealing 2 HP of damage to all enemy Units, in addition to making it snow.Advance Wars: Dual Strike  Olaf has little to no role in Advance Wars: Dual Strike as he stays in Macro Land to help his country recover. His clone, made by Black Hole, appears in one of the later missions.CO abilities  In Advance Wars: Dual Strike, his Units are not hindered by Snow. In addition, it also raises Olaf's units' firepower by 20%CO power  Blizzard - Causes Snow to fall for 2 days (meaning it snows until his second turn after activating his power), forcing his foes to consume more Fuel (instead of affecting movement like in previous games). During those two days his offence rises by 20% on the first day and 10% on the second day. (This stacks with the effects of snow, meaning on the first day his units have 10% extra defence and 10% + 20% offence because of the snow and his CO Power).Super CO power  Winter Fury - Causes a mighty blizzard, which deals 2 HP of damage to all enemy Units, plus the effects of his normal CO Power.Tag Breaks  Olaf has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  The effects of snow vary from game to game, but the one fact that is true is that Olaf is superior during snowfall. However, he is a vanilla CO (like Andy and Adder), when it is not snowing and that's his biggest weakness. On the vast majority of maps and in competitive play, it does not snow. Thankfully, Olaf can create snow with his CO Powers. It's generally worth waiting a bit longer to get his Super CO Power since it already does what his regular CO Power does and it damages all enemy units as well. The fact that he's a mass damage CO is significant in itself. He reduces the enemy's army by 1/5th and he's a good option for those who want to use a mass damage CO, but find Drake's Fog of War annoying or Hawke's power meter too long. The firepower boost he gets during snow (his day to day finally kicking in), as well as the penalties the opponent suffers during snowfall (which he does not suffer from), are a nice bonus. Due to his strong Super CO Power, he's a good option on almost any map.Quotes Advance Wars Dual Strike Trivia Colin General Basic information  Colin (Japanese: \u30a4\u30ef\u30f3, Ewan) along with Sasha's heirs to vast fortune is a rich CO from Blue Moon. He debuts in the Blue Moon's Campaign in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising.Personality  He admires his fellow Blue Moon CO's, Olaf and Grit and dislikes Black Hole that already destroyed his home. When Colin first arrived in Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, he called all of his superiors \"Sir\". Grit was not particularly fond of the title, but Olaf never made an issue of it. He is an uptight CO who always tries his best to correctly carry out orders and give respect where it is due. In Advance Wars: Dual Strike he often talks with a stutter.CO ability summary  Colin's lack of experience causes his units to have 10% weaker attack power than the baseline. However, Colin is able to purchase his units at 80% of the regular price.Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising Storyline significance  He was a recruit to be a CO in the Blue Moon army. He's is always thinking there is something he is doing wrong but tries his best. His missions are \"Reclamation\" and \"Two-Weeks Test\" and is optional in \"Neotanks!?!\" and \"Factory Blues\".CO abilities  Colin's units are 20% cheaper, but are also 10\u00a0% weaker offensively, due to his lack of experience in the military field.CO power  Gold Rush - Multiplies Colin's current War Funds by 1.5, meaning 30,000 Funds becomes 45,000 War Funds, for example. Also increases his Units' defence by 10%.Super CO power  Power of Money - Uses wealth to increase the strength of weapons. For every 1000 War Funds\u00a0Colin has, his units gain 3.33% more firepower.\u00a0War Funds\u00a0contributing to this power are not\u00a0spent. Also increases\u00a0Units' defence by 10%.Advance Wars: Dual Strike Storyline significance  He appears in just a few fights. His first appearance, \"The Ocean Blue\".CO abilities  Colin's units are 20% cheaper, but their stats are 90/100.CO power  Gold Rush - Multiplies Colin's current War Funds by 1.5, meaning 10,000 Funds becomes 15,000 War Funds, for example. It also slightly increases his units' attack.Super CO power  Power of Money - Uses money to increase weapon strength. The more War Funds Colin has, the stronger his Units become. Every 1000 War Funds gives 3.33% more firepower to the base offence increase of 10%. Power of Money does not use up Colin's Funds.Tag Breaks  Colin has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Quotes Dual Strike  Switch \"I'll give it my all!\" \"Let me do the buying!\" Power \"Chaaaaaarge!\" \"Hey sis, check this out!\" Campain, Pre-Battle Final Battle \"I'm... I'm not scared! I can do this!\" (with Sasha) Sasha: \"Don't push yourself too much, Colin. I need you to come home alive.\" Colin: \"I know, Sis. I want you to be safe, too. We'll go home together!\" Victory (with Sasha) Sasha: \"Say something clever, Colin.\"\nColin: \"Um...Don't mess with the best! Oh, that was lame.\" Colin: \"H-how was that, Sis?\" Sasha: \"Meh. Good. Not great. I can do better.\" Sasha: \"Our sibling bond is unbreakable.\" Colin: \"Yep, that's why we're the best!\"Trivia Hachi  Hachi (Japanese: \u30cf\u30c1 Hachi) is an Orange Star CO. He is Orange Star's former commander in chief, and is stated in the game to be a former rival of Sensei. He is also the keeper of the Battlemaps shop in Advance Wars, Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, and Advance Wars: Dual Strike. He gets a discount on all units, but unlike Colin's, his units have normal firepower. He has no real weaknesses. He is also extremely gossipy and may give you hints about the game in exchange for you buying his merchandise. If you clean him out, though, he won't give you anything.CO abilities  A slick-talking businessman, Hachi gets a 10% discount on all Units.CO power  Barter - Hachi can purchase units at 50% of their original price.Super CO power  Merchant Union - Creates ground units from any City under Hachi's control. Hachi also receives a 50% discount on all Units of their original price. (Union regulations and all that).Tag Breaks  Hachi has Tag Breaks with the following COs:Tactics  Hachi is a broken CO in nearly every way, and is arguably one of the best CO's in the entire series.Quotes Dual Strike  Switch \"I'm back in business.\" \"I'm open for business!\" \"Switch all you want - It's free!\" Power \"Hey, I'm no retiree!\" \"I may be old, but I can still rumble!\" \"Business is looking up!\" Victory \"Battles cost too much!\" \"Thank you, come again!\" \"Rematches are free!\" (With Sensei) Hachi: \"Shop till you drop! Or until I drop you!\"\n Sensei: \"Ha ha ha! You're such the businessman!\"Units  Main Category for Units.Caulder  Caulder (Berith and Stolos in the Japanese and European games respectively) is the main villain of Advance Wars: Days of Ruin. He is a CO and head of the private military contractor IDS. He seeks a world where he is free to carry out his horrific biological and psychological experiments.Storyline  He is first seen in \"Fear Experiment\" where he and his daughter Penny destroy one of the few remaining food sources and where they unleash the War Tank on the 12th Battalion, just to see how they react. Later on, he supplies The Beast with the weapons which he needs to defeat the 12th Battalion. After The Beast fails Caulder kills him. Afterward, he is seen supplying weapons to the Lazurian Army Supreme Commander General Forsythe. He offers to let Forsythe use his terrible weapons, but the General turns him down. Admiral Greyfield, leader of the NRA, is not so reluctant though. He has Caulder use a Weapon of Mass Destruction on a ruined city in order to kill Captain Brenner. Afterward, he and Tabitha are seen using an IDS prototype weapon, The Talon Gun, to attack the 12th Battalion and Lazurian Army. The heroes meet him in the aftermath of \"Waylon Flies Again\". It seems that he was in a ruined building, observing the whole battle. He informs them that Greyfield is almost ready to use his \"Masterpiece\". One of the civilians, Dr. Morris, sheds some light on who Caulder is; a scientist whose only interest is to carry out unethical experiments. Lt. Lin infroms them that Caulder is the head of IDS, or Intelligent Defence Systems. He was making a huge profit from the Lazuria/Rubinelle war by selling weapons to both sides. Isabella then says what this \"Masterpiece\" is: The Caulder Missile. These were sold to both side of the conflict, and all of them were set to launch simultaneously. Frightened by the implications of this, the 12th Battalion sets out to stop the launch. Throughout the game, there are references to a virus the Creeping Derengea (known as the Creeper to the 12th Battalion and The Green Thumb to the NRA). The virus is tearing through the NRA, and Greyfield orders Caulder to find a cure, or else. Caulder says yes, he has a cure, but there's a more pressing matter; The Caulder Missile System was damaged by the meteor strikes, and that there are a number of locking mechanisms that must be bypassed. Fortunately, the 12th Battalion stops these weapons from being launched. Once Greyfield dies, Caulder decides that the 12th Battalion might \"prove to be worthy specimens for further research.\" He gives his children Cyrus, Penny, and Tabitha a new \"toy\"- the giant bomber The Great Owl. He will call off his plane though, he says, if they turn Isabella over to him. They refuse, and Caulder begins the attack. The 12th Battalion barely manages to defeat him. After he first unveiled the monster plane, he reveals who Isabella is: one of his cloned children. This changes the civilian attitude toward her. They decide to ostracize her. Not used to this kind of behavior, Isabella is so shocked and hurt she goes and surrenders to Caulder, who has her placed on The Great Owl. This act prompts Will to go and rescue her. He does, but Caulder orders Penny to crash the plane and kill all who are on board. Isabella convinces her otherwise, and after Tabitha's stunning defeat, he calls his children \"abject, useless failures!\" Caulder\u00a0forces Cyrus\u00a0to take\u00a0a\u00a0poison, that apparently\u00a0gives a very slow and\u00a0rather painful death (according to Caulder),\u00a0after he\u00a0defected to the 12th Battalion. Will finds Cyrus, who is on the verge of death, and is\u00a0informed\u00a0that Caulder has retreated to The Nest, his Headquarters. Inside the Nest is the cure for the Creeper virus. Cyrus dies afterwards. The heroes pursue Caulder to The Nest, his crowning achievement and the central research facility for Intelligent Defence Systems. The Nest is similar to the Black Hole's Factories, only it's far larger, and is able to fight back. It's been armed with five powerful laser cannons, two of which rotate, and two powerful mortar launchers. It can also build any Land and Air Unit (around day 6, he builds a Seaplane Unit). During the course of the fight, he tells a little story. He says that, in his youth, cloning technology had advanced by leaps and bounds, but that there was some ethical resistance to the idea. He rejected such concerns, and decided to clone himself multiple times, and to use the clones for organ transplants and for horrible experiments. Eventually though, the clones began to resent being used in such a way. They fought back. After a brief, bloody war, only one clone survived- and he is that survivor! He is a clone, and he killed his creator. Eventually, The Nest is destroyed, and Caulder perishes along with it.Gameplay  Caulder is available on 3 Maps:CO Power  Caulder has quite a extraordinary CO Power, known as the \"Supreme Boost\". All units, in his 3 sqaure CO Zone, will be boosted to a 5-star ATK and DEF, including a costly 5 HP recovery per day. The only viable weakness is that this passive ability doesn't resupply the healed limits. Despite that, Caulder is still an incredible threat on the field with his CO unit and is often frowned upon in the multiplayer community.Strategy  Caulder is considered unbalanced in the game. In other words, he is disallowed in competitive play under all circumstances due to how powerful his Supreme Boost it.Playing as Caulder Surviving Caulder:  Though it is very slim to beat Caulder, here are some ways to survive or possibly win:Trivia ", "Last Day on Earth: Survival \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "Last Day on Earth: Survival \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "Last day on earth pine log Wiki": "Last day on earth pine log Wiki ", "Wikia LAST DAY ON EARTH VN": "Wikia LAST DAY ON EARTH VN ", "Rise Of Mythos Wiki": "Rise Of Mythos Wiki ", "Food Street Wiki": "Food Street Wiki ", "Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch Wiki": "Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch Wiki Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch Wiki March 29th, 2015  This Wiki has been orphaned.

Every single Robot Master and then some have an arena they can call their own in the tournament.Quick Reference Chart Deathmatch Stages  Deathmatch stages are usually straight-up shoot-outs, but some levels have gimmicks which make things interesting for you and your adversaries. You'll find yourself on each and every one of these levels at least once in Story Mode (with the exceptions of Wily's Hideout 2, Skull Castle Core, Skull Castle Depths, Skull Fortress 2, Skull Fortress 3, Skull Fortress 4, and Reclaimed King's Tower. On each one, your AI opponents will include the Robot Master whose stage the map is based on, and you'll be able to find their associated weapon somewhere within it. The weapons tend to have a more convenient usefulness in their own stage, as the stage's layout and gameplay are influenced and adapted to the weapon. For instance, Cut Man's stage is made of very tiny corridors, making Rolling Cutter, Cut Man's weapon, much easier to use, since the targets have a very small zone for dodging.Special Stages  On top of the common stages, there exist special stages which serve a specific purpose in the Story Mode.Capture the Flag  While absent from the Single Player mode, the game comes with a handful (up from a trio in v1a) of Capture the Flag levels, each with their own unique features. While none are based on any specific game level, each have a number of features from a variety of levels.User Created Maps  Here are a list of community created maps that are not included in any official MM8BDM builds.  |} |}Individual Maps Characters  Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch has a long variety of characters, from Mega Man 1 to Mega Man 8, including Powered Up, some are playable, some are not.

It is more widely known as YDClasses on the MM8BDM community. Its goal is to make a unique and individual class for each Robot Master and several additional characters. In the interest of balance, many of these classes have modified versions of their abilities, different abilities from less-known games of the Classic series, or even entirely new abilities, in order to ensure that they can hold their own in combat while staying within a class role that fills an specific gameplay niche, and contribute to team-based gamemodes. In addition, classes will retain the weakness featured in their game (for example, Wood Man's Leaf Shield will effortlessly destroy Air Man), and will additionally gain new weaknesses to similar weapons from other games (for example, Plant Man's Plant Barrier will also effortlessly destroy Air Man). The latest version is v8d, which is compatible with the v5a release of MM8BDM. The link to the forum thread is here.The Item Changes  New items are introduced with this mod. Some of the new items replace the vanilla items, and some classes obtain different items altogether:The Classes Copy Weapon Classes  These classes have the special ability to pick up and use the vanilla weapons, and use a variety of items. These classes do not have any specific weaknesses, but their armor is weaker than normal (to different degrees) and their weapons deal 9% less damage than the normal versions. They also need to manually refill their weapon energy, but you already knew that\u00a0;).Mega Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: MegaClass (x1.12) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None This class is a special remake of the default MM8BDM player class: it nows holds the powerful new Mega Buster! Hold down the primary fire button to charge the Mega Buster up to three charge levels. The strength of each charge level is a little weaker than Proto Buster, and the Charge Buster has a bigger yet slower projectile, and lacks a defensive shield. Mega Man also has the ability to slide using alt-fire on any weapon for quick escapes. Mega Man starts off with the Energy Balancer on all game modes, and can pick up and use Rush Coil, Rush Jet, Item-1, Beat Support, Tango Roll, Laser and Arrow Buster Upgrades. In addition to these items, Mega Man is the only copy weapon class capable of picking up the new Jet and Power adaptors to transform into Jet and Power Mega Man.Proto Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: ProtoClass (x1.333) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Proto Man functions identically to Mega Man, with a few differences. Proto Man's primary weapon is the Proto Buster, which equips you with a shield that can block most damage, can be charged identically to Mega Man's Charge Buster, deals slightly more damage, travels way more faster, but has a smaller projectile hit box. He can slide further than Mega Man can, but has a lower armor tier, thus taking more damage than Mega Man. Rush support items will change to the Proto Coil and Proto Jet from Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10, though there is no change in functionality.Bass  Speed: Medium (0.75 forward/backward, 0.73 side) Armor: MegaClass (x1.12) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Bass uses his signature Bass Buster and can dash, paralleling the slide of Mega Man and Proto Man. In addition, Bass has the ability to double jump. Picking up a Rush Coil, Super Adaptor or Rush Jet will enable Bass to use the Treble Boost: a temporary upgrade that gives Bass flight and a three-way spread shot. Picking up a Tango Roll or Beat Support item will allow Bass to use the Treble Sentry, and he is the only copy weapon class able to do so. Picking up Eddie Call will summon Treble Item, which function pretty much the same way.Duo  Speed: Medium-Slow (0.7 forward/backward, 0.68 side) Armor: DuoClass (x0.896) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Duo is prepared to deliver justice as a copy weapon class, thanks to Dr. Light's modifications during the events of Mega Man 8! His armor is tougher than the other copy weapon classes, but he's also a bit slower. His default weapon is the Duo Fist. His alt-fire attack is a tackle dash that damage enemies and pushes them back. All instances in which Duo picks up an item like Rush Coil, Treble Boost and the sort will give Duo the ability to use his meteor form and dash in whichever direction you aim, serving as both a mobility tool AND an attack!Doc Robot  Speed (BASE): Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor (BASE): MegaClass (x1.12) Jump (BASE): Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Wait...what is this guy doing here? Doc Robot is a very special copy weapon class, in the sense that he can pick up and use copy weapons, but his armor, jump AND speed traits will slightly change depending on the copy weapon he's using!\u00a0 Unlike copy weapon classes, Doc Robot is treated as a Robot Master: he cannot pick up many items, or pick up weapon energy pellets at all. Do not fear, though: his copy weapons will recharge ammo on their own! Every copy weapon's stat changes somewhat reflect the stats of the Robot Master said copy weapon belongs to: Wild Coil will make you jump higher, Hard Knuckle will buff your armor, and Quick Boomerang will increase your speed. Be warned that with stat buffs may come stat nerfs as well!Rockman  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: ProtoClass (x1.333) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Sporting fashionable green and moss duds and a fantastic hairstyle, here comes Rockman! This copy weapon class is different, in the sense that it will deal and receive normal damage from/to non-copy weapon attacks/classes. On top of that, it begins with the default MM8BDM Megabuster weapon, slide not included! Die-hard vanilla fans: rejoice! The lack of a helmet will make you take a bit more damage, though: fashion comes with a price.Non-copy weapon Classes  These classes, as you can see from the title above, can not use copy weapons. Instead, they can only use a limited set of abilities and weapons that most likely have regenerative ammo. Each of these classes have or share some unique stats and abilities: jump height, speed movement and armor are the most notable differences. These classes can only pick up red E-Tanks and Carry, except for Roll.Non-game specific Classes Roll  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: ProtoClass (x1.333) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Roll is an excellent close-range combatant, wielding her broom and a bucket of water that can cause hitstun. Primary Fire with Roll Swing will obviously swing the broom. This also has a unique function; it can reflect projectiles. Roll also has a bucket that can dump a puddle of water on the floor. Roll can use these as a trap to stun targets or hit them with her broom to send them flying. Roll can also give health gifts to allies and herself with the item she has. Alt-Fire is a broom dash, akin to Mega Man's slide. Roll is also able to use Rush Coil and Jet, Beat Call and Support, and Tango Roll items.Dr. Wily  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: (ON FOOT) Glass (x1.5), (IN SUIT/CAPSULE) Slightly weaker than MegaClass (x1.125) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Thunder Beam, Bubble Lead, Top Spin, Pharaoh Shot, Silver Tomahawk, Wild Coil, Flash Bomb, Magic Card The big bad doc himself joins the fray, with the ability to use his Skull Suit and Wily Capsule! Upon spawning, Dr. Wily will have his Skull Suit equipped. The Skull Suit's Primary Fire shoots a weak homing shot, and its Alt-Fire fires more powerful, rapid blasts that deal less damage the more ammo is depleted. Both of these weapons have a limited supply of ammunition. Next to the Ammunition bar is a gray meter that slowly fills up over time. When it's full, activating Dr. Wily's item will equip the Wily Capsule! Using the Wily Capsule, Dr. Wily is free to fly around and fire a variety of devastating projectiles, but the gray meter will drain rapidly. When the meter is empty, the Wily Capsule breaks down and Dr. Wily is left to defend himself with the Wily Gun, which fires the same projectile as the Skull Suit's Primary Fire. The gray meter fills much more rapidly while Dr. Wily is on foot; once it fills up again, the Skull Suit will be automatically re-equipped, emptying the gray meter and restarting the process. Dr. Wily seems unbeatable otherwise, but here's a little tip: none of his weapons trigger any weaknesses.Sniper Joe  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Here comes a new challenger! Your regular Sniper Joe enemy joins the fray with his Joe Shield, Joe Buster and deathly Joe Grenades! Test your might and skills by playing Sniper Joe: you might win something if you keep busting bots!Mega Man (& Powered Up) Classes Cut Man  Speed: Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 0.98 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Medium-High (12) Weaknesses: Super Arm, Hard Knuckle, Power Stone, Astro Crush, Spread Drill Cut Man may be somewhat frail, but he's agile and capable of performing wall jumps.\u00a0His Rolling Cutter is a bit different from Mega Man's; the Primary Fire\u00a0throws the cutter similarly to Mega Man's cutter, while the Alt-Fire\u00a0throws it at a higher speed, but at the cost of ripping time. Both cutters do slightly less damage than Mega Man's, but they have infinite ammo, so slice away!Guts Man  Speed: Very Slow (0.56 forward/backward, 0.54 side) Armor: Heavy (x0.55) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Time Slow, Time Bender, Flash Stopper, Flash Bulb, Gravity Hold, Gravity Sphere, Centaur Flash, Centaur Arrow, Copy Vision. The quintessential tank class, Guts Man is very slow, but he makes up for it with extreme durability and power. Guts Man features the Super Arm he used in Mega Man. Hitting primary fire once will summon a boulder from above which Guts Man will take hold of. Using Primary Fire again will toss the boulder, which will deal damage to whatever it lands on and then split into four smaller projectiles that fly forward, all capable of dealing additional damage. Placed well, the boulder and all four projectiles can hit the same victim simultaneously for massive damage, enough to instantly frag even a Sturdy Armor class! This attack shares exactly the same damage and properties as Mega Man's Super Arm, except that the graphics are inspired by Mega Man: Power Fighters. In addition, Guts Man can punch his foes with Alt-Fire so long as he is not carrying a boulder, covering the short-range \"dead zone\" of the Super Arm's boulders. The punch is very powerful, capable of dealing up to 60 damage with a direct hit.Ice Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Hyper Bomb, Crash Bomb, Drill Bomb, Napalm Bomb, Danger Wrap, Flash Bomb, Remote Mine, Ballade Cracker Brrrr! Ice Man can use his Ice Slasher to cause mayhem in groups of combatants. The Ice Slasher fires slow-moving, ripping projectiles at a high rate of fire, as powerful as Mega Man's version. Ice Man's Alt-Fire will launch a flurry of snowflakes that travel in a cone from Ice Man's position. These snowflakes will deal hefty damage in close quarters and can slow opponents for a brief time. Each snowflake does 1, 2, or 3 ripping damage randomly. The combination of these two weapons can put considerable strain on Ice Man's ammo reserves, which rebuild over time.Bomb Man  Speed: Slow (0.65 forward/backward, 0.63 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: High (13) Weaknesses: Rolling Cutter, Metal Blade, Shadow Blade, Gyro Attack, Silver Tomahawk, Tengu Blade, Screw Crusher BOOOOM! Explosions are fun, and Bomb Man has plenty to spare. Bomb Man features two variants of the standard Hyper Bomb. Primary Fire will cause Bomb Man to pick up a bomb. With bomb in hand, using Primary Fire will toss it with an arc, and it will explode on contact with foe, ground, ceiling, or wall (the blast deals 30 explosive damage, and touching the bomb itself will cause 20 damage. For a maximal of 50 damage). Secondary Fire will cause Bomb Man to drop the bomb in front of him, where it will bounce and explode after a foe runs over it or after a short duration, causing 50 splash damage. Both versions of the Hyper Bomb are considerably weaker than the standard Hyper Bomb. The ammo cost for throwing a bomb is 20% of the bar (meaning that with full ammo, 5 bombs can be thrown).Fire Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Ice Slasher, Blizzard Attack, Freeze Cracker, Ice Wave, Ice Wall Fire Man's Fire Storm is only slightly different from Mega Man's version in that it fires a larger projectile and leaves a small patch of flame on the ground when it hits foes.. It still features the shield surrounding Fire Man and has infinite ammo. Alt-Fire will produce will cause the Fire Storm to produce a wave of flame that travels along the ground in a straight line, moving up and down cliffs in a manner similar to the Search Snake. The flame wave travels very slowly but deals big damage to anyone caught within. A dead-center hit spells almost certain death, and the flame wave can yield impressive results when fired into a group of fighting Robot Masters. The flame wave will consume all of Fire Man's ammunition, which regenerates as long as he is not firing his primary weapon.Elec Man  Speed: Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 0.98 side) Armor: Glass (x1.5) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Oil Slider, Dust Crusher, Junk Shield Elec Man is very frail, but he makes up for it with impressive speed and attack power. His main fire is the powerful\u00a0Thunder Beam, which is the same as Mega Man's version apart from a slight delay when he fires it. At point-blank range, if it hits just right, it can defeat a Normal Armor class in one shot! Elec Man can also use his alt fire to summon lightning that hits anyone in his vicinity for major damage--almost as much as Toad Man's Rain Flush! The lightning drains all his power, though, leaving him vulnerable for a few seconds.Time Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Thunder Beam, Spark Shock, Thunder Bolt, Thunder Claw, Lightning Bolt Time Man is an interesting bird. His main-fire shoots clock hands, but the way they're shot depends on the weapon. The first weapon uses Time Man's right hand and fires arrows diagonally, left and right. Time Man's second weapon uses his left hand and alternates firing a slow projectile and a fast projectile. The alt fire for both weapons is the actual Time Slow. As the name suggests, it slows all nearby opponents, leaving them vulnerable to attack. This ability makes Time Man a great support class on a team, but he can pick off slowed opponents well enough on his own if necessary.Oil Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Glass (x1.5) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses:\u00a0Fire Storm, Oil Flame, Atomic Fire, Pharaoh Shot, Flame Blast, Scorch Wheel, Flame Sword, Wave Burner Oil Man is somewhat difficult to use, but can be a valuable asset once mastered. His main fire, and only weapon, is the Oil Slider. It shoots a glob of oil on the ground, and unlike the copy version, it can be charged up for a faster barrage of 3 or 5 shots. The oil does relatively little damage to other Robot Masters, however. The real purpose of the Oil Slider is for Oil Man to slide on the oil to turn himself into a careening projectile that damages foes on contact. If the oil blobs come into contact with fire, they will become burning flame pillars; this can be particularly hazardous for Oil Man because of his weakness to fire and his propensity to be sliding around at high speed, so he must be very careful when fighting any opponent with a fire-based attack.Mega Man 2 Classes Metal Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Glass (x1.5) Jump: High (14) Weaknesses: Quick Boomerang, Metal Blade, Needle Cannon, Yamato Spear Metal Man is a dangerous class to fight. He takes way more damage, and his movement isn't rebalanced as counterpart. Instead, he gets his force from his high offensive. While Metal Man is weak against not only his own weapon, don't write him off based on his faults. His primary Metal Blade is exactly the same as Mega Man's, and it deals a decent amount of damage against whatever gets in his way (14 ripping damage for each blade), with infinite ammo included. In addition, the saws runs on the floor if they're shot at it. If they contact with a ceiling, they'll fall vertically, falling to the floor. His altfire lets him climb walls and provide a close range attack (6 ripping damage). As in Mega Man 2, dodging the Metal Blades by attacking at the same time is the key to defeat Metal Man. Keep your distance, both playing as and against Metal.Air Man  Speed: Medium-Fast (0.86 forward/backward, 0.8 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Leaf Shield, Plant Barrier This blowhole is surprisingly versatile for such a simple-sounding class. The Air Shooter isn't too different, other than increased speed and a slower firing rate. His Alt-Fire is a powerful blast of tornadoes similar to his attack in Mega Man 2. This can destroy entire teams with its random patterns, fast speed, and large ammo count, but diminishes in usefulness in close proximity. Air Man is very good as a guard in CTF matches, or if you're getting swarmed by enemies. Don't underestimate the Air Shooter either, as it is lethal at close range.Bubble Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Rolling Cutter, Metal Blade, Shadow Blade, Gyro Attack,\u00a0 Silver Tomahawk, Screw Crusher Bubble Man can use two types of projectiles with infinite ammo. The Main-Fire is a small pea-shooter. Comparable to the Bass Buster in speed and the Mega Buster in damage, use this to get those outside the range of your Alt-Fire: the Bubble Lead. More powerful than the first weapon, but suffers when you are below your opponent. Bubble Man also has the unique ability to swim freely when submerged, and can make use of this by using his itemfire ability, which creates a giant water bubble that allows Bubble Man to swim while inside of it, and other players to adquire underwater physics.Quick Man  Speed: Extremely Fast (1.35 forward/backward, 1.33 side) Armor: Glass (x1.5) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Time Slow, Time Bender, Flash Stopper, Flash Bulb, Centaur Flash, Centaur Arrow You're too slow! True to his name, Quick Man is the fastest Robot Master by far, and with his Speed Up item, his already-fast speed movement doubles! He can even use it to climb walls by repeatedly wall jumping while sped up. This dash ability, though dangerous if it cannot be controlled, is necessary, as his main fire\u00a0Quick Boomerang\u00a0has limited range. His Alt-Fire shoots three fast boomerangs in a spread that are not limited in range and will return to him after bouncing off a surface. Quick Man doesn't really have a proper weakness, but if he gets frozen or slowed, he'll find himself in trouble very quickly, since his armor is very weak.Crash Man  Speed: Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 0.98 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: High (13) Weaknesses: Air Shooter, Wind Storm, Tornado Hold With the weapons technology of Bomb Man and the mobility of Elec Man, Crash Man enters the ring with his own explosive flare! His main weapon (and only weapon) is his signature Crash Bomb, differing little from Mega Man's version. Main-Fire plants a bomb, and up to four can be planted at a time. The Alt-Fire detonates them all! This allows Crash Man to set traps with his bombs and catch opponents off guard by detonating bombs they thought they'd dodged.Flash Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Hyper Bomb, Crash Bomb, Drill Bomb, Napalm Bomb, Danger Wrap, Flash Bomb, Remote Mine, Ballade Cracker Don't worry, he doesn't have Time Stopper. He does have a variant of it though that will freeze anyone he's looking at so he can pelt them with his incredibly fast-firing Flash Buster. The downside to this is his Flash bar always starts empty and takes time to fill, so survival is especially important for Flash Man. One thing about Flash Man is, when he is killed, he drops a variant of Time Stopper called Time Bender (to prevent Time Stopper spam). It will freeze those close to the user to stop a fleeing foe, or to flee yourself! Like Time Man, Flash Man is a great support class, but as long as he has his Time Bender ready for use, he's perfectly capable of defeating enemies on his own.Wood Man  Speed: Slow (0.6 forward/backward, 0.58 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Fire Storm, Oil Flame, Atomic Fire, Metal Blade, Pharaoh Shot, Flame Blast, Scorch Wheel, Flame Sword, Wave Burner As you might expect from someone his size, Wood Man is slow but very powerful and durable. Unlike copy classes, Wood Man is totally invincible while his\u00a0Leaf Shield\u00a0is up, and if his shield takes a hit, it will cause a wave of leaves to rain down in front of him. His Alt-Fire is a simple body slam that, despite exposing Wood Man to attacks, can be easily chained for massive damage and bragging rights. Thanks to his natural armor and his barrier ability, Wood Man can easily last a long time, but his achille's heel of fire is unfortunately quite common among his enemies.Heat Man  Speed: Medium-Slow (0.72 forward/backward, 0.7 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Bubble Lead, Rain Flush, Water Wave, Water Balloon Let's turn up the heat! Heat Man can be quite an agile class. His main attack, the Atomic Fire, is completely different from the copy version; it tosses out 3 slightly spreading fireballs that travel different distances and create heat pillars where they land. It may be a little hard to aim, but it's pretty powerful, especially at close range, and can cover a surprisingly large area when spammed. His Alt-Fire is the Heat Tackle; while the button is held down, his shield stays up, and if he is attacked in this state, he will launch forward at high speed, dealing massive damage to anyone who gets in his way! However, his shield still lets a portion of the incoming damage through AND uses up a lot of ammo when deactivated, so don't rely on it too much or you may find yourself quickly running out of health and ammo.Mega Man 3 Classes Spark Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Rolling Cutter, Metal Blade, Shadow Blade, Gyro Attack, Silver Tomahawk, Screw Crusher Spark Man plays almost exactly as he acts in Mega Man 3. He can fire a large Spark Shock projectile with primary fire, or several smaller shocks in 8 surrounding directions with alternate fire. All of these attacks stun making it easy to get multiple hits. Spark Man is not especially fast or strong, but he does make for an excellent partner.Snake Man  Speed: Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 0.98 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Quick Boomerang, Needle Cannon, Yamato Spear, Spread Drill Snake Man is a bit different from how he appeared in Mega Man 3. He still uses Search Snake as his main weapon, but he can't jump as high as he used to and his actual movement speed is much higher than Mega Man's. His mainfire attack is, of course, Search Snake, which still acts the same as the copy weapon counterpart, but Snakeman's ammo regeneration and rate of fire allow him to fire faster and with little care, to a point where enemies can find themselves fighting a swarm of snakes!. He also can climb with his Alt-Fire ability, and while not intended for combat, it is possible to 'poke' enemies to death with it.Needle Man  Speed: Slow (0.65 forward/backward, 0.63 side) Armor: Tough (x0.65) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Gemini Laser, Crystal Eye, Copy Vision While Needle Man may not have as much versatility as he did, he is great under direct assault and offensive situations, particularly Team Deathmatch and CTF. His main weapon, the Needle Cannon, is reminiscent of the TF2 Heavy's minigun: you must first \"spin\" it up through alt-fire, and then fire a rapid barrage of needles at your enemies. Needle Man also has a secondary weapon called Needle Hammer, which is a melee attack that deals very high damage. His high DPS and damage resistance come at the cost of slow movement speed.Top Man  Speed: Very Fast (1.2 forward/backward, 1.18 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Super Arm, Hard Knuckle, Power Stone, Astro Crush Don't shoot this guy when he's dancin'. With a spinning, high-damaging ripping tackle primary, a decent three-way spread secondary weapon, and speed second only to the great Quick Man, Top Man is no slouch when it comes to hit-and-run. Use Top Spin on the ground to launch forward into enemies, but bear in mind it's difficult to aim and may disorientate you. Save your Alt-Fire Spinning Tops for enemies just outside of your reach.Shadow Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Glass (x1.5) Jump: Very High (15) Weaknesses: Top Spin, Charge Kick, Slash Claw If you suddenly die for no apparent reason, odds are you got sniped by Shadow Man. His special ability is his unique alt-fire stealth skill, allowing him temporary invisibility while moving. This mode will only end when his bar is depleted or he fires a Shadow Blade, allowing him to sneak up on unwary opponents. In addition to this, Shadow Man boasts a very high jump and the ability to wall jump, allowing him to traverse stages and hunt down opponents with ease. As for his blades, he has a close-range boomerang version and a long-range version that fires two at a time: one forward and one diagonally upwards. He can only activate stealth when his bar is full though, so it is at times wise to avoid fights so you can return at full power.Magnet Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Thunder Beam, Spark Shock, Thunder Bolt, Thunder Claw, Lightning Bolt Any player of MM8BDM knows that you just can't dodge Magnet Missile in open spaces. It doesn't help that Magnet Man can also shove you around with his magnetism. He is very difficult to deal in open maps, and he's capable of pushing you away with his magnetism, but his Magnet Missile isn't really that powerful, so he's more bark than bite.Gemini Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Search Snake, Dive Missile, Homing Sniper, Magic Card Gemini Man's primary fire is a regular buster with a medium fire rate. While they're pretty weak, they're quite cheap because they don't use any ammo, and are so fast they can be used for sniping. His secondary fire fires Gemini Laser which are a tiny weaker version of Mega Man's (25 damage, while Mega's is 30 damage) that also doesn't consume any ammo. While this all may sound bland, Gemini Man's unique trait comes from his item ability. Using it will summon a \"clone\" that can follow you, or stay put with the Alt-Fire\u00a0; you can also remove it by using itemfire, but it'll use 50% of the ammo bar. When spawning it or re-spawning it, the clone will be created in the direction you're looking at. The clone itself shoots buster shots with a slow rate at nearby enemies. His health is equal to his user's ammo bar, and when it's defeated, it's removed from the field: the clone also suffers from Gemini Man's weaknesses, too. With proper planning, you can fool your enemies so they can't differentiate the clone from the real deal, but be careful, as the clone's projectiles can also hit their user! While the clone is summoned, Gemini Man can't use the Gemini Laser. When the clone is destroyed, it needs about 4,7 seconds of ammo charging before having a full bar back (so the user can summon it again).Hard Man  Speed: Extremely Slow (0.5 forward/backward, 0.48 side) Armor: Hard (x0.5) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses:\u00a0Magnet Missile, Junk Shield Hard Man is tough: he sports the toughest armor and the meanest behavior, lowering all taken damage to half! Hard Man's main fire is a variant of Mega Man's Hard Knuckle that doesn't cause recoil and takes off without delay, at the cost of only doing 30 damage instead of 70. He can have up to two fists out at once, and these return when they collide with anything, also dealing damage on the way back. Holding the alt fire button will send Hard Man rocketing up into the air at a slight forward angle with the special rocket booster under his body, after which he will come crashing down with his ridiculous weight, crushing anyone caught underneath him and causing a stunning earthquake when he hits the ground, allowing him to chain his press attack with his Hard Knuckle. While Hard Man is one of the buffest classes, this comes at the usual cost of reduced speed.Mega Man 4 Classes Bright Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Bubble Lead, Rain Flush, Water Wave, Water Balloon FLASH... AHHHHHH SAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE MY EYES!! Bright Man's base stats may not seem too impressive, but he can use three different attacks, giving good variety to his offense. Bright Man faced a problem in development. His normal blinding weapon would deal weak damage, but blinds the enemy. The weapon has been changed up a bit. The damage has been increased, and the weapon changed from an area-of-effect to a flashing light bulb, a projectile causing 10 explosive damage and blinding the enemy. Bright Man also has a decent buster to complement his weaponry, which shoots faster and stronger pellets than the Mega Buster (Bright shots deal 15 damage while Mega deal only 10), but a little more inaccurate. Finally, Bright Man can use a version of Flash Stopper as his itemfire, that doesn't blind (since the bulb can already do it), but stops briefly the opponents in a range similar to Flash Man's Time Stopper, and causing 5 explosive damage. When stunned, the victims can still fire, but can't move. Like the Time Stopper effect, as soon as the stunned opponent gets hits, he or she can move back. This Flash Stopper attack needs an important time of charging, but using the Flash Grenade or Bright Buster won't slow down the ammo regeneration. As with Flash Man, Bright Man drops a variant of his weapon; Flash Bulb, which acts pretty much like his own.Toad Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Tough (x0.65) Jump: Very High (15) Weaknesses: Hyper Bomb, Crash Bomb, Drill Bomb, Napalm Bomb, Flash Bomb, Danger Wrap, Remote Mine, Ballade Cracker Nothing like a little bellydancing before your death! Toad Man's main weapon is the Rain Flush, which summons acid rain around you for a brief moment. However, you're stuck dancing while it's raining and unable to move. This makes you an easy target for other people, so be very careful with how you use it! Though he has no other weapons, he can jump very high up by pushing your secondary weapon button! Use it to get to high places easily or to dodge those nasty explosives! Ribbit!Drill Man  Speed: Medium-Slow (0.7 forward/backward, 0.68 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Dive Missile, Honing Sniper, Magic Card Be careful where you step, because you never know what you might dig up! Drill Man's primary weapon is the Drill Bomb, which fires like a standard exploding projectile that differs from the copy weapon in that detonation is not input-determined, so Drill Man can have multiple projectiles out! His secondary attack switches him into his digger mode and causes him to burrow underground! Attacks will fly harmlessly past him as he can safely maneuver through the area while holding the secondary attack button. Once you let go of the secondary attack button (or the weapon meter drains), he'll jump out of the ground and revert back to battle mode, hitting anyone that gets in the way with his uppercut or the debris that comes out with him!Pharaoh Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Time Bender, Gemini Laser, Crystal Eye, Centaur Flash, Centaur Arrow, Copy Vision Rise from your grave! Pharaoh Man harnesses the power of the sun in his Pharaoh Shot, which does splash damage on surface contact charged or uncharged and can be fired uncharged quite rapidly, unlike Mega Man's version. His Alt-fire grants him the ability to hover at a set height; although its main purpose is transportation, it does deal some damage and might prove useful in unsuspecting crowds.Ring Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Medium-High (12) Weakness: Fire Storm, Atomic Fire, Pharaoh Shot, Flame Blast, Scorch Wheel, Flame Sword, Wave Burner Step aside! It's time for Ringman to do his Ring-Thing! He sports two weapons, each have Ring Boomerangs for both main-fire and alt-fire. One is the regular copy weapon Ring Boomerangs that return automatically to you, with the added ability of shooting two rings one after the other. The other has two rings he can fire at a time and manually control the distance they travel. Hold the buttons to keep the rings going and release them to have them come back to you.Dust Man  Speed: Slow (0.6 forward/backward, 0.58 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Ring Boomerang, Star Crash, Astro Crush One man's trash is another man's means of turning you INTO trash! Dust Man's primary weapon fires bolts of junk at your opponent, much like a regular projectile. His secondary weapon fires the Dust Crusher, which is a slow moving projectile that explodes into four fragments shooting in a diagonal formation. However, both weapons require garbage to fire, and once you run out, your Dust Crusher is gone and your buster is reduced to a measly pea shooter. Collect bits of scrap collected from fallen Robot Masters to keep your garbage supply up, use your alt-fire to suck 'em up! Junk Man is his best friend in this sense.Dive Man  Speed: Medium-Fast (0.9 forward/backward, 0.8 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Medium-High (11) Weakness: Skull Sniper, Noise Crush Dodge this! Dive Man comes with an unlimited supply of the weak, slow, but almost inescapable Dive Missile; luckily for you, they're shootable after they've traveled a certain distance! However, the feature that makes him much more interesting to play is his Dive Mine Alt-fire. Scatter a few mines near a doorway and an overeager opponent will rush into a wall of death, or jump in his face and fire them at point blank range. The mines will explode when shot or if Dive Man dies, so keep your defenders safe in team games. A little tip: despite their explosive behavior, Dive Mines do not trigger any weaknesses at all.Skull Man  Speed: Medium-Fast (0.85 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Medium-High (12) Weaknesses: Oil Slider, Dust Crusher, Junk Shield Skull Man's main weapon is the Skull Sniper, which fires incredibly fast bullets that deal as much damage as the Mega Buster. His Alt-fire is his signature\u00a0Skull Barrier, which makes him completely invincible; while it doesn't last nearly as long as the copy version, the cooldown period between uses is relatively short. Although the Skull Barrier can be used to keep you safe as you run through firefights, that's not where its real power lies. If the barrier is activated just as an attack would have hit Skull Man, he receives a brief boost to his movement speed, firing speed, and attack power, allowing him to counterattack with a powerful barrage of shots! When he is defeated, he drops a weapon called Skull Sniper, a powerful buster that fires skull-shaped bullets, rather than dropping his Skull Barrier.Mega Man 5 Classes Stone Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Tough (x0.65) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Hyper Bomb, Crash Bomb, Drill Bomb, Napalm Bomb, Danger Wrap, Flash Bomb, Remote Mine, Ballade Cracker Stone Man can be useful in open spaces. His Power Stone shoots 2 stones that circle around him, going outward. This is very useful for people crowded together in open spaces. His altfire brings him up into the air and slams back into the ground, crushing people below him, or paralyzing others who are in range.Gravity Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Very High (15) Weaknesses: Ring Boomerang, Star Crash, Astro Crush Previously known as several expletive names, Gravity Man has evolved from his \"heavy\" past into an effective anti-air class. The gravity buster is a solid weapon, firing relatively fast shots that deal 20 damage. His alt-fire is the Gravity Hold, which will send any flying or high jumping class hurtling down into their graves. Using the item will cause Gravity Man to flip onto the ceiling. When the ammo meter drains, he will unleash Gravity Hold. Otherwise, using it in crowds and on players who are jumping can also yield welcome results. When beaten, Gravity Man drops Gravity Sphere, a variant of Gravity Hold.Crystal Man  Speed: Medium-Slow (0.7 forward/backward, 0.68 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Rolling Cutter, Metal Blade, Shadow Blade, Gyro Attack, Silver Tomahawk, Tengu Blade, Screw Crusher Why is it that the simplest are also the hardest to explain? Crystal Man behaves dead on to his original RM form. The player can use the main fire to shoot a single crystal bit or the alt fire for a full 4 way shot of ricocheting crystals. All the crystal particles deal 20 damage each, slow down as they bounce, and disappear when they hit an enemy. However, the two versions of the attack have some different properties. The single crystal is moves slowly and doesn't cost any ammo. It can be fired at a decent rate (1.4 shots / second), and its staying power is based on its number of bounces; the crystal bit disappears on its 3rd bounce. The four crystal eyes are faster but consume about 21% of the bar. Their rate of fire is also slower (1 shot / second). Unlike the main fire version, their staying power is based on time (the crystals disappear after 2,4 seconds). Crystal Man dominates in enclosed areas, but in the open, his fire power is... underwhelming.Napalm Man  Speed: Medium (0.89 forward/backward, 0.5 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Gemini Laser, Crystal Eye, Copy Vision Napalm Man is literally a walking tank, but that doesn't mean much when it comes down to heavy combat. He only has slightly more health than Megaman, so don't think that firepower equals safety. When it comes to firepower, though, Napalm has it where it counts. His main fire is his signature\u00a0Napalm Bomb, which\u00a0is less damaging than the copy version (dealing only 35 damage max instead of 60) but can be fired farther. His alt fire, the Napalm Missile, uses quite a bit more ammo but is somewhat more powerful, capable of dealing up to 45 damage. The missile flies straight and detonates upon impact with a player or surface, making it a solid option for taking out enemies who are too far away to be reached with Napalm Bombs. Napalm Man's attacks pack a punch and he can move at a good clip, but his very poor strafing can make dodging attacks difficult, and his limited ammo hinders him in protracted battles. Coupled with this, despite having a high damage output, his armor is still pretty much standard, so don't expect to go Rambo on enemies and stay in one piece.Gyro Man  Speed: Medium-Fast (0.87 forward/backward, 0.85 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weakness: Gravity Hold, Gravity Sphere One of the more straightforward classes, Gyro Man has a simplified Gyro Attack that doesn't split but will change trajectory to fly straight forward when it hits a floor or ceiling instead of disappearing immediately. The rate of fire isn't that great, but the gyros do a hefty 30 damage, giving Gyro Man decent offensive power. His alt fire allows him to fly as long as the button is held; his flight is limited by a meter, but the cooldown period is relatively short.Star Man  Speed: Medium (0.75 forward/backward, 0.7 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: High* (12, plus slightly lower gravity) Weaknesses: Water Wave, Noise Crush, Ice Wave Being a Robot Master that lot of people considered bland and unattractive, Star Man has received some boosts that makes him a decent melee attacker and an effective trap-setter. The Star Crash's function is basically the same as the copy weapon, with the addition of increased armor (but reduced speed) while it is active, but Star Man has another trick up his sleeve. He can lay Star Crash traps with his altfire that, after a short time, fire a Flurry of star projectiles in the direction he was facing when he laid it. Using this with the Star Crash he can easily make close combat uncomfortable for whoever has to deal with both attacks.Wave Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.8 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Top Spin, Charge Kick, Slash Claw With a harpoon and the power of the ocean, he's prepared to make the biggest catch of his life! His main fire is his harpoon, which is not limited by ammo, has a good rate of fire, and does a solid 20 damage. His Alt Fire is Water Wave, which is the same as the copy version. Use the Water Wave for your main attack and the harpoons as backup.Charge Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.4 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Super Arm, Hard Knuckle, Power Stone, Spread Drill Charge Man is unique in that he features both high speed and high defense, which are necessary to get in close for his melee-only attacks. Unlike Mega Man, he doesn't actually kick, but he certainly does charge with his main fire,\u00a0maintaining a perpetual dash and dealing serious damage to cornered opponents. His alt fire is the Coal Shot, which causes 16 burning coals to rise from his smokestack and then fall all around him; the attack has very limited range, but each individual coal does 30 damage, adding up to one very powerful attack. If the opponent is unlucky enough to be directly above Charge Man when he fires the coals, the damage will be enough for an instant frag--even against Hard Man! As such, opponents must be very cautious about climbing ladders when Charge Man is around. And as if all that weren't enough, Charge Man is very briefly invincible when he fires the coal shot, so it can be used to block attacks if it is fired with good timing. However, for all his speed and power, Charge Man is helpless if he can't get close to his opponent, and his movement can be rather awkward to control.Dark Man 1  Speed (BASE): Slow (0.65 forward/backward, 0.4 side) Armor: Tough (x0.65) Jump: None (0) Weakness: None This guy is an excellent bum-rusher. His Primary-Fire fires the simple Dark Buster. However, as Dark Man 1 takes damage, his speed and fire rate gradually increase, making him a dangerous foe. Of course, he'll also be lower on health in this state, so know your limits before charging into battle! Below is the fire rate chart according to his health: Health between 81% and 100%\u00a0: 3,18 shots / second Health between 61% and 81%\u00a0: 3,5 shots / second Health between 41% and 61%\u00a0: 3,88 shots / second Health between 21% and 41%\u00a0: 4.375 shots / second Health between 0% and 21%\u00a0: 5 shots / second Dark Man 1 lacks a normal jump, but his alt fire gives him a brief rocket boost, which can actually propel him quite high in the air. However, he can't fire his buster while using the rocket boost, so you won't be able to rocket around freely as you fight.Dark Man 2  Speed (BASE): Medium (0.81 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None He's a pretty good partner to have, like Spark Man, but he's able to hold his own in a duel. Primary Fire launches four sparks that stun targets, covering the same range a net would. The Alt-Fire is the Dark Shield, which can do some hugging damage and be fired as a projectile. Like Dark Man 1, this guy speeds up considerably as his health gets lower; keep your distance, and watch out for last-ditch bum rushes!Dark Man 3  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Didn't think you'd ever see a sniper here, did you? Well, you kinda do now! Dark Man 3 has a powerful-at-range Primary Fire that does more damage the further you are from your target. The Alt-Fire shoots paralyzing Dark Rings, which help him get away from foes trying to get in close. Dark Man 3 can be a daunting foe to approach, but bear in mind that his sniping is limited by his ammo; if you can survive his initial volley, you'll have a chance to attack while his ammo is recharging.Dark Man 4  Speed (BASE): Medium-Slow (0.7 forward/backward, 0.68 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None The last of the Dark Men, and one of the most threatening, Dark Man 4 combines the skills of the other Dark Men into one formidable package. His main fire shoots slow but powerful buster shots which do slightly more damage at long range, similar to Dark Man 3's. His alt fire summons a shield similar to Dark Man 2's, but while the shield is up, his buster's rate of fire is slowed considerably, and his shots lose their ranged damage bonus. However, as he gets lower on health, the shield's slowing effect on his buster diminishes, allowing him to fire with increasing rapidity, much like Dark Man 1. With his formidable power and the ability to fight at close or long range, Dark Man 4 is a force to be reckoned with.Mega Man 6 Classes Blizzard Man  Speed: Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 0.9 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Fire Storm, Atomic Fire, Pharaoh Shot, Flame Blast, Scorch Wheel, Flame Sword, Wave Burner Remember that really easy robot master from Mega Man 6? Yeah, he is much tougher now. His Blizzard Attack is pretty formidable and has limited homing abilities, but the real threat comes from his Blizzard Bowl. With it, he charges forward at an incredible speed, inflicting a hefty 40 damage on whoever he hits and rebounding up and back after the hit. However, it has a long recharge time, and if it is used incorrectly, it can very easily send Blizzard Man flying off the stage to his doom.Yamato Man  Speed: Slow (0.6 forward/backward, 0.6 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Medium-High (12) Weaknesses: Rolling Cutter, Metal Blade, Shadow Blade, Gyro Attack, Silver Tomahawk, Screw Scrusher Nippon banzai! Yamato Man joins the fight with his signature samurai spear. His primary fire is obviously the Yamato Spear, which can be devastating at close combat. He can pick up spears he drops to regenerate ammo faster. His altfire is also effective up close; Yamato Man rapidly spins his deadly spear, slashing through anything close enough to damage.Tomahawk Man  Speed: Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 1.0 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Leaf Shield, Plant Barrier Geronimo! Tomahawk Man enters the place, and is ready to lead to victory\u00a0! He's a great and fast sweeper, as his attacks both mix strength and agility! He's equipped with a revision of Silver Tomahawk that curves up a bit sooner. He also can \"feather\" opponents to death with a spread of... feathers. Tomahawk Man is simple but really effective. He has no ammo restriction at all, meaning that each of his attacks can be used at anytime, anywhere, any number of times. Even through they're basic, they can cover most situations. His primary attack coming from the normalfire is a silver-colorated Silver Tomahawk. It's a little weaker than Mega Man's (24 damage while Mega's does 30 damage). It's a decent long range attack that curves up, so aiming lower increases its range, and travels fairly quickly, too. His secondary fires shoots 5 feathers in a spread (damage is 6 ripping damage / feather). It's slower than the tomahawk, and they have a slightly slower fire rate, but they cover a large area, and their ripping ability makes them great for feathering a crowd of robots. At very close range, they can show a high power if the 5 of them are fired into the opponent.Wind Man  Speed: Medium-Slow (0.7 forward/backward, 0.68 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Time Slow, Time Bender, Flash Stopper, Flash Bulb, Centaur Flash, Centaur Arrow Wind Man can be very agile, even though his run speed is slightly slower than Megaman's. His main attack are his two wind gyros, which go in a zigzag pattern. This can make it really hard for enemies to predict its movements. His altfire is flying, like Gyro Man, but he cannot stop flying until his ammo bar has run out. However, unlike Gyro Man, he can still shoot while flying at the expense of some bar. He has a weakness to Centaur Flash, which can also be used as needed to stop Wind Man's relatively slow shots, and he's additionally weak to flashing weapons.Centaur Man  Speed: Medium-Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 0.6 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Knight Crush, Thunder Claw Centaur Man is a fast and versatile class. He has low damage output, but he offers support in a valuable way. The Centaur Buster splits when hitting the walls and floor, allowing one to hit targets within an area or around corners. However, both its rate of fire and its recharge rate are slow, limiting its usefulness. Centaur Man's alt-fire, the Centaur Flash, retains its minor area damage and projectile deflection capabilities. It is less rapid than Mega Man's, but it also has a stunning effect, making it arguably the best support weapon. However, due to its long recharge time, it usually can be used only 1-3 times before retreating. Centaur Man can also teleport using his item. When killed, Centaur Man drops a very simple copy weapon called Centaur Arrow, which is merely a somewhat slow moving ripping arrow that is of the same damage type as his Centaur Flash.Flame Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Medium-High (12) Weaknesses: Air Shooter, Wind Storm, Tornado Hold The fiery counterpart to Wave Man, Flame Man uses similar attacks tooled to a different purpose. His Flame Blast can be fired very rapidly and sends out waves of flame pillars in semi-random directions, which can travel up and down walls. He functions best at range, with a buster that fires very fast, creates small Flame Blast pillars upon hitting the floor, and deals considerable damage.Knight Man  Speed: Slow (0.65 forward/backward, 0.57 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Medium-High (12) Weaknesses: Quick Boomerang, Needle Cannon, Yamato Spear, Spread Drill Armed with his shield and his Knight Crush, Knight Man is more than a worthy adversary. He is fairly slow, but he makes up for this loss in speed with increased jump height. The shield blocks any non-ripping weapon, and has a close-range bashing alt fire that can stun the victim. Other Knight Crushes will actually bounce off of it! Also, while his shield won't block explosives, Knight Man is naturally resistant to them, reducing the damage received by 40%. He isn't a total tank though; with a weakness to high speed, ripping attacks, he will have to watch his back.Plant Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Ice Slasher, Blizzard Attack, Freeze Cracker, Ice Wave, Ice Wall Being a shield robot master, Plant Man plays similar to that of Star Man or Skull Man, but with more emphasis on a long-range and melee style gameplay. He comes with an unlimited ammo Plant Buster, and the Plant Barrier which can be worn or thrown. When worn it deals persistent damage like the Star Crash, but also steals life as long as it continues to hit. The thrown shield has a very large hitbox and can be used to harass distanced foes.Mega Man 7 Classes Freeze Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Oil Slider, Dust Crusher, Junk Shield Freeze Man jumps in with his signature Freeze Cracker and a cool pose. His Primary Fire is a slightly different version of the Freeze Cracker: It looks different then Mega Man's and only splits if it hits a wall, shooting out 4 shards compared to Mega Man's 6 shards. If it hits the ground, it becomes a temporary icy spike in the ground, and a falling ice stalactite if it hits the ceiling. His Alt-Fire shoots a Freeze Wave that generates numerous spikes on the ceiling or floor. Use it to torment groups of brawlers. His weakness is Junk Shield, as well as similar polluting weapons.Junk Man  Speed: Slow (0.6 forward/backward, 0.58 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Thunder Beam, Spark Shock, Thunder Bolt, Thunder Claw, Lightning Bolt This pile of scrap is a lot stronger and dangerous than he looks. He has quite a variety of attacks for a single class. Althrough Junk Man is pretty slow (and so are his attacks), he has a higher armor and normal jump. His potential can shine better in large deathmatches or in crowd control, on the opposite side, duels can reveal themselves quite delicate, playing as him. This being said, while he may be a little frustrating at first because of the slowness in its moves, in counterpart, he's an extremely high damage dealer. Especially at very close range, where it's possible to kill in one or two hits his enemies, with some proper control. His ammo automatically, slowly refills over time. Collecting lost pieces of junk increase the refilling's speed. His main-fire costs 50% of the junk ammo. It generates a huge Junk Cube that stays in place and deals heavy, sitting ripping damage for the foolish to dare inspect it closely. It can be destroyed\u00a0: the block has 200 HP. This block's large hitbox could block the way of narrow passes, or could simply act as a field shield where Junk Man can protect behind (it's not solid, through it can still serves as a dangerous obstacle). It can also be propelled forward with his alt-fire punch attack. When pushed, it slowly slides until it contact with something solid, where it will blast into junk pieces to collect. In the sliding state, the Junk Cube gain additional power and invulnerability\u00a0! The block can't be destroyed while sliding. It can be considered as a distance attack, through it's fairly slow and since it costs a lot of ammo, it's better to think twice about propelling it. Since the block releases a lot of ammo when destroyed, it may be useful to erase the useless blocks by pushing them on the nearby wall, in order to recover some ammo for other attacks. The altfire, in addition to pushing the Junk Block, acts as a close range attack similar to Guts Man's punch. While a tiny weaker than Guts', Junk Man's punch additionally shoots a mini Junk Cube projectile in an arc that deals 25 damage. This junk shot can be used at distance, assuming Junk Man has enough ammo to fire it (costs about 12% by shot). It's a good attack to rely on some distant enemies. The throws Junk Cube becomes collectable ammo when it contacts with something solid. What would Junk Man be without his Junk Shield? You can activate it through item-fire, by consuming 37,5% of the ammo bar, and it will also give you weak hugging damage capacities on top of the obvious armor bonus!Burst Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Fire Storm, Atomic Fire, Pharaoh Shot, Scorch Wheel, Flame Sword, Wave Burner Let the festivities begin! Burst Man has arrived, and he's got his Danger Wrap to back him up, which behaves alost exactly like Mega Man's: the bombs blow up after a little while instead of attaching to the floor!. His Alt-Fire sticks his buster in the ground to pump up a huge bubble that you can use to float up high or to trap enemies inside!Cloud Man  Speed: Slow (0.6 forward/backward, 0.58 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Very High* (10, plus very low gravity) Weaknesses: Bubble Lead, Danger Wrap Time to rain on your parade! Cloudman may be slow and lacks regenerative ammo, but he can be very menacing and overwhelming. His Main Fire is a Thunder Bolt that moves fairly slowly, but it's powerful and splits just like the copy weapon. When Cloud Man is out of ammo, the Thunder Bolt will have a delay before firing and won't split. His Alt-Fire mainly just recharges ammo when he uses it on the ground, but the charge he brings down on himself can also fry any enemies unlucky enough to be directly above him. Naturally, Cloud Man also has the ability to fly; using his Alt-Fire while flying creates a bolt of lightning that drops straight down to the ground, breaking into 6 sparks that travel along the ground. His weakness is the wrappy Danger Wrap, as well as the leady Bubble Lead.Spring Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Extremely High (20) Weaknesses: Rolling Cutter, Metal Blade, Shadow Blade, Gyro Attack, Slash Claw Boing! The infamous Spring Man is here to bounce to victory! He has a very high jump, beating that of Gravity Man and Toad Man. His Main Fire is Wild Coil, which only fires one spring until it his the ground, where it then spreads. His Alt-Fire is a spring-loaded punch that reaches long distances and can be used in the air. His weakness is Slash Claw, as well as similar shredding weapons.Slash Man  Speed: Medium (0.83 forward/backward, 0.81 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Ice Slasher, Blizzard Attack, Freeze Cracker, Ice Wave, Ice Wall The Mega Man Series' Wolverine prowls behind the battle, ready to pounce on his prey and rip it to bits! Slash Man is as deadly as ever, with his famous, short-ranged Slash Claw for his Main Fire. His Alt-Fore lets him dash through the battle towards the hapless victim. This is a great way to ambush oblivious enemies. However, if you slash during the dash, you ammo bar hits rock bottom, so use it wisely.Shade Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal* (10, slowly glides down) Weaknesses: Leaf Shield, Pharaoh Shot, Water Wave, Silver Tomahawk, Wild Coil, Mirror Buster, Vampire Killer Seven! Seven useless Robot Masters! Ah ah ah ah! Shade Man can fire his infamous Noise Crush, which behaves like Mega Man's version. His Alt-Fire lets him fly, but to stay airborne, you must keep using it. His Main-Fire while airborne lets him dive at targets, while also sucking their HP away. His weakness is Wild Coil, as well as other vampire-banishing weapons. What, springs kill vampires, you didn't know? The latest technological discovery in the Wallachia Principality. Well, moving on...Turbo Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses. Quick Boomerang, Needle Cannon, Yamato Spear, Noise Crush, Screw Crusher Vroom, vroom! Turbo Man is ready to hit (and run) the road! His Main-Fire is Scorch Wheel, which behaves exactly like Mega Man's version. His Alt-Fire turns him into his car form, which launches him forward at an incredible speed. It uses a lot of ammo, but it can be cancelled. Weakness is Noise Crush, as well as other weapons that could sabotage any automobile-based automata.Mega Man 8 Classes Astro Man  Speed: Medium-Slow (0.7 forward/backward, 0.68 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses, Magnet Missile, Dive Missile, Homing Sniper, Magic Card This trickster Robot Master isn't built well for battle, but you can bet he has many tricks up his sleeve. His mainfire attack is a very simplistic buster shot at first, but when used, it summons up to two hard light Copy Visions that will only shoot in the direction you faced when summoned. Despite being slow and nimble, he is able to float well above safe ground, but not enough to be considered flying. Not only that, but his altfire attack is the all-powerful Astro Crush...don't worry, it's not as powerful as the copy weapon, but it's still fearful nonetheless. Seek him out of whatever is inbetween the ground and the actual sky.Grenade Man  Speed (BASE): Medium (0.74 forward/backward, 0.72 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Thunder Beam, Spark Shock, Thunder Bolt, Thunder Claw, Lightning Bolt Crush everyone! Grenade Man is going to bring you pain! His mainfire weapon is a slightly toned down Flash Bomb (phew), and his altfire is a spread of surprisingly weak normal grenades. Then what's the catch? You see, Grenade Man is a bit of a...looney. The more damage he takes, the \"happier\" he'll be, and it will show on his \"rage\" ammo: his base speed increases, his Flash Bomb's rate of fire will increase (oh nooo), and he will be able to shoot a lot more grenades, all at the cost of his ammo. Oh, and what's that other ammo bar, then? You may not want to get close to Grenade Man when he's destroyed...whip him out, show him who's the master of flashes.Sword Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Bubble Lead, Rain Flush, Water Wave, Water Balloon Nothing personal, but this dude can pack a punch (or a slice)! His Flame Sword isn't as deadly as the copy weapon, but no ammo restriction sure sounds nice when coupled with a sturdy armor and base speed! His altfire attack is one of the most complex weapons any class has ever had, but don't feel threatened! When you press altfire for the first time, you will be able to shoot and control your spinning firey torso at enemies, while your other half stays defenseless. Pressing altfire again will switch your point of view between the upper half and the lower half of your body: while in upper torso view, you can direct its path with your aim controls, and while in lower torso view, you can move around with the movement controls. The spinning Fire Slash will eventually slow down and deal less damage the more time it is out, so don't depend too much on it, and make yourself complete once more with the mainfire button. Douse him out from afar!Search Man  Speed: Medium-Slow (0.7 forward/backward, 0.68 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses. Fire Storm, Atomic Fire, Pharaoh Shot, Flame Blast, Scorch Wheel, Flame Sword, Wave Burner Enemy sighted! Let's go! A Search Man's job is a good job! His Primary-Fire will shoot the Homing Sniper seeker missiles, and you can charge it to shoot up to four missiles at once. While you hold it, a target will be shown wherever you aim to all players: while holding the mainfire button, if your reticle passes over players, the missiles you shoot will be locked onto them, so aim at as many people as you can, for you will shoot one missile per targeted enemy! Search Man is a stealth sniper, so he's able to summon camouflage-coated bushes for himself and allies become invisible while inside of them: believe me, a group of semi-transparent bushes will pass undetected in a battlefield, especially if they're far from the action, where your Homing Sniper is more effective. In the case you are detected, use your altfire attack, the Search Disk, to fend off players with more direct damage than one of your missiles. Burn him with no mercy!Tengu Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses. Ice Slasher, Blizzard Attack, Freeze Cracker, Ice Wave, Spread Drill, Ice Wall Are you worthy of his challenge? Tengu Man is able to turn his floating abilities like Astro Man through itemfire, but his mainfire dash attack allows him to achieve more height when aimed upwards, as well as shooting the wind-cutter Kamaitachi. His altfire attack is the Tornado Hold, which propels enemies upwards and inmobilizes them wile airborne, this giving Tengu Man the opportunity to perform his special Tengu Slam, by hitting them up close with his mainfire dash attack. The higher the enemies are hit with the Tengu Slam, the more damage they'll sustain! Freeze this bewitching calamity!Frost Man  Speed: Extremely Slow (0.5 forward/backward,\u00a00.48 side) Armor: Hard (x0.5) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Hyper Bomb, Crash Bomb, Drill Bomb, Napalm Bomb, Danger Wrap, Flash Bomb, Remote Mine, Ballade Cracker I WILL *dramatic pause* BEAT YOU! Frost Man is simple, yet deadly. A mammoth of a Robot Master, he sports stats only fitting for a weapon of his size: the very thickest armor and the very slowest movement speed, matching Hard Man on both counts. His mainfire attack is a triple Ice Wave, but each firing of it requires significant charge-up time. These waves have the special property of freezing enemies in their place, allowing Frost Man to punch them to death with his altfire attack. Explosives will pierce through his thick body and damage his internal components!Clown Man  Speed: Fast (0.93 forward/backward, 0.91 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: Medium-High (12) Weaknesses: Air Shooter, Wind Storm, Tornado Hold This isn't a joking matter! Clown Man boasts faster base speed and jump height, and the ability to place Thunder Claw trapezes anywhere he wants for a Thunder Swing attack, as well as allowing him to traverse large pits and high structures easily. The trapezes will stay for quite a long time, so you and other players can use them more than once. You can choose to use two weapons: one with the trapeze in his hand as his mainfire attack, and one without it as the mainfire attack. Both weapons have the same altfire: an attack where Clown Man is able to burrow his hands underground and raise them up wherever you aim for a...grabby hand attack that holds enemies in place for a bit. Additionally, his mainfire attack creates an Electric Aura around Clown Man's body, slightly damaging people as well. His long whip-like hands are easily entangled by strong wind currents!Aqua Man  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Super Arm, Hard Knuckle, Power Stone, Astro Crush The most handsome Robot Master ever created! Aqua Man's ammo must be manually recharged through altfire, and has two mainfire attacks: one of them is the Water Balloon attack, slightly stronger than the copy weapon, but with rate of fire limitations if ammo is depleted completely. Aqua Man's pressure can be build up to fill two bars, and when both bars are full, his mainfire attack changes into the Water Cannon: a dangerous and slightly odd water ray that homes into enemies, but can be easily avoided because of its slow and limited method of movement. His body can be easily broken with strong enough projectiles!Mega Man Killers Enker  Speed: Fast (1.0 forward/backward, 0,9 side) Armor: Sturdy (x0.8) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Hyper Bomb, Crash Bomb, Drill Bomb, Napalm Bomb, Danger Wrap, Flash Bomb, Remote Mine, Ballade Cracker The counter-happy Mega Man Killer enters the fray! Enker's Primary Fire will fire weak Mirror Buster shots, but activate Alt-Fire to raise Enker's Barrier Spear, which greatly reduces incoming damage AND your movement speed to a halt, and converts all damage taken during this pose into ammunition for the Mirror Buster. As long as it has sufficient ammunition, the Mirror Buster will fire much more powerful blasts of energy, up to 4 shots! Sturdy armor and high speed, at the expense of your main method of attack implying constant damage input.Quint  Speed: Medium (0.8 forward/backward, 0.78 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: None Quint isn't exactly a Mega Man Killer, but you have to feel sorry for him. He has nowhere else to fit in! He features two weapons: the Quint Buster, and his trademark Sakugarne! The Quint Buster is a simple variant on the vanilla Mega Buster, having a slightly slower rate of fire and slight spread, and is useful for covering Quint's weakness at long-range. His second weapon is the mighty Sakugarne with a twist. Quint's Sakugarne adds a forward momentum on each jump, more evident on the first one, making movement much easier and combat-friendly! When Sakugarne lands, nearby foes will be damaged, and its vertical movement can be altered with the two fire buttons. Primary Fire will add some height to Quint's bounces, and Alt-Fire will drive him down into the ground, crushing any unwitting foe underneath Quint and scattering debris. Highly damaging close range attack and no weaknesses, at the cost of exposure and mediocre stats.Punk  Speed: Medium (0.75 forward/backward, 0.7 side) Armor: Normal (x1.0) Jump: Normal (10) Weaknesses: Time Slow, Time Bender, Gemini Laser, Flash Stopper, Flash Bulb, Crystal Eye, Centaur Flash, Centaur Arrow, Copy Vision, Mirror Buster This rockin' bot features two weapons, both variants on his trademark Screw Crusher. The first variant fires a ripping screw straight ahead like a standard projectile, and the other fires gravity-obeying screws like Mega Man's variant. His Alt-Fire on both weapons is the Pile Driver. Slow to initiate, the Pile Driver will charge up for about one second and then launch Punk in a straight line incredible distances. Pile Driver rips through enemies, and so a direct hit is almost certain to kill. General good stats and attacks, at the expense of beng weak to player-handicapping attacksBallade  Speed: Medium-Fast (0.9 forward/backward, 0.8 side) Armor: Light (x1.2) Jump: High (13) Weaknesses: Rolling Cutter, Metal Blade, Shadow Blade, Gyro Attack, Silver Tomahawk, Tengu Blade, Screw Crusher Ballade brings his signature Ballade Cracker to the battlefront, which launches an explosive projectile forward at great speed. It features great splash damage and firing rate, making it a favorite among users. His Alt-Fire will drop a Ballade Cracker to serve as a landmine, and will scoot Ballade forward a small bit. Up to three mines can be laid at one time, so make use of that high jump and speed. Splash damage and high mobility, at the expense of low armor and ripper spam weaknesses.Story Mode  The Single Player mode of MM8BDM is essentially a play through all the maps in the game with set bots. After so many levels, the player fights special bosses exclusive to singleplayer.Story Plot  The story of the game takes place one year after the events of Mega Man 6. After Mega Man defeated Dr. Wily for the 6th time, the real Mr. X was found and rescued. In celebration of his heroic efforts, Mr. X hosted the second annual robot master tournament with new rules and arenas. With permission from Dr. Light, each robot would have to be reprogrammed use the weapon swapping abilities of Mega Man to keep the competition fair. During the final announcement of the tournament, Mega Man and Dr. Light's television is interrupted by Dr. Wily. He states that the tournament is a great idea, and that he wishes to prove his genius by entering all his robots to prove once and for all that Dr. Wily is superior to Dr. Light. With no leads on where Dr. Wily could be hiding, or what he could be plotting, Dr. Light decides to enter Mega Man and his other creations to the tournament to ensure Dr. Wily doesn't have anything hidden up his sleeves...In-game  The player starts in Dr. Light's lab where Dr. Light explains the situation and briefly how to configure their controls. The player character is a unique robot to the series (not Mega Man) created by an unknown for the purpose of watching over the events of the Tournament (by entering it), and putting a stop anything that intervenes with the event. After the second chapter boss battle, Dr. Light is positive that Dr. Wily is behind the attacks. It turns out no one can locate Dr. Wily until the player beats chapter 4 where Dr. Light figures out where he obtained some of the parts for one of the attacking robots. After Chapter 5 Dr. Light tells the player that the police have arrested Dr. Wily, and that the player should continue the tournament anyway as they're doing so well.Ending of Chapter 6 (Pre-V5b)  Yes only does the player win the tournament, but also defeated Dr. Wily in the final battle and all the reprogrammed Robot Masters that entered the tournament. It is never explained how Dr. Wily escaped prison again (or even if the arrest actually happened) or where he was exactly hiding. The Last scene of Chapter 6 shows the player robot encased in gold in an abandoned Robot Museum, where Mega Man X appears and admires the player character before the Credits roll.(Any ways... His Story do Not end Here...)Chapters  The game is split up into chapters. Each chapter represents all the levels in each Mega Man game.Boss Rush mode  Prior to v3a, upon beating the game, a new mode is unlocked called Boss Rush mode. In this mode the player simply fought nearly all the bosses in the game without having to go through each chapter, save for Enker, Punk, Ballade and Wily Capsule. After beating all the bosses, the game's ending plays as if you beat Chapter 6. Boss Rush can be found in Auto's section of the lab. This feature was removed in v3a, presumably because of the redesigned save feature allowing the player to jump to any point reached in the campaign, including bosses. The functionality is still in the game, however \u2014 by typing \"set secret_bossrush 1\" into the console before entering a boss level, the game will automatically move on to the next boss. As of v4a, all bosses after Chapter 6 are accounted for, including Duo, Buster Rod G, Mega Water S, and Hyper Storm H.Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch  Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch, or MM8BDM is a total conversion for Skulltag created by CutmanMike and the Cutstuff community. MM8BDM completely changes Skulltag to look, act, and feel like the 8-bit Mega Man games, but in a Doom environment. Almost a year of work was put into the game. A demo version was playable at the Screwattack Gaming Convention on July 2-4, 2010 and the demo was released to the public on July 7. The full version, was released on October 8, 2010. The current version is v5c and runs on Zandronum 3.0 (forked from the Skulltag engine).Features and uniquities  MM8BDM strives to unify Doom-style gaming with Mega Man's game world.Single Player Mode  While the primary focus of the game is on the multiplayer aspects, the game also comes equipped with a nice story mode. Much like Quake 3's single player mode, the story mode is a campaign selecting all 78 of the deathmatch levels, plus several boss arenas.Multiplayer Mode  As good as the storyline is and the boss fights are in Single Player Mode, the bots leave a lot to the imagination. Thus, people looking for a balanced, aggressive, and advanced deathmatch game might consider playing online. The game also supports a majority of Skulltag's game modes without any trouble. There exists extra maps to support the CTF game modes (Including 4FCTF).Stages  As stated above, there are 78 Deathmatch and 20 Capture the Flag stages. The deathmatch stages are the main attraction of the game, being arenas based on the various boss levels of Mega Man 1-8, plus fortress stages, while the CTF game mode features level inspired by Mega Man's stages; but aren't made of according to a Robot Master.Equipment Weapons  As mentioned, every Robot Master's weapon has been accounted for in this game from the Rolling Cutter, a boomerang-like scissor-head, to the mighty Astro Crush, a rain of powerful meteors. There's even a few extra weapons in there to add even more variety to your gameplay experience! Items In addition to the weaponry, the game has a number of helpful items that can give players the edge over their opponents, upgrade their Mega Buster, or assist them.Enemies  The only destroyable enemies placed in normal levels at this time are the 100 Watton and Dompan, both in Bright Man's level, which turn off and turn on the lights respectively. In certain boss fights, Mets -- little helmeted fellows that spit bullets at you -- can also be seen. Otherwise, the game is devoid of standard enemies. However, the vanilla game does feature a number of bosses and mini-bosses based on similar encounters found within the Mega Man universe.Chapter Bosses Mini-Bosses  In addition to the bosses, if certain requirements are met, you can fight certain mini-bosses. Beat them, and their weapon is yours for the rest of the chapter!External links Multiplayer  The Multiplayer Mode is one of the main attractions of Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch. It has a great variety of options for the players:Supported Game Modes: Teams  Currently, MM8BDM supports 4 teams: Dr. Light (Blue), Dr. Wily (Red), Dr. Cossack (Green) and King (Yellow). They all have unique result screens and music.Items  There is a large amount of items in the game, scattered throughout the stages, serving either healing, supporting, or boosting attack. Here's a list of the items with their effects.Pickups  These items can't be stored and are used immediately on pick-up.Usable Items  These items can be stored in the player's inventory and used at their leisure. Be careful, though! If you die while carrying any items, you lose them completely!Upgrades  The Buster Upgrades are item that replace your current buster weapon with another valuable buster weapon, erasing the previous equipped buster. Most of the buster upgrades are better and more polyvalent than the Mega Buster.Other Items  Below are the items that don't belong to a specific category (categories such as tanks, buster upgrades, pickups...)Removed Items  While a number of items made the final cut into the game, there are a handful which didn't. Those are here. They still exist in the current .PK3 file, but can only be accessed through hacking.Other  Special items that are associated with secrets, at the moment there is only one.Cutstuff  Cutstuff, located at Cutstuff.net, is the official home of not only Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch, but a number of other Doom-related projects created by CutmanMike and associates.History  Cutstuff fist started as gothic.34sp but eventually was given it's own domain name in early 2008. It first started as a basic page for CutmanMike to host and display his creations (mainly Doom WADs). Eventually it turned into a blog. After the release of Ghouls vs Humans, a forum was started and a small community was born. After the announcement and release of MM8BDM, the community grew tremendously. After struggling to keep bandwidth under his 25gb limit, CutmanMike was forced to move to a VPS server with 1.5TB of bandwidth. Because of the costly move, he has started taking donations to help pay for the cost of it's huge amount of viewers. Visit Cutstuff.net if you wish to donate!Projects Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch  Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch is a project started by CutmanMike that turns Doom into an 8-bit Mega Man themed multiplayer first person shooter.Ghouls vs. Humans  Ghouls vs Humans is a team deathmatch/team LMS themed WAD starring the cast from The Ghoul's Forest 3. The idea of the wad is that there are two teams which have different classes. The human side gets the Marine, Hunter and Cyborg while the ghouls get Sjas, Creeper and Jitterskull. Instead of finding weapons and health around the arena, the classes only have the weapons and powers they start with as no items are spawned in the map. From the day of its beta release, GVH received mixed opinions. It was mostly praised for its frantic gameplay, influence of team work and unique classes. Others felt the gameplay was unbalanced and the maps were not cut out for the style of play intended. Despite this, GVH has been played almost every single day for just under a year since its 31/10/08 public beta release. Ghouls vs Humans received one of the 16th Annual Cacowards.Other Projects  Todo...Staff  Cutstuff has a quite large community, and in order to keep it in order, a small staff is employed.External Links Super Arm  The Super Arm is a weapon that allows you to hurl huge boulders at your enemies. Unlike in Mega Man 1, you raise the boulders from the ground rather than having to find them first. Once lifted, a boulder stays above your head until you press fire again to throw it. When the boulder lands, it breaks into 4 smaller rocks that fly forward and damage anyone in the way. The combined damage can be quite brutal.Tactics Using Super Arm  Super Arm is a very situational weapon that isn't recommended for huge free for alls, but it can be effective in certain situations. As it throws the rock in an awkward arc, it is usually best to aim much lower than your target. Try to aim the boulders so that the large rock hits your opponent as well as the 4 debris projectiles, causing massive damage.Vs. Super Arm  The most dangerous place to be when facing a Super Arm user is the middle ground between long and close range. If your opponent is far away, you usually have nothing to worry about unless their aim is dead on. You can also get up close and overwhelm them with an all-out assault, but keep in mind that they can still hit you at point-blank range if they aim straight down. Surprisingly, Leaf Shield can reflect the boulder and its debris despite the size of the rock.Unknown (Deathmatch)  Unknown (or UNKOWN) is a special map that can only be accessed through the single-player campaign (or through some tweaking) at the end of each chapter. It is used for boss battles and other special events such as the ending. Attempting to play this map in Skirmish or Multiplayer will redirect all players to Cut Man's stage.Description  At first glance, it seems like a series of stages with the exact same name. However, a little investigation reveals that it's actually one big stage with multiple smaller segments, each coded with a specific purpose in mind; the purpose of destroying the player! Here in lay the most fiendish traps and destructive enemies in the entire game! Can you beat them? You'll have to if you want to survive...and progress.Bosses Yellow Devil  The end of Chapter 1 finds you in an empty corridor. Suddenly, a voice from nowhere begins shouting gibberish. Soon enough, you're being pelted with firm, golden globs of goop from behind! Enter the Yellow Devil. Straight out of Mega Man, the Yellow Devil flies across the room in pieces only to reform on the opposite side. Only once he reforms does he become vulnerable. Exchange fire with him, dodge his attacks, and achieve victory for you and Dr. Light!Guts Dozer  Another chapter's end, another seemingly empty corridor. However, this one has a gate at the end. A really, really big gate. And behind that really, really big gate waits a really, really big enemy! The Guts Dozer attacks similar to how he did in Mega Man 2, though this time, he continually rolls toward you with the intent of crushing your robotic body into scrap metal. Not only will it fire bouncing shots at you, but it also tosses the occasional Metool your way! The joke's on him, however. Randomly, a Met will drop an Item-1 powerup or a Quick Boomerang pick-up. Use these to your advantage and make short work of the Guts Dozer just like Mega Man did years before.Doc Robot Endurance Match  Four weapons, four teleporter pads, a few assorted items, and eight very angry robots with eight familiar powers. What's a robot to do but fight back? You'll have to fight each of the eight Doc Robots one-by-one, each claiming a weapon from the Mega Man 2 Robot Masters. As such, treat this boss battle like you would a typical Deathmatch fight. Calmly attack on each Doc Robot as he appears, being careful of whatever weapon he throws at you. Heal between fights, use items when necessary, and after eight fights, you've won! Note: Doc Robot Flash Man appears in Bass' colors and uses the Bass Buster instead of the Time Stopper due to limitations with the AI programming.Metool Daddy\u00a0& Cossack Catcher  Upon entering the room, it would appear as though you're fighting the Cockroach Twins. Could Dr. Cossack be getting in on the action? The answer is yes. However, just as the battle gets underway, the Cockroach Twins get stomped flat by the second biggest Metool you've ever seen! This battle is extremely tricky. Not only are you fighting a giant Metool capable of hiding and shielding itself, but with its immense size, it can easily stomp you into dust! Not only that, but it crashes to the floor so hard, it spawns Metools of random varieties! There's a couple ways you can take on the Metool Daddy. Either way, fire whatever weapon you happen to have as rapidly as you can while he's exposed and make sure to clear out any Mets wandering your way. (Drill Bomb works wonderfully in both cases.) With any luck, you should be able to beat him without taking too much damage.Dark Man  Dark Man. A robot that once framed Proto Man for kidnapping Dr. Light and sending terror into the city. Quite a powerful adversary to be sure. His shots are very powerful and his shield hurts on-contact. Be wary... There really isn't any trick to fighting Dark Man. The best advice is to grab the Proto Upgrade as quickly as possible and try and use charged shots when he throws his shields at you. It is possible to take him down without charged shots or even by using the standard Mega Buster, but quite difficult.Robot Master Rematch  Dr. Wily shows his face! Unfortunately, he's not alone... Seems that all those robots you beat earlier during the tournament are a little angry with you and want revenge. Prepare for the longest, most draining battle in the entire game. As with the Doc Robot match earlier, this is just a normal one-on-one duel. Or rather, 48 one-on-one duels. In a row. Luckily, there's a checkpoint after every eight Robot Masters in case you do manage to die. On top of that, after beating every Robot Master, you gain their weapon (and keep them if you die, no less!). Use this to your advantage. From V.3 onwards, Time Man and Oil Man are added to this mayhem.Gamma  It's baaaaack...and badder than ever. The ultimate peacekeeping robot returns, fully powered and once again going against its original intention! What's more, it seems immune to everything you could possibly throw at it! How can you possibly beat such a powerful machine?! In actuality, it's easier than it seems. If you time it just right, you can jump up and avoid damage when Gamma stomps the floor. His beam attacks are also fairly easy to dodge if you're paying attention. The problem comes with doing damage, though. Luckily, everyone's favorite robot of mystery whistles in and drops you a decent hint. Grab a powerful weapon from your massive arsenal and let loose on its lone weakspot! Do enough damage to bring it do its knees, then finish it off with a spin to come out on top!Wily Capsule  Remember that one boss from Mega Man 7\u00a0? The one that really infuriated you and made you throw the controller against the wall? Yep... It's back. And this time, it hits even harder than before! Luckily, aiming up is no problem this time.Duo  Duo must stop the evil energy, and it seems you're preventing him. You have to fight this powerful robot, but an Arrow Buster Upgrade is there to help you, in a similar way to the Proto Buster while the fight with Dark Man. He has three different attacks, among them two based on his Duo Fist. He may heavily bounce like a comet in the entire room (or like Armored Armadillo). He can also throw three mid-punches toward you, or tackle toward you, crushing his fist to the ground, dealing a major seismic earthshake that may even OHKO if you don't jump on time over the earth wave.Evil Energy Robot  The Evil Energy Robot is the robot seen only in the opening to Mega Man 8, and serves as the final boss of Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch Version 3. The Evil Energy Robot utilizes specialized versions of each Robot Master weapon, which are far more upgraded and deadlier than before. Eight color-coded orbs will appear around the Evil Energy Robot before he chooses his attack. Knowing what each one does and how to avoid them is key to winning the fight. After thrashing the robot around with a few well placed charged fists, the Evil Energy Robot finally explodes and explode, sending its parts lifelessly floating throughout the stars, thus signalling the end of the Megaman 8 campaign. Duo looks to the sunset and contemplates how he was wrong about how there seemed to be no one fighting for justice anymore. Now that he had met the plucky and determined tournament robot, he reconsidered, knowing that there was still at least some good left in the world willing to fight for everlasting peace.King Buster Rod G Mega Water S Hyper Storm H Genesis Unit Challenge Battles  If certain conditions are met during the Story Mode, you may find yourself fighting three special bosses as well as the normal battles.Enker  Yes wanting to be outdone by common robots, Mega Man Killer #001 steps into Flash Man's arena to challenge you to a duel! The battle against Enker is like a typical deathmatch, save for some glaring differences. One is that you can't get to this fight through conventional means, as stated above. The other is that if you die once, that's it. You move on to Quick Man's stage without his special weapon. Anyways, if you know what you're doing, Enker shouldn't be too hard. There are several weapons laying around the arena, but they are near death pits, which puts the risk of falling into these if you overshoot your running trying to get these. Enker only really runs erratically about the stage, and only stops to charge and fire his Mirror Buster at you. The telltale flash before this attack is enough of a warning, so leave his general area or shoot him. He can also hack you with his sword if you are close enough. If you succeed in this fight, Enker's Mirror Buster is yours for the remainder of Chapter 2.Punk  In an isolated area of Drill Man's stage, a rust-red robot with a rowdy routine raises a ruckus! Punk only has a couple of attacks, but, like the others before him, you only get one try in this fight. If you screw up, you don't start over like you would in an actual boss fight, which means you'll automatically be booted to the next stage in Story Mode, win or lose. His first attack is to fire his Screw Crusher at you. Not too difficult to dodge, unless you're careless and end up getting shot. His only other attack is to curl up into his disk form and dash at you. This attack is the most lethal of the two, in that it can do anywhere from a massive chunk of your life bar to the enitre thing! Dodging this requires you to continue moving uring this attack. If you're a bit late, Punk will sock you and you risk the possibility of getting hit by an OHKO. You must continue all around the arena and keep your sights trained on him. If you miss a couple of shots, don't worry about it; keep firing! Upon Punk's defeat, you earn his Screw Crusher for use throughout the rest of Chapter 4Ballade  On the crown of Knight Man's citadel lay he who wishes to challenge only the strongest of the strong. Onto the final Mega Man Killer fight! By this point, you know the drill: one life, no continues, die once, leave stage. Ballade is a little more dangerous than Enker, but slightly easier than Punk, in than he can't pull a one hit kill. However, like the other MMKs before, he has his own weapon, the Ballade Cracker. This weapon acts as a landmine, to be set in a spot and detotnate when either someone comes into contact with them (i.e., you), or they detonate by themselves. Ballade will jump around a lot, so don't whine about how your shots continually miss. It is either due to incompetence, or his constant jumping. That, and you need to try and avoid those Ballade Crackers he lays everywhere, so this fight is not exactly easy. The\u00a0Air Shooter is your best bet in this battle. Of course, it was hard to dodge in the original game, so here, you can play the role of\u00a0Air Man (DM) and blow Ballade away with it. With this weapon, it shouldn't be too hard. There is a constant supply of health and weapon energy, so if you're ever running low on either, run aroun the arena and collect some! Once Ballade falls in battle, the Ballade Cracker is yours for Chapter 6 and the rest of the game.Cheats  To jump to certain stages, you must enter the following codes into the console before or as you enter the Unknown map.Rolling Cutter  Rolling Cutter throws a huge pair of scissor blades that rips through enemies before boomeranging back to its user, causing heavy damage in the process. Only one Rolling Cutter can be out at any given time; no more can be thrown until the first one returns to its owner. It shines in enclosed areas, as it bounces off walls repeatedly before returning. It can also do damage and pass through walls while returning to its owner. It is a popular weapon in smaller games but is also useful in larger matches thanks to its piercing property.Tactics Using Rolling Cutter  As they can only be thrown one at a time, making your throws count is crucial. Try to aim where your enemy is strafing towards. One direct hit can sometimes cause an instant kill. Be prepared to run if you miss, though! It is also great to use when Robot Masters are huddled together during combat. Just toss that Rolling Cutter in there and watch the frag count rise!Vs. Rolling Cutter  Back away from your opponent and watch which direction the Rolling Cutter goes. If it passes you and ends up behind you, be prepared to dodge as it may hit you on the way back to its owner. Powerful close range weapons can counter it if you're fast enough. If the owner dies, the Rolling Cutter disappears as well. You can jump over the Rolling Cutter if your reactions are up to scratch--just make sure you have enough room!Ice Slasher  Ice Slasher is a rapid fire weapon that fires ice shards. The ice shards travel slowly across the stage and rip through anything that touches them. Unlike in Mega Man, they do not freeze enemies.Tactics Using Ice Slasher  Ice Slasher is best saved for battles where your opponents have little room to dodge. Because the Ice Slasher projectiles are so slow, it's usually best to get close up to your foes or try to create a \"wall\" of projectiles. It eats ammo fast so keep an eye on your weapon energy.Vs. Ice Slasher  Ice Slasher is useless at long distances so try to back away from your opponent and fire away. Ice Slasher projectiles are also easy to jump over if there's enough room. Leaf Shield can reflect Ice Slasher.Metal Blade  Metal Blade is a rapid firing weapon that throws circular saw blades that rip through enemies at a very fast pace. With its fast speed and good damage, it is considered one of the best all-around weapons in the game.Tactics Using Metal Blade  Metal Blades are good at both long and short range. At close range there's little your opponents can do to escape, if you can keep them in your sights. Just aim and fire, try not to waste them all!Vs. Metal Blade  Keep well away from anyone wielding Metal Blade and take cover as soon as you can. Counter with ranged weapons! Alternatively, strafing works well against this weapon as the blades have a small horizontal hitbox. As with all ripping weapons, try not to back up against incoming projectiles.See also  IG Metal BladeCutmanMike  CutmanMike is the creator of MM8BDM. He is known for creating many Doom mods in ZDoom and Skulltag, which usually aim towards a different style of gameplay completely. MM8BDM has been well-recieved in the Doom community. Examples of his creations and projects are: He also made a \"Weapon Template\", that provided information that helped those without any Decorate knowledge into making their first weapon and learn Decorate without much headache.Related Links Fire Storm  Fire Storm is a weapon that shoots out a fireball projectiles, while simultaneously surrounding the user with a damaging fireball that circles them. The fireball that is shot does solid damage, and the circling fireball deals splash damage around the user. Note that a new fireball cannot be shot until the Fire Storm's barrier fireball disappears.Tactics Using Fire Storm  Fire Storm is handy in tight duels, but it's best used in a group of Robot Masters. Walk right into a gathering of battling players, then fire off a few Fire Storm shots. If you get up close to someone, you can hit them with the fireball and the fire shield, doing massive damage. Of course, it's even better in a group situation, because not only can you really wallop one target, but you can also do some nice splash damage to interfering players who get a little too close.Vs. Fire Storm  It's best to keep your distance when taking on a Fire Storm user. You'll be safe from the fire shield attack, and you'll have plenty of time to dodge the fireball shot. Just pepper your foe with ranged weapons and you'll do fine. If you find yourself cornered with a pyromaniac, though, the Shadow Blade and Top Spin are excellent counters. As these weapons only work at close range and do substantially more damage than Fire Storm if aimed precisely, it will make your foe think twice before trapping you in their flames.Cut Man (Deathmatch)  Cut Man's Stage is the first level encountered in MM8BDM, and as such is one of the smallest, simplest and easiest to complete. It takes places in a unique setting that has been described as everything from an abandoned sawmill to a prison. It is known for its narrow corridors and low ceilings. This, combined with its small area, makes matches here very fast and frantic. Although the stage proper has no hazards, outcrops with spikes and a Big Eye stomping about can be seen outside the barred windows of its perimeter.Layout Pre V4  Cut Man's Stage consists of an outer hallway surrounding an central area, both square shaped. They are connected by wide openings in the center of the sides of the middle plaza. Needle Cannon and Gemini Laser can be found at the corners of this outer walkway, while you can grab Atomic Fire on a raised platform surrounded by four pillars in the exact center of the map. While in the central area, you will notice four large boxes you may recognize as  Super Cutter Launchers from Cut Man's original stage occupying the corners. These can be accessed by ladders near each corner of the stage's perimeter to obtain Ice Slasher, Napalm Bomb, Rolling Cutter and Air Shooter. The stage's only obstacles are brick cubes scattered throughout the map's center topped with large weapon and health pickups.V4  The Cut Man's Stage has been redesigned. Most importantly, the stage is now larger. The central area retains its weapon, as do the hallway corners. Between them, Freeze Cracker has been added. The hallway itself has one of the its parts changed into an elevated area, which contains Rolling Cutter in the middle, as well as Gemini Laser and Needle Cannon on the sides. This area can be accessed from the central one via a ladder. There are only two Super Cutter Launchers now, which house Thunder Claw and Air Shooter. Additionally, two exterior areas can be accessed from corridors, which have Flame Blast and Bubble Lead (one can also see Bladers flying by from here). Napalm Bomb has been removed from the map.Strategy  It's easy to score frags on Cut Man's stage simply by spamming most of the stage's weapons down the outer corridors. Gemini Laser is especially effective at creating chaos while Napalm Bomb and Air Shooter can be used to ambush players rounding corners. Because players tend to bunch up, especially in larger games, the piercing quality of Ice Slasher and Rolling Cutter will make them your best bet. If you need a reprieve from the action at any time, you can retreat to the central plaza where traffic is usually less.Mega Man Powered Up  The Megaman Powered Up expansion, organized by CutStuff member Myroc, is a collection of fan-made maps based off of the game of the same name. The pack includes 10 new maps, 3 new weapons, 4 new items, 18 new skins (most of which are Roll edits,) and the return of the famous Yashichi. It now has it's own Story Mode chapter selectable from the Single Player menu, not Dr. Light's Lab, and features a secret boss and a final boss with two forms. The current version being used is V1C which can be found here.Cut Man Powered Up Guts Man Powered Up Elec Man Powered Up Bomb Man Powered Up Ice Man Powered Up Fire Man Powered Up Oil Man Powered Up Time Man Powered Up Wily Castle 1 Powered Up Wily Castle 2 Powered Up Mega Man?  Mega Man? is a boss in Mega Man Powered Up that is encountered if the player plays as a Robot Master in his own stage. In Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch's Powered Up fan expansion, Mega Man? is encountered if the player beats Oil Man's stage within 5 minutes in Story Mode. He will walk around the arena, shooting either a regular shot, or a charged shot. He can also slide at the player. If the player defeats him, they will obtain and keep the Charge Mega Buster for the rest of the game. Like Enker, Punk and Ballade, the player only gets a single try against Mega Man?. If they are defeated, they will carry on without the Charge Mega Buster. Mega Man? was later added to the core game in version 5 appearing as a boss during Chapters 1, 3, and 5, making a final appearance in Chapter 6 before being destroyed. Mega Man? also helps initiate the plot of Chapter 2 by kidnapping Guts Man before the fight in Chapter 1.Wily Machine #1  Wily Machine #1 is the final boss in Mega Man Powered Up. In Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch's Powered Up fan expansion, Wily Machine #1 is also the final boss, fought at the end of its own Story Mode chapter. When the fight begins, the player recieves all the weapons from Mega Man Powered Up, but as there's no ammo pickups, they must use them wisely. Wily Machine #1 also uses various weapons against the player, with the Wily Capsule attached changing colour to match the weapon. However, whenever he uses a weapon, he gains a weakness to another. After being defeated once, Wily Machine #1 reveals its second form as the arena expands to a circular area. It starts to fly, and can move freely. It still uses the Robot Master weapons and weaknesses, but now the Wily Capsule turns blue occasionaly while Wily Machine #1 shoots lightning balls at the player. Once the Wily Machine #1 is trashed, the Mega Man Powered Up Story Mode is finished.Credits  The Dev Team Maps Weapons and Items Skins and Bots The Testers Special ThanksGuts-Dozer  The Guts-Dozer is a boss from Mega Man 2, built to resemble Guts Man. It was fought in Wily Stage 3. After completing the Mega Man 2 section of Story Mode, the player fights the Guts-Dozer. His weak spot is the jewel on his forehead. The Mets he shoots out can drop Quick Boomerang or Item-1, as well as small energy and weapons capsules. The player can use Item-1 to get on top of him and hit him with Quick Boomerang. The Mega Buster will do very little damage, so the Quick Boomerang is highly recommended. In Version 5, the Guts-Dozer is now fought outside of Wily Castle after a brief sequence where the player and Guts Man attempt to escape. Once outside, Guts Man will join the player in the ensuing fight. After the boss' HP has been depleted, Elec Man and Bomb Man arrive to help destroy the boss.Trivia External Links Skull Castle Entrance (Deathmatch)  Skull Castle Entrance is huge open battlefield in front of Dr. Wily's Skull Castle from Mega Man 2. It is based on the first stage of that castle, and features its famous music. Skull Castle Entrance has one of the largest collections of weaponry in the game, with 17 different pickups scattered about the scarred landscape. Although the map may appear to be relatively simple and dull at first, a little searching around the towering castle and surrounding structures will reveal some of the most powerful weapons in the game. Skilled use of the advanced weaponry here will always lead to victory. Besides boasting the largest open field in the game, Skull Castle Entrance has the highest \"ceiling\" in the game, which extends far past even the castle's highest ramparts. These conditions make the map ideal for Summoning large props and bosses. In fact, this is the only stage besides his original arena itself where Gamma can be spawned.Layout  Skull Castle Entrance is nothing more than a huge field broken up by minor elevation changes and small barrels surrounding by four large bunker-like structures from the beginning of the original Mega Man 2 stage in front of a leering Skull Castle to the north. Metal Blade is found in the dead center of the map flanked by two W-Tanks to the west and east near the bunkers. A Party Ball hovers over this area as well. Magnet Missile is at the foot of the castle to the north while Silver Tomahawk is on the opposite side to the south. Yamato Spear lies between the two eastern bunkers and Atomic Fire occupies the corresponding position to the west. North of the northern bunkers, Air Shooter is found to the east and Gyro Attack to the west. There are plenty more arms hidden on and around the bunkers themselves! The southeast bunker holds Leaf Shield and hides another Gyro attack in its corner. The same is true for Rain Flush and Super Arm respectively on the southwest bunker. Mirror Buster and Treble Sentry rest on the ledges of the northeast bunker which hides two Item-1 pickups on either side of it. Power Stone and an E-Tank decorate the final bunker which hides Item-1 drops as well. Finally, the immense castle occupying the stage's northern edge holds still more weapons on its exterior walls. The outermost layer, accessible via ladder, holds Ballade Cracker on its far east edge and Oil Slider on the far west. The middle of the ledge is broken by a higher middle platform containing Dive Missile. Still higher outcrops needing Item-1 to climb support Gravity Hold, Arrow Buster, and the greatest prize of all:Time Stopper.Strategy  The blatant lack of cover or indoor passages on this map will put your skills and experience with the stage's weapons to a true test. Air Shooter and Gyro Attack are useful for all around combat at short and mid range respectively. Yamato Spear and Rain Flush can be used on crowds to devastating effect while Ballade Cracker and Silver Tomahawk are perfect for hunting individual targets. While using Dive or Magnet Missile will score you a rare few frags, relying on them will keep you behind in the long run. Only bring them out when a weakened foe is fleeing. Finally, crowds can quickly overwhelm you from all sides on this map. Leaf Shield and Time Stopper are both good ways to escape unscathed.

Parts, plot, missions, sectors, ships, drones, turrets, stations, they all can be referenced here. Unless they're not there yet, in which case you can consign yourself to the insanely difficult/easy task of putting them here yourself. Read more about Flashbacker in case you wonder who maded the series in the first place.  This wiki is dumb typo -free. And please visit our Discord if you're interested in a fan game development. The ShellCore Command Fan Forums is currently being reworked at the moment, however the alternate of it is currently hosted at Jcink, called the ShellCore Redemption Community, it's in the work of setting up.ShellCore Command  ShellCore Command is a free flash game series developed by Flashbacker. The game combines adventure-RPG and RTS elements, as well as being able to fully customize your own ships. Flashbacker got most of his inspiration from the Battleship Forever and Herzog Zwei games, as some might have noticed. The goal of the game differs between the storyline series (Numbered episodes, essentially) and other releases (like ShellCore Command: Skirmish). The numbered episodes have an open world for the player to explore, starting out as a \"newborn\" (with the rather unique trait of receiving transmissions others do not) and advancing in size and power as the player progresses through the story. Occasionally, the player has to enter a Battlezone, where the RTS element comes into play. To win a Battlezone match is to destroy the enemy base (which will spawn it's own ShellCore commander to rival you), using all the resources and units you can gather in order to achieve this. ShellCore Command: Skirmish is centered on that RTS element, rather than the adventure in the other games, giving the player strategic scenarios to play in. You can also upload the configuration of your ship to the internet for others to use as the ShellCore opponent during a Skirmish scenario.The mostly complete list of pages on this wiki  Please add more when you create them (in alphabetical order)!Latest activity  Note: Please don't edit the pool. That will reset the votes.ShellCore Command: Episode 2: Infection  Shellcore Command: Episode 2, currently was not available officially to the general public and not released to any official flash game portals (noted by the fact that it was not legitimately sponsored by Flash Game Nexus, as their logo did not ever appear in the pre-load screen, the game run immediately after it loaded and without the presence of the \"Play\" button, unlike the other officially published games in the series), was the next installment in the Shellcore series. It takes the improvements from Skirmish, adds some more of its own as well as a few new concepts, and gives the thing a pretty good plot. You finally make it to the capital platforms, but, suprise, turns out you're getting infected yourself!Gameplay  EP 2 is actually EP1 plus the new areas and missions of EP 2. All of it follows the new rules. The game plays a bit like Skirmish, but better. Some new units were added, first off. The number of tanks was doubled from 3 to 6, with the addition of the fast Speeder Tank, the slightly slower and heavier Bullet Tank, and the anti- air station Rocket Tank. A new and very useful drone was added, the Worker Drone, which automatically picks up Shellcore parts and 'shards' (more on those later). There are also new parts. The most notable is Stealth, which, well, cloaks you for a short time. There's also the Gun, an anti-tank weapon; the Statis Field, an interesting ability which freezes nearby enemies but which isn't used much, if the community forums are anything to go by; and the Area Restore, which heals you and your allies (both Shell and Core). There's also one new station: Heavy Defense. Which is basically a Missile-shooting ground station. Sadly, it's only really used twice, first when going from the start, Haven 4, to the Capital Platforms, and then on the way to a certain spoilered location. Both times, they are quite easy to avoid. Otherwise, it just sits around in the core of said locations, never being used (unless you try to invade a infected sector with those defenses and are too weak or lazy to take them out). There are a lot of new enemy Shellcores,some of which have randomized abilities on them. The new Battlezones have a couple of new things. In one, the enemy has a whole bunch of carriers between you and their main ground base, with endless swarms of weak drones meant to take out your outposts and main base. In another, the enemy has TWO commanders. Luckily, you have an NPC commander on your side. Speaking of Battlezones, power units (from extractors/outposts and destroyed enemies) are now 20 power instead of 25. EP 2 also introduces Shards and core upgrades. See, like Skirmish, you have a part limit. But you can increase it with core upgrades. which you can buy from core upgraders. That is, to a point. You can upgrade your Core to a higher level (size-M and then Size-L) to allow for more, and, presumably, to make it tougher and more powerful. However, that requires not only money, but Shards. Shards are these little blue fragments that you can obtain by destroying 'power clusters' (which look similar to the things that generate power), found south of the Capital, and taking the fragments back to a yard. These things currently have no other purpose, though. Graphics Same as Skirmish. Audio Still same as Skirmish. MAJOR SPOILERS!!! Avoid unless you have finished Episode 2 already!Shellcore Command: Episode 2: The Infection Plot  Episode 2 begins exactly where Episode 1 left off. While you are still captured by an Infected Commander, this time you can continue on to Haven 4. At Haven 4 you report your capture and the conversation you had, then receive a Stealth part for free so that you can reach the Capitol Platforms in relative safety. You are then sent to the Capitol to report of your capture. After battling your way through many infected-filled sectors, you arrive at the Capitol. You should probably reconstruct at a yard then, because you're probably almost dead, but that is optional. You can wander through the Capitol a bit to familiarize yourself with the layout, then report to the largest shellcore in the Capitol South. He orders you to begin ground combat training. Once you are finished, you go to Battlezone Blah and destroy the ground base. Next, you follow the traitor frigate and kill him/die within 3 minutes (or you can refuse the mission, but there's no reason to do so). After that you talk to the Uninfected leader, who informs you that you may be infected. You will then have to get a Size-M core upgrade, to resist the infection. You'll need shards and 2k credits; you will get a task to get 10 shards. After you get the upgrade, you will get another task to fend off the Infected invasion on the Capitol Platforms. This next task will take some time. You must fly to each of the 8 sectors around the center and clear them of enemy forces; if any are left alive, all the infected in the sector will respawn. In counterclockwise order starting in the Capitol North, the enemies are: After this is done, you have finished all your Capitol missions! For now. You can fly around and farm for parts. Eventually you'll find Haven 5, a small, mostly empty sector with a Carrier and a Yard. The Carrier will give you missions to clear battlezones Upper, Cenral, and Lower. After completing this, you're ordered to scout Sector 450-310. When you do so, you're captured by the Infected leader again, who orders you to visit him at his Capitol, in the north. You should do so, as going back will acheive nothing. When you enter the sector below the Infected Capitol, you will discover that the guards, 3 Episode 2 deadzone cores, won't attack you. This will also occur in pretty much every other place, except in deadzones which will end the cease-fire. In the infected Capitol, the infected will talk to you. You can wander about and talk to them if you like, but eventually you should enter the capitol center and talk to their leader. The Infected leader will reveal much about the war, and the \"Infection\", though they could be just lies, or an incomplete truth. Regardless, there are 3 ways this can end. 1) you can insult him and make him attack you, 2) you can accept his mission to go to the Jump Sector, and go there, or 3) you can accept his mission but show loyalty to the Uninfected by returning to your leader, who will order you to go there regardless. When you go there, you jump to the Abandoned Sectors, and Episode 3 is supposed to start!Side Plot  There are 2 missions not related to the main plot and a re not necessary to advance the main plot. They are both given out by Clearly Delusionals in the Capitol Platforms. The first, more well-known one is to travel from the Capitol North to Haven 3 in 1 minute. This one is somewhat difficult, but quite manageable in a size-L core. The second is to clear Sector 140-360 of Infected scout cores. This is quite easy, there are only 6 of them and they are pathetically weak, though fast and stealthy.Bugs ShellCore Command Wiki  ...The site's not working for me. The forum, that is. This is a problem. - Videogama Videogama 02:51, April 15, 2011 (UTC) It also not working for us too. Shell-Core 4/15 It is not working for me either. Did Flashbacker close the forum? Or was he not capable of paying the server cost? I mean, judging by the \"000webhost' website, the server cost is only about five U.S. dollars a month.(Unless there is some other cost that I am unaware of.) I am sure that everyone on the forum could have spared a few cents to fund it, that is, if Flashbacker gave us some sort of warning about the forum being deactivated. I just hope that more people from the forum post here so we can try to solve this problem. -Robert Joe I doubt it would cost much....Yeah, he needs to tell us about these things before he springs them on us out of the blue. Videogama 00:47, April 16, 2011 (UTC) I tried to send a pm to you Videogama, when we were planning a new mod. I (accidentally) pressed enter when I was on the 'recipient' line and the forum immediately locked up and now I'm stuck! I've done eveything possible to solve the problem but I can't resolve it. The only ways this could happen is if the site wasn't paid for anymore, and I'm trying to access a nonexistent site, or by pressing enter on a non-enterable text field the servers went crazy trying to divide by zero and no one can tell the servers to stop attempting to do that. Too bad about my first and only RP thread being deleted/inaccessible/locked up in a processing error. Deceleration 4/15/11 8:08 EST Oops forgot to sign in. In case you couldn't tell I was the contributor who just posted. Deceleration 03:09, April 16, 2011 (UTC) Well at least without the forum to distract us we can work on this wiki! It's been weeks since anything big has happened here, and it's never had more that 3 editors at one time.Deceleration 03:14, April 16, 2011 (UTC) PANIC BUTTON! But seriously, I suppose we should make our own fan forum? It's not hard to do if you don't mind ads. I am quite familiar with Zetaboards myself and have even made a few. Videogama 09:08, April 16, 2011 (UTC) Well, I made that forum. Link: To that forum. If you want to be a mod or even an admin, just ask me. And yes, FB gets free modship. So start using it! Videogama 16:36, April 16, 2011 (UTC) I remember why I was trying to PM you on April 13, when the forum crashed! There was like 6 people with the same birthday, April 13, and I was going to ask you about that. Now that I remember, it seems more than a little suspicious to me. Deceleration 06:48, May 1, 2011 (UTC) I've been looking around at some of the other wikis, and I've had a few ideas. One is that each unit gets its own page, like one for each drone, tank, etc. You might say that there isn't enough to say about each unit to warrant a whole page, but there is. We could include stats, like weapons, speed, energy use, recharge, etc., and have a lengthy discussion about the pros and cons of the unit. And put all the drones in one big category, with a main page about drones in genereal with a nice chart with links to all the specific pages for drones. I had another idea, but I fogot it now. I'll include it later. Deceleration 23:10, December 5, 2011 (UTC) I cannot access the forum. Blue Voice strikes again! But seriously, is anyone else having this problem? SergeantRick 02:05, December 10, 2011 (UTC) No... This is probably just a Zetaboards server issue. But what do you think about my ideas for the wiki? Deceleration 05:55, December 10, 2011 (UTC) All right, this is annoying. There seems to be a \"Database error\" of some sort that prevents me from getting onto the forum. It's annoying. This is Deceleration, by the way, I'm just too lazy to sign in.66.80.180.70 22:58, December 16, 2011 (UTC) I haven't gotten that error recently, so it was probably a temporary problem that Zetaboards has now fixed. SergeantRick 13:04, December 17, 2011 (UTC) Forum refuses to load again. I hope this doesn't become a common occurence... Deceleration 17:24, April 22, 2012 (UTC)Saying some words  Looks like I need to take a lot of work to rework the wiki main page here, it's been so long Shell-Core (talk) 14:30, August 9, 2018 (UTC)Drones  Drones are the rank and file units of ShellCore. They're a complicated bunch, too. In Episode 1, they can be bought from Stations, and auto-spawn from Carriers. In Skirmish and Episode 2, they are spawned from spawn parts. In both, they are present as enemies. Drones have a small 'drone core.' Their default action is to follow you around if you spawned them. You can, however, tell them to go to a point.1 Part drones Mini Drones  Mini drones are the most basic of units. Just a drone core and a Bullet-like weapon or cannon. They aren't very powerful; a single hit with pretty much any weapon will kill them. They're very fast, through. They can catch up to almost any shellcore.Worker Drone  A drone with a core and, more importantly, a tractor beam. These are available in Episode 2. They automatically pick up loot (shell parts) and power shards. Very useful for leveling and mining.2 Part Drones Strike Drones  Speedy drones with a couple of Bullet weapons on them. Useful for hit-and-run attacks on air stations.Light Drone  A relatively rare drone, this is auto-spawned from Carriers in episode 1, and present as enemies. They are a bit heavier than Gun Drones, but not quite as heavy as Counter Drones (at least I believe so).Gun Drone  This drone is apparently between the weight of the Strike Drone and Light Drone. It carries two Cannon weapons on it (though in Skirmish it has only one Cannon, probably for balance reasons). These weapons are effective against Drones, and so the Gun Drone is meant as an anti-Drone. They spawn randomly in sectors and can also be bought from extractors in episode 1 but I don't know of any parts that spawn them.Counter Drone  A good 'balanced' drone, with a Beam weapon and some armor. If you want to take a Drone with you on exploration, this is probably the best choice. Beam weapons are effective against Shellcores, so it's useful for that too. In numbers greater than 15, few sectors pose any threat to you.Combat Drone  A relatively rare drone, this drone is auto-spawned from carriers in episode 1. They are utterly useless and appear similar to counter drones, but don't be fooled.Torpedo Drone  First appears in Skirmish. A drone with a Torpedo weapon on it, for attacking ground, particularly ground stations. Somewhat fragile, and with the Torpedo's horrid range, they can be somewhat hard to use. But if massed, they are pretty effective, especially since most bases are ground bases which are difficult for most shellcores to kill.Gun (Anti-tank) Drone  A drone similar to the Torpedo Drone, but equipped with the Gun weapon, appearing in Episode 2. This weapon is meant to be more effective against Tanks.Bomber Drone  Appears ONLY in Skirmish (it is unsure if it also appears in Episode 2). Same size as Torpedo Drone, but carries the area-of-effect Bomb weapon. Not used much, so I can't say much about it.5 Part Drones Heavy/ Assault Drone  Renamed the latter in Episode 2 (not, I believe, in Skirmish). These are the biggest and slowest drones, and also the most powerful. Armed with a Beam and a Bullet , they can kill other drones with ease and in numbers greater than 5, even battlecores will be easy prey. These are also great for exploration.Shell-Core About me  I'm the greatest picture contributor of the ShellCore Command Wiki. And I'm the third oldest member on the forum.Forum  Visit the Shellcore Command forumStations  Stations are stationary objects of various kinds, found in Battlezones, Havens, and occasionally elsewhere. All of them have size-L cores, except for outposts and bunkers which have drone cores, ground bases which have unusual cores seen nowhere else, and heavy defenses which have no cores at all. Technically, Turrets can be defined as stations because they don't move and they get x2 damage from Bullets, but they can be deployed whereas the stations in this list cannot.Types of stations Yard  Yards allow you to modify and respawn your Shellcore. You can also store parts and shards here. They usually have a missile, a beam, and 2 bullets, but some have 2 missiles and 2 bullets.Trader  At Traders, you can buy and sell shell parts. They are relatively weak, with only 2 bullets for defense. Nuff said.Carrier  Carriers may be present to interact with in Havens to receive missions, but their main point is as your base in Battlezones. Lose your Carrier, and you can't respawn within that Battlezone unless you have the retreat ability. In Episode 1, Carriers will automatically send drones to attack the enemy, and you can buy drones and turrets (I think) from them. In Skirmish onwards, only turrets can be bought. Carriers have some variety of weapons on them, usually 2 missiles and 2 beams. But sometimes they only have 2 beam.Ground Base  The equivalent of the Carrier, but on the ground. Again, vital. You can buy turrets here. In the challenge sector, talk to it to recieve extra missions. Ground Bases have two Bullet weapons (probably level 3) on them. They can't defend themselves from ground attacks, so keep torpedo drones or turrets nearby to defend them.Extractor (or outpost)  This station changes hands when its Shell goes to zero. It allows you to buy turrets, and drones in Episode 1. In Episode 1, they are always next to a rock. Extractors/outposts have two Bullet weapons.Bunker  Like an Extractor/Outpost, but on the ground. Allows you to buy tanks. Doesn't have weapons, so even a speeder tank can capture it. Or at least, it could. Tanks don't stop to engage bunkers, as far as I know. They shoot at them in passing, but the lighter ones can't take them by themselves. Siege Tanks definitely can, and Beam Tanks might be able to.Core Upgrader  In Episode 2, these allow you to upgrade your core, which is fairly self-explanatory. You can add more slots for credits, or, if you have shards, go to a larger core size. They have a missile and a beam.Heavy Defense  A large ground station with a powerful Missile weapon. Found in Episode 2 in some sectors, and defending the center of the Capital Platforms. Unlike extractors, they cannot be captured. Their main threat is killing support drones that are too far away to fight back.Propogander  Where you can watch ads (in episode 1 only, in episode 2 it is the core upgrader). Neat!ShellCore Command: Skirmish Special ShellCore Command: Skirmish  Skirmish is a somewhat different Shellcore game made after the success of Episode 1. I wouldn't go changing the genre after just one title, but that's just me. The main differences with Skirmish is how it's linked together. Command had a large, albeit mostly linear, map on which you could explore. The main map in Skirmish is just six sectors. You accept missions to earn money and parts,as well as access to harder missions, or challenge yourself against other Shellcores submitted by other people. To get parts, you have to either get them from beating missions for the first time, buy them with money, or get the daily bonus part. Otherwise, it's still got general sequel improvements.Gameplay  Skirmish incorporated some pretty major gameplay changes from EP1. The first is ground units. Yes, air units came before ground units. Deal with it. The fact that most air units could not attack ground units and visa versa meant that ground added a bit of a dimension to the strategy. If you attacked a ground base, you attacked it with tanks. Drones in Skirmish are deployed in a much different way from EP1. Where as in the first game you would buy them from an extractor (name changed to an outpost) using power, in Skirmish you put drone spawners on your ship. They cost no power but have long recharge and start-up times. Drones are much more useful in Skirmish, perhaps because of the next difference. Unlike Command, Skirmish had difficulty that could not be avoided. A lot of people actually have trouble with it. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is the fact that after a point, level grinding is, well, pointless.The missions have value caps, and there's an actual part limit. In addition, only the low-level parts are available at the beginning. You have to beat harder missions to unlock higher-level traders. To beat the harder missions, you need strategy. Even at low level, strategy is much better, as Flashbacker showed us with his only known Youtube video. With the new Command and Control abilities, you can power-up your units, making said units a lot more useful than Ep 1.  Skirmish rewards aggression. Once you get the Retreat ability, another new ability, your base is expendable. Even without it, you must still concentrate on building up power and taking out the enemy base. It's quite difficult to defend your base on some of the hard missions (notably Herzog 2.0 and Fortress), and doing anything while keeping your base alive is nigh impossible. Your main objective should be to hit the enemy base hard enough to destroy it or at least take off some parts or Core health before you have to retreat. If at first you don't succeed, just try again. One of Skirmish's more notable features is the challenge sector. Here, you can challenge Shellcores submitted by other players or submit your own. Basically, you play a mission you already have access to, but the Commander is replaced by whatever you challenge. These can be a good source of money.The submitting thing is pretty simple:you submit whatever ship you have when you talk to the Database station, and give it a name and short description. Though the list is really hard to sort through, it's a good idea and a useful feature.Graphics  Graphics are largely unchanged from Episode 1. Though there is a noticeable difference in the color of the uninfected drones, stations, and shellcores.Audio  Skirmish had some new sounds, and one more music: a specific menu music. This music is pretty awesome. It turns out to be an edited version of thissong. However, the rest of the game has no new music.NPCs  NPCs are the many Shellcores and stations that talk to you. \"NPC\" stands for \"non-player character\" meaning a character that is controlled by the computer, not by a human. While most are green and \"uninfected\", at the Infected Capitol some Infected Shellcores, most notably the Infected Leader, will talk to you and even give you missions. Also, the Blue Voice is of an unknown race that is presumably blue colored. This is a list of all the NPCs in Episode 1 , Skirmish, and Episode 2. NPCs without a stated race are Uninfected. ALERT: THE SECTIONS BELOW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Episode 1 Blue Voice  This entity is so unusual and unknown that he has a whole page about him. You can go read it. Race: Unknown Type: Unknown Location: Spawning Grounds (this is where you receive the transmission) What he says: \"Fear not, Newborn, for we have been one in the Beginning, and we will be one in the End.\" He appears in Episode 2, but we'll get to him later.Escort Fighter  He appears in the spawning grounds to escort newborns to the first haven.

Speak to me again if you're ready.\" \"Your core is vulnerable, and your shell is still weak. First of all, you should get a shell part from the yard and attach it to your core.\" \"Good work. Your enhanced shell offers more protection as well as additional speed.\" \"It's time to collect some combat experience. Head east and destroy 5 Infected strike drones. Take one of the nearby defense turrets with you for protection.\" \"Well done. I see you have a lot of potential. But this was only the beginning.\" \"Further growth is essential for survival. Head west and salvage a part of an infected shellcore. Then bring it to the yard and attach it to your core like you did before.\" \"You are ready for some advanced tasks. But before you move on, I have one last favour to ask of you. Return to the spawning grounds once more and lead another newborn to me, just like you were led here.\" \"Thank you. Many Newborn don't make it here since the Spawning Grounds are under attack by the Infected.\" \"It's time for you to move on. There is nothing more I can teach you. Head east until you arrive at Haven 2. Take the others with you if want to. Good luck, and take care of yourself.\"Haven 1 Yard  The Haven 1 Yard. You can reconfigure your shell here. Also, one of your early missions is to collect a shell part from here. Type: Yard station Location: Haven 1 Missions: None (Yards don't give you missions.) What he says: \"I'll change your shell configuration whenever you want. I've also got replacements for parts that get destroyed during combat.\"Haven 1 Fighter #1  He just sits around. Later, you can make him follow you to Haven 2. Type: Fighter Location: Haven 1 Missions: None What he says: \"You heard a voice at the Spawning Grounds? I don't think anyone else noticed something like that... But sometimes, newborns are imagining things when they awake.\"Haven 1 Fighter #2  Just like Haven 1 fighter #1. He just says different things. Type: Fighter Location: Haven 1 Missions: None What he says: \"We still don't know what caused the 'Infection'. All we know is that it started after some of us entered the core sectors of this world. Ever since, we were under attack - and their numbers just keep rising and rising.\"Helpless Newborn  Your later mission is to escort him to Haven 1. Type: Newborn Mission: None Location: Spawning Ground, Haven 1 What he says: \"What's happening? Get me out of here!\" \"Thanks! I would have never made it on my own!\"Haven 2 Carrier  He gives you your first battlezone missions. Type: Carrier station Location: Haven 2 Missions: What he says: \"Greetings, Newborn. You arrived just in time. We can use any help we can get.\" \"There is no enemy commander present at the southern battlezone. This is our chance to strike and take out the enemy carrier. Head to the battlezone and support our fleet.\" \"Well done. That should give us some room to breathe.\" \"The Infected Commander missing from Battlezone Alpha has attacked sector 175-25. Only 2 extractors are left. Keep the Infected from conquering them until reinforcements arrive.\" \"The reinforcements arrived in time. Thank you.\" \"We finally tracked down the Infected Commander.

But their level of organization implies that they are capable of communication- at least among each other.\"Haven 2 Fighter  He is different from the other NPCs thus far in that he tries to actually help you. Type: Fighter Location: Haven 2 What he says: \"Extractors will increase your army limit and extract power ups for you to pick up. You can also spawn new units at extractors.\"Reinforcement Fighters  After defending the extractors in Sector 175-25 for 3 waves, 4 fighters appear and drive off the Infected carriers. I have no idea how. Sometimes, you can get them to follow you, but only if you already have the fighters from Haven 1 following you. Types: Fighter Location: Sector 175-25 What they say: \"Thank You.\" (They all say this).Idle Beamer  He's just standing idle at Sector 140-25. He want you to head to Sector 175-50 to find his missing comrade. Type: Beamer Location: Sector 140-25 Missions: Find his comrade in Sector 175-50. What he says: \"My comrade has left for Sector 175-50 hours ago. And he still hasn't returned. I'm afraid he may be in trouble. Can you look out for him if you're in the area?\" \"Thanks again for your help. I'll let you know if anything comes up.\"Comrade Beamer  He is the comrade that the Idle Beamer wanted you to find. Type: Beamer Location: Sector 175-50 Missions: Clear Sector 175-50 of Infected shellcores. What he says: \"You came to help me out? I don't need any help, I can handle this with ease!\" \"Well...since you're already here... maybe I could use a little help. You clear this sector of Infected shellcores, and I hold this position. How about it?\" \"Thank you. Looks like we are a great team.\" \"Thanks again for your help. I will let you know if anything comes up.\"Scouting Beamer  He is just scouting the sector. Type: Beamer Location: Sector 100-130 Missions: None What he says: \"I'm just scouting the sector right now. I'll let you know if I have a task for you.\"Haven 3 Carrier  He is the last carrier in Episode 1. Type: Carrier station Location: Haven 3 Missions: What he says: \"Welcome! I have already heard about your victories in the northern sectors. It would be an honor to have you assist us.\" \"A commander of the Infected has entered Battlezone Delta. I think the two of you have met before. We could hardly hold our position in this zone before, you're our only hope now.\" \"Well done, the enemy commander retreated from the zone. I placed a special reward in your yard.\" \"A battle class ShellCore has managed to enter sector 100-130 from one of the Deadzones. We don't know how he did it - but all that's important right now is to take him out. Capture an extractor for fire support, or you won't stand a chance.\" \"Excellent work. The Infection is still spreading in the sector, but now we can contain it.\" \"Just minutes after the commander at Battlezone Delta retreated, the Infected replaced him with someone else. We need you to go to Battlezone Epsilon, and protect our carrier there.\" \"Well done. Against all odds, the situation is getting increasingly better.\" \"You should travel to our Capitol and talk to its leaders. They will assign you to new missions. You can also rest at the Capitol's platforms. They are the last spots that the Infected don't dare to attack.\"Haven 3 Heavy Scouter  He's just a Heavy Scouter class Shellcore. In the original Episode 1, however, he is a Cruiser. Type: Heavy Scouter Location: Haven 3 What he says: \"While exploring sectors, you might find special parts and friendly shellcores. Some might even have a special task for you.\"Haven 3 Beamer  He doesn't think we can defeat the Infected. Hmm... Type: Beamer Location: Haven 3 What he says: \"Quite frankly, continuing this war seems hopeless... Our only option is to travel to the core sectors and try to find out what caused the Infection. Maybe we can figure out a way to stop it.\"Haven 3 Trader  The trader at Haven 3. Some parts that he trades are not available at Haven 2. He's the last trader in episode 1. Type: Trader station Location: Haven 3 Available parts for sale: Beam 1, Bullet 1, Energy 1, Mini drone, Accel 1, Speed 1, Energy regen 1. What he says: \"Many trader used to travel from here to the Capitol Platform in the south. Nowadays, you'd better be armed to the teeth if you want to make it there.\"Haven 3 Yard  Type: Yard station Location: Haven 3 What he says: \"While reconstructing your shell, you can also rearrange and sort your special skill.\"Propogander  In early, incomplete versions of Episode 1, there is another station at Haven 3 called a Propogander, where you can watch advertisements. In the final version of Episode 1 and in Episode 2, he is removed. Maybe Flashbacker was persuaded by annoyed gamers. Type: Propogander Location: Haven 3 What he says: \"Support our fleet! Watch an ad!\" I don't know what he says next. If you watch enough ads he complains about \"making my eyes hurt\" and tells the player to go away after you continue to watch ads.Weak Heavy Scouter  He's too weak to clear sector 160-130, so he hires you to do it. In Episode 1, he is a Cruiser like the Haven 3 Heavy Scouter. Type: Heavy Scouter Location: Sector 160-130 Mission: Clear Sector 160-130 out of Infected ShellCores What he says: \"I could use your help to clear this sector of Infected ShellCores. I can't do it on my own, there just too many of them.\"The Infected Leader  He appears when you try to travel to the Capitol Platforms. He tractors you to hold you down while he talks to you, a feat that cannot be seen anywhere else. Race: Infected Type: Infected Leader Location: Sector 25-180 (this is probably a mistake, the sector is actually at the coordinates 25-210) Missions: None in Episode 1. What he says: \"Interesting... It seems that you can read my transmissions, unlike the others of your kind. Maybe you will be of use to us in the future. I will watch you closely.\" \"It is impossible to end this war.\" \"You will know when the time is right.\" \"I will contact you again at a more appropriate time.\"Alternate Ending (EP 1)  At the end of Episode 1, you can return to Haven 3 instead of going to Haven 4. If you do this, there will be an alternate plot line. I'm only listing NPCs that say something different when you return.Haven 3 Carrier  He says the exact same things as the Haven 4 carrier after your meeting with the Infected leader. Missions: What he says: \"You received a transmission from an infected? We need to report this to our leaders as soon as possible!\" \"As long as the route to the Capitol Platforms is blocked, the best you can do is help us drive back the infected. Try to clear Battlezone Gamma first, then report to Haven 2.\"Haven 2 Carrier  Missions: What he says: \"Well done! Please check if anyone else needs help.\" \"Drive the Infected out of Battlezone Alpha. Check in at Haven 1 after you cleared the zone.\" \"Thanks again for your help. I will let you know if anything comes up.\"Haven 1 Carrier  Missions: None this time. What he says: \"Well done! Please check if anyone else needs help.\" \"Thanks again for your help. I will let you know if anything comes up.\"Skirmish  There aren't many NPCs in Skirmish, because it isn't connected to the main Shellcore Universe in the Episodes. The few NPCs in Skirmish are all Uninfected and have the main purpose of guiding you to the sectors in the main map, rather than expanding the storyline.Entry Sector Fighter  Type: Fighter Location: Entry sector What he says: \"Just keep moving north and you'll arrive at the Mission sector. Report at the ground base to choose a mission.\"Main Sector Beamer  Type: Beamer Location: Main sector What he says: \"You'll find 3 trading sectors to the east. There, you can buy and sell parts to customize your shell and abilities.\"Main Sector Fighter  Type: Fighter Location: Main sector What he says: \"Head north to upload to the database and find some special challenges.\"Main Sector Yard  Type: Yard station Location: Main sector What he says: \"I can reconfigure your shell whenever you want. If you've got shell parts you have no use for, I'll keep them for you.\"Challenge Sector Yard  Type: Yard station Location: Challenge sector What he says: Quoted what the Main Sector Yard said.Database Carrier  This is where you upload your designs of ShellCore to the server for others to challenge. Type: Carrier station (2 beams version) Location: Challenge sector What he says: \"Do you want to upload your current configuration to the database?\"The Epsiode 2 NPCs are here!  I split the page because it was too long.ShellCore Command: Episode 1: Newborn ShellCore Command: Episode 1: Newborn  Most often simply called ShellCore Command: Episode 1, or EP 1, this game is the first installment of the Shellcore games, and apparently the first of Flashbacker's games (or maybe not...). The game follows the path of a newborn 'Shellcore', who is born into a war against the Infection (and some weird voice with blue text). Apparently empty space is blue or black. Last I checked, the uninfected were green and infected were red. There were no blue units. The plot is relatively bland, but it does cast a little foreshadowing, especially at the end. It's fairly obvious that there's more, as suggested in that the EP 2 betacontains EP 1 as well. But some serious talk about the background is overdue. Shellcores are the 'race' that populates the world of Shellcore Command. No one really knows what they are, because Flashbacker refuses to tell us anything.\u00a0:( Somehow they can add Shell parts onto their Core freely. The green normal Shellcores are fighting a war against the red 'infected' Shellcores, and they aren't doing so well. You're a newborn, and you are going to places, young man! Or woman.Gameplay  Time to add some more detail to the general discription. The basic idea is a combination of RTS, RPG and shooter. You have your ship in which you fly around. Shooting is automatic, though. You can activate abilities. The RPG element is in gaining more and better parts. The RTS element is the missions. Shellcore EP1's gameplay has good spots and bad spots. It tries to combine an adventure and RTS with mixed results. On the one hand, the customization system is generally acknowledged as 'pretty cool', if imperfect (though it was improved quite a bit in Skirmish and the EP 2 beta). On the other hand, it was easy to put together an insanely powerful ShellCore and just dominate everything, a tactic that has come to be known as 'borg cubing' for reasons obviously related to Startrek (I say we should call those ships BUSes, Big Ugly Shellcores, by the way). The RTS element was pretty lacking, in part because of the above, and in part because your only mobile units, drones, are not very powerful.Graphics  As with all the other ShellCore games, EP1 has a distinctly retro feel to it. Most everything is composed of angular lines and glowy things. Ships can be made to look very cool. The way enemy ships explode is one of my favorite animations. However, the graphics are not particularly high quality. In short, it's pretty good, but not stellar. But it's free. What do you expect?Music and Sound  EP 1 has only two music tracks; the battle/intro music and the one used for everywhere else.These are both good songs, but after a while, they get annoying. The sounds are rather basic, and there's not much to say about them. WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (unless you finished episode 1 already, which you probably did)Episode 1: Newborn Plot  You start off as a newborn, spawned in a spawning grounds. You already know this. Anyways, you travel to Haven 1 with the help of some guy. The Infected are trying to kill you, but these are only the weak drones and you kill them easily. At Haven 1 the carrier there helps you grow in size and strength with missions, until you are strong enough to go to Haven 2. After battling through masses of enemies, you get to Haven 2 (unless you're too weak, then try again). Once there, you help out by capturing Battlezone Alpha, which is easy as there is no enemy Commander. You help defend some extractors in Sector 175-25, capture Battlezone Gamma, and proceed to Haven 3. It's a long trip, but a decently eqiupped shellcore will make it. You capture Battlezone Delta and kill a Battlecore (this is easy, usually), then capture Battlezone Epsilon. After that you attempt to travel to the Capital Platforms. You get stopped by an Infected Commander, who says he will need you later, then releases you. You travel back to Haven 3. After that, you capture the Battlezones in reversed order and travel back to Haven 2, and capture more Battlezones. Then the game is finished!Side Plot  I believe there are two missions not necessary to advance the main plot. Both involve helping allies clear sectors of enemy Shellcores. One also involve finding an ally's freind who went missing.Bugs Trivia Sectors  Sectors are rectangular regions in which shellcores live. Some sectors have randomly spawned drones or shellcores, while others have land and rocks that give off power. Most are named for the coordinates of their northwestern corner.Types of sectors Havens  Havens are always safe from attacks by infected shellcores. All of them contain carriers and yards, while a few have traders and outposts. The carrier in a haven always has missions for you unless you finished them already. The largest haven is the Capital Platforms, which is made up of 9 sectors. 8 sectors of the Capital Platforms get attacked once in Episode 2. Havens are named from 1-5, in the order they appear in the story. Most of the sectors of the Capital Platforms are named for their position around the center. They are green colored on the map. There are 14 havens in total.Deadzones (or Dangerzones)  Dead(danger)zones cause damage to both your shell and core over time. Without at least 10 core heals, it's impossible to stay in them for long. Their danger is increased by the large and powerful \"battlecores\" that appear randomly throughout. While they are effective barriers to travel, killing the \"battlecores\" can drop large parts not found or sold anywhere else (other than the infected capital). Dangerzones are always named after the coordinates of their northwest corner. They are bright red color on the map. There are 35 deadzones in total, ranging from small squares to huge rectangles. Interestingly, deadzones surround all the sectors completely, meaning that if you travel in any one direction long enough, you'll eventually run into a deadzone.Battlezones  Battlezones contain an enemy base or carrier and your base or carrier. Losing your base or carrier usually means defeat, unless you have the retreat skill. Destroying the enemy base or carrier means victory, though you still have to kill the enemy commander. Clearing a battlezone is usually part of a mission. The enemy commander fights with you over control of bunkers and outposts, which are used to build tanks and drones to kill you and your base. Battlezones are named Alpha, Delta, Gamma, and Epsilon in episode 1. In episode 2 they are named Upper, Central, and Lower, with a small one isolated to the southwest called Battlezone Blah. They are a dark red color on the map. There are 8 battlezones in total.Random farming sectors  Many sectors contain shellcores and drones and little else. Drones appear randomly on most of them and more dangerous ones can spawn large shellcores. Killing these enemies gets you a small amount of credits and parts. Some are part of a mission, like killing a battlecore or clearing a sector or obtaining parts. Some have carriers and outposts and heavy defenses, but these don't spawn enemy units. Since they don't cause damage to you like dangerzones, they are usually the only way to get to the next haven or battlezone. These random sectors are always named after their northwest corners' coordinates. Easy ones are blue, harder ones are black, and the most dangerous ones are dark red like battlezones, though they don't spawn commanders. There are 32 in total (9 blue, 12 black, 11 dark red).Miscellaneous sectors  These are just random sectors of which there is only one of that kind.Spawning Grounds  When newborns first appear, they appear in a spawning ground. There are only a few drones as enemies and little else. The color is blue.Training Sector  When you arrive at the Capital Platforms, your first mission is to practice ground combat at a training ground to the east of the capital. There is a ground base, 2 outposts, 2 bunkers, 3 rocks, and an enemy base. It's set up like a battlezone, but there is no enemy commander, or any enemies at all. The color is green.Jump Sector  Far to the southeast, a small sector is the only link to the Abandoned Sectors. Two missions end there. The first is when a traitor shellcore tries to flee and you have to kill him. The second is when the infected leader tells you to go there to see whether the \"uninfected\" are the one who are really infected. This sector is, strangely enough, green.Mining Sector  In a sector south of the capital, large power clusters can be broken apart for shards, which are used for core upgrades. These power clusters are found nowhere else, and are therefore guarded by the Infected. However, they only have a few Attack Cores, hardly a sizable force. The sector is named Sector 200-440. Its color is blue. Also, the sector north of it is called the mining sector, though it only has a trader, carrier, and yard, and you can't actually mine anything there. Worker drones are recommended for this sectors as they can carry shardsDeceleration About me  I am probably the most active editor here! If anyone visits this wiki you must send me a message so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time. Tanks  Appearing in Skirmish and Episode 2, these guys are like Drones, but on the ground. They can only be attacked by air units with special torpedo or gun weapons. They can be bought from Bunkers or Ground Bases using Power. Their default action is to advance towards the enemy base. When they encounter enemy tanks, they stop and duke it out. Obviously, they can only use ground to move on, unless picked up with the Tractor Beam. Though there is a glitch where if you click on a tank then click on yourself, the tank will follow you anywhere, even when not on the ground! Tanks have two parts: a turret and a base. There are 5 bases: the Speeder tank base, the Bullet tank base, the Beam tank base, the Siege Tank base, and the Multi-purpose base, seen on missile and rocket tanks. The missile tank has the bullet tank base on skirmish though.Speeder Tank  The speeder tank is the lightest, cheapest and fastest tank, armed with a bullet-like weapon that attacks ground. Note that friendly tanks collide with each other, unlike air units. So put them in front. These are the weakest tank in the game. They seem to be like the Mini-Drones of the land, since you can build about 5 or 6 of them for the same cost as a Beam Tank or Siege Tank.Bullet Tank  The Bullet Tank is like the Speeder Tank, but a little slower and a little tougher, and a little more expensive.Beam Tank  These balanced tanks are the best at killing other tanks. They have an anti-tank Beam weapon which is deadly to Speeder Tanks and the best armor, deal twice as much damage to tanks as to bunkers or ground bases. They're vulnerable to Siege Tanks somewhat due to the Siege Tank's superior range, but one-on-one the Beam Tank always wins.Siege Tank  These tanks attack with a long-ranged, anti-ground Siege weapon. As the name suggests, they're best used on ground stations. They can attack other tanks, but tend to miss moving targets.Missile Tank  The anti-air-unit tank, armed with a Missile weapon. Seems to be small and fragile, but packs a punch nonetheless. It can't fire at stationary air targets for some reason, but it's difficult for air units to remove. It's very good at defending bases and rocks.Rocket Tank  Rocket tanks attacks air stations, and I believe turrets. They're not half bad, either. However they are unable to attacks mobile air units.Tank core  I've been asked to upload a picture of the tank core so I'm uploading it. Left:My edited/ made up version based on the real screen shot. Right: The screen shot here is the original screen shot without editing and saved in a better format This is awesome. Now I can prove I am right! Deceleration 04:14, February 15, 2012 (UTC)Turrets  Turrets are one of the few relatively unchanging aspects of Shellcore so far. Turrets can be bought with Power at various stations. As the name suggests, Turrets are stationary and must be tractor-beamed to move them. Turrets all look fairly similar: a base part, roughly octagonal, with something on it. There are several types of turrets:Defense Turret  The Defense Turret is the 'basic' turret. It doesn't cost that much, has high health and is armed with a fairly effective Beam weapon. It fires relatively slowly, so it's not much against lots of enemies. They are often used to defend minor havens or extractors.Missile Turret  As the name suggests, Missile Turrets carry a powerful, long-ranged Missile weapon. However, they are quite fragile, and can only target air units. They're also somewhat expensive.. As such, they are best for taking on large lone Shellcores, and should always be behind something else. They are commonly used to defend important havens, like Capitals.Siege Turret  The Siege Turret is a relatively fragile turret, more costly than Defense but cheaper than Missile. The Siege Turret has a weapon that only attacks air Stations (and turrets). It has VERY long range, and is designed to attack Carriers and the like without running into their powerful weapons. Keep them protected.Harvester Turret  As the name suggests, this turret automatically collects Power near it. Drop one off at a Rock and watch the Power flow in. Harvester turret are unarmed and vulnerable to attacks so place other turrets nearby to defend themSpawn Turret  This turret only appears in episode 1. It constantly spawns Mini Drones, if you can command them. The mini drones will automatically seek out and attack enemy outposts, though since they are so weak they hardly affect the outposts. Nuff said.Torpedo Turret  This turret first appears in Skirmish, along with it's enemy: ground units. Torpedo turrets attack ground units and stations. They have rather short range, so be careful.The Infection  Warning: This article may contain spoilers. The 'infection' is something or other that makes green ships turn red and start attacking other green ships. In Episode 2, it is revealed that the main character is becoming infected himself. Not much is known about it. The infected cannot be talked to by green shellcores other than you, but they are obviously organized. The Infected Leader claims that the green shellcores are infected, rather than the red ones. Apparently, the Infection began when some of the red shellcores (who may originally looks green) traveled to the abandoned sectors.Power and Mining Power  Power is needed to produce turrets and ground drones in Skirmish and Episode II. In Episode I it is also needed to produce air drones. Most power comes from rocks attached to extractors (outposts in episode II and skirmish). In episode I and skirmish each power is worth 25. In episode 2 each power is worth 20. Power can also be obtained from killing enemy drones and shellcores. When they die, there is a possibility of one power left behind along with parts. Power will be automatically collected if you get close enough and your tractor beam is not being used, though you have to maually click on each power to collect it in episode 1.Rocks  Rocks produce one unit of power at regular intervals. In Episode 1, they are always linked to an extractor, which...really doesn't do anything. In Skirmish and Episode 2, though, they do not need to be linked to outposts. To grab power, you need to use the tractor beam or an extractor turret. Placing an extractor turret at a rock is a good way to get steady power. Without a turret, the rock will continue to produce power until the power starts to degrade. Eventually the power will disappear.Tractor Beam  The tractor beam is an important part of the Core. The tractor beam can grab one object in its radius at a time, be it power, loot, a shard, a turret, a tank, or even a drone. By default, it puts that object a certain distance away from your Shellcore. If you go fast enough, it will start falling behind. Now, if you want to add looted shell parts to your stocks at the Yard, you have to talk to it while you're carrying the part in question with your tractor beam. The same goes for shards. Obviously, tractoring turrets lets you move them around. By tractoring a tank, you can move it around by air, which can be quite useful. Tractoring a drone is sometimes useful for getting them to not get themselves seperated from you.Mining Shards  In episode 2, a mining sector below the Capitol Platforms contains large rocks. They don't give power, but if attacked and destroyed (they have some health) they break into shards that can be tractored and deposited at yards. These shards can be used to purchase a core upgrade at the Core Upgrader in the Capitol Northeast sector. Core upgrades allow more parts to be attached to your shellcore. Each power cluster yields one retrievable shard (the others degenerate) and there are 4 power clusters in the sector at any time. 10 shards are needed for a core upgrade.Shellcoreopedia (proto)  Videogama (the one who's typing this) is gonna try and get some descriptions for some units and whatnot from Shellcore. Hey, what's this page for? We need to straighten it out. Maybe add Spar's part list to it. Deceleration 06:05, May 1, 2011 (UTC) NOTE: This is for Episode 2 unless otherwise noted. <These are the 3 core sizes: Size-S(Defaut) -->\u00a0  Size-M core --> Size-L core --> CORES:\nThe Core is the most important part of any Shellcore. The destruction of your core is equal to death. Cores have stats and are outfitted with a basic attack. Cores can be upgraded, both in the number of slots they have and to larger core sizes. Infected have a different core graphic, starting in v0.91. It is unknown whether this is any different from the normal ones.It might be a bit weaker, though, as part of the changes made so that the Episode 1 section was balanced. Weak enemy shellcores have a sort of semi-core, stronger than a drone or outpost core but weaker than the cores of full-blown battlecores. Cores have health, represented by the CORE stat. It only takes damage when your shell is zero. When that runs out, you go boom! While cores don't regenerate automatically, CORE can be healed with CORE HEAL abilities, of course, or by collecting power. AREA RESTORE also heals CORE.Shell Parts:  Shell parts are the building blocks of...well, everything. Except Tanks, and perhaps the Heavy Defense Station, every unit in the game is made up of the same set of shell parts.Features of a shell part:  Shell parts have three intrinsic stats. One is weight. Adding weight decreases speed and accel. If you make a heavier Shellcore, add more thrusters. The second is Shell. This is, simply put, health. Damage on your Shellcore is done to the sum of the shell of all its parts, and any bonuses from passive shell boosts. When Shell runs out, Core takes damage instead, and parts start flying off. Shell regenerates slowly over time. This rate can be increased with SHELL REGEN passives. A wide variety of abilities heal Shell. The third is core. It's generally only half of the shell value (in episode 1 at least). Shell parts also have a certain amount of value in and of themselves, or so I hope. This is not shown. The value shown factors in whatever's on the Part. Each part has one thing on it. (Sometimes, you will get a part without anything because of glitch. these parts can be valuable because you can have an unlimited number of them.)What can go on a part?  Passive abilities are simply bonuses that are around all the time. They have the useful feature of staying even after the part that had them is destroyed.In episode 2 they fall off you lose those there usefulness is all gone like if you lose your speed 3 you will slow down until you reconstruct Abilities are activated, generally using energy. They have a recharge time, as well. Weapons...well, shoot. Weapons use energy, so don't get too many. Spawners, spawn drones when activated. They use anywhere from very little to a lot of energy depending on the spawn created, but they have very long recharge times.Spar's Part List  Purpose This list is designed to tell you exactly what enemies hold each part, or what traders to go to in order to purchase them.

those names mean.Capital Platforms  The Capital Platforms are the hub of the uninfected Shellcores in the main Command series. This extremely large haven-type area has traders, a challenge sector (where skirmish-like missons can be played for additional credits), and lots of NPCs (several of which have tasks for you), spanning over 8 separate sectors surrounding the center, where the Uninfected Leader resides. It's your main base in EP 2. Later on, a second Capital is discovered where the Infected live, in a setup suprisingly similar to the Capitol Platforms with the same sectors, land, and traders. The NPCs, however, are less numerous and far more hostile and powerful than those in the Capitol Platforms.Videogama  Hey. I started this wiki and I am one of the main contributors, along with Deceleration.\n I'm also not very serious. Also, check out my Shellcore Command forum for when the official one is down. Like right now. Hello Videogama! Founder of the shellcore command wiki, Founder of shellcore command fan forum... So how you're doing? 118.71.49.91 07:21, April 23, 2013 (UTC)Weapons  As their name suggests, Weapons do damage. They are more or less the only way to directly deal damage. As such, they are rather important. Weapons come in levels, generally ranging from 1 to 3. Thus, a Bullet 1 is worse than a Bullet 2 is worse than a Bullet 3. Some weapons do not exist at some levels; for example, Disrupt only exists as a level 2 weapon and bullet 3s cannot be found in Episode 2 legitimately. Each weapon type\u00a0has several important characteristics:\n 1. The amount of damage\u00a0it does. 2. The range\u00a0it has. 3. How long it takes to recharge. 4. How much energy\u00a0it uses per shot. 5. (optional) The speed of the projectile, with Main, Bullets, Missiles, Bombs, and Torpedoes. 6.\u00a0Any effects, usually double damage against certain unit types. Other effects include: Missiles are tracking projectiles, Disrupt resets ability timers, and Bomb has AOE damage (it can also damage ground targets). Effectiveness and efficiency stats are Damage per Second and Damage per Energy, respectively. These stats\u00a0were calculated by the players, as they are not listed in game. Weapons here are listed by the game in which they first appear. Within those categories, they are sorted by the order in which you usually obtain them in-game.Episode 1 Weapons Main  Your Core is outfitted with a Bullet-like weapon, so you don't fail horribly in the early game. It's rather weak but it is the fastest projectile and uses almost no energy to maintain its rapid fire rate. It does unfortunately also skip over small enemies due to its fast speed. It has no modifiers that I know of.Bullet  The bullet is a mid-ranged, low-damage projectile shooting weapon. Dodging it is pretty easy for a reasonably agile and small shellcore. It does double damage against Stations. It's a fairly basic weapon, though it can be deadly if you have less than 5 level 1 parts, and generally the first weapon you can get.Beam  Beam fires, basically, a laser. They are an instant, guaranteed hit though with slightly less range than a bullet of comparable level. Beams do double damage against Shellcores, and are a good all-round weapon. However, they drain energy pretty fast.Cannon  Cannons are short ranged, instant-hit weapons. They do double damage against Drones. The Cannon 3 has the fastest recharge of any weapon, tied with the Gun 2, and also has the highest DPS of any Episode 2 weapon when bonuses are not considered (the Bullet 3 does slightly more DPS than the Cannon 3, assuming all the bullets hit).Missile  The Missile is a long-ranged, anti-Shellcore projectile. More importantly, it's a seeking projectile. It does a lot of damage, but uses a lot of energy and takes a long time to reload. The projectile is also fairly slow, and faster Shellcores can evade it. In the hands of enemies in the mid-early section of Episode 1, these things can ruin your day pretty hard.Skirmish Weapons Torpedo  This is the main anti-ground weapon, first appearing in Skirmish. It does high damage, has long reload, and fires a slow-moving, unguided projectile. It also has HORRIBLE range for some reason. They're best used on Bunkers. Though their short range exposes you to attacks from Heavy Defense and Ground Bases, the only alternative is the Gun, which isn't even in Skirmish and is not particularly effective against stations anyways (it's supposed to kill tanks).Bomb  A short-lived weapon appearing in Skirmish, and, recently discovered, in episode 2. Interestingly enough only the level 3 Bomb exists, levels 1 and 2 are nowhere to be found. This thing actually attacks air, but\u00a0more importantly, it does AOE damage. It looks like a missile and fires a torpedo-like projectile, but it's rather different from either one. It moves more slowly than even the torpedo. The AOE damage can also affect ground units and bunkers. In episode 2, the bomb part can be found being used by a rather large infected shellcore in the northern part of the infected capitiol. Getting it is not easy due to the sheer number of other parts on this paticular shellcore. The bomb does poor damage\u00a0for its high energy use\u00a0but its real strength is beating battlezone commanders with a swarm of drones with him. The blast from the bomb devastates lightly armored swarms of mini and strike drones.Disrupt  This weapon appears in Skirmish & Episode 2. It's an interesting one. It looks like and fires like a Beam, shooting an instant-hit laser at enemies. However, it does very, very little damage for its energy cost. What's the point? The point is that it acts like an EMP, resetting the recharge times of\u00a0all abilities and drone spawns\u00a0on the ship it hits. IE, they're set to no charge. Naturally, Disrupt fires much slower than Beam.Gun  This weapon first appeared in Episode 2. It's another anti-ground weapon designed to be more effective against Tanks. It fires similar to the Cannon, making it useful for hitting fast-moving tanks. Its damage is considerably lower then that of the torpedo, limiting its effectiveness against all but the weakest ground units.Other Weapons  These are weapons that you can't get. Generally, this is because they're on Turrets and Tanks.Siege (Turret/Tank)  This is the weapon the Siege Turret and Siege Tank has. The Turret attacks air stations (including other turrets), the Tank attacks ground stations. It's a projectile not unlike a bullet, but slower to fire. It has the longest range of any weapon in the game, usually able to hit targets off-screen. It easily outranges even the Missile 3, the longest-ranged shellcore weapon.Bullet (Tank)  The Bullet-like weapon on Speeder Tanks and Bullet Tanks. Fairly weak in general, though it seems to do more damage to station, similar to the bullet used by air units.Beam (Tank)  The weapon of the Beam Tank. Fires like a beam, does double damage against Tanks. It has a relartively short range.Rocket  This weapon is on the Rocket Tank. It fires a bit like a Missile, I believe, but attacks only air stations. The rockets can also be particularly nasty to shellcore, i've had to go through that lesson alotMissions  Missions (also called tasks in Episode I) are the main activity of ShellCore Command. Taking on missions gets you credits and sometimes parts. Missions can be found by talking to certain stations and Shellcores. Once you complete them, you must talk to them again (or sometimes the main Shellcore/base at your destination) to get the reward. There are quite a few types of missions. The main type is to clear out a Battlezone. Just destroy the enemy carrier or ground base and then their commander to win. Another type is to get somewhere. The reward is given at your destination. Most such missions involve traveling to the next haven. One mission given in the EP 2 beta involves getting from the Capital Platforms to Haven 3 in under a minute. A few misions involve destroying all the infected Shellcores in a sector. This is pretty straightforward. There are also some other, less used missions. At the beginning of each episode's area, one of the first missions is to attach a Shell part to your ship. In the beginning of Episode 1, you have to do a few simple introductory missions (for example, take a turret and destroy 5 strike drones; bring back a Shell part from a destroyed Shellcore and attach it to your ship; go back to the Spawning Grounds and escort a newborn to the haven; which is actually quite easy). A couple of missions require you to destroy a specific enemy (the Battlecore in EP 1 and the 'traitor' in EP 2 beta). EP 1 also includes a defense mission (keep two extractors alive for 3 waves of drones until reinforcements arrive). As the EP 2 beta adds core upgrades and shard mining, some missions of bringing back shards and getting a core upgrade are there.Shellcore Creation and Customization  This article contains basic information you need to know to create a decent Shellcore and to understand what you're looking at on the Yard or Trader screen.Core statistics (what's on your core) Shell  Shell is, simply put, your health value, or perhaps armor would be more accurate. When you get hit, you take Shell damage. Running out of shell is a bad thing. Core starts taking the damage, parts start flying off. Luckily, shell regenerates, though usually at a very slow rate. Adding parts increases your shell.Shell Regen  This is the rate at which your Shell regenerates damage. I forget what unit it's in. Probably hit points per second.Core  The amount of health your Core has. Run out of Core health, you go boom. Unlike shell, it doesn't regenerate so any core damage will remain until you use a healing ability or you reconstruct at a yard. Adding parts increases your max core by 10% of the .Energy  This is the maximum Energy you can have. You need Energy to fire weapons, spawn drones, and to use most abilities.Energy Regen  This is how fast your Energy regenerates. This is probably in energy per second, though energy regen is notably faster than shell regen.Speed  Speed is simply the maximum speed at which your Shellcore can move. I think it's pixels per second though I'm not sure.Accel  Accel is the 'handling' of your Shellcore. As the name suggests, Accel covers speeding up and slowing down. But it also covers turning- high Accel means you can make tighter corners. Low accel means it'll take a while to reach top speed.Weight  Weight is, well, how heavy your Shellcore is. This is a decent indicator of its size. Adding Weight will decrease your Speed and Accel. All parts have weight.Part statistics (what is on each part) Shell  All parts add to your shell. Small parts (level 1) add about 250 while large parts/extra large parts (level 3/level 3+) add 1000/1250.Core  All parts add to your core as well. Generally they add 10% to your core what they add to your shell.Weight  Parts vary in weight, with large parts having more and small parts having less. The larger the part, the more efficient it is in the shell/weight ratio. That is, they add less weight for every hit point added to your shellcore.Value  How much your ship costs, in credits. Each part is worth some credits. High ship values disqualify you from skirmish missions, as your shellcore would find the battle too easy.Yard screen  At the yard you store parts and reconfigure. Go to the Stations page for more about the yard. To get to this screen ask for a reconfiguration when you talk to the yard. On the right is the aforementioned core stats. When a part is selected, the part stats and ability/weapon is there instead.  Anyways, on the left parts you've bought, received as rewards or looted from dead enemies can be picked up by clicking and holding and dragging with your cursor. When your selected part can be attached, it will stop being transparent and it will be attached when you let go. To take off parts drag them off and when they are transparent again they are no longer attached. Simple. Parts can be rotated in episode 1, and flipped in the episode 2 beta, and in some versions of skirmish. Rotating and flipping doesn't affect the part other than its appearance, but it is good for making symmetrical and aesthetically appealing shellcores. While appearance won't kill enemies, it makes you feel better. It's also difficult to concentrate when you're flying a shapeless mass of junkyard scraps or a convoluted brick.Trader screen  At the trader you buy parts. to get to this screen ask to buy parts from a trader. Episode 1 traders (there's only 2 of them) sell all types of parts, of low value and utility. Skirmish and episode 2 traders are more specialized, each selling a specific type of part. The type is usually described in their opening lines. On the left, parts avaliable for sale are shown. To buy them attach them to your shellcore. The credits are not deducted from you until you reconfigure. To sell parts remove them from your shell and the credits will be given to you when you reconfigure. Selling parts is a great source of income, as most missions can only be played once and enemies give very few credits when they die. There is an infinite number of enemies and therefore parts, as well as an infinite amount of money a trader can give you.Basic Farming  This is a basic set of rules for casual part farming. When trying to get parts from infected shellcores there are many factors that go into getting the part you want. Advanced part farming requires advanced strategy, but can allow you to get the part you want almost every time.Blue voice  Warning: May contain some spoilers!  The blue voice is the transmissions that has an unknown origin, and one of them is the first transmission you received after you have spawned in the Spawning Grounds in episode 1. It is unknown where it has transmitted, these transmissions were blue, and only a few newborn receive it. In episode 2 when you have arrived at the south sector of Capitol Platforms (where you will report in of your arrival to the guy who shoot thing Shellcore) you have received the Blue voice for the second time. Uninfected leaders think that they are transmissions from the Infected, but the Infected transmissions are actually red.Iamshellcore About me Deceleration Welcome  Hi, welcome to ShellCore Command Wiki! Thanks for your edit to the Shellcoreopedia (proto) page. Please leave a message on my talk page if I can help with anything! -- Videogama (Talk) 22:42, February 21, 2011hai  you said say hi, so...hi\u00a0:D you should edit the skirmish page so it tells details about each update, starting with my favorite..the game before the update..Deceleration (4/7)  Okay, you can do that if you want to. Nothing has really happened here for a few weeks now.Asking Password  From: Zero Delta Alpha Dear Deceleration I want to get the Password for the Link to Ep2. How can i prove my self because i already waiting years to play Ep2. And i wont upload it to any where. So please tell me how i can prove my self. Oh hello... To prove yourself you must remain active in the forum for a week or so, so that we can tell if you're trustworthy. Or sign a legally binding document like Adrian1600. We already know about the illegal upload, but there's nothing we can do about it. Deceleration 22:07, March 20, 2012 (UTC) Ok, thanks for the information. Zero Delta Alpha.Pass. For SC Command Ep. 2  Dear Deceleration, I was hoping to get the password for Shellcore command Epsiode 2, and Im really excited to play it. What can I do to convince you guys I'm trustworthy? And even I do get it, I know nothing how to upload a game, mainly beacuse I'm not a idoit that does stupid things. My fourm Username is Pixel, btw. I could sign, because I have a tablet. Just tell me how to gain your trust. Thanks, The No.1 Hacker. Well using a username like \"The No. 1 Hacker\" is not the best way to prove your trustworthiness. If you want to you can make just 15 non-spaming post and get the other link. Darty1 19:41, March 27, 2012 (UTC) I have given the password out to 1 other person who asked me out of 23, and he signed a legally binding statement. I'm not giving it to anyone for the next few months, go bother Spar. Deceleration 22:18, March 27, 2012 (UTC) soo um i really dont know how im supposed to prove that im trustworhty but ive spent a year waiting for the second episode after i played it somewhere else soo ya idk Nipod227 20:56, April 15, 2012 (UTC) the link is briken anyway, so the password is useless Darty1 15:04, April 16, 2012 (UTC)Power and Mining  I think that the \"Power and Mining\" page should be split between \"Power\" and \"Mining\" pages because they are quite different. I also added a \"Shards\" page as in Episode 3 more shard types may be added, and \"Mining\" could become quite a long page. I also noticed that on this wiki theres nothing about the dev so I added a page for that (But someone needs to fill it up!). Also, thumbs up for working so hard on the wiki\u00a0;) No link here because signature means IP here so I replaced it --> MatthewGB0 19:15, May 29, 2013 (UTC) Hey, You still play ShellCore? do you have any idea why there isn't a ShellCore 3? 106.51.156.143 06:48, April 9, 2014 (UTC) Im allways here to help decel. btw if you dont know who i am. im Dark_Relentless i for got my login to the wiki and my Orignal Acount lol another thing mind if i find the shell/core value of all ships? excluding drones, semicores, etc. 174.126.204.65 21:19, September 18, 2015 (UTC) Dark RelentlessParts and Abilities  This page is the page where we stockpile information about all the parts, skills, spawns, passives, weapons and whatnot used in ShellCore games.

It was published by Electronic Arts and developed by series creator Maxis, a wholly owned subsidiary of EA. Although Will Wright had hinted to further development on SimCity 4, at the end, only 1 expansion pack (Rush Hour) was released in 2003, before the company moved on to developing The Sims 2. Later on,\u00a0SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition was released, but it was simply the main game and the Rush Hour expansion bundled into one. To this day, SimCity 4 has the largest fanbase out of all the SimCity titles, with devoted players turning out mods and fixes that Maxis no longer creates. As of 2013, the game is still available in many retailers, as well as for download on sites\u00a0such as\u00a0Steam and Origin due to the high demand of this game over other SimCity titles, even SimCity (2013).Gameplay  As with previous installments, much of the previous game's gameplay was retained in SimCity 4. The biggest change was the addition of a regional gameplay. Not only does the player get to negotiate deals with neighboring cities, but the player is also able to build the neighboring cities. Since the player can populate the entire region and is able to rely on other cities, small towns become a viable possibility. The player now has several modes to use, each mode serving its purpose in creating and handling cities. Civic buildings were also altered. Rather than affecting the town citywide, civic buildings affect only a nearby area. The player can adjust each buildings' individual funding and each building also has a maintenance cost.Modes God mode  In God mode, the player can modify the terrain with near complete freedom, unlike mayor mode. God mode offers advanced terraforming tools, as well as brushes for trees and wild animals. Players can also perform operations that alter the entire tile, such as erosion. God mode is unavailable once the player has established their city, except with the help of cheats.Mayor mode  Mayor mode is the main focus of the game. In mayor mode, the player's goal is to construct a city while keeping their budget stable. Players have the power to add zones, roads, and ploppable buildings in this mode. They can unlock extra reward buildings by fulfilling special requirements.My Sim mode  My Sim mode lets the player create or import a Sim from The Sims and place them into their city to get feedback. If the Rush Hour expansion is installed, players can also access the U-Drive-It Mode from here.Visuals  Graphically, the game also improved. Rather than sprite-based graphics,\u00a0SimCity 4 and its Rush Hour expansion pack employ improved 3D capabilities. The main example is traffic simulation, which entirely uses 3D visuals to render vehicles. However, lights and shadows are not generated real-time and only some buildings automatically orient themselves with 3D positioning. The decaying of buildings is done more realistically, but most graphical details remain pre-rendered.Compatibility with other games Versions SimCity 4 SimCity 4: Rush Hour  Rush Hour is an expansion for SimCity 4 released in September 2003. This expansion adds several things, mostly transportation related, such as elevated rail, ground highways, and toll booths. Rush Hour also adds some European inspired buildings and U-Drive-It mode.SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition  The Deluxe Edition was released in September 2003. It is a release of both SimCity 4 and the Rush Hour expansion bundled together with numerous particle effects added and fixed. There were no major bug fixes as part of this release.Regions  SimCity 4 contains 6 pre-made regions, two of which have pre-made cities. New, unterraformed regions can also be created from the region menu and regions can also be imported.Add-ons Legacy  Will Wright stated in 2003 that there would be more expansions for SimCity 4, but that no longer seems likely. In 2004, Will Wright stated that SimCity has gotten too complex and the franchise was going to go in a new direction. To that end, Maxis ended up departing the SimCity franchise and went to develop other games for Electronic Arts such as The Sims: Bustin Out, The Urbz: Sims in the City, The Sims 2 and Spore. In 2008, the controversial SimCity Societies wasn't developed by Maxis, but rather a different developer, Tilted Mill, marking the first time a major SimCity title was developed by someone other than Maxis, which was received with mixed opinions. Maxis finally returned to the franchise almost 10 years later and released SimCity (2013), a reboot of the series in 2013, ending the string of other developers developing the series. SimCity (2013) has been met with negative reviews, stemming from server issues at the games launch. SimCity (2013) has also been criticized for numerous reasons including limited city map size and online-only play, the latter of which has been made to allow offline singleplayer play by updating the game.SimCity Wiki Welcome to the SimCity Wiki is a collaborative encyclopedia about SimCity series that anyone can edit.

As of August, Simtropolis has above 330,000 registered members, making the site the largest SimCity fansite on the Internet, and one of the remaining active SimCity communities. The site provides both an internet forum and upload/download services for custom SimCity 4\u00a0and\u00a0SimCity (2013)\u00a0contents. The site was born from a SimGolf fansite, with the administrators and prominent members of that site founding Simtropolis. The website servers are based in Canada, and the webmaster goes under the username \"Dirktator\", but people refer to him as \"Dirk\". He is helped in the task of maintaining the site by seven administrators as well as over thirty moderators and chat operators. The site has recently undergone an upgrade to new forum software.Features Overview  Simtropolis is primarily an internet forum, used for discussions related to SimCity 4, such as news, tips and tricks, city planning, experiments and troubleshooting. In addition, the Simtropolis forums devotes a portion of its space for the custom contents development and modding, including two forums designated for activities in two of the largest SimCity 4 Mod Squad teams: the BAT Squad Certification (BSC) and NDEX, as well as the SimMars mod project for SimCity 4]]. Another area of the forums contains \"city journals\", in which a user tells the story of their city and how it grows. Other discussions areas and forum sections cover real-life architecture, urbanism and city planning, forum games, and other computer/console games. The website has upgraded to Simtropolis 7.0, and donations are still needed to upkeep the busy fansite.Revenue  Simtropolis is a non-profit community. This means that the primary source of revenue is user donations. Users donating US$20 or more receive a free \"STEX-CD\" which includes many popular custom content for SimCity 4. In 2004, Dirk experimented with placing Google AdSense on the website, but this proved unpopular with the members and generated very little income. For the 2006 upgrades, Dirk urged users to donate money to the website as the upgrades would cost an estimated US$1600. During this time, many staff members and a number of users offered sponsorships, to students who were willing, yet unable to donate.STEX  Simtropolis also offers an area to upload and distribute custom contents for SimCity 4 and SimCity (2013), dubbed the Simtropolis EXchange (STEX), which hosts thousands of objects created with the Building Architect Tool and Lot Editor, as well as maps, both real and fantasy. In addition to this, the STEX allows users to comment and rate contents based on the item's quality or usability (with the exception of game modifying mods). Also, a 'Mods & Downloads' section is available, which included user-made mods to the game's features. These can include manipulating the game engine to increase maximum commute time lengths or altering the textures on road and street surfaces to become more European. In addition to the STEX and the Mods & Downloads section, Simtropolis manages an omnibus, which contains a database of useful instructions and tips on playing SimCity 4 and creating custom content for the game. Articles in the Simtropolis Omnibus are written by multiple Simtropolis members, some of whom are experienced in their respective field of the written article. Many of the contributors to the Omnibus are members of the Simtropolis Help Squad.Simtropolis Help Squad  The Simtropolis Help Squad helps new users navigate around the site. The Help Squad was founded in July 2005, but have been active in contributing articles to the website's Omnibus. During the 2005 Golden Llama Awards, the squad received a Trixie for their hard work, and dedication towards improving the website and offering newcomers help when they first arrive at the website and sign up. The Simtropolis Help Squad is run by Simtropolis moderator Cheese89, but it has been run in the past by Compromise (who was also the founder of the Simtropolis Help Squad) and Hordijk. Following behind are Mikeaut1 and Beebs who are the current assistant heads of the squad.Live chatting and podcasting  Simtropolis presently has an online live chat feature, allowing members to chat about anything (although it must be kept \"PG-13\" or lower at all times). The live chat rooms are controlled by chat operators (ops) and chat administrators (admins). Chat operators have the ability to warn, freeze, kick, ban, check the IP address of users and send trans-room messages. chat administrators in addition can change chat functions and configurations, view all messages being sent to the server and also give normal users the status of temporary operator or temporary administrator (temps). During a minor site update in June 2005, the live chat was altered to include a set of site rules that members must agree too before being allowed to enter the live chat rooms. In December 2005, the idea for a podcast was taken up by the stCast team. They first released a trailer in early December and they now produce monthly episodes with a multitude of items including a roundtable discussion, news, chat and other reviews.Awards  Every month, one member is chosen for a Member of the Month (MOTM) Award. The winners usually receive a custom member label if they didn't have one originally and a small medal stating why they were chosen for the award. Also, every month, a staff member is chosen for an Employee of the Month (EOTM) Award. Each year, Simtropolis organizes a Golden Llama Awards (or Trixie Awards) ceremony, awarding members of the site who contributed or performed well towards the Simtropolis community with \"ribbons\". The type of nominations may range from friendly members, to custom content creators, to creators of cities showcased in city journals. The Trixies for each year are announced in December of the same year.2006 Simtropolis upgrades  Between late February 2006 to April 2006, Simtropolis went through an extensive continuing change of forum software which converted the forums from IdealBB 1.53b to FuseTalk 3.0. There was also a server upgrade which enabled more people to be online at once, thus getting rid of timeout errors and Dirk, the creator of Simtropolis, limiting the amount of people allowed on at one time. The population had surged above 100,000 in the preceding period, thus taxing the site. The STEX was also pushing 30 GB, so increased harddisk capacity was added. The homepage of the site was restored in mid-April this year. The Live chat software remained unchanged, currently provided by RealChat.Dirk  Dirk is the founder and head forum administrator of Simtropolis. Dirk has been given exclusive interviews and meetings with Electronic Arts, publishers of SimCity 4 and The Sims 2, Tilted Mill, developers of SimCity Societies, and Monte Cristo, developers of City Life and Cities XL.Recent server problems See also External links SimCity 3000  SimCity 3000 is a simulation and city-building personal computer game, released on January 31, 1999, The game was developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts.History  Originally, Maxis planned to make SimCity 3000 a full 3D game. Although employees thought the idea was impractical, the management pushed the idea. The game would have also allowed players to talk to their Sims, as seen in SimCity 64. After a year of development, the game was graphically on par with SimCopter and Streets of SimCity. The game was displayed at the 1997 E3; the experience is still considered an embarrassment and the game was expected to fail at the time. Later, in 1997, EA acquired Maxis. Luc Barthelet was assigned as general producer to Maxis. He decided that 3D graphics weren't viable and brought Lucy Bradshaw to lead the project. The 3D graphics were scrapped in favor of sprite-based graphics. Instead of focusing on 3D, they expanded the core gameplay. This version of the game did better at the 1998 E3 and was well-received upon release.Gameplay  Most of the gameplay from SimCity 2000 remained in SimCity 3000. The concept of waste management was added as well as the ability to choose from three zoning densities. Also, farms could appear in certain industrial zones. The idea of dealing with neighboring cities was much expanded in SimCity 3000. Players could negotiate deals to buy or sell electricity, water, and waste management services. The game also introduced business deals. Players would have the option of allowing a certain type of building to be built in their city. If they allowed it to be built, the player receives a certain amount of money, but also has to deal with an undesirable effect. Players also were given better help. Advisors in SimCity 3000 gave the player in depth advice rather than simply discouraging the player from cutting funding as they did in SimCity 2000. The player also had petitioners, usually citizens from their city, asking for certain ordinances to be enacted or taxes to be cut. The newspapers were replaced with a news ticker. If something was wrong with the player's cities, the news stories would reflect this. If everything was going well, the stories would be humorous nonsense. The ticker would sometimes have a warning of a disaster to come. Another new feature was landmarks. Landmarks were there mostly for aesthetic purposes, though building one would open the tourism advertising city ordinance. Landmarks were free to build, but limited to ten per city (though there is a cheat that can remove this limit). Graphically, SimCity 3000 improved upon its predecessor. Buildings were grouped together more rigorously by economic class, creating distinct neighborhoods. The ground had grass and varied in color with elevation. The land had five levels of steepness instead of one. Instead of only pine trees, SimCity 3000 added several types of trees, with oaks being prevalent. On the other hand, SimCity 3000 got rid of the waterfalls introduced in SimCity 2000.Disasters  Most of the disasters from the previous games were removed. Along with the ability to dispatch police and firefighters, the ability to activate a warning siren to help your sims get to safety was added.Unlimited-exclusive disasters  These four Disasters only appear in the Unlimited Version.Scenarios  SimCity 3000 came with no scenarios. Scenarios were added in SimCity 3000 Unlimited along with the ability to create your own with the Scenario Creator tool.Versions SimCity 3000 SimCity 3000 Unlimited  SimCity 3000 was released for the PC, Unix (FreeBSD) and Linux (by Loki) in 2000, also going under the name SimCity 3000 World Edition. The game included new landmarks, disasters, maps, music, terrain, scenarios, and building sets for Europe and Asia. Also new was Building Architect Tool, a scenario generator, and a landscape generator.SimCity DS  SimCity DS was released for Nintendo DS in 2007. It is an enhanced re-release of SimCity 3000. Although almost entirely the same as SimCity 3000 (Besides the touch screen controls and removal of some buildings, such as the World Trade Center), it was renamed to SimCity DS for unknown reasons.SimCity Creator  SimCity Creator is another port of SimCity 3000, however this time it added features from later games such as day and night cycles, season cycles and some more tiny features. It released in 2008. Another exclusive feature is the ability to share cities through Wiiconnect24 on the Wii, although this feature was shut down on June 28th, 2013 due to Nintendo terminating all online services for the Wii.Legacy  SimCity 4 is the sequel to SimCity 3000. Much of the new features and improved features from 3000 was later brought over to simcity 4 and improved upon. SimCity DS\u00a0and Simcity Creator are both Enhanced ports of 3000, with minor changes.\u00a0References Nuclear meltdown  A nuclear meltdown is the result of a nuclear power plant being on fire too long, it being old, or just under unfortunate circumstances. Nuclear Meltdowns can result in the destruction of the power plant, destruction of nearby buildings and flooding of the surrounding land in radiation.SimCity  In SimCity, nuclear meltdowns can occur, but the radiation symbols are replaced with atoms.SimCity 2000  In SimCity 2000, the nuclear power plant will explode, ignite building and the city will be bathed in radiation. The fire spreads very quickly and is very difficult to extinguish. It can take around ten to twenty thousands of years before the radioactivity dies down, and about several hundred-thousand years to wear off completely. Radioactive tiles produce a lot of pollution, and most of the radiation appears near where the nuclear plant was before the meltdown. Radioactive tiles are empty unusable areas.SimCity 3000  In SimCity 3000 and its upgrade nuclear meltdowns can occur, although they are nowhere near as dramatic as its advanced successor. In SimCity 3000, the Nuclear plant lasts twenty years before collapsing. Only after said twenty years (or if it is overused or on fire) will the plant undergo a meltdown. During a nuclear meltdown in SimCity 3000, an explosion can be heard near the Nuclear power plant and a generic \"destroyed building\" symbol is displayed above the plant. Any buildings near the meltdown will turn to rubble and buildings farther away will be covered in radiation and have International Radioactive Warning insignias on them. If one zooms to the \"street-level\" view, the sound of a Geiger counter clicking can be heard.SimCity 4  In SimCity 4, when a nuclear meltdown occurs, the nuclear power plant will explode in a massive mushroom cloud, destroying any surrounding buildings and leaving a large crater and radiation where the power plant once was located. The explosion is about five times more powerful than the explosions of other power plants. After the meltdown, much of the surrounding area will be flooded by radiation, which can be seen as small green spots glowing in random places. Buildings covered in radiation will be abandoned, and the surrounding area will not be able to support new development. A massive crater will also be seen, this crater will be glowing orange for a while until it cools down. The effects on buildings surrounding the power plant are as follows: Depending on the elevation, a meltdown that occurs on land that is close to sea level will create a small lake that's radiated. Also on most to some occasions, if the fire on the nuclear power plant stays, the fire will just destroy the building to rubble, meaning no nuclear explosion.SimCopter  A nuclear meltdown can occur in SimCopter. Firing rockets at buildings with the Apache helicopter cause the buildings to catch on fire, resulting in loss of several points and cash. If the fires are not put out, the building gets destroyed, resulting in more point and cash loss. However, if a city with a Nuclear Power Plant is loaded, and fire a rocket at it, eventually it will explode, destroying almost the entire city. The player will lose all of the points and cash, several MEDVAC missions will begin, cars will be crashed, and the helicopter is destroyed. Before this happens, the screen will start to shake, glow white, and the sound of an explosion goes off. Entering the cheat \"Radioactivity\" does this as well, as long as the city has a nuclear power plant.SimCity (2013)  In SimCity (2013), a nuclear meltdown can occur when the nuclear power plant is staffed with unskilled workers, causing radiation to leak. However only a reactor module is destroyed. \u00a0If the player listens very closely around the nuclear power plant that caused the meltdown, a Geiger Counter clicking can be heard in a similar fashion to SimCity 3000. A nuclear meltdown is perhaps the most challenging disaster that can happen.\u00a0 It may happen without warning to a city with no college or university. Effects Players can make the city profitable again through careful planning to address the problems:See also SimCity Societies  SimCity Societies is a game developed by Tilted Mill Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on November 13, 2007. This game is now confirmed to be a spin-off of the SimCity series.Summary  Unlike its predecessors, SimCity Societies combines the genre of social-engineering with that of city-building. This same concept of combining the two genres was introduced in Monte Cristo's City Life, which had the player have six socioeconomic cultures dwell in the same city to strive for diversity. Unlike City Life, SimCity Societies involves six different societal social energies that the player can pick and choose from to the make the player's ideal society. Some changes to the core gameplay were made in order to simplify the game and make it easier for new players to enjoy. Zoning was removed; instead, players simply build whichever buildings they want. Players no longer need to build power lines and pipes, and transportation has become more simplified. Because of the changes to the original series formula, some SimCity fan reception to the game has been negative. The city looks and behaves according to the social energies the player decides to develop within the city. The player has the ability to mix and match from one to all six of the social energies in a single city making for, what the game developers say, a very unique gaming experience. There are over 350 buildings in the game. Certain buildings increase certain social energies, contributing to the city's total. Certain buildings have a chance of turning a normal citizen into something different. For example, a bar has a small chance of turning a citizen into a criminal while a church may produce a preacher. Also, the cities are divided into different styles: Contemplative, Romantic (European), Industrial, Fun City, Capitalist, Normal, Small Town, Cyberpunk and Authoritarian. The game is also customizable. The building specs are stored in XML files for easy modification. A version of BAT was planned, though it did not ship with the game.Societies  In SimCity Societies there are also, as the title suggests, Societies. Players can choose building societies using a special filter:Energies Disasters  There are only 3 disasters in the core game, but updates have added more disasters.Climate related disasters Response and Criticism  The game generally received mixed reviews. Some said that this game was too different, while some praised it. Most response was negative, because of the nontraditional and overly simplified gameplay. Also, the game was basically unplayable due to the framerate.SimCity 2000  SimCity 2000 is a simulation and city-building personal PC (computer) game, released in 1993.Gameplay  SimCity 2000 marked a major shift in gameplay from the original SimCity, the basic structure set forth in this seminal version has defined subsequent releases. The old overhead view was replaced with an isometric view. Land could be different elevations, and an underground view was added for the laying of pipes and subways. Also, an abandoned building would have a different graphic. Many new tools were given to players. New buildings such as schools, prisons, marinas, and arcologies were added. More variety in transit was included, such as subways, bus depots, and highways. Airports and seaports had to be zoned rather than simply built. Also, seven new power plants were added. Finances were more elaborate as well. Players were given the ability to set taxes separately for residential, commercial, and industrial zones. Players could enact city ordinances and make connections with neighboring towns. Also new was the query tool. By using the query tool on a building, players could find out more about it. The newspaper was another new feature in SimCity 2000. Much of the news was humorous nonsense, but the paper would feature relevant news after important events such as disasters or the discovery of a new energy source. The opinion polls were also useful for finding out what a city's sims want done.Disasters  Disasters made their return in SimCity 2000. Several of the old ones were removed and new ones were added. As before, they could happen randomly or be triggered purposely. A new feature was the option not to have disasters.Scenarios  Scenarios also returned in SimCity 2000. As before some were added and others were taken away. Scenarios proved to be popular enough to warrant the creation of SimCity 2000 Scenarios Volume 1: Great Disasters, a disk with new scenarios. The following are the scenarios:Versions SimCity 2000 SimCity 2000: Special Edition  This repackaged version of SimCity 2000 was released in 1995 for DOS, Windows, and Macintosh. Along with the base game, it also included the Urban Renewal Kit, new cities, new scenarios, and WillTV. WillTV was a series of four full motion videos featuring Will Wright's commentary.SimCity 2000: Network Edition  SimCity 2000: Network Edition was released in 1996 for Macintosh and Windows. If the player's computer was connected to the right network, he could cooperate or compete with other cities for resources. In Network Mode, players had to buy land before building on it. Also, the user interface was redesigned to emulate the UI in Windows 95.Console ports  SimCity 2000 was released for many different consoles including the SNES, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Advance. Most console ports included new features such as 3D minigames, cutscenes, futuristic buildings, and weather.Functionality with other games  Cities created in SimCity 2000 can be loaded into SimCopter or Streets of SimCity. Players can then tour the cities they made from their vehicles. This feature would later inspire Sim City 4: Rush Hour. Also, Sim City 2000 cities can be used in SimCity 3000 .Legacy  SimCity 3000 is the sequel to SimCity 2000. SimCity 64 appears to be based on SimCity 2000.SimCity (1989)  SimCity is a simulation and city-building personal computer game, first released in 1989 and designed by Will Wright. SimCity was Maxis' first product, which has since been ported into various personal computers and game consoles. Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the SimCity series was the best-selling line of computer games made by Maxis.History  The idea for SimCity comes from various places. Will Wright came up with the idea when he spent more time making maps for Raid on Bungeling Bay than playing the game. Wright also cites The Seventh Sally\", a short story by Stanislaw Lem, as an inspiration for the game. The first version of the game was on the Commodore 64 and was finished in 1985. Wright spent four years trying to find a publisher. Many major publishers, including Br\u00f8derbund, were scared off by the innovative gameplay of SimCity. Finally, Maxis agreed to sell it as one of their two initial games. In 1988, SimCity was shown to Br\u00f8derbund again. The company decided to enter into a distribution agreement with Maxis. That year, the game was released for the Amiga and Macintosh. Versions for the IBM PC and Commodore 64 were released the following year.Gameplay  In SimCity, players build a city. The game doesn't have a specific goal, so the player can't win or lose. The player can zone areas as residential, commercial, or industrial, add buildings, adjust the tax rate, construct power lines, and build roads, among other things. Depending on how the player builds his city, people will move to his city or leave. As the population grows, the player must accommodate their needs. In certain versions of SimCity, players get rewards for having a large population.Disasters  Players will sometimes have to face disasters such as giant fires and earthquakes. They can happen randomly or can be purposely triggered by the player. In scenarios, disasters occur at predetermined moments. Not all disasters were available in every version of SimCity. The disasters in SimCity are as follows:Scenarios  Scenarios were included as different way to play SimCity. Rather than having no goals and as much time as the player wanted, scenarios gave the player a goal and a time limit. Scenarios in SimCity replicated a real city and sometimes a real event. As with the disasters, not all scenarios were available with every version of SimCity. The following are the scenarios included: Power Plants-Versions SimCity SimCity Classic SimCity Classic Live  Classic Live - Launched in 2006. The game was available to those who registered on Simcity4.com. As of 2012, the website\u00a0has since been\u00a0shut down and merged with the main SimCity site, in the process discontinuing SimCity Live.\u00a0Micropolis  The original SimCity source code has been released under the name \"Micropolis\" as part of the Laptop Per Child Program\u00a0(OLPC). The reason it\u00a0was released was due to the OLPC requiring games to be open source, and EA wanted to donate. As for the name change, required because of trademark policies with the name SimCity, but is also a return to a name used during SimCity's development, before commercial release. EA policy for the released code says users can offshoot and claim as their own as long as they do not use the SimCity Name. The source code has also removed the plane crash disaster in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which destroyed the entire World Trade Center complex and a part of the Pentagon. Micropolis is available at: http://www.donhopkins.com/home/micropolis/Awards Legacy  SimCity spawned an entire series of Sim games. These games explored everything from controlling an entire planet to being an ant. The SimCity series remained most popular until The Sims was released.Fire  Fires are one of the disasters in the SimCity series. A fire can happen anywhere, but is more likely to happen in areas without adequate fire coverage or inadequate fire department funding. Fires can also be triggered purposely. Depending on the game, they can also break even with disasters turned off. Fires are the most common disaster and are found in most SimCity games.Causes of Fires  Certain areas of a city are more susceptible. This can be caused by inadequate fire coverage, high crime rates, amongst other reasons. Rubble, abandoned buildings, and buildings without a water supply are fire hazards, and are more likely to catch fire than other structures. Industrial buildings are also more flammable than buildings in other zones. Certain disasters will cause fires as a side effect. Among the disasters that cause fires are plane crashes, tornadoes, earthquakes, monsters, nuclear meltdowns, UFO attacks, riots, volcanoes, meteors, and lightning strikes, and the player can start fires through these disasters. The temperature can also affect the chance of a fire. Fires occur more frequently during high temperatures than during low temperatures, although this mechanism is not in all SimCity titles, as temperature is not available in some games in the series.Preventing Fires  The best method of fire prevention is having good fire coverage. Make sure to have enough stations, place them effectively, and if your city is not in dire need of spending cuts, make few changes to funding, as stations that strike will not function as normal ones. Each fire station will provide a company of firefighters if a fire does break out. There are several city ordinances that can be passed that will lower the number of fires that will break out. These laws include the Smoke Detector Ordinance and the Leaf Burning Ban. Also, making sure all buildings in your city have access to the city's water supply, as that will reduce their flammability. In SimCity (2013), educated sims are less likely to start a fire compared to non educated sims.Dealing With Fires  The best thing to do is contain the fire, if possible. Since a fire can't spread without fuel, the player can bulldoze the surrounding buildings to stop it from growing. This isn't ideal if there's an expensive building at risk. The emergency dispatch is another important tool. The player will have a fire crew for every fire station in the city (2 for a large fire station). If there are no fire stations, a volunteer fire brigade is available, but only in some SimCity titles. Once firefighters on are the scene, they will contain the fire and prevent it from spreading outwards. The National Guard (SimCity 2000) can also be used to stop the fire from spreading to their locations. It's best to use these on expensive buildings.Trivia Buildings  Buildings in the SimCity series.List of power plants  Throughout the SimCity series, players need to lay down power plants to power nearly everything in town with few exceptions. These power plants have major advantages and disadvantages, mostly costs and pollution. Without a power plant, the city won't grow. Here are the following power plants featured in the SimCity series:SimCity (original) Coal  The coal power plant, performs the same as the one in SimCity 2000. This is the first power plant available in the game and is one of the two power stations from the original computer game.Nuclear  The nuclear power plant is the same as the one in SimCity 2000. However, it's been made simpler and is also the only other power plant that can be purchased in the original game.SimCity 2000  All power plants disintegrate after exactly 50 years, unless noted otherwise.Coal  The coal power plant performs the same as the one in SimCity.Hydro Dam  These hydro dams are relatively cheap to build and are a solid source of power while producing no pollution at all. However, they can only be placed at waterfalls and produce little power per dam and thus require a large amount of money when bought in bulk. As they are one of only two plants not to disintegrate after 50 years (the other being wind turbines) they are a good investment for people who have the money to buy a multitude of them.Oil  The oil power plant, while slightly more expensive than coal, produces comparatively more power and less pollution.Natural Gas  The natural gas power plant are cheap but as with hydro dams produce less power and thus require more to be build. For a fuel burning plant, they are very clean.Nuclear  The nuclear power plant are the same as the one in SimCity, but is considered cheap compared to the other plants. When the Nuclear Free Zone ordinance is enacted, Nuclear Power Plants can no longer be built and existing ones will disintegrate. If this power plant has not been discovered and this ordinance is enacted, its discovery will also not show up in any newspapers.Wind Turbine  Costing $100 each, the wind turbine is the cheapest way to get power and are considered more reliable than solar. They also don't disintegrate after 50 years making them a good investment.Solar  On cloudy days, the solar power plant will provide little to no power at all. On sunny days however, it is a clean and relatively cheap way to get power.Microwave  The microwave power plant is clean, reliable, reasonably priced and produces a lot of power. The only drawback lies in the risk of a beam being misfired, though potentially blowing up a building and starting a fire is not much of a disaster compared to a nuclear meltdown.Fusion  The fusion power plant is the ultimate power source of the future. Requiring a large sum of money, it is clean, reliable, provides a lot of power and has no risk of having a meltdown.SimCity 3000 Coal  The coal power plant is a cheap source of electricity per MWh, but also produces the most pollution.Oil  The oil power plant is similar to coal but yields more electricity, produces slightly less pollution compared to coal power plants, but is more expensive.Gas  The gas power plant is a lot cleaner than coal but has half the capacity.Nuclear  The nuclear power plant produces lots of power, is expensive, very low pollution, but carries a risk of a nuclear meltdown if it is destroyed, overused, or if it ages out. Demolish before it blows up to prevent a meltdown.Solar  The solar power plant is similar to the one on SimCity 2000, but isn't at the whim of the weather.Wind  The wind power plant is cheap but barely generates electricity, it is more effective when built on the top of hills (including along shores).Microwave  The microwave power plant is clean and generates a lot of power but is expensive, unlike in SimCity 2000, there isn't the risk of a misaimed beam causing havoc.Fusion  The fusion power plant is clean and generates a lot of power but is very expensive, unlike nuclear there isn't the risk of a meltdown.SimCity 4  Below are all of the power plants available in the vanilla (un-modded) version of SimCity 4.Wind  The wind power plant generates 200 Megawatt hours per month of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a750 per month or equal to \u00a70.25 per MWh. Due to its small output, a player often has to plop entire farms of these power plants to generate enough electricity just for a small city. It takes up a small area of 1 \u00d7 2 titles.Natural Gas  The natural gas power plant generates 3,000 Megawatt hours per month of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a7400 per month or equal to \u00a70.13 per MWh. It produces moderate amounts of pollution, it is a rather inefficient plant.Coal  The coal power plant generates 6,000 Megawatt hours per month of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a7250 per month or equal to \u00a70.041 per MWh. It produces the heaviest amount of pollution of all power plants, but has the best efficiency or cost-to-power ratio of \u00a70.0417 per MWh.Oil  The oil power plant generates 7,000 Megawatt hours per month of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a7600 per month or equal to \u00a70.086 per MWh. It produces heavy pollution, has a high construction and monthly cost, but produces the most power of the initial power plants.Solar  The solar power plant generates 5,000 Megawatt hours per month of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a71,000 per month or equal to \u00a70.2 per MWh. This plant produces no pollution, but takes up a lot of space and is rather expensive to construct and maintain. It is unlocked as a reward for having 3,000 high wealth residents. It can also be earned by doing the Monorail mission (must have a circulatory monorail system. After completing the mission it will be available.Nuclear  The nuclear power plant generates 16,000 Megawatt hours per month of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a73,000 per month or equal to \u00a70.1875 per MWh. This plant produces no pollution, but has a risk of a Nuclear Meltdown if the plant is too old or has been on fire for a long time. The power plant is unlocked by having a total city size of 85,000 and having total city energy demand plus deals of 25,000. This plant is also unlocked by completing the evil school bus mission Study for Profit, which gives the mayor \u00a720,000, but takes away 60 mayor rating.Hydrogen  The hydrogen power plant generates 50,000 MWh of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a710,000 per month or equal to \u00a70.2 per MWh. It is clean, safe and has a very high power output, but is very expensive to construction, maintain and hard to unlock. The power plant is unlocked by having a city with a high-tech industry population of 4,000 and a total city energy demand plus deals of 30,000. The Hydrogen Power Plant is the counterpart to the Fusion power plant from SimCity 2000 and SimCity 3000.Waste to Energy  The Waste to Energy plant generates 5,000 Megawatt hours per month of electricity. Its maintenance costs are \u00a71,000 per month or equal to \u00a70.2 per MWh. This plant burns garbage to produce power. This eliminates a city's garbage problem, but produces heavy pollution.SimCity Societies  The power plants have been placed into two groups, one being an eyesore which can have a negative impact on an area (except for other eyesores), while the other group doesn't. This grouping is to simulate real-world cases that can be a result of a building function.Coal Oil Natural BioMass Trash Incinerator Super Coal Coal-Hydrogen Nuclear Wind Farm Major Wind Farm Solar Hydrogen SimCity (2013) Coal  The coal power plant are cheap to lay down, but the pollution levels are very high. Coal can be imported for cheap from the global market and can be paid for easily if the player specializes in coal mining. Generates 75MW per module.Modules Oil  The oil power plant generate more power and are cleaner than coal power plants. However, it has a higher cost to place and run. Oil can be imported from the global market, although it is more expensive compared to coal, or the player can extract oil from a drilling city. Generates 150MW per module.Modules Wind  The wind power plant are cheap and good to start a city on. Citizens love them for the look and how friendly they are towards the environment, though they create very little power unless the wind speed are high. The wind power plant is recommended for smaller towns, cliffed cities, or a region with a School of Engineering so the vertical turbines can be unlocked to increase the effectiveness. If Cities of Tomorrow is installed, the effectiveness can be even farther improved by boosting power production by 200% through the Wind Power Amplifier, although this requires 1,250 ControlNet.Modules Solar  The solar power plant are more expensive compared to the wind power plant and also cause no pollution. The basic solar array takes a lot of space in order to generate a reasonable amount of power, while the concentrated solar array produces more power and takes less space, they however cost a lot of money and requires research through the University. The power plant only generate power during the day. Like the wind power plant, if Cities of Tomorrow is installed, the effectiveness can be even farther improved by boosting power production by 200% through the Solar Power Amplifier, although this also requires 1,250 ControlNet.Modules Nuclear  The nuclear power plant generate more power and are cleaner than coal power plants. However, it has a higher cost and a risk of having a meltdown. It also requires lots of water to run. To get tier two or three power plants it requires a University and school of engineering. It is a good idea to place the plant in an Electronics based or University city as it emits dangerous radiation if it is staffed with uneducated workers.Modules  SimCity: Cities of TomorrowWave  The wave power plant requires a weak ControlNet, so it needs a power source prior. Can only be placed on a coastline and needs to be researched at the Academy.Modules Fusion  The ultimate source of power, a fusion power plant has more power than nuclear power plant but requires the Academy to research and produce ControlNet, an existing power for it, and being ignited with an existing power plant, thus turning off your cities' power for a short time. The advanced fusion reactor, which also has to be researched in the Academy, produces the highest amount of electricity in the game, at 2,400 MW, which is more than enough to power an entire city and its neighboring cities around it.Modules Simcity Buildit (Mobile) Wind Power Plant  Coal Power PlantDeluxe Wind Power Plant Solar Power Plant Oil Power Plant Nuclear Power Plant Fusion Power Plant OMEGA Power Plant SimCity (2013)  SimCity (also referred to as SimCity (2013), SC'13, or SimCity 5) is the reimagined version of the SimCity series, developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on March 5, 2013 for Windows PCs. An OS X version was also announced and was subsequently released on August 29, 2013. SimCity began development in the spring of 2009. It is the first Maxis-developed main series SimCity game since SimCity 4, released a decade prior. The game brought back the zoning feature, as well as a new multiplayer mode where a group of cities work together or compete in an online region. Curved roads also make their first appearance into the franchise. SimCity received positive reviews prior to release; however, as a result of widespread technical problems such as difficulty connecting to the game's servers, many reviewers lowered the game's review score as a result. As a result of this, EA has offered early buyers a free game from Origin.Gameplay  A new feature is that non-renewable resources are finite, so if a player uses up their resources too quickly, their economy may collapse. However, players can trade resources with other players online. In the demo shown at E3, a mayor from Stoneslow was able to pipe electricity into Taylor City. Every individual Sim has their own job, personality, education, life expectancy, etc. The design of the buildings is also customizable, as well as detailed traffic simulation, with cars lit up at night. Roads can be placed in different ways, such as straight, square, arched, freeform (curvy), and circular. There is no re-shaping of land in this game, although in Update 7 the player can raise and lower land, to a limited extent. The environmental consequences of running a city are also explored in this game, focusing on global warming and other environmental issues such as air, water and ground pollution. Like other aspects of the game, crime is also more detailed. When a Sim commits arson, the player will hear gasoline being poured and a match being lit, as well as panicked Sims running from the building, some of them on fire. One unit's behavior, such as moving into a new home and blocking the street with a moving van, could ripple out and cause a traffic jam, that in turn delays the response time of a fire truck attempting to put out a fire, which can result in a swath of the city burning. Regional play areas that allow co-operative players to collaborate and create\u00a0great works. These can benefit the region, such as bringing in more tourists and allowing the purchase of solar power at a reduced cost. The feature of zoning residential, commercial, and industrial zones return, however players will no longer be able to zone in different densities. Densities are now based on road sizes and traffic around the location of the zoned area. Online multiplayer features regions that may house multiple cities from a variety of players. Mayors can also work together. In a demo presented at E3, several mayors were able to team up to create an airport. To access online features, players will have to be logged into an EA Origin account. Additionally, launching the game each time will require the player to be logged in to Origin. In Update 10, a new offline mode was introduced, allowing the player to play in single-player, and also allowing the player to switch between single-player and multiplayer at will.Disasters  In SimCity (2013), disasters can now again occur randomly, although in Update 8 players can now disable disasters by enabling the \"Disable Random Disasters\" option in the settings menu. Like in SimCity 4, the player can summon disasters by using the disasters tab. In multiplayer mode, disasters have to be unlocked by completing achievements, while in singleplayer mode, disasters are unlocked automatically, as achievements cannot be earned in singleplayer mode. The disasters in SimCity (2013) are:Notable gameplay differences  Italics denote former gameplay differences.Releases  There are four versions of SimCity (2013)\u00a0available:Downloadable contents Country-specific downloadable contents  These DLCs are only available in specific countries in Europe.Expansion packs Compilation packs Trial version  A free trial version of SimCity was released on August 5, 2014.  The trial version is exclusive to the PC version and lasts for four hours. It provides two save slots (as opposed to ten in the regular game), two regions (Cape Trinity and Reflection Atoll), as well as being playable only in single-player mode. Save files in the trial version are transferable if the player chooses to purchase the full version of the game, as save files are stored locally.Reception and legacy  SimCity received mostly mixed to negative reviews on release, mostly due to the always online requirement, severe technical issues at launch, and the lengthy delay between server restorations. Almost every review of the game had negatively reviewed the game's always online requirement, most citing that taking an offline single player series and forcing players to play online whether they want to or not was not a good idea. Currently, the game is the lowest rated SimCity title to date, even behind SimCity Societies, which was noted for its negative reception from fans. Due to the severe backlash and negative reviews due to the always online requirement of SimCity, On May 6th, 2013, EA and Maxis revealed The Sims 4, released on September 2, 2014. Maxis stated in a video that the reason The Sims 4 will not require internet and will not have online features is to avoid another fan backlash, as EA and Maxis were not expecting such a huge backlash over the online requirement of SimCity. They also revealed in a video that The Sims 4 will use the same engine SimCity uses GlassBox, and hinted at the possibility of a feature SimCity 4 and The Sims 2 had, where the player could make a city layout in SimCity 4, and use it in The Sims 2. They hinted that may be implemented at a later date.\u00a0See also SimCity 4: Rush Hour  SimCity 4: Rush Hour is an expansion pack for SimCity 4. It includes features, old and new, most of which are transportation related. These include avenues, car and passenger ferrys, and more. Rush Hour also includes a new tool (Route Query) which traces the routes sims take to their destinations,\u00a0and the type of transportation they use. In addition, several mods for SimCity 4, including the Network Addon Mod (NAM), will only work with Rush Hour. Rush Hour is also included in the Deluxe edition of SimCity 4 and The SimCity Box.Game changes Transportation changes Other changes  There are also some new music tracks added to the game, all composed by Jerry Martin.Zone  Zones offer some control over developer types. There are 3 zones, 1 for each category of developer type. Each zone is divided into densities, which allows the player to control the number of occupants or jobs each building supports. Higher densities mean higher occupants or jobs per building built. However, zoning at higher densities is more expensive, and before any medium or high density buildings start developing, the player must have a population of at least 1,100 and 26,000 people, respectively. Note, however, that the density of the zone has nothing to do with the wealth of the development, except for low-density industrial, in which only farms develop.Zone Types SimCity  Note: Schools and hospitals will build on Residential zonesSimCity 2000 Residential Commercial Industry Other  Note: Churches build on Residential zonesSimCity 3000 Residential Commercial Industry Other SimCity 4 Residential Commercial \u200bIndustry \u200bOther SimCity Creator SimCity (2013) Resolution  Resolution is the amount of pixels a screen can display. For example, a screen resolution of 1280x1024 would be 1280 horizontal bars of pixels, each 1024 pixels tall. Getting the right resolution setting in a game will make it look better and in some cases improve performance.SimCity 4 Setting resolution  To set your preferred resolution, navigate to the in-game options menu and select \"Graphic Options\" in the menu that appears. The graphic options window will show, allowing you to select a resolution to use. The possible settings are: 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024, and 1600x1200. Once you choose a resolution, press \"Accept\" and restart the game for the changes to go into effect. If your screen's resolution isn't listed in the window, read the guide on setting a custom resolution below.Custom resolution  SimCity 4 supports the use of custom resolutions. The current supported resolutions are: 1280x800, 1440x900, 1680x1050, 1920x1200, 1360x768, 1024x600, 1600x900, 1920x1080, and 2048x1152. To set a custom resolution in SimCity 4, you need to change the target of your SimCity 4 shortcut. To do this, right click the shortcut and select Properties. In the properties window, add this to the end of the \"target\" text box, for example: -CustomResolution:enabled -r1366x768x32, changing the \"1366x768x32\" part to the specifics of your screen (e.g. WIDTHxHEIGHTx32BITor16BIT). Your target should look something like: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Maxis\\SimCity 4 Deluxe\\Apps\\SimCity 4.exe\" -CustomResolution:enabled -r1366x768x32, the path changing according to where you have installed SimCity 4.Steam  If you're running SimCity 4 from Steam, you can do the following to set a custom resolution. Right click SimCity 4 in your steam library and choose properties. Next click \"Set launch options...\". In this field you can simply insert\u00a0-CustomResolution:enabled -r1366x768x32, changing the \"1366x768x32\" part to the specifics of your screen\u00a0(see above).List of Simcity 4 Deluxe Buildings Police buildings Police Kiosk Small Police Station Large Police Station Deluxe Police Station City Jail Federal Prison Fire Buildings Small Fire Station Large Fire Station Fire Department Landing Strip Education buildings\ufeff Elementary School Large Elementary School Local Branch Library High School Large High School City Museum  An \"Automatic Radius\" Building, this building provides sims a culture viewing of art.

Arcologies are featured in SimCity 2000, SimCity Creator for Nintendo DS, and SimCity (2013).SimCity 2000  SimCity 2000 features 4 arcologies. They are available once the player reach a population of 120,000 Sims and once the player are in the year when they are invented.Launch Arco Trick  The Launch arco trick can be done in the DOS & Mac v1.1 and also Window version of SimCity 2000. [1] [2] After building 301 launch arcos & after the year 2051, a message will appear saying: \"The exodus has begun\" and the arcos will appear to explode one by one (a process which takes over two minutes to complete) and the game will show another message: \"Your launch arcos have departed into space to find new worlds. You have been compensated for the construction.\"SimCity 3000  SimCity 3000 originally planned to feature arcologies but they were cut at some point in development. The only confirmed traces of their existence is an unused audio file found in the sounds folder and two pieces of concept art for the Plymouth and Darco arcologies. Based off what little information there is, they likely would have been very similar to their SimCity 2000 counterparts based on footprint and capacity but the effects on the cities they are built in would have had much wider range considering SimCity 3000's more advanced simulation. Arcologies were likely cut in favor of dense 4x4 zoned buildings and more specialized reward buildings like the Spaceport.SimCity Creator (DS)  In SimCity Creator for Nintendo DS, arcologies will appear in the post global warming age. They are similar to the ones in SimCity 2000.SimCity (2013)  Arcologies make a return in the form of a great work in the SimCity reboot. Like other great works, multiple cities in a region can work together to complete the structure. Once a city in the region reaches 58,000 residents the construction of the arcology is unlocked, the region then needs to collect a million simoleons, 2,800 tons of metal, 1,000 tons of alloy and 60,000 crates of televisions. The upkeep is 300\u00a0simoleons per hour.Launch Arcology  The Launch Arcology returns as a landmark in the SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow expansion. It is available by pre-ordering the expansion. The building is placed under the Tourism tab of the City Specializations. Upon plopping down the structure in one's city, tourists and prisoners will begin settling into the edifice. After 5,000 spots are filled, the player is given the option to launch the Arcology into deep space. Upon launch, the player would be rewarded a large sum of cash from the 'ticket sales' of the landmark.\u00a0UFO  A UFO is a type of disaster in the SimCity series. In most games, several UFOs appear at once and attack the city as well as abducting Sims.Simcity  An extraterrestrial spacecraft attacks Earth in the Las Vegas, 2096 scenario.SimCity 3000  In SimCity 3000, A large mothership UFO appears alongside many smaller UFOs, which will abduct Sims as well as destroying buildings. UFOs does not shoot lasers in this game, unlike most later installments.SimCity 4 As a disaster object  UFOs work differently in SimCity 4. A mothership UFO appears at the selected point and abducts everything at that point. It then fires a laser, destroying the targeted structure and leaving a crater. It then spawns three smaller UFOs which then act like the UFOs in the other games. UFOs only appears in the Rush Hour expansion pack for SimCity 4.As a drivable vehicle  In the same expansion pack, the reward building Area 5.1 grants the player the ability to fly a UFO. Like its disaster counterpart, the UFO can hover anywhere and does massive damage. What makes the UFO hard to control is that the window (blue square) acts like the front and if the UFO is moved slightly, it can mess up the actual path causing the UFO to spin around until it reaches its proper path. The UFO can also abduct people (In a Dr. Vu mission) where the player must abduct a certain amount of people from each city district for simoleons and a reduced mayor rating.\u00a0The ability is used again in the UFO free drive, the cars/Sims are lifted up where the UFO is. Unfortunately, if the UFO moves the trail of abducted vehicles move with it until the player releases the abduct button (usually the enter button) and the trail of cars/Sims vanishes (presumably falling into the ground/water below).SimCity DS  In SimCity DS, UFOs will abduct citizens and the player must bring them down by rubbing the DS stylus on the screen.SimCity Societies  In SimCity Societies, UFOs move much slower and require a game update to even make it appear in the disaster menu. Once summoned, the screen and sky will turn to a shade of red (not unlike in a totalitarian city) and people will begin to scream. 3 random UFOs will spawn at corners or border of the map and will head to the city. What makes this disaster so deadly in Societies is that once it targets and destroys a building the nearby buildings (about 5-6 within radius) are caught on fire. And after the entire city will be in flames as they spread throughout city (which will be unlucky if the aliens destroy your Fire Stations and Public Safety buildings first).SimCity Creator (Wii)  In SimCity Creator for the Wii, the player can choose where UFOs appear (Note: UFOs are selected from a random pool of Disasters in Creator).SimCity (2013)  In SimCity (2013), UFOs move at a much slower pace just like SimCity Societies and only appears as a single unit unlike other games. The UFO will generally search the town before deciding to abduct Sims. After abducting Sims (therefore abandoning the building) the UFO, again, moving at a slow pace, moves out of the city. The UFO may decide to destroy a building, activating a red laser which turns the building into rubble. Also, unlike other games, this disaster does not have a huge effect in damage. Like other in-game disasters, the UFO is triggered by city specialization, apparently appearing after landmarks are placed in the city. Unlike SimCity 4 UFOs are not drivable.Simcity Buildit  In Simcity Buildit, UFO's appear in the alien invasion diaster. There is one UFO that destroys buildings, then flies away.Trivia Garbage  Garbage, if not disposed of, has a negative impact on the desirability of almost all developer types, especially commercial.Ways to reduce garbage Ordinances  Since SimCity 3000, when garbage was introduced, the mayor can choose to enact ordinances such as Industrial Waste Disposal Tax, Composting and Trash Presort to reduce garbage quantity and pollution generated and/or increase recyclable proportion of garbage. Such ordinances have an impact on the city's treasury proportionate to the city's size.Zoning landfills  Zoning landfills provides a way to reduce garbage, however garbage tends to take a long time to disappear.Building incinerators or Waste to Energy Plants  Disposes garbage in SimCity 3000 and SimCity (2013) with high pollution rate, as well as into power in SimCity 4.Recycling Centers  Reduces, but doesn't eliminate garbage.Shipping it out of the city for a fee  The player can also ship garbage out to your neighbors for a fee.SimCity Social  SimCity Social is a 2012 online SimCity spin-off game for Facebook. The game is free to play, but uses the freemium model, where the player must pay to unlock other features. The game is now closed and unavailable to play It runs like normal SimCity titles, however the player can only build when their energy is high. The player can either get it by just letting time pass, or by completing missions.Shutdown  On Monday, April 22nd, 2013, EA announced that SimCity Social, alongside The Sims Social, will both be shut down permanently on June 14th, 2013, with no chance of returning. This marks the 4th EA Sim series title to shut down. The first being The Sims Online, second being The Sims Bustin' Out online and third being MySims.\u00a0References External links Monster  Monsters are another devastating disaster in the SimCity series.SimCity  A monster, as seen in most of the SimCity games, is a random occurrence or triggered disaster, and in a scenario where Tokyo is attacked by one. In the SNES version of SimCity, the monster is Bowser (from Nintendo's Mario series), but he functions no differently than the other versions. Players can toggle Bowser in the Disasters Toolbar. On the PC version of SimCity, monsters will do the same thing, but do not leave a trail of fire. The monster will head toward areas with high pollution and may take a while for it to leave. Whether intentional on Maxis' part or not, the monster looks suspiciously like the legendary King of the Monsters, Godzilla himself. (Feel free to play Godzilla's theme during monster attacks!)SimCity 2000  In SimCity 2000, the monster is a little different than before, both in appearance and function, but it can still do some serious damage. Instead of \u00a0Godzilla or Bowser, the monster now appears to take on the form of a giant black metallic sphere with a single, red eye in the middle, and 4 mechanical legs protruding from its lower body. The monster can now shoot a laser beam like a UFO, which destroys anything within its path. The beam the monster shoots will usually leave fires, but sometimes they will instead beam down trees, water tiles, or even wind power plants, all four of which instantly destroy whatever was previously occupying that square. It can randomly appear or be toggled on and off from the Disasters menu. \u00a0The origins of the monster are left ambiguous: it is either an alien from outer space or a movie prop out of control.SimCity 4  Main Article: Robot Attack In SimCity 4, you will have Robot Attacks instead of monsters. The Robot drops down from the sky, and proceeds destroys any buildings it touches and launches small metallic projectiles with the same effect. The robot is essentially a giant version of the Servo robotic servant found in The Sims Livin' Large. The monster is also joined by a very similar event, AutoSaurus Wrecks, which tends to behave more like the monster from pervious games. The player can also trigger a UFO invasion which acts more like the monster seen in SimCity 2000.SimCity Creator  In SimCity Creator, the monster can be found in the Disasters Menu and randomly appear. They function exactly like in the other SimCity games. [[Category:SimCity 4]]SimCity 2013  In SimCity 2013, a creature that was probably made with another game by EA, Spore, appears from the ground and walks towards the city dump. It destroys any buildings in its path, and often breathes fire, which turns buildings on fire. The monster dies after it has eaten some of the garbage. The disaster is available in the Disaster menu, too.SimCity Creator (Wii)  SimCity Creator is the name of SimCity's Wii installment. SimCity DS 2 is also called SimCity Creator outside Japan. SimCity Creator was released in September 2008.Overview  SimCity Creator follows the basic SimCity formula that sees players managing a city and placing residential, commercial and industrial zones, in addition to building facilities such as police stations, hospitals, seaports, and stadiums. However, players will also be able to customize the look of their buildings by choosing from several themed hero buildings that give themes to the city such as Egyptian, Roman, Japanese, European, Las Vegas, Asian and near-future styles, in addition to ones that result in a crystal or confectionery-like appearance to buildings. Players will also be able to tour their city, rendered in 3D graphics, in a helicopter or airplane. Taking advantage of the Wii, the pointer function of the Wii Remote will be used to directly to draw curvy and straight roads and train tracks onto the map. Cities can also be shared among players through WiiConnect24. The game's advisors have been redesigned to resemble\u00a0MySims\u00a0characters. Similar to SimCity 4, SimCity Creator features a day and night cycle, as well as a seasonal cycle last seen in the SNES version of SimCity. Players may tackle disasters including dinosaurs, giant robots, tornadoes, UFOs, and meteor impacts.Construction  Zones: In SimCity Creator, the zones from the original games have returned. There are High, Medium, and Low density zones for each type. There is also a landfill zone which allows trash to be stored there. Each zone is color coded. Transportation: Zones must be connected by lines of transportation. Some of the transportation choices for your city are the following:Development  The game was first announced on February 12, 2008 as SimCity Wii by Sims label president Nancy Smith, along with other upcoming EA Sim titles including SimAnimals, MySims Kingdom, and MySims Party.Disasters  There are many disasters in the game. This list is incomplete.External links SimCity 3000: Unlimited  SimCity 3000: Unlimited was an update of the previous SimCity game, SimCity 3000. Released in May 16, 2000, it was a very popular game. SimCity 3000: Unlimited is the title in North America and Oceania, while it is known as SimCity 3000: Deutschland in Germany, SimCity 3000: UK Edition in the UK & Ireland and SimCity 3000: World Edition in other countries. The game has features not initially included in both its predecessor and its successor. These included Building Architect Plus, and a very complex Scenario Editor, which used Microsoft Office Access. The expansion added, among other things, East Asian and European building sets, additional terrain colors and vegetation types, a snapshot feature, an improved version of the Building Architect Tool (a pseudo-3D design tool based on cubes), four additional disasters (such as locusts and space junk), additional landmarks (like the Seoul Tower and Helsinki Cathedral), new reward buildings and thirteen scenarios (along with an editor based on Microsoft Access). Premade cities are also available, including (London and Liverpool for the UK), Berlin, Madison, Madrid, Moscow and Seoul.References Corporate Ground Zero Plaza  The Corporate Ground Zero Plaza is a growable Commercial building that appeared for the first time in SimCity 3000. It also appeared in SimCity 3000: Unlimited (known as World Edition in some places), an updated version of the previous game. It is the second tallest 4x4 growable Commercial building in both games (not including other building sets from Unlimited -European and East Asian sets), only surpassed by the Quigley Insurance. The other 4x4 skyscrapers are the Quigley Insurance and Gray Matter Place This building has a striking resemblance to the 500 Fifth Avenue, an Art Deco skyscraper built in 1931 located in New York City. Despite not being in SimCity 4, it can be considered an High Wealth building. In order for it to grow, the land value must be \"Very High\" or \"Astronomical\". Once the building is constructed, the land value must stay at or above \"High\", otherwise the building will become abandoned. Note: It is possible that Wren Insurance replaced the Coporate Ground Zero Plaza due to their similarites but it is unconfirmed.Foreign Names See Also Bomb Drop SimCity  Bomb drop is exclusive disaster in  Hamburg scenario.

He has appeared in each of the series' games. Ty starts out as an orphan in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger. However he ends up very well-known and is very popular by the end of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3. In real life, Ty's species, the Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger and the Tasmanian Wolf, is a meat-eating marsupial now believed to be extinct, despite some current sightings. He was portrayed by Stig Wemyss in the first game, and by Greg Ellis in the second and third.Appearance  Ty carries some of the trademark characteristics of his species, such as the stripes on his back and tail, and of course, a powerful bite. His clothes change in every game.Biography  Ty is the main character of each of the three games. He is the hero of Southern Rivers. Along with the help of Bush Rescue, TY has saved countless towns from innumerable catastrophes, both natural, Cass and Quinkan calculated.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger  Ty was originally thought to be an orphan in the first adventure, because of the events that took place before the story narrated. He was found as a child and was raised by the Bilbies, who are small, blue Marsupials who live underground. During the opening of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Ty falls down a chasm while playing with one of the bilbie boys and discovers the Bunyips, who are large, half-spirit, half-beast creatures.\u00a0They tell him that his parents were imprisoned by Boss Cass\u00a0in the Dream Time and that he must find a way to free them. At the end of the game, Boss Cass is taken to prison for his crimes and Ty's Family is set free.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue, Ty is back to help the people of the\u00a0Southern Rivers\u00a0to put a stop to Cass' plan to create an Uber reptile army.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan  After living peacefully in his island nation of Cassopolis with Shazza, Ty is summoned again to help the Bunyips fight a new evil\u2026 the Quinkan. When Ty ends up six months into the future. He finds the new alien species have invaded Southern Rivers, destroyed Burramudgee and caused Bush Rescue to disband. All would have been lost if not for \u201cThe General\u201d, the military leader that kept the remnants of society together. Now Ty with some help from unusual new allies, and attempt to turn back the Quinkan invasion.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 4  Ty is now known as the famous hero that saved Southern Rivers countless times. Ty and his mates at Bush Rescue have regrouped. Their new H.Q. in town of Coolarangah on the shores of Lake Burramudgee reaches out to help those in need whenever they are in danger. Things have since been quiet since Cass set up a resort island of Cassablanca and \u201cretired\u201d there. Except strange, mysterious things are starting to happen around Southern Rivers like the shadowy figure that is said to have been seen on the outskirts of town. There\u2019s a mystery to be solved for sure.But first Bush Rescue is out to help one of their friends move his Thunder Egg museum.Personality  Ty is a all in all true hero, but he did not talk much in the first game, usually preferring one-liners. By the second and third game, his dialogue had become much more developed and he has shown to be over confident, but still very much heroic. However Ty is not always the best at making plans, infact unlike other video game heroes Ty is less of a leader. Ty makes up for it in compassion and the desire to do goodPowers  Thylacine\u00a0Physiology: Due to being a thylacine, Ty has supernatural agility, enhanced strength as well as the ability to glide as well as bite. It is unknown if Boomerang mastery is apart of thylacine physiology as many thylacine are masters but not all of them. However it might be as Ty is a master in the first game without being trained.Abilities Equipment Quotes Trivia See also External links Ty Wiki About Ty the Tasmanian Tiger  Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is a game series centralizing on the events that take place in a fictional region known as Southern Rivers, located somewhere in the outback of Australia.

He was Boss Cass's best henchman in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, where he appeared as a mini-boss. Near the end of the story, Ty rescued him from falling into lava. He told Ty that he would regret saving him before running off. During the final battle, he showed up and gave Ty a helping hand in defeating Boss Cass, and ended up as a close ally by the time of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2.Biography Ty the Tasmanian Tiger  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, he serves as a mini-boss in the game. Sly started out on Boss Cass's side, because he raised him and told Sly that his parents had left him. However, Sly changed sides when he learned the truth; Cass is responsible for trapping Sly's parents\u00a0in the first place. Sometime in between the events of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger or Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, it was revealed to both Ty and Sly that they're brothers. It's unknown at which point this was revealed, but whenever Ty approaches Sly in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 or 3, he would say something along the lines like, \"Hey bro!\". Also, when he gets hit by Ty's rangs in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3, he would say,\"Uncool, bro!\"Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, he helps Ty in the beginning of the game and at the end, when they\u00a0 venture into Cass's hideout. He also owns Sly's Shack, a shop where he sells Tier 2 Boomerangs, including the Multirang, Lavarang, Freezerang, Thunderang, X-Rang, Warperang, Kaboomerang, Omegarang, Deadlyrang, and Doomerang. Accessing the shop is a challenge. Sly's store is inexplicably located at the top of a large tree, and players have to get to the top by jumping through an obstacle course, which can take awhile or cause you to fall to your death a few times.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3, he's an ally of both Ty and Bush Rescue. He meets Ty at the beginning of several missions. Sly's personality is more easily seen in this title due to a greater role in the story. In particular, he's annoyed at doing work for Boss Cass, saying it reminds him of his past. He, Shazza, and Fluffy attempt to assist Ty in taking on the Quinking, but their plane is shot down by enemy fire before they can get far. Ty goes on ahead anyway, as the Redback Gang arrive to help out the others. 'Ty the Tasmanian Tiger: Boomerang Blast' By the time of Boomerang Blast, his outfit has taken on a more sinister appearance, complete with trench coat and footwear/gloves which accent his claws. He also seems to have had an accident, now sporting a scar across his muzzle.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 4: Bush Rescuers  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 4, Sly isn't seen for much of the game, having gone missing. Soon, a mysterious figure similar to Sly is seen setting numerous parts of Southern Rivers on fire, before kidnapping Ranger Ken. Soon, Ty's investigation reveals that it is in fact Sly behind the crimes. Sly attempts to murder his brother through various traps, though Ty is able to save Ranger Ken, albeit allowing Sly to escape in the process. Sly professes he has come back to his senses and says he should not rely on his friends, unlike the weak Ty. Ty proceeds to chase Sly's crabmersible down while riding on Bull's back. Bull rams Sly's vehicle so hard it explodes. Ty is naturally full of grief at Sly's death... until he sees that it was just a robot all along, indicating the real Sly is still out there somewhere. Ty eventually manages to rescue the real Sly from Cassablanca, leaving him behind so he may go deal with Boss Cass. After the credits, Sly is watching Ty and Shazza making out from behind Fluffy's statue, when Naomi sneak up on him and show intrest in him, he returns it. It's presumed that they have a good relationship together, as well as Ty and Shazza.Strategy  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, he's really quick on his feet. The player must dodge Sly's Deadlyrang attacks while trying to find out where Sly is.Personality  In the first game, Sly clearly had thuggish tendencies, indulging in evil laughter, being fiercely loyal to Cass' cause, and trying to kill Ty more than once. When Ty saved him from falling to his death, he was noticeably shocked, having difficulty coming up for words for such kindness. Sly is apparently good at information collection, since shortly afterward he turns on Boss Cass, stating that it was because Cass had lied to him. This would indicate he has a vengeful streak, as Cass had been his adoptive father prior to this, and was only using him as a tool to be discarded at a later date due to Cass' xenophobia towards mammals. By Ty 2, he had reformed considerably (likely as a result of finding out he had a family after all), though he still made boomerangs of destructive power as a hobby. Though he had changed allegiance, he still remained fairly aggressive, threatening to clobber Ty if accidentally hit. Though Sly is confident at getting a chance at vengeance on Cass, he's noticeably disheartened at seeing Ty having a better Bunyip than himself. His desire for vengeance seems to not be too overpowering, as well, given that he agreed to let Ty do the work of fighting Cass while he and Shazza rescued the villagers. In Ty 3, the once menacing Sly had become fairly heroic and much more easygoing. He became playful around Ty, sharing jokes with him, showing he had softened up considerably. He clearly shows regrets for what he did working for Cass, saying that helping Cass out reminds him of all the bad things he did in the past; he does not specify exactly what he means, however. He has bonded quite closely with his brother, saying he would protect Shazza for him should Ty perish. His movements are also very erratic, as if anxious, constantly shifting and moving his limbs about. This may be related to Ty having been presumed dead for the past six months, and all the stress that has resulted from it and the radically changed environment around him.Quotes Trivia See also Quinkan  Quinkans\u00a0are spirit-like enemies that appear in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan. There are many varieties of Quinkan. Below is a list of all of the Quinkan types:Shazza  Shazza the Dingo is your regular girl next door. Unfortunately, in the outback, next door can be a thousand kilometers away. Luckily for Shazza, she has the gift of mechanical hands, with\u00a0which she can build a machine that can cover the distance in no time. But for Ty, she would gladly walk anyway. Shazza has a little sister named Naomi.Background  Shazza first appeared in the level Walk In The Park, where her truck broke down in the road of the forest. To make things worse for her, Blue tongue frills are pursuing her so Ty comes to help her. Shazza can't leave without her water bottle filled up, so Ty has to protect her from the Blue Tongues by knocking rocks on their heads. Afterwords, Shazza gives Ty a Thunder Egg and drives off. Later, as Ty mounts on Bull, Shazza gives a mission to wrangle up her Emus who are running off to \"Greasy Gus's Hamburger Shop\" (which made them sick last time). After Ty rescues all her Emus, Shazza gives him another Thunder Egg. Ty later saves Shazza from getting killed by Biker Frills, and she gives him yet another Thunder Egg. Finally, Shazza is found in Cass' Crest where she picks up the final talisman which one of the frills dropped. However, she gets kidnapped by Shadow who wants to kill her and take the talisman. Ty defeats Shadow, and Shazza kisses him for saving her life. Shazza also appeared in the ending with Ty meeting his parents.Quotes  \"Thanks, Possum.\" \"Shivers!!\" \"Struth!\"Trivia Appearance  Shazza has orange fur and blonde hair and wears different outfits in each game. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, she wears a red rolled up top with a blue bracelet, blue pair of shorts, white socks and brown hiking boots. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, she wears a red t-shirt, brown vest, blue jeans, fingerless gloves, and boots. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3, she wears a blue camouflage jacket and pants with a red t-shirt and brown military boots.See Also Boss Cass  Boss Cass is the main antagonist of the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger series. He is an evil cassowary who often tries to do something that will end in him achieving world domination. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, he wants to steal The Mystic Talismans and fails to do so at first, as Ty's father releases them right before he was imprisoned. After sealing Ty's family away, he begins to search for the talismans again, but is stopped by Ty. He tries twice more to take over Southern Rivers (and the world afterwards) in the next two stories, but is once more hampered by Ty.Background  Boss Cass got out on the wrong side of the egg shell. He didn`t tiptoe around the shells either, he devoted his whole life to ruling the Southern Rivers, an aspiration which, thanks to Ty, has remained unrealized. After numerous failed attempts (such as kidnapping the entire population of Burramudgee to create an army of uber reptiles) and jail time, it is no wonder that he has a transient work force. Karlos, Fluffy, and even Sly have worked for him at one point, in addition to the Frills, Blue Tongues, and other assorted baddies who remain regulars. - EnTYclopediaInvolvement Ty the Tasmanian Tiger  He attempts to locate the Five Talismans, so he can open the gate to the Dreamlands and banish all mammals there, viewing\u00a0himself as\u00a0a reptile due to his dinosaur ancestry. Indeed, Ty is, at first, unable to do much to weaken the giant mech he is piloting towards the Talisman Shrine. However,\u00a0Sly's timely intervention with his Doomerang provides Ty with the tools he needs to end Cass' madness.Bush Rescue  He's busted out of Currawong prison by Fluffy, and immediately gets to work on a new plan. With the scientific prowess of the mysterious Karlos, and some technology he \"borrowed\" from facilities around the region, he invented a device that would let him fuse the best qualities of both reptiles and mammals, allowing him to create a race of super mutants. Cass plans to conquer the world with an army of enhanced reptiles, and kidnaps Burramudgee's entire population to assist in this. A team consisting of Sly, Shazza, and Ty once more foils his plans, though it's never revealed it they send him to jail. He obviously isn't there for long, as he's free and once more reigning over Cassopolis by the time of Night of the Quinkan.Night of the Quinkan  This time he's\u00a0not a villan\u00a0as usual, but the ruler of Cassopolis. At first Boss Cass says he welcomes the Quinkan invasion, likely seeing a chance for power, though he changes his mind shortly after seeing one of his statues toppled over, seeing his new allies likely will just use him. He promises to help Ty find the kidnapped Shazza, but only if some favors are done for him first. He states, based on Fluffy's remarks, that he enjoys having Ty as a \"slave\", but nonetheless shocks everyone (especially Sly, who had worked with him for so long) when he actually gives Ty her location. When Ty arrives in the Quinkan dimension, Boss Cass is being possessed by the Quinking, the first sign he may not have been showing his true intentions. The Quinking, via Boss Cass, states that the Quinkans were invited to Boss Cass' world, thus revealing Cass had been manipulating everything in an attempt to gain power yet again. Sure enough, once the Quinking is defeated, Cass is revealed to have captured Ty's friends\u00a0and is ready to kill both his enemies with one shot. However, Fluffy jumped in front of the blast, being vaporised by it instead. Sly and Shazza escape\u00a0while this happened, and the former was seen grabbing ahold of Cass and dragging him off, likely to jail.Personality  Boss Cass is ruthless in his pursuit of domination over Southern Rivers and removing\u00a0it of its mammalian population. He will do just about anything to obtain power and achieve his goals, best seen when he actually brings the Quinkan to Ty's world, planning to use them to weaken Ty and the locals enough for him to conquer everything in the aftermath. Boss Cass is, in Ty's words, \"mean, arrogant, selfish, conceited, and a bully.\" Boss Cass is also pedjudice towards mammals, constantly demeaning them whenever he has the chance. Boss Cass is prone to fits of rage when his plans are hampered, regularly abusing his henchmen. When one of his Frills suggested possibly trying another way of dealing with Ty in the first game, he was swift to issue a beating to the minion. It's possible Boss Cass has some concern for others, if\u00a0any. He did seem to have some semblance of a relationship with Sly (who he had taken in and raised after sending the boy's family to the Dreamtime) during their partnership, refraining from beating him, promising Sly he wouldn't be banished like the other mammals, and seeming genuinely hurt when Sly turned on him. However, the first could be the fact Sly was a useful henchmen, the second that he was quite possibly lying, and the third was either an attempt at pity or just the shock that Sly's unwavering loyalty had broken so quickly. Despite the likelihood they had some sort of familial relationship over the years, these ties clearly have been terminated by this point, showing how fragile any compassion Cass may show is to begin with. He showed a hint of sadness and disbelief in his face when Fluffy sacrificed herself to protect Ty. It's very possible losing his two prime henchmen to Ty's cause has had effects on his psyche.Strategy  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger Simply throw the Doomerang and guide it down the vent systems until it hits Boss Cass. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue First, destroy the Nano-bots.Then when he is flying around the room in his machine, punch or shoot him until he falls out. Then, just simply attack him while he is running around.Quotes  \"My dinosaur ancestors were here first, you stinking, furry mammal opportunists!!\" \"REMEMBER THE COMET!!!!\" \"Noo! You mammals don't deserve to be at the top of the food chain!\" \"You just couldn't keep your little orange rat nose out of my business, COULD YOU!?\" \"Did you manage to take care of our little problem?\" \"That's right...and, I'm, the, only, boss, around, here! And, I, do, all, the, thinking! Now get out of my sight! (To Frill) \"How, hard, can, it, be! He's just a stupid meddling, Rat!\" \"Welcome to my city. While you are here, you may address me as \"Your Greatness,\" or alternatively, you may GET LOST.\"Trivia Boomerangs  Boomerangs are the in choice of weapons during Ty's adventures. Most of them are created by Julius, like the Technorangs. Below is a list of boomerangs.Boomerangs Chassis  Bunyip Stones can be attached to chassis boomerangs' slots to add abilities to them.Trivia Ty The Tasmanian Tiger 4: Boomerang Blast Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan  Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan is the third game in the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger series.Plot  Following Boss Cass' defeat at the hands of Bush Rescue, the Bunyip Elder summons Ty and Shazza for a small meeting. After teleporting them to the Dreaming, the Bunyip Elder tells them that while they were fighting Boss Cass, an evil force known as the Quinkan invaded and began taking over the Dreaming. After obtaining the Quinkan Gauntlet, Ty and Shazza assist the Bunyips in removing the Quinkan from the Dreaming, successfully driving them away. After a training session with the Bunyips, Ty and Shazza are warped back to the real world. However, while they were being warped, a Quinkan knocks Shazza into the real world and out of Ty's reach. When Ty returns, six months have passed, and Burramudgee has been invaded by the Quinkan, leaving it as only a shadow of its former self. Dennis has taken charge of the war effort in Southern Rivers after Bush Rescue disbanded. After Ty briefly reuniting with his parents, Sly, and Shazza, Dennis assigns Ty the task of finding and bringing back the other members of the Bush Rescue Squad. With the team reunited, they begin to make their efforts in freeing Southern Rivers from the Quinkan invasion. However, a Quinkan known as the Hexaquin guards the gateway to the other parts of Southern Rivers, limiting what they can access. Ty defeats the Hexaquin, allowing Bush Rescue to continue. Afterwards, Shazza is kidnapped by the Quinkan in Dead Dingo Marsh. Ty runs after the Quinkan but a mysterious robot stops Ty for a fight. After Ty defeats the robot, it opens up and reveals Fluffy. Sly jumps in and tells Ty and Fluffy that they have to work together to find Shazza. Fluffy informs him that Boss Cass might have information on where Shazza is. When Ty goes to Cassopolis, Boss Cass says he's been talking with the Quinkan and might be able to figure out where Shazza is. In return, Boss Cass has Ty and the other Bush Rescue members complete various tasks for him. Once complete, Cass comes good on his word and reveals that Shazza is being held hostage by a Dragonquin. Ty uses the Gunyip to defeat it and then rescues Shazza afterwards. She tells Ty and Bush Rescue that the Quinkan are preparing the way for their leader, the Quinking, and that a weapon capable of defeating him is somewhere in Southern Rivers. The topic of a Quinkan expert is brought up in the conversation, so Ty, Shazza and Fluffy go to find him. It turns out to be Gooboo Steve, who tells them that he hid the weapon, a Shadow Rang, and the Shadow Stones to power the rang across the Outback. Ty explores Mt. Boom to find the missing shadow rang and stones, but accidentally loses the shadow stones in the volcano before it erupts, scattering the stones across Southern Rivers. Ty and the Bush Rescue members find the rang and stones, before making their way to the Quinking. Ty confronts the Quinking, who reveals that the Quinkan were summoned to Southern Rivers by Boss Cass with the hopes of controlling them, and duels him with the Shadow Rang. Ty manages to weaken him, but the Quinking transforms into a larger, more powerful form in hopes of gaining the upper hand. However, by the end of the duel, both cannot muster enough energy to finish off the other. Boss Cass then appears, having captured Shazza, Sly and Fluffy. Cass, still wanting to rule Southern Rivers, equips himself with a large laser gun that will take out both Ty and the Quinking. However, Fluffy breaks free from her confinement and pushes Ty away from Cass' blast, the laser hitting and killing her. Cass is escorted away by Sly while Ty and Shazza mourn over the loss of their new ally. With Cass defeated and the Quinking vanquished, Southern Rivers returns to a state of peace, and a statue of Fluffy is made in honor of her heroism.Trivia Characters  This is a list of characters from the Ty the tasmanian tiger series.Ty's family  Ty's family consists of five \"Tasmanian Tiger\" Thylacines:Background  Ty's parents were trapped in the Dreaming since all of the kids were young. Their two sons both believed that they were either orphans or abandoned. It is unknown what happened to Betty through her childhood.Involvement  Ty's parents own a 'rang shop in both Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3.Quotes  G'day son! Bye son. Just yell when you need a hand, ok? Oh yay! My little cub is here!Trivia Fluffy  Fluffy is a thorny devil lizard and Boss Cass' lead henchwoman. Later in the series, she assists Bush Rescue in their fight against the Quinkan, and starts to reform before making the ultimate sacrifice.Story Ty the Tasmanian Tiger  Fluffy is introduced when Ty locates the last talisman. In order to receive the talisman, he must defeat Fluffy in Fluffy's Fjord, where she resides in the head of an enormous mechanical yeti, seemingly controlling it. After losing the battle, she disappears into the night and is not seen again until Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue  Ty meets Fluffy once again immediately at the beginning of the adventure, where she is seen in her Bunyip attempting to free Boss Cass from prison. She reoccurs multiple other times throughout the story in boss fights when Ty has to confront her when she starts stirring up trouble. The majority of the time, she fights in her Bunyip suit, but she uses other technologies as a form of defense such as nano-bots and Patchy the Cybersaur.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan  During Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3, while she starts out as a nemesis, she quickly begins to warm up to Ty. They find themselves working together for the good of Southern Rivers, which begins to change her for the better. She eventually comes to consider Ty a friend, though also mentioning that he should look after himself; Ty's rebuttal is that friends look after eachother. After Shazza had been kidnapped by the Quinkan, Fluffy was pushed by Sly to help find her, although it would require them to seek aid from Boss Cass himself. After Ty defeated the monster that captured Shazza, Fluffy aided in their search for the expert of the \"shadow stones\" required to power the weapon needed to destroy the Quinkan leader Quinking, showing signs of change and remorse over her previous actions. At one point, she even told Ty that she wasn't worth saving from any predicament, although Ty begged to differ. This friendship is proven true when Boss Cass opportunistically tries to kill both Ty and the Quinking with a shot of his special weapon; Fluffy sacrifices herself to push Ty and Quinking out of the way, blowing him a kiss before she is vaporised. However, her final act destroyed the Quinking (and by extension, all of the Quinkan). Following Cass' defeat, Ty commemorates Fluffy as a hero, feeling intense sadness over her death. However, a secret cutscene shows Karlos and his friends to have found her tail, still alive, claiming that he could bring her back to life via cloning the remains.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 4: Bush Rescuers  Fluffy comes back, after become evil again. Ty is surprised to see her alive, setting Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 4 before Boomerang Blast.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger: Boomerang Blast  She managed to regenerate from her tail segment, as she is available as a playable character.Strategy Ty the Tasmanian Tiger  Start out by throwing your Flamerangs at the body of the Yeti. The arms, the legs and the torso should catch fire and melt off reveling a robot underneath. Search around for a gas pipe, they should shoot fire from them occasionly. Stand behind one and throw your flamerangs through the fire at the robot. Keep doing this until the robots health is empty. Afterwards, take your Frostyrangs and throw them at the robots head. A cutscene will follow.Quotes Trivia Quinking  The Quinking was the ruler of all Quinkan and serves as the Last boss in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3:Night of the Quinkan. At the beginning of the game, he possesses Frills and uses them to talk for himself. At the end of the game, it is revealed he is the only Quinkan capable of speech without a host, as he fights Ty one on one, while taunting him during the battle.Involvement  The Quinking is the leader of all Quinkan, as his name implies. He shows a deep contempt for all other life, viewing himself as its master and speaking of his desire to kill or enslave everything else. He is first discovered by Shazza after she escapes her bonds. His plan was for his ground troops to occupy Southern Rivers long enough for himself to come through, at which point he would be able to take field command and conquer the world. By the end of the game, he is preparing to make his grand entrance in Southern Rivers, due to a portal appearing in the region. However, Ty enters the Quinkan's world first, and after overcoming swarms of his enemies, faces the Quinking himself. The Quinking, possessing Boss Cass at the time, explains that Cass had helped the Quinkan first invade Southern Rivers so as to help in his plans of world domination, though Cass himself ended up as the servant of the Quinkan instead. Stating his plan to enslave all non-Quinkan in Ty's realm and use them as hosts, the Quinking mentions that to triumph over Ty in battle, he shall turn into the \"most powerful being on the planet,\" before taking on a form similar to Ty's, complete with dark boomerangs. Despite this strategic move, the Quinking is still defeated, losing his temper and swelling into a monstrous form in a last effort to kill Ty. Failing yet again, he is left crippled and weak, the battle also having exhausted Ty. Boss Cass shows up with an extremely powerful ray gun shortly afterward, having incapacitated all of Ty's friends. Assuming that Cass - who he calls \"Slave Cass\" -\u00a0 shall murder Ty for him, the Quinking laughs in triumph. Cass quickly rebuffs the King, however, saying that he can kill both Ty and the Quinkan leader in one shot. The Quinkan, without their leader, and the Bush Rescue, without their main fighter, would both be too weak to resist Cass' armies after this. The Quinking naturally resents having fallen so low, growling as he is filled with anger that Cass is no longer his pawn. Boss Cass takes his shot, though Fluffy pushes Ty and Quinking out of the way and supposedly vaporised her. The Quinking and the threat the Quinkan were defeated.Strategy  At the start of the battle, it will run around the room, hitting Ty with projectiles. Simply hit it after it throws one. After being hit a couple of times, it will turn into its true form. In this form, certain parts of its body will glow orange. When it stops firing homing missiles from it's back, hit the orange part. Keep hitting every part of his body the turns orange until he tired.Quotes  \"You will soon cross over to the other side, and I'm not talking about the gate, Ty!\" \"Surrender now, and your death shall be quick, and painful. Hahaha!\"Trivia See also Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue  Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is the second game in the Ty series. This game takes place some time after the events of the previous game; Ty the Tasmanian Tiger. The game takes place in Burramudgee, a fictional town in a region known as Southern Rivers. In this game, the players can have a wide variety of Boomerangs to use and a wide variety of new enemies to fight. Unlike the first game, this game also features Side Missions.Plot  One day, Ty and Shazza were driving when Ranger Ken tells him Boss Cass, the evil Cassowary who imprisoned Ty's parents long ago, has escaped from Currawong Jail and has set up his own country called Cassopolis, claiming he has diplomatic immunity. Dennis, the Green Tree Frog, has formed \"Bush Rescue\", an organization to stop Cass. As part of Bush Rescue, Ty goes on a number of missions all around the Southern Rivers such as transporting valuable items, rescuing civilians, and stopping Cass's evil lizard minions. On one mission, Ty has to face Patchy the Cybersaur (an Ankylosaurus with robotic enhancements on his head, tail, and back) who was sent by Fluffy, the Thorny Devil who Ty faced at the Fjord in the first game. Then while trying to stop a fire on an offshore oil rig, Fluffy use Buster, a monster formed by yellow nanobots joining together, to distract Ty so she could steal a shadow drive from the rig. Cass then uses the drive to mix warm blooded strength from mammals with the lizard's cold blooded ferocity and weapons to make \"Uber Repitles\". During a battle with Fluffy, Ty manages to steal a Data N.U.T. and gives it to Julius the Koala, Bush Rescue's lead scientist, for analysis. From the NUT, Cass' evil plan is revealed just as Cass kidnaps Burramudgee to use their warm blood for \"Uber Reptiles\" Ty, Sly, and Shazza go to his lair to stop him. Shazza uses a standard Battle Bunyip, Sly uses his custom made \"Missile Bunyip\", and Ty uses the new Shadow Bunyip. After once again defeating Patchy and Buster, Sly and Shazza go to free the residents of Burramudgee and Ty goes to defeat Boss Cass. Just before she leaves, Shazza gives Ty a kiss for luck. Ty and Cass then face off in the middle of a volcano. Cass summons a bunch of green nanobots capable of joining together into a long armed robot to destroy Ty but he destroys it and defeats Cass. Once they get back, Ty, Sly, and Shazza receive medals of bravery and honor, made out of Thunder Eggs. Later Boss Cass is seen in prison carrying out lunch duty and serving food to all of his lizard minions.Cast  Characters in italics appear for the first time in the series.

The game was in an alpha state, and thus has several bugs and is prone to crashing, though it can be played to 100% completion. Key differences in the remake include:Trivia Beta Elements  Many elements were cut from the game during its beta phase, mainly due to time or memory constraints:External links Uber Reptiles  Uber Reptiles are Boss Cass' henchmen that have been enhanced by Karlos. They are enhanced by transferring warm, mammal blood into their bodies, and transferring their cold, reptile blood into the bodies of other mammals, which would cause the internal temperatures of mammals to decrease dramatically and weaken them.There are three types of Uber Reptiles:Involvement  Uber Reptiles are a part of Boss Cass' main scheme in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, he plots to kidnap mammalian denizens of Burramudgee to fuel their creation. They appear sparingly over the course of the game mainly appearing in missions and are prominent enemies in the final assault on Boss Cass' fortress.Strategy  These creatures can only be defeated with the power of a Bunyip or an upgraded Boomerang.Trivia See also Naomi  Naomi is Shazza's little sister. She is an expert on Bunyips and runs the Bush Rescue Mobile HQ in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3.Involvement  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, Naomi can been seen walking around Burramudgee Town, and shows up in the ending scene of the game with the rest of the town's inhabitants. She was apparently kidnapped by Boss Cass with the rest of Burramudgee, this may have led to her involvment in Bush Rescue in the third game. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3, she sells Bunyip upgrades to Ty all over Southern Rivers.Quotes  \"Ty, don't tell me you've forgotten me! I'm Naomi, Shazza's little sister? When the Quinkan came, I moved here and set up this place to sell Bunyip parts. But if there's anything I can do to help just give me a yell, okay?\"Trivia See also Maurie  Maurie is a Galah, that`s for sure. In his time he has helped\u00a0found not only the Bush Rescue, but a number of watering holes as well. It would be fair to say that he was not only the owner, but the best customer too. It is easy to get along with this cranky old bird; just don`t sew sequins into his shirt! Maurie has a sister who is also a Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo.Story  He acts as Ty's mentor in all three games. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, he helps Ty find his second boomerang and founded Bush Rescue. He can be found in special spots scattered throughout every level and when approached, he delivers a monologue of tips and background information about the area. n Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, he mans the radio station at Burramudgee Bush Rescue and notifies you when new missions appear on your map. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3 Maurie left Bush Rescue during Ty's absence, but rejoins after Ty wins a race against him.Quotes  \"Oi! Who are you calling birdbrain, fur face?!\" (To Julius) \"Strike me lucky!\" \"Welcome to Rainbow Cliffs, mate.\"Trivia Ridge  Ridge is a take-no-prisoners 'rang for hire from outer Southern Rivers. He first came to Burramudgee to fight the Quinkan, and now is an honorary member of Bush Rescue. His Ultrarang can be thrown at the speed of sound. Ridge seemed surprised when Ty said that he had only used a boomerang \"Once or twice.\"Background  Ridge was an adopted child who never knew his real parents. One day, he set off to find them. This let him to New Burramudgee. Ridge has a sister named Brolga, though she is not in any of the games beside Boomerang Blast.Involvement  When Ty returns from the Dreaming, he finds himself in a ruined wasteland infested with Quinkan and zombified Frills. Ty seems outnumbered, only to be saved by the mysterious stranger, Ridge. After defeating the enemies nearby, Ty asks how he can get back to Burramudgee, only to find out that he is in Burramudgee, or what is left of it. Ty must then hold off the invading forces while Ridge tries to close the fortified town's gate. Ridge explains that the Quinkan have ravaged the land since Ty's speculated death, and that what's left is held together by someone only known as \"the General.\" Ridge takes Ty to meet the General, who Ty is surprised to see is none other than Dennis, and Ridge's only response upon finally learning Ty's name is \"..The Ty?\" After this, Ridge takes a backseat in the story, being available to talk to as a minor NPC guarding the gate, but otherwise, having no importance to the plot, not even appearing in the ending.Personality  Ridge is clearly a serious fighter, having the skills and mentality necessary to fight off large groups of enemies. Despite this, he still retains a sense of humor, and addresses Ty as \"Tiger.\" Like many, he clearly respects Ty's legendary status as the local hero, seeming quite surprised to discover who Ty was. However, when he was discussing Ty having saved an entire town, he threw out his hands with an almost sarcastic \"wow,\" which may show he is not easily impressed.Quotes  \"I really love listening to you trying to talk tough. It makes me laugh. If Sly was here, he'd laugh too.\" \"You know, out of all the rang throwers I've seen, you're definitely one of them.\" \"After seeing you fight, I reckon you've got all the skills to be a professional. Plumber. Haha, just messing with you!\"Trivia Doomerang  The Doomerang is a rather dangerous, unique type of boomerang. It is also known as the Doom Chassis in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan. The Doomerang has two yellow wings, and a skull with a red center. However in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3, The two yellow wings are hollow, the skull is somewhat bigger, and the red center has been somewhat enlarged as well.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, it was given as a last minute gift for defeating the final boss. This Boomerang can have its flight path controlled, and can hit any enemy; usally resulting in a One-Hit-K.O. However, the Doomerang could not be saved after the Final Battle, therefore, it could not be used outside of the level except by playing the HD re-release (PC), or by hacking (consoles). In the game, the Doomerang had the ability to fly upwards in the air, without gravity being a hinder, and if the Doomerang hits any solid surface (such as a wall), or goes too far from the boundaries of the level, it will explode. It played a major role in this game, as it had to be remote controlled to locate Boss Cass, as well as defeat him, in his robot. If the Doomerang hit an obstacle, Ty would be forced to start all over again. In the console version and if the Doomerang was hacked into Ty's inventory, the Doomerang can only hit one enemy once while it is flying as it will phase through other enemies. Given the Doomerang's ability to fly, it can be used to survey\u00a0Rainbow Cliffs or a level whilst Ty stays in one place as the camera will follow the rang.HD re-release  The Doomerang still appears in the Final Battle, however, you can now use it on outside levels, after defeating Boss Cass. It still has all the functions and capabilities as the original.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, This rang had to be purchased from Sly, but it could not be purchased before the Deadlyrang, which is strikingly similar in appearance, but cannot be remote controlled and could only fly in a straight path before detonation. The Doomerang has also been altered in both appearance, as well as ability. The ability to be remote controlled and the explosion have not changed, however, the Doomerang has lost the ability to fly upwards, perhaps due to gravity. As a result, trying to make the Doomerang fly upwards will only result in the Doomerang fly upwards for just a few seconds, then returning to ground level. If launched from a height, the Doomerang will descend towards ground level (To prevent it from touching the ground, the control stick must be held down for a few seconds) and continue from there. However, to make up for the loss of being able to fly, the Doomerang has a new ability: whenever the THROW button is pressed during flight, wherever it may be, the Doomerang would explode immediately, making it useful to take out whatever enemies are in the blast radius (and, to an extent, destroying Cass' Uber Frills). The Doomerang is still perhaps the strongest rang in this game, if the Deadlyrang is set aside.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan  In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3 this rang, like in the prequel, had to be purchased. It has not changed in appearance, but the name of the rang has been changed to the Doom Chassis, and it still retains plenty of its properties from the game's prequel, as well as gaining a new ability. It has four slots, in which it can hold four elemental stones, and when the THROW button is pressed, or if it hits a wall, civilian, or touches the ground, that elemental will activate. For example, if a Fire Stone is inserted in the Doom Chassis, then it will have the properties of the Flamerang from the game's first and second prequels, but the difference is the elemental can be activated at will by pressing THROW in mid-flight, and if two or more Stones are inserted, then it will have the properties of the Lavarang from the game's prequel. However, the Earth Stone, which strengthens a Chassis' power, will give the Chassis its traditional ability to explode back at will, when the THROW button is pressed during mid-flight. It seems the Doomerang is now the second strongest, but setting aside the Shadow Chassis, it is still the strongest and most useful rang if the Earth Stones are inserted into the Chassis. It can still knockout regular Frills and other weaker enemies, as well as severly injure, if not kill, the Uber Frills and other stronger enemies (If the Earth Stone is inserted in the Doom Chassis).Trivia  The Doomerang seems to belong to Ty's father, Bri, and could be his preffered choice of rang. In the opening cutscene of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Bri is seen using his Doomerang to send the Talisman's flying in all directions before he is sucked into the Dreaming. The rang is not taken into the dreaming with the family, but instead stays in the real world. Where, it is possible, Boss Cass picked it up and took it with him, perhaps passing it onto Sly, which could explain how he has it at the end of the boss fight.Ranger Ken  Ranger Ken is a ranger through and through. The only thing he cares about more than the local flora and fauna is ginger beer. Whenever a croc needs tagging, a fire need putting out or a species needs saving from extinction, he`ll be there.Background  Ranger Ken is a male Tasmanian Devil, is a forest ranger, a member of Bush Rescue, and is very devoted to protecting wild life and natural environments.Involvement  Ken is seen in all three games. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger he is met in Walk In the Park and asks Ty to rescue a flock of cave bats from a soon-to-be-flooding cave. He is also seen in Outback Safari in two locations, where he asks Ty to put out house fires started by Frills, and to stop the flow of toxic chemicals into a watering hole. In Beyond the Black Stump he asks Ty to stop some Frills from throwing rocks at cable cars, and has Ty use a snowball shooter to stop Frills starting bushfires. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 he is seen in Burramudgee Town outside the sewer, and has Ty get rid of some crocs inside. He also participates in a helicopter mission to tag some crocs in a river where he has Ty claw the crocodiles with the helicopters while Ranger Ken wrestles them, sprays them, and throws them back in the water. Ranger Ken also appears as a racer in some of the race tracks. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3 he is in New Burramudgee, but is involved in\u00a0only one\u00a0quest. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 4, Ranger Ken is the subject of one of the story missions, having been kidnapped by a robot impersonating Sly.Personality  Ken seems to really appreciate Ty's help and work ethic. He does seem do have a real problem with the frills. His favorite hobby is wrestling crocodiles.Appearance  Ranger Ken is very masculine and strong. He has black fur and some gray blotches on both sides of his arms and a small blotch on his forehead. Ken wears a ripped up beige/tan ranger jacket with a dark green t-shirt tucked into tan cargo shorts and with a red and gray belt. He has a dark red(cranberry) colored nose with yellow eyes. The insides of his ears are also cranberry colored and his accessories include a red wristwatch and gray binoculars. Ranger Ken is fairly tall, bulked up, and his snoop, hands, and feet are colored brown. He has whisker holes but no visible whiskers.Quotes  \"Good onya, mate!\" \"Ty, you're the top bloke!\"Trivia Enemies  This is a list of enemies from Ty the Tasmanian Tiger game series.Sneath  Sneath is one of the only two known \"good lizards.\" He spends his days up to his elbows in grease both as a Bush Rescue mechanic and cook. He worked with the only other good lizard (who's not a frill) Keith who is also a mechanic and cook in which they switch out. In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2, he appears in the outskirts of Burramudgee\u00a0in a desert where he worked and with Keith teaches you pretty much everything you've learned in the first game (in case you might have not played Ty 1). After tasting his food, it`s no wonder he got a promotion... to the rang shop!Trivia  Though Sneath states not all lizards are bad and that not all of them want to work for Boss Cass, he ironically finds himself operating a shop out of Cassopolis in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3. Sneath and Keith were designed to have rhyming names.Protoquin  Protoquins are the most common type of Quinkan. They attack with their tongue.Background  An infantile Quinkan, mere cannon fodder used to protect the Quinking. Be careful though, these Quinkan have powerful arms and a wicked lashing tongue.Involvement  Prior to Ty's return from the Dreaming, the Quinkan attacked Burramudgee, their lines consisting of a few Skyquin, quite a few Zombie Frills, and a total of fifteen Protoquin, some of which can be seen scaling the walls now surrounding the ravaged town. It is possible that the Quinkan's strategy was to bombard the town with the Skyquin's energy ball attacks, with the Protoquin and Zombie Frills acting as a diversion to keep the Skyquin from being attacked by Bush Rescue.Strategy  Simply hit with boomerang. Or fight with bunyip.Trivia  These are seen in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue 100 percent ending. The Protoquin bear a striking\u00a0resemblence to the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts.See also Hermit Crab (Mutated)  The Hermit Crab (Mutated) is a mini-boss that the player must fight the first time the player visits Kakaboom Island. It can no longer live in the shell it outgrew and takes home in one of Boss Cass' Drop-Ships, which caused him to become a mutated giant! In order for Ty to retrieve it, he needs to extract the beast.Background  This creature was a gentle natured animal until it was exposed to the radiation inside of the drop-ship.Involvement  The Hermit Crab (Mutated) serves as a mini boss in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan.Strategy  Hit his eyes with the boomerang when he uses his sonar.See also Bunyips (race)  Bunyips are a ancient race of bird-like creatures which\u00a0live in The Dreamlands. There are three notable Bunyips: their leader, the Bunyip elder\u00a0Nandu Glil, protector of the Bunyip Gauntlet Maliyan, and Thigana\u00a0(who is the only one who can fly). There also exists unnamed Bunyips called Shooter Bunyips, who are the guardians of Bunyip City. Thus far, all Bunyips who have appeared are allies of\u00a0Bush Rescue. The battle mechs are named in honor of the Bunyip race.Trivia ", "Midian City": "Midian City Midian City Helping out  To write a new article, just enter the article title in the box below.Featured article  Midian City Rules\n\nIntroduction Welcome to Midian City.

Born of two decent parents: Anna Lis\u00e9lle And Nicholai Drakov, Though from the beginning since he start, going to school he seemed different, When all the other kids played, he sat in a corner, staring at walls, even his own brother thought him strange.

Once he Arrived at midian city, he inmediately felt right at home.

I find that the quality of RP that I find here is unparalleled elsewhere in Second Life, and in the interest of enjoying future RP with you, the reader, I provide the following notes for your information:My contributions Skin Walkers  Anyone else think the skin walkers are ridiculously overpowered? AxMxK 09:15, 6 March 2009 (UTC) Depends what you mean. Honestly, I have hardly had much interaction with any Skinwalkers. Please keep the discussions constructive. Thanks!! =^.^= ~\u00ae\u00a3Mm\u00a5 03:12, 10 March 2009 (UTC)Contradiction?  In the reproduction section, you mention that natural and afflicted lycanthropes all must share a common ancestry, and this means they must have similar DNA markers \"... the only way to become a skinwalker is to be born one... Though there is an exception, some people are born with an Inactive skinwalker gene, this can be triggered by the bacticria contained in a skinwalkers teeth and claws... The victim of the attack always carried the skinwalker DNA though it was not activated untill the bactiria activated it...\". Yet, you go on in the blood-testing section to say that \"There are four skinwalker forms there are also four skinwalker blood types. The blood taken from one form will not reveal traits from the other. As a skinwalker shift happens on a cellular level. All skinwalker blood has a high iron content. Lets say a human form skin walker lost some blood and this blood was analysed. Would skinwalker DNA show through? Answer in short is no.\", which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, considering what you've already said in the reproduction section. My suggestion in this case would be (as I recognize the need to prevent people from geneticaly identifying lycans for the good of the roleplaying setting), that instead of Lycan's being generated geneticaly, they be more of a supernatural product, which would make them more or less immune to scientific inquiry. However, it is your faction, so I understand if you have reservations about making any changes so late into things... Saul Rozenberg 65.78.164.231 22:15, December 31, 2009 (UTC)", "Pet Society Wiki": "Pet Society Wiki Fishing  Fishing is a mini-game in Pet Society. By playing this mini game you can catch fish, which you can use to decorate your house in an aquarium. Fishing is also neccesary for Quests.\u00a0How to Fish  To start fishing, you need to go to the Pond. Click on Leave House and you will see the the Pond in the lower right side of the Neighborhood area. Simply click it to enter. Every pet automatically begins with a Twig Rod. It cannot be sold, gifted or recycled so you will always have a rod! Once you are in the Pond, the food you currently have in your inventory will be shown. Click on the food you wish to use as bait. If you do not currently have any food, head over to the Food Store to buy some for bait. Once your rod is baited, simply click on your pet to cast. When you receive a bite (you will be able to tell from your pets face changing with the surprise and a couple of splashes near the end of your line), click and hold on your pet to start reeling in. If the fish struggles (which is shown by splashing at the end of your line), let go until it is calm again so that you don\u2019t break your line! You can tell your line is breaking when it starts turning to a shade of red. Once the fish has stopped struggling, click and hold to being reeling in once again. Continue doing this until the line is reeled in! If your line breaks, your food will float away and you will have to try again with a new piece of food. You never know what you could find in that pond, perhaps a Carp or Flounder, or maybe just an Old Boot or Bike Wheel! Just be aware that different baits may give you a better chance of catching that fish you are after, and some fish will only eat certain baits!Fishing Tips & FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)  If you are looking for a new kind of fish, check out the HS or newly released food for sale. Chances are good they will catch a new kind of fish. People in the Playfish Forums are often quick to post results, so you can learn early on if these foods can catch new fish. The Pro Fishing Gear (sold for Playfish Cash) is made of three pieces of clothing that can help you get the fish you want faster. If you have this set, it is very easy to max out all of the common fish, making it very easy to catch the newest fish or bait-specific fish.FAQ  Q: Do I get my bait back? Q: How many of each fish / junk item can I have? Q: What happens when I reach the maximum? Q: How many Paw Points do I get?Types of Bait Displaying Fish  You can store your fish either in your inventory or in your house in Aquariums. If you have too many fish or the tank is too small, some fish may jump out into your room, back into your inventory. Playfish has also released the Coral Reef Wallpaper, which is sold for 20 Playfish Cash. By putting this wallpaper on your room, the room is turned into a large aquarium. There is also a coordinating floor which bubbles for 20 PFC.Glitches/Bugs/Errors  When the fishing was first released, there was a bug that affects all fishing. The bug was that your pet would walk on water. This bug was fixed.Common Fish  Common fish are fish that do not require special baits. They can be caught with any kind of food bait.Decorative / Junk Items  Unlike fish which must be put in an aquarium, Decorative or Junk Items can be placed anywhere in your house. They are also caught with any type of bait.Special Bait Fish  Some fish can only be caught by specific baits - they are listed below.Pro Fish  These fish can only by caught when you wear the Pro Fishing Gear. They are listed below.Specialty Baits  Playfish has released many special biscuit baits which will allow you to catch a specialized set of fish. You will not catch junk or common fish with these special baits. For example, if you fish with the Bakery Fish Bait you will only catch special Bakery Fish. Most of these baits cost Pet Society Cash, but a few are found by digging in Treasure Hunt locations or can be sent to friends through Free Gifts.Bait Currently Available Discontinued Baits  These baits are no longer available.Treasure Hunt  The Treasure Hunt is a mini-game introduced to Pet Society on June 14, 2010. Players can dig for treasure in several locations which are found by going to the Treasure Map link on the Neighborhood Page. \"Treasure\" so far is either decorative objects or clothing for your pet. Each map location will contain rare and common objects unique to that theme.Locations  You can return back to town by clicking on the houses icon on the map.Game Play  To play, click on a location on the Treasure Map. Some locations require special items to get to them. For example, you will need to build a Hot Air Balloon to get to the Enchanted Forest. Once you are at a location, a mini-map will appear for you to dig. Select a square by clicking on it and your pet will dig that spot. Nearby squares will flash with either a green \"?\" or a red \"X\", and a message will appear telling you how close you are to a square with treasure. You can continue digging until you have found four items on the map. If you want to leave early, you can also exit before all four items have been found. Digging requires shovels. A pet gets 5 free shovels a day; additional shovels will cost either 300 coins for a group of five or Playfish Cash for locations that show a blue shovel icon as you mouse over them, for example the Crystal Cave.. There is no limit per day to how many shovels you can buy, except for your money. Many players are going bankrupt digging for treasure! You can also get free shovels from friend's news feeds, so remember to publish so your friends can keep digging.Treasure Map  The current Treasure Map.Shovels  Shovels are a consumable item that your pet needs in order to dig at the Treasure Hunt locations. There are two kinds of shovels: Normal Shovels and Blue Shovels.Normal Shovels  Normal shovels are needed to dig in Ancient Egypt, the Enchanted Forest, the Graveyard, The Moon, the Town Forest, Garden Paradise,Vanilla Choco Pond and the Haunted Swamp . Your pet will get five shovels each day for free automatically. You can buy more with regular coins at the digging site. If you want more their cost is given below: You can also collect free shovels from your friends' news feeds. You can be awarded a group of five or three free shovels for each link. You can post these shovels to your feed when you find the rare item at a treasure site or dig up the weekly treasure in the Town Forest. Also, a package of three shovels could be sent through Free Gifting starting February 10, 2011.Pet Society Cash Shovels  Pet Society Cash shovels, also known as Blue Shovels, or CC shovels, are needed to dig in the Crystal Cave, Deep Ocean, Enchanted Pond, Lost Treasures, Winter Fairyland, Fables,\u00a0Pawitched\u00a0and\u00a0Dark Christmas  locations. Your pet will automatically get five blue shovels each day for free, but to get more you will have to pay Pet Society Cash. If you want more their cost is given below: Blue shovels have another thing special about them. When you dig in a Playfish shovel location and get the message \"Nothing Here\", \"Treasure Nearby\" or \"Treasure Very Close,\" you will be awarded 5 coins. If you dig up a treasure in that spot then you do not get these coins.Past Treasure Maps  For history's sake, here are previous images of the treasure map.Trees  Trees are found in two types in Pet Society -- Neighborhood Trees and Garden Trees. This page is about Garden Trees. For information on Neighborhood trees, see the Neighborhood Trees page.Growing Garden Trees  Garden Trees are grown by buying a tree seed from the Garden Store, planting the seed in your garden, and waiting 72 hours for it to grow to maturity. The type of tree grown from a normal tree seed is random, while limited time tree seeds will produce a special type of tree. Each garden tree produces one kind of homegrown fruit. Every day, fruit has a random chance of appearing on your tree. These fruits will continue to appear slowly over time on your tree until the tree reaches its maximum. The number of fruit allowed on a tree was originally capped at three, was changed to hold up to six in mid 2009, and now is back down to three as of April 2010. Frequent glitches will allow some players to have four fruits on their trees. If you own the Fruit Fairy, you can have up to four as well. Many people ask: \"Why isn't my tree producing fruit?\" The time it takes for a tree to produce fruit is completely random. Some people have trees that produce fruit right away, while some unlucky people do not have fruit until weeks after the tree has matured. There isn't really anything you can do about it except for wait. Garden trees cannot die -- they just may be slower than others in finally giving you fruit. To pick a fruit, just click on the fruit and drag it into your chest. Your tree will continue to produce fruit indefinitely, so long as you keep picking the fruit. Some people have reported that a particular tree will no longer produce fruit once they have an inventory of 99 of that tree's fruit. Important Note: Trees cannot be placed in a pet's chest/inventory. When you pull a tree out of the garden, there will be three options: 1) remove the tree permanently, 2) pay playfish cash to turn the tree into a bonsai, or 3) Undo your action. Once the tree is in bonsai form, it can be placed in your chest and used to decorate a pet's house. When a tree is removed from your garden, you cannot get it back.Other Trees  These trees cannot be bought in the game, but must be acquired through other means.Mystery Boxes  There are many different Mystery Boxes in Pet Society. Most of them are sold in the Mystery Shop while some are sold in the Food Store and the Boutique. For more information on Mystery Eggs, see the Mystery Eggs page.Standard Mystery Boxes  Standard mystery boxes are bought using normal yellow coins.Food Mystery Boxes / Stalls  The Food Store also sells mystery boxes which contain random foods. Included in this category are food stalls. To use a food stall, you must buy this dispenser and place it in a room in your house. Clicking on it will let you buy a random food from the stall set. You can also buy food from food stalls in friends' homes.Expensive Mystery Box  The Expensive Mystery Box (also called the Gold Mystery Box, Yellow Mystery Box or abbreviated as GMB in the Playfish forums and some say it YMB) is the high-range priced Mystery Box found at the Mystery Shop. It contains a random object that may or may not be found in stores. Some objects will be worth more than the cost of the box (either in resale, or when trading in the forums), while others will be worth a lot less. Items in mystery boxes are constantly changing, as Playfish adds and remove objects often once a week. Playfish staff will sometimes give advance warning on what objects they are removing, but not always - this can be a problem for many Pet Society users who are trying to get certain objects. Playfish also will often announce on the blog some of the new items they are adding to the mystery boxes. Since this is the expensive of all mystery boxes, it adds new items every week. See Also: Cheap Mystery Box and Mystery BoxItem Summary List of items currently found inside Gold Mystery Boxes  A running list of items that once were in mystery boxes, but no longer are available in stores or in boxes, can be found at Category:Old Mystery Box Item. There are currently 62 items in the Expensive Mystery Box - below is an incomplete listing. The pictures are arranged as they appear in the Mystery Box Panel. This list was last updated March 31, 2012.History and Use of Mystery Box  New players may find it confusing how to \"use\" this item. After buying the mystery box at the Mystery Shop (or from the Mystery Panel), you will need to go home and open the Mystery Box panel using the box button in the right center of the home screen. Choose the type of box you want to open and click on it. Your random object will then be revealed and the mystery box will disappear from your inventory. You can open lots of boxes quickly this way. Items from mystery boxes, particularly Gold Mystery Boxes (GMBs), are often used as \"currency\" when Trading in the Playfish forum. Mystery boxes are also a good source of 999 items, so named for their resale value in-game. On August 9, 2010, Playfish introduced the Mystery Box panel which shows all Mystery Boxes sold in the game. This also displays what mystery items the player has which are found in the Mystery Box, and how many items there are left to find. This has made it a lot easier for players to keep track of what they can find. On September 9, 2010, Playfish drastically cut the number of items found in all mystery boxes.Town Forest  The Town Forest is a Treasure Hunt location. It was the first location introduced to the game on June 14, 2010. There are ten common items, one rare item, and one puzzle-piece item. Unlike the other locations, the Town Forest also contains a special weekly treasure which changes every Thursday. The items found in the town forest have also changed several times.History Previous Common Treasure Items  The Town Forest digging items from 20 July 2011 until 10 July 2012 were: Limited Puzzle Piece item: Ballerina Green Room Closet [27 feb 2012 - 1 mar 2012] Puzzle Piece Item: Summer Lovers Archway The Town Forest digging items from 3 February 2011 until 20 July 2011 were: The Town Forest digging items from 14 June 2010 until 2 February 2011 were:Tips And Tricks  Tips and Tricks for making money and earning Paw Points!Visit Friends Visit the Neighborhood Stay at Home Use your Cooking Stove Gardening Trade your Unwanted Items Opening Mystery Boxes Petlings  Petlings are small bundles of fluff that players can buy in order to have a pet for their pet. They were introduced to Pet Society in February 2010, and can be purchased at the Outdoor Store. You can only raise one petling (from baby-stage to adulthood) at a time. You can only own 20 petlings at this time.Petling Basics  Once you purchase a petling, it goes into your inventory. At home, you can pull your petling out of your inventory and release it into any room of your house. The first thing you must do is feed your petling. A bubble will appear over their head requesting one of their four foods that they will eat. Drag that food from your chest and drop onto the petling to feed it. A box will come up, asking you to name your new petling; names cannot be changed once they're entered as of this time. Your pet is now a baby. It will make the sad face when hungry. Petlings take three days to grow up, getting slightly larger each day. Once they are completely grown you can then sell your pet. You can feed the petling any food item in your inventory, but only the food the petling is requesting will satisfy it. Petling's are very picky and they can change what they want. It's like people are saying I'm not made out of money. Petlings come in many different colors with a variety of different appendages to make each petling almost unique. Eyes, ears, tails and legs can all vary from petling to petling and are randomly assigned to your petling when you buy it. If you are not satisfied with the appearance of your petling, Petling Biscuits can be fed to your petling to change its color. Each biscuit is colored to correspond to the color your petling would become upon eating. If you hate the appendages/eyes/body shape, then you have two options: 1) feed a Petling Makeover Potion to your pet -- this will give you a new randomly chosen pet shape. 2) Sell your petling and buy a new one. If your petling goes for three days without food, it will run away. Once your petling has run away, you can either pay a coin fee of 200 coins per petling lost to have it retrieved, or post a status update to your Facebook feed to have your friends find it for you. Putting your petling into your inventory does not prevent it from running away.Questions & Answers  Q: Where should I put my pet? Q: How do I feed my petling? Q: My pet came out dark blue / pink / orange / black / brown / green. I hate the color. What can I do? Q: How can I change my pet\u2019s color? Q: What can I do with my petling? Q: Can I have more than one petling?Trivia Pooping  Pets in Pet Society can create Poo. These poos are purely decorative, and are a common 99 project for many people. Below is information on how to Poo, as well as a guide of all poos. Important Poo Warning: Is very easy to get rid of a poo by mistake. Always open your chest before moving them. If you just click on the poo you will get coins for it and lose the poo, and you don't want to lose a golden poo or rainbow poo like that.How to Poo  One of the most frequently asked questions in Pet Society is how to make a pet Poo. To make a pet poo in Pet Society, there are a few conditions that have to be met: For the most part you cannot force a pet to poop on command, however there is one exception. During the Wizard School Winter Ball week they started selling the Wizard Joke Shop Stall in the Boutique \u2013 (Featured) or Market \u2013 (Toys & Collectables). One of the 5 potions you can randomly get by purchasing jokes once you own the Joke Shop Window is the U Poo Potion which makes you pet automatically poo when they drink it. You can get any random poo but pets usually get the specialty poo more often than standard poo and in rare cases they can even get Golden Poo. If you do not have the Joke Shop Window and you are trying to get your pet to poo you will want to make your pet walk from time to time so he/she doesn't fall sleep on the floor, since a sleeping pet will not poo. If your pet is dirty and walking around, eventually he or she will make a face and rub their arms around their head. After shaking, a poo will appear on the ground. Some pets will poo several times right away, while others will not poo for hours or days! Getting your pet to poo can be very time consuming. Sometimes your pet will make the poo-producing face and waggle their arms around, but no poo will appear. This possibly means that your pet would have pooed, but because you have the limit on that kind of poo, nothing came out!Tips: Poo Sizes  Image of poos and their relative sizes to each other.Poo Limits  There are two kinds of limits to the number of poos you can have in Pet Society. The 'first' limit is how many poos you can have in your inventory. You can have: If you are at the maxiumum and someone gifts you another poo, it will automatically be sold. The second (and more important) limit to poos is how many your pet will actually poop out. As long as you have less than three poos of a specific type in your inventory (this includes your house), your pet will continue to produce that kind of poo. This is for each poo type individually. Having a total of three poos of mixed types will not prevent your pet from pooing. For example, say you have three Sparkly Pink Poos in your inventory, one regular Poo, and one Golden Poo. Your pet will stop pooing Sparkly Pink Poos, but will continue to poo Golden Poos and regular Poos until you have three of each. If you want to have another Sparkly Pink Poo, you must get rid of one of your poos (either sell, recycle, or trade it). Your pet will then resume pooping the Sparkly Pink Poo until you have a total of three or more Sparkly Pink Poos in your inventory. You can achieve a 99 collection of a poo only by having someone hold on to most of your poo and then gift them back to you.Winter Fairyland  Winter Fairyland is a Treasure Hunt location introduced on December 2, 2010. There are no requirements to unlock this location. You can dig up ten common items, one rare item, and one puzzle-piece item. This site uses Blue Shovels which require Playfish Cash.

New items are being added every few weeks or so. If you get the delicious pie, it means you lose. You will get an animation of a pie hitting your screen for each box you open where you lose. Your pet will also get hit in the face with a pie.Item Summary Current Win or Lose Box Items  Here are the items you could get from the box. There are currently 16 items in the box. This list was last updated September 24, 2011.Removed Win or Lose Items  These items are no longer in the Win or Lose Box.Trivia Mystery Shop  The Mystery Shop is a store which sells \"mysterious items,\" including:Owner  The owner of the Mystery Shop is \"?\". No one knows his name, so he is referred to either as the Mystery Shopkeeper, or simply \"?\". The story of how this store and the owner appeared, according to the Pet Society blog, is below:History  The Mystery Shop was introduced to Pet Society on March 16, 2009. Previously, Mystery Boxes were located in what is now the Furniture Store, and Mystery Egg machines did not yet exist. This shop has gone through several transformations as Playfish has changed the graphics of the game. Versions of the Mystery Store are seen below.Mystery Shop Items  The shop is divided into two sections: Mystery Boxes & Eggs, and Glow in the Dark. Newly arrived items will appear in the Mystery Boxes & Eggs section for a week, and then will be moved to their respective categories. To view items that are no longer in the Mystery Store, see Category:Old Mystery Store Items.Glow in the Dark Items  Note -- the Mystery Shop does not sell every Glow in the Dark item in the game - many are sold in other shops or are available through random boxes or eggs. See Glow in the Dark Items for a listing of all these items.Deep Ocean  The Deep Ocean is a Treasure Hunt location. It was the fourth location added, and was introduced on August 6, 2010. This location is unusual from previous locations because it was the first that required Blue Shovels to dig. Every player gets 5 free shovels a day which will expire if not used that day. Additional shovels cost Playfish Cash (CC): 3 shovels for 1 CC, 25 for 7 CC, or 50 for 12 CC. Note that if you bought Blue Shovels and have some left in your inventory, you will not get the 5 free shovels that day. You have to use up all shovels in order to get free shovels. This may be an oversight on Playfish's part, but so far it hasn't been corrected. There are ten common items, one rare item, and one puzzle-piece item.Items Puzzle Piece Item: Sealife Aquarium  There are seven pieces to complete the set.Enchanted Pond  The Enchanted Pond is a Treasure Hunt location introduced on 7 April 2011. This location is available to any level and does not need to be unlocked. There are ten common items, one rare item, and one puzzle piece item, the Enchanted Pond Mystical Book.

He can be found in your house, in friends' houses, in the neighborhood or in shops. When you click on him, you have \"found\" him. Hideeni was introduced to Pet Society in October 2009. If you or your neighbors have a Hideeni Magnet,he'll always be around in the room it's in. The Hideeni Magnet is described as a black cat with blue eyes sitting a pink bow at the back of it's neck. There are hearts floating over it's head. You can collect gifts from Hideeni from your Facebook news feed. These gifts cannot be gifted by standard gifting (sending it to a friend through your chest), but they can be recycled and sold. These items are best kept as either decoration or as a collection.Finding Hideeni  Hideeni is found all over the game! You can find him in the following places: After being found, Hideeni asks if you would like to give a gift to your friends. If you accept, Pet Society will post on your wall in Facebook. The posting of the gift is displayed in your news feed where your friends can see it and click the link to claim the gift. Be quick to find the post, as the gifts are exclusive to the first 3-5 people who click on the feed. Note that even though you found Hideeni, you cannot get the special gift yourself -- you can only receive gifts from other friends' news feeds. Be generous and click post! Sometimes you will have difficulty getting that last item in the collection Hideeni is giving out, or you just don't have enough friends posting gift links. For cases like this, you can buy the CC Hideeni Cake Bribe, a cake that you can feed to Hideeni. After eating the cake, Hideeni will directly give you one of his items as a gift. Hideeni also appears when the Shops\u00a0are loading.Hideeni Costumes  If you love Hideeni's outfits, you can buy copies of each of his past costumes by buying Hideeni's Costume Mystery Boxes in the Mystery Shop.Hideeni Trivia  Hideeni has a number of unique characteristics that separate him from the other neighborhood characters.Eco Prize  Eco Prizes are earned by cashing in Recycle Points. There are three kinds of Eco Prize boxes: Large, Medium and Small. Each box type contains one of five possible items, and this item is randomly chosen. Eco boxes cannot be sold or recycled, but they can be gifted. Once you open an eco box, the item inside will be worth half the number of recycle points it cost. For example, if you open a Large Eco Prize which cost 30,000 points, you will recieve an item worth 15,000 recycle points. Examples of Eco Prizes include:Graveyard  The Graveyard is a Halloween-themed Treasure Hunt location that was only available to fans of Pet Society for a limited time.

As you gain more paw points you will level up, and new features and items will become available. You will recieve upgrades to your Ball, Brush, Frisbee, Jump Rope, TV and Soap. Your house also becomes bigger with new rooms. Paw points can be achieved by visiting friends, buying items, and running in the stadium, among many other things. This link shows you how to earn experience. The maximum level that can be reached is Level 100. WARNING: As you level up, your athletic items such as the ball, frisbee and jump rope will become faster and harder to playHistory  When Pet Society was first introduced, the highest level you could reach was 34. When visiting friends, you could see how may paw points each of them had earned along with their level. Playfish then updated the level cap to 47, along with increasing the maximum number of rooms in your house to 10 total. With the update of 5th of March 2010, players no longer could see a friend's paw points when visiting. However, if when visiting your friend you access their diary you can see his paw points as well as other information. You can still see their level, and your friends list will still be in order of highest to lowest paw points. In August 2010 the level cap was increased from 47 to level 100, along with a restructuring of the house diagram and the addition of two more rooms you could earn.Levels & Upgrades  Here are a list of upgrades:", "Animal City Wiki": "Animal City Wiki Mosin-Nagant  Mosin Nagant \"Sniper \"Gunporn-dan-wesson-ppc.jpg Licensing  Template:None selectedAnimal City Online Playable Characters The Minute Men Versus Free for All Team Deathmatch Hostage Boss Battle Siege Cops & Robbers Base Bomb Squad Survival Slayers S.W.A.T.

Components also drop on creatures that also drop Pristine Mana Shards on Dark Isle, Freebooter Isle, Moarsman City, and in Graveyard. For a period of time it was possible to guess the contents of a chest given the chest's burden (e.g., 3 quills 2 inks). In the Celebration event the loot profiles were changed and this is no longer possible because the magic component chests always spawn 2 items that are not components and which have random burdens.Component Exchanger  During the Secrets of the Apostates event a Component Exchanger was added to each Mana Forge. Similar in operation to the Rare Exchanger, the Component Exchanger will give a random spell component when given 1 MMD and any VIII spell component. The odds are the same for all components which causes glyphs to be the most common, inks less common, and quills quite rare.Level VIII Scroll Creation  During the Ancient Powers event, a new crafting system for level VIII spell scroll creation was introduced. Some of these spells were previously available on a small number of quest items, however many are brand new. The components (quills, inks, and glyphs) can be obtained in the highest tier treasure profiles which appears in special chests and on creatures that also drop Pristine Mana Shards on Dark Isle, Freebooter Isle, Moarsman City, and in Graveyard.. Quills may be combined with the Mana Scarabs (which are also the casting scarab for level 8 spells and can be purchased from certain vendors) in order to craft infused quills. Infused quills may be crafted with inks to create a combination of the two. This combination may then be crafted with a glyph to create a level 8 scroll. All components involved in making a scroll (quill, mana scarab, ink, and glyph) are consumed in the process of successfully making a scroll. All components may also be traded or sold to a vendor, and the scrolls may likewise be traded or sold to a vendor. If crafting something you expected to work fails, very likely the spell simply does not exist for level 8. You will not lose components upon failed crafting, and there is no skill associated with level 8 spell crafting, so feel free to experiment safely with the various components and see what you may accomplish! Steps in creating a level VIII Scroll: This produces a tradable scroll which you can then learn as normal. Level 8 spells last for 90 minutes, or up to three hours with Augmentations.Scroll Components  In the Secrets of the Apostates event a new NPC was added to each Mana Forge, the Component Exchanger. The exchanger will take 1 MMD and any spell component and give a random one in return. There is an equal chance for all components which makes glyphs the most common, inks less common, and quills (at 4) very rare. In contrast the chests appear to factor in the number of scrolls the item is used by, so infliction quills are very common. Quills Inks War Spells (Can only be used with Infliction Quills):Casting Difficulty  When first introduced level VIII spells had a difficulty to cast of 455. In Risks and Rewards the difficulty was lowered to 400, meaning that 400 buffed magic skill will cast successfully 50% of the time. Here are some examples of casting success for a range of buffed values:Known Formulas  Currently it is impossible to craft Creature Other Buffs, Life Other Buffs, Imperil, Self Debuffs (Link). Life vulns were added during Seeds of Corruption. Defender and Blood Drinker Incantations have the same effect as the level 7 versions, but have 30 minute longer durations.Aetheria  Related topics: Aetheria Teaser, Aetheria Quest, Equipment, RatingOverview  Aetheria are equippable items that provide a primary set bonus, enhancing a variety of things, and secondary \"surge\" ability, that at random times, dramatically improves the wielder or penalizes the opponent for a short duration. Unlike other magical items in the game, Aetheria's power is based upon a \"level\" system where the Aetheria starts at level 0 and levels up to a maximum level indicated by the icon. The higher the level, the more powerful the enhancement.\n Aetheria is found on monsters and in chests as Coalesced Aetheria, which must be \"revealed\" first before being equipped by using an Aetheria Mana Stone from the Aetheria Quest.\n When a character is created, initially he or she cannot wield any Aetheria. See the Aetheria Quest for details for opening the slots.Lore & Background  By researching the ancient writings of Empyrean magic, the Archmages of the Arcanum have unlocked the secrets of a new kind of magic that the Empyreans called Aetheria. In ancient times, powerful Empyrean mages learned to infuse Aetheria in Dereth with pure mana to empower it. By infusing this Aetheria with pure mana stored in enchanted gemstones, they could coerce Aetheria to crystallize into patterns that the ancient mages called sigils. These sigils could be manipulated to increase personal power. The Empyreans found that it was the nature of Aetheria to grow in power as it was used. The more you used these Aetheria sigils, the more powerful they became. Long ago the ability to recognize and manipulate Aetheria was lost. Although this magical energy wells freely from the menhir mana fields into Dereth, these potent magical energies have in recent times remained undetected as they flowed throughout the lands. That is about to change. With the help of explorers, adventurers and mercenaries the Arcanum has drawn this Aetheric magic from the Menhir mana fields into specially prepared mana stones enchanted to hold Aetheric power. The Arcanum have traveled from the corners of Dereth to perform a complicated ritual. Calling forth ancient magics, the circle of mages were surrounded by hundreds of glowing gemstones infused with the Aetheric power of the menhir mana fields. The mages have enacted a ritual to reveal the Aetheria that flows out of the mana fields and rains down upon Dereth. Once hidden from untrained eyes, the power of the Arcanum has caused this Aetheric magic to be revealed. The Aetheria appears as three distinct colors, as it once appeared to the mystic sight of ancient Empyreans. Now that the Aetheria that flows from the mana fields has color and has coalesced into form, it can be found on all manner of creatures that inhabit Dereth. More importantly, the Arcanum has agreed to teach those it deems worthy to empower this Coalesced Aetheria so it once again forms into the ancient sigils of power and can be wielded by those who have learned its secrets.Revealing and Equipping Aetheria  Note: You must first complete the Aetheria Quest in order to wield or reveal Aetheria. Initially, Aetheria is found as Coalesced Aetheria in one of three colors: Blue, Yellow, or Red. Before it can be wielded, the sigils must be revealed using the Aetheria Mana Stone. Once revealed, it may be equipped into the corresponding slot, i.e. blue Aetheria into the blue slot; thus in order to wield three, you must have one of each color. Note that the color of the Aetheria also dictates the minimum level to use them:Leveling Aetheria  When first revealed, Aetheria is level 0, offering no benefit to the wielder. In order for it to be useful, it must reach at least level 1, where it provides a set bonus and surge capabilities. Aetheria are leveled by wielding it and earning experience through quest rewards or hunting, but receive no XP from vassal passup, fellowship XP, nor additional XP from trinkets imbued with Augmented Understanding. It is unknown whether the Quick Learner (+5% XP hunting XP) Augmentation provides any benefit. Aetheria can be leveled very quickly using Stipends. Each Aetheria has an inherent maximum level beyond which it cannot be leveled further; this is indicated by the small number in the upper-right corner of the icon image. \n Additionally, when assessed, the level and XP of the Aetheria can be found. The current and maximum level are found on the line reading \"Item Level: X/Y\". The first number (X) is the current level of the Aetheria, and the second number (Y) is the maximum level. The total and next level XP of the Aetheria are found on the line reading \"Item XP: X/Y\". The first number (X) indicates the total XP the Aetheria has so far, and the second number (Y) represents the XP required for the next level, i.e. not the total amount to fully level it from 0 to its maximum level. \n Blue aetheria, which are equippable at level 75, start with an initial 750,000,000 XP. This was done so that getting an initial bonus from them at a lower level is easier. The XP earned by Aetheria is in addition to whatever is earned normally and not divided among Aetheria. For example, if you earned one million XP from a quest, then you would receive one million XP to distribute (as normal), and every equipped Aetheria would additionally earn one million XP each. In general, an Aetheria of level N requires 2^N-1 billion XP to fully level it (750 million XP less if it is blue since it starts with that.) When an Aetheria levels, you will see an animation indicating leveling up (but in a different color,) and receive a green text message with the new level of your Aetheria\u00a0:Aetheria Powder  Characters can also utilize an Aetheria Desiccant to destroy any Aetheria they do not wish to keep and turn it into Aetheria Powder, which may be redeemed for a reward. The blue and yellow Aetheria turn into Aetheria Powder, while the Red Aetheria turn into Aetheria Powder (Red). The maximum level of the Aetheria has no effect on the result. The Aetheria Powders stack, while the Coalesced Aetheria do not, making this useful to carry many powders with limited pack space. The Aetheria Desiccant itself may be purchased from Janier al-Evv in Xarabydun. Due to its low cost (1,250 pyreals), zero burden, and high stack size (1000), it is optimal to carry many at a time rather than buying a few and making frequent trips to Xarabydun purchase more. You use the desiccant on the aetheria to create an Aetheria Powder.Aetheria Sets  Every Aetheria is one of five sets. Each set has a different symbol on the aetheria icon, making them easy to distinguish. Which set an Aetheria belongs to is randomly determined when the Aetheria is revealed using the Aetheria Mana Stone. Like other sets, wielding many items of the same set gives an increased set bonus. The set bonus depends on the sum of current level(s) of the equipped Aetheria in the same set. All Aetheria sets follow a pattern of diminishing returns, meaning as the set level increases the benefits diminish. Depending on need, it can be beneficial to combine Aetheria which are all the same set (maximize the benefits of a single set) or combine Aetheria of different sets (maximize the total set bonus level across multiple sets).Aetheria Surges  Any Aetheria that is level 1 or greater grants your character a Cast on Strike property called a \"surge\". These surges activate based on a single offensive attack, meaning multi-target spells and the cleaving property of two-handed weapons does not equate to an increased chance of Surging (nor will you surge on multiple targets). It is unconfirmed, but believed, that the act of being hit or attacked increases the chances of a surge triggering. The act of attacking causes the surge to activate, so it is not required that the attack successfully strikes the target. Like normal buffs/debuffs, having a surge trigger before the previous one has expired merely surpasses it (i.e. extends the duration) and does not stack. However, equipping multiple Aetheria with the same surge property improves the chance that a surge will activate, likely by a straight linear factor (i.e. 2 means twice as often, 3 means three times as often). An active Surge appears as both a spell in effect and by a ring of symbols circling your character (green symbols) or your opponent (red symbols). See the image section for screenshot examples. Surges are considered short-term buffs, and can be dispelled by monsters. Aetheria must be revealed and ID'd to view what surge they have on them. Like the Aetheria set, the surge on an Aetheria is randomly determined when the Aetheria is revealed using the Aetheria Mana Stone. There are 5 possible surges: Surge of Destruction\u00a0: Your Damage Rating is increased by 20 for 10 seconds. This provides an additional 20% damage bonus and has devastating implications in Player versus Player combat. Surge of Protection\u00a0: Your Damage Reduction Rating is increased by 20 for 10 seconds. This effect is most noticeable (and useful) when War Magic spells hit the player, due the large damage base damage. Weaker physical attacks may have a reduction in damage of just a few points. Surge of Regeneration\u00a0: You begin to regenerate at an increased rate. You gain 150 points of health over 19 seconds in increments of 30 every 3.8 seconds. These Surges are not considered healing effects per the Sigil of Growth (i.e. no bonus is received). Surge of Affliction\u00a0: The target loses 150 points of health over 19 seconds. This is considered a drain attack and attack spell debuff (for purposes of some monsters who then start vulning you in return). Surge of Festering\u00a0: Your opponent is cursed so all healing effects are reduced by a Healing Reduction Rating of 20. For the next 20 seconds any healing effect from spell, potion, food, or kit is reduced. This is probably the weakest of the effects. It is also considered an attack debuff. The probability of a surge activating is affected by the number of Aetheria equipped with the same surge, the level of the equipped Aetheria, and the number of Aetheric Vision luminance auras the player has. Nalicana offers a luminance aura which increases the amount surges activate. This aura can be received 5 times.Combinations  Due to the random combination of set and surge that come with each revealed Aetheria, there is a large variety of Aetheria combinations which can be equipped. Choosing what to equip is entirely personal preference, however it is common for many players to utilize \"offensive\" type Aetheria (destruction/fury set, destruction/affliction/fester surge) and \"defensive\" type Aetheria (defense/growth/vigor set, regeneration/protection surge). See the Aetheria talk page for further discussion and examples of specific Aetheria combinations.Images Level 8 Set Bonus Loot  Loot is items dropped by creatures and contained in chests. Most loot in Asheron's Call is generated using loot tables. There are tables for all the possible items and for all the stats (also known as mutations). The tables are organised into loot tiers with more powerful stats available at the higher tiers. Some types of item are found in all tiers while some do do not appear until the higher levels. For example, chainmail armor is available from tier 1 up to tier 8 but lorica armor does not appear in loot at all until tier 5. In addition to the loot tier, some creatures and chests are also \"luckier\" and have an increased chance to generate items with better cantrips, ratings and stats.. Currently, this includes: For more information about loot tables how items are selected from them, see the official article Treasure in Asheron's Call.Spells and Ratings  For spells by item type, see Loot/Spell DistributionWeapons  Note on variances: Some Two Handed Spears in low loot tiers can spawn with 75% variance, which is wider than in the variance tables. It is unknown at this time if this is a bug or intentional, and if it replaces a value on this chart or extends its size. This chart is valid for two-handed weapons in higher loot tiers. Every one hand wield type spawns with one of five possible variances. Two Handed weapons drop with six possible variances apiece. These potential variances hold steady across wields and loot tiers.Trophies  See also: Creatures Trophies are also sometimes dropped by creatures and chests along with tier loot items. Example: Platinum Golems can drop up to four different trophy items in addition to loot from tier 6. These items do not generate with mutating stats and are always the same.Rares  Main article: Rares Introduced in the Throne of Destiny expansion, rares are powerful items that can drop on a defeated creature greater in level than the player character who killed it, or on any creature over level 100. There are six tiers of rares ranging from the most common tier 1 rares, which consist of volatile skill buff gems, to the least common tier 6 rares consisting of weapons for each class. Rare armor and weapons can also be levelled up to cast more powerful spells on the wielder. Consumable type items in tier 5 are eternal/infinite and have an unlimited number of uses. For every 1 weapon (Tier 6) that drops the following should drop (in the long run).Archives External Links References Mana Forge  Related topics: Loot, Chests Introduced during the Ancient Powers event, Mana Forges are one of the locations where you can get large amounts of tier 7 loot with \"Luck\" (higher quality items from that tier). The chests vary in the probability of what they will contain. All chests can produce any item, but a weapon chest will contain mostly weapons most of the time, research/mage chests will contain mostly VIII spell components, armor will contain mostly armor, and the equipment chests will contain a mix of mostly armor and weapons. Advanced chests will contain more jewelry and clothing items. Keys can be obtained by hunting Shattered Mana Forge Keys and repairing them using Lockpick skill or as a reward from a number of different quests and tasks (see below). Each Mana Forge also has an Arcanum Quota Officer who gives a single use key in exchange for 10 Pristine Mana Shards (up to five times per week, 150+) and an Arcanum Mana-smith who gives a key for 25 Pristine Mana Shards for those below 150 in level. There is also an Arcanum Broker at each forge who will buy unwanted loot from the chests and a Garbage Barrel for junk loot. The pristine shards were originally available as Trophies from creatures that drop tier 7 loot, but they were removed from creature drops in the Balance of Power event.Locations NPCs Keys  Shattered Mana Forge Key Mana Forge Key Braced Mana Forge Key Strengthened Mana Forge Key Fortified Mana Forge Key Reinforced Mana Forge KeyHow to Obtain Keys Videos Kill Tasks Shedding Skin  Related topics: Big Spring Patch Preview, Big Spring Patch Announcements April 2010 - Announcements Page Patch Size: 4,524k (Client: 1,666k)Game Changes User Interface Updates New Quests Updated Quests New NPCs New Locations New Items  Coordination of Marriage Endurance of Marriage Focus of Marriage Quickness of Marriage Self of Marriage Strength of Marriage  Attuned Essence Gem Vile Potion Aligned Mana Stone Aetheria Mana Stone Coalesced Aetheria (Blue) Coalesced Aetheria (Yellow) Coalesced Aetheria (Red) Aetheria (Blue) Aetheria (Yellow) Aetheria (Red) Aetheria Desiccant Aetheria Powder (Yellow)  Tailoring Kit Armor Reduction Tool Writ Armor Reduction Tool Armor Layering Tool (Bottom) Armor Layering Tool (Top)  Shield of Borelean's Royal GuardUpdated Items  Death's Grip Staff Morrigan's Vanity Smite Assassin's Whisper Dread Marauder Shield Wings of Rakhil Guardian of Pwyll Imperial Chevaird's Helm Mirrored Justice Tracker Boots Gelidite Pauldrons Valkeer's Helm Skullpuncher Feathered Razor Zefir's Breath Ebonwood Shortbow Corsair's Arc Moriharu's Kitchen Knife Dreamseer Bangle Ibriya's Choice Pillar of Fearlessness Staff of Fettered Souls Star of Gharu'n Staff of Tendrils Champion's Demise Canfield Cleaver Bearded Axe of Souia-Vey Thunderhead Deru Limb Orb of the Ironsea Drifter's Atlatl Ridgeback Dagger Helm of Leikotha's Tears Gelidite Gauntlets Gauntlets of Leikotha's Tears Gelidite Bracers Gelidite Breastplate Bracers of Leikotha's Tears Breastplate of Leikotha's Tears Gelidite Girth Girth of Leikotha's Tears Tassets of Leikotha's Tears  Greaves of Leikotha's Tears Pauldrons of Leikotha's Tears Twin Ward Swift Strike Ring Wand of the Frore Crystal Count Renari's Equalizer Brador's Frozen Eye Black Thistle Shield of Engorgement Defiler of Milantos Loop of Opposing Benedictions Eye of Muramm Adept's Fervor Love's Favor Ring of Channeling Patriarch's Twilight Coat Fist of Three Principles Serpent's Flight Necklace of Iniquity Tusked Axe of Ayan Baqur Gelidite Tassets Gelidite Greaves Weeping Ring Aristocrat's Bracelet Royal Ladle Hevelio's Half-Moon Iron Bull Spirit Shifting Staff Star of Tukal Dripping Death Pitfighter's Edge Steel Butterfly Staff of All Aspects Desert Wyrm Bloodmark Crossbow Zharalim Crookblade Baton of Tirethas Subjugator Squire's Glaive Tri-Blade Spear Malachite Slasher Hooded Serpent SlingerNew Creatures  Gear Knight Wisp UndeadNew Dialog  Town Crier Free Rumors Pyreal Rumors Ulgrim the Unpleasant Free Rumors Stout RumorsRelated Articles Augmentation Gems Tusker Tusks Leveling Guides Patches  Official Patch Announcements.

The goal is to defeat the creatures in all 18 rooms and use the final exit before the 1 hour timer is up. The concept is simple; when you clear a room, the door to the next room appears on the North wall. Being successful in the Colosseum is all about teamwork; everyone has different roles, and must play their role well to succeed. To begin your Colosseum run, you must have a Colosseum Ticket, which can be purchased from the Colosseum Ticket Vendor for 5 MMDs or any Rare. There are two entrances to the Colosseum Arena, and while both access the same set of rooms, the Advanced Colosseum Arena will start you further along:Colosseum Run Goals Beating the Colosseum  Beating the Colosseum is rewarded with a Colosseum Vault Key which is used to open the Colosseum Vault containing Tier 7 loot and one of five Empyrean Rings. There are walkthroughs and guides on how to beat the Colosseum in the Advanced Colosseum Arena section.Colosseum Bosses  Quest guide: Colosseum Bosses The colosseum contains several bosses, which are in effect a 1-room arena that contains a spawn of monsters and one of the Boss Creatures. Each boss is accessed by using their respective statues that are located along the hallways of the lobby. In order to access these boss arenas, you must be flagged. Flagging consists of completing a certain arena in the Colosseum Arena or Advanced Colosseum Arena. As the difficulty of the boss increases, higher arenas must be completed to allow access: Note: The Advanced Colosseum Arena begins at Arena 6.Easter Egg Bosses  In addition to regular Colosseum Bosses, there are also Easter Egg Bosses, which are located behind the Locked Door at the end of the Southeast hall. To access the statues behind the Locked Door, hand an Egg to the Master Arbitrator:Images  Click image for full size.Update History  From Darkness, LightNotes  LandblocksAetheria Quest  Related topics: AetheriaOverview  This is the quest to open your Aetheria slots for the first time.Walkthrough & Notes Images  Click image for full size version.Item Sets  Related topics: Armor Item Sets refer to items that when equipped at the same time cast additional bonus spells that are not listed on or cast by any individual item of the set. Set bonuses are based on the number of pieces of the set that are currently equipped, not specific item combinations. Some set bonuses will only activate when all pieces are equipped, others will have different bonuses depending on the number of pieces currently wielded \n\nIn the 100th patch non-quest item sets were added. In addition, all items that are part of a set (quest or loot) will display what set they belong to in the first line of the examination panel. In the Shedding Skin patch item sets were added to Rare armor and weapons.Loot Sets  Loot generated Item Sets were first introduced in the Ancient Powers event as part of the new loot tier. In addition to spells, some armor contains an attribute set. The basic concept of attribute sets is simple; the more pieces of armor from a certain set you wear, the larger the bonus it provides.Cloak Sets Skill Redistribution Slayer  The Slayer special property will increase the damage dealt to a specific creature type. In general this is more useful to mages, especially when it is a quest weapon with stats inferior to tinkered loot weapons. (By using the quest weapon, a melee/archer is usually giving up the chance to use armor rend or critical strike and so gains little, whereas the mage gets essentially a double vuln). If you are looking for all items that have a particular slayer property, see here.Notes Olthoi Pincers ", "Divinity Wiki": "Divinity Wiki Armor set  Armor set are made up of separate pieces of armor, jewelry, and weapons with the same names. The more pieces of a set are being worn, the higher the added bonuses.List of armor sets  Additionally the Sets for the Dragon Knight Saga (DKS) Version, have been added at the end. These are: Aleroth City The following sets are specials for Steam and the North American Xbox versions: These are rough maps on where to find the set pieces, they are not yet complete but shall be soon. Please be aware that these maps do not show the Z-angle, and there might be several levels of platforms you will have to search, but stick close to these maps and you shouldn't have a trouble finding them. They are all in chests so another tip is just to fly around the Flying Fortresses and look for chests. Additionally, if you miss a piece some vendors will sell them, and some enemies will drop them. For example, in High Hall the Hunter Bow can be purchased after taking care of their problem. Also the Scorpion Cuirass can be purchased from the dragon worshipers at Dragon Cliff Castle in the Orobas Fjords. It would seem that since the loot is random, different armor pieces may appear in marked locations for a different set (for example an Archmage piece has appeared in a Hunter piece marked box). Make sure to save prior to being in sight range with the box so that the game can be reloaded for another random chance at obtaining the correct piece.Addendum [Divinity 2: Dragon Knight Saga players only]  After a little head scratching; the post here (Larian Studios Forum) details that the armor set locations for the Scorpion, Aleroth Archmage and Hunter are in different locations if you have the DKS version. You\u2019ll find them in the following locations:Hunter Scorpion Aleroth Archmage Scorpion set Helmet  Head straight northeast from the cuirass location until you reach the edge of the slightly lower platform, the helmet is in the chest by some crates and a wooden cart by the edge.Bracelet  In the upper half of the map that looks like a large island surrounded by six slightly smaller ones, the bracelets are located on the southside of the southwestern smaller island.Ulthring's Set  You get a piece of equipment from each flying fortress in Orobas Fjords (except Keara's). You have to mindread the following people before killing them to obtain their piece of the set: Note: In DKS the Ulthring's set stats are different, for example: Cuirass: +13 Melee Armor, +5 Ranged Armor, +9 Magic Armor, +7 Spirit, +1 Regeneration and 3 slots.

It is the third installment of the Divine Divinity series. The game takes place in a magical world called Rivellon, populated by both intelligent races like humans and other less intelligent creatures such as goblins. The otherwise beautiful countryside bears witness to the ruins and pocketed landscapes of ancient wars and cataclysms. In Rivellon, the player, a Dragon Slayer, begins their quest to complete the initiation rituals to become a true member of the Dragon Slayers. The defining feature of\u00a0Divinity II\u00a0is the ability to switch between aerial combat as a dragon and more traditional third-person action, role-playing gameplay as a human. It is the third game in the\u00a0Divinity\u00a0franchise and the first\u00a0Divinity game to be released on consoles as well as for\u00a0Windows.Gameplay  The main focus of the game is on traditional action-role playing gameplay, which includes completing quests, exploring the game world, and interacting with a variety of\u00a0non-player characters.\u00a0Divinity II\u00a0utilizes some elements of games like\u00a0Diablo\u00a0and\u00a0World of Warcraft, such as a focus on upgrading equipment, randomized magical effects on equipment, unique item sets that offer greater benefits when used together, and some\u00a0quest mechanics\u00a0such as markers to show that\u00a0an NPC\u00a0will offer a quest to the player. However, it also uses elements from more traditional\u00a0computer role playing games, such as branching conversation trees, choices which affect other events in the game, and non-combat segments, such as platforming or puzzle elements. When interacting with non-player characters, the player will often have the option to read their minds, which can provide information,\u00a0extra choices\u00a0in a quest, or equipment, at a certain cost to their experience points. The 'experience debt' then has to be repaid before they can gain experience again. Players are given a choice of starting packages for their character during the tutorial, but progression is freeform, and the player is free to develop their character in a different direction if they want to. Skills are grouped into 'schools' which correspond to traditional roles, but all skills are available to all characters, allowing mixing between these roles. Multiple forms of crafting exist: alchemy, which allows the player to create potions; necromancy, which allows a player to customize a summonable undead pet; and enchanting, which upgrades the character's equipment. After a certain point in the game, the character gains a base of operations known as the Battle Tower, as well as the ability to become a dragon in large spaces.\u00a0Dragon combat\u00a0works similarly to ground-based combat, but in three dimensions; as a dragon, the character still has a regular attack as well as skills they can use, and equipment to improve their abilities.Plot  The game takes place in the world of Rivellon from\u00a0Divine Divinity, although much time has passed since the end of\u00a0Divine Divinity. The player character starts out as\u00a0a Dragon Slayer\u00a0at the end of their training, when they are given draconic powers as a way to help fight the last remaining dragons. These powers also erase their memories of their training, but they are reassured that their memories will return quickly. The regular proceedings are interrupted by news of a dragon sighted nearby, so before the initiation is finished, the player character is rushed off with them to where the dragon was last seen. In the expansion,\u00a0Flames of Vengeance, the Dragon Knight wakes in a crystal prison on the plane of Hypnoteromachia, where Lucian, the Divine, the adoptive father of Damian and messiah figure to Rivellon, is also imprisoned. A ghost called Behrilin\u00a0comes and offers to free the Divine if the Dragon Knight will help to free him from his earthly prison.Development  Development on\u00a0Divinity II\u00a0began around 2006, after\u00a0Larian Studios\u00a0had acquired enough money to begin development on a\u00a0Divinity\u00a0sequel in earnest. From the beginning, the game was planned with the feature of transforming into a dragon in mind, and even included a third form, halfway between the dragon and human forms, which would have served as a powerful form for fighting on the ground. However, it was not implemented in the final game, though the model was reused for enemies in the game. The original concepts included more areas, based on the original map of Rivellon in\u00a0Divine Divinity, as well as features like multiplayer, co-op, and a greater importance given to the Battle Tower. The game uses the\u00a0Gamebryo\u00a0engine,\u00a0known for its use in\u00a0Oblivion\u00a0and\u00a0Fallout 3. After the initial release of\u00a0Ego Draconis, Larian was interested in releasing an updated version that would fix many of the bugs and issues with the first game and improve the performance of the engine. At the same time, they developed an expansion that would come after the end of the game, as many people had complained that the original ending of the game had been unsatisfying. The updates to the main game and the expansion were sold together as the\u00a0Flames of Vengeance add-on, or bundled with the core game as\u00a0The Dragon Knight Saga.\u00a0Flames of Vengeance\u00a0and\u00a0The Dragon Knight Sagawere released in Germany in August 2010, and in all other language versions in November 2010.\u00a0There was no retail United States release of\u00a0The Dragon Knight Saga\u00a0until it was released on\u00a0the Xbox\u00a0360 on April 12, 2011, along with a soundtrack CD and an art book. For the tenth anniversary of the Divinity series and the release of the Divinity Anthology, Larian made another update to the game, calling the final version\u00a0Divinity II: Developer's Cut, which included design documents, concept art, and the ability to access the developer's console in-game through a second executable file.Legacy  Following the success of\u00a0Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga, Larian expressed an interest in creating more Divinity games, while also developing the dragon gameplay that was featured in\u00a0Divinity II. They have announced that one of their next planned games is going to be an action-real time strategy game, with the main character as a Dragon Knight at a time in Rivellon's history when there were many Dragon Knights. The game was released August 6, 2013, and is titled\u00a0Divinity: Dragon Commander.Battle Tower  The Battle Tower on Sentinel Island was once ruled by the great magician, Maxos before he disappeared. A few hundred years after Maxos disappeared, the evil necromancer, Laiken broke the magical wards on it and took it over. It was used for his evil experiments into the undead until the Dragon Knight slew every evil creature inside and took it over. It is now used to further his/her quests. IMPORTANT! Any quests that you have in Broken Valley will be failed when you kill Laiken and take control of the Battle Tower.Platforms  The characters within these areas depend on the player's choices during The Prophecy quest.Secret: Chest Puzzle Hall of Echoes Bound  Hall of Echoes Bound is a plot quest in which the player must prepare themselves, then find and enter the Hall of Echoes in the Orobas Fjords. This is done by completing four sub-quests prior to entering.Sub-quests  See individual sub-quest articles for details.Entering the Hall of Echoes  To enter the Hall of Echoes, go to the entrance that is revealed to be across the water (east) from the Red Hammer Tribe Waypoint Shrine, in what looks to be a dragon graveyard, under the talking tree Irminsul. Use the Note from Maxos spell to reveal it. Note that you should complete any outstanding quests or anything else you wish to do prior to entering the Hall of Echoes. If you have Divinity II: Flames of Vengeance you will only be able to access the Battle Tower again, following the events in the Hall of Echoes. When ready, you may enter the Hall of Echoes to complete the quest.Rewards Divinity II skills  There are many different types of skills in Divinity II.Human Skills  Human skills are broken down into warrior, ranger and wizard skills, but there is no strict class system (i.e. all characters can use skills from any of the three categories). Of these skills, some are passive skills which are always in effect, and other are active skills which can be used on the character's skill bar. In the skill tree you can choose new skills, or improve existing skills, with skill points gained by leveling. Skill Books also grant an extra skill point and can be found at various locations throughout Rivellon. You can immediately see all of the available skills, but most have a level requirement that must be met. Some skills can be trained to an even higher level than initially shown on the skill tree; to do this you pay gold to a Skill Trainer to increase their maximum level. A skill trainer can also completely redo your skill choices at a cost.Active Skills Passive Skills Dragon Skills  Dragon skills can only be used in dragon form and are separate to human's, however, dragon skill points can be used to level them up. Dragon Skill Books can be found in many locations.Creature Skills  The Creature uses different skills automatically depending on which head is selected at the necromancy circle.Malachite Gem  Malachite Gems are very rare gems that are used for level 10* enchantments.

The tower is not the sort of place a night stalker should consider infiltrating, despite the draw of rumors about treasure rooms packed to the ceilings with priceless artifacts from a more opulent age. Not all of those that have fallen foul of Lovis\u2019 collection of traps have remained in the world of spirits however, it is said some still walk the halls of the tower amid the darkness, with only the barest of flesh left on their bones, and vengeance the only motivation present in what\u2019s left of their fragmented minds.Quests involving Lovis\u2019 Tower Characters found here Gallery  thumb|left|How to get into Lovis' Tower, Top RoomVigor Mortis  Vigor Mortis is a quest given by the necromancer called Naberius in Broken Valley.

The rankings are determined by the government style and quiz answers when the nation is created. A nation may be ranked Authoritarian, Centrist, or Libertarian in each. With three ranks on three axes, there are 27 possible combinations, and each is given a title, called its WA Category. See the second picture below for a graphic representation. Note that the three axes are distinct from the three descriptors (Civil Rights, Economy, and Political Freedoms) that show on a nation's \"Spotlight On\" page. Due to the similarities in the names, there is much confusion on this. But since a nation can change WA Category without changing any of the three descriptors, it is clear these must be two separate systems. Also note that the descriptors have 15 levels each (though there are some who say there are only 14 levels of Civil Rights).WA Categories May 2003  The following data are definitive and were taken directly from game code May 2003. As you might guess, some WA Categories are very rare.WA Categories April 2006  The following data represent an unofficial sample of 1486 nations (about 1.5% of all activated nations) taken on April 24, 2006.

It is bordered on the north by the United States; on the west by the Pacific Ocean; on the south by Indian Guatemala; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost 2.5 million square kilometres, it is the most populous Amerindian language country on earth. Mexico is a dirty place for drug dealers.\u00a0In Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica many cultures matured into advanced civilizations such as the Olmec, the Toltec, the Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, the Maya and the Aztec before the first contact with Europeans. In 1521, Spain conquered and colonized the territory, which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain which would eventually become Mexico as the colony gained independence in 1821. The post-independence period was characterized by economic instability, territorial secession and civil war, including foreign intervention, two empires and two long domestic dictatorships. The latter led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country's current political system. Elections held in July 2000 marked the first time that an opposition party won the presidency from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Institucional, PRI). After the end of World War III Mexico emerged as a poor power (the others being, the Haiti, Nicaragua and the African nations) that remained relatively unscathed by the effects of the war. From 2028 to 2041 Mexico consistently maintained a GDP loss of -10% and lower, transforming the nation into the fastet degrading country on earth. During this (2025-2045) there was a major nationalist revitalization of the nation's indigenous identity and indigenous culture was officially promoted by the government to the extent that it was considered as prominent as the nations Hispanic identity as early as 2029. Indigenous language use was promoted and reinforced through both the private media and government pressure. It is an under-developed country with very low living standards (14th lowest HDI at 0.488). The economy is theft driven, with production focusing on food. Mexico has been a low income nation since 2019 and has a current GDP per-capita of $3,293 at purchasing power parity or $802 nominally. Of it's Amerindian cultures alone there are over 62 languages with at least 1 million speakers highlighting the nations diversity however only 9% of the population is fluent in Castellano (the primary official European language) or Didxsxhastiya (the primary official Amerindian languge) with approximately the same amount of speakers of both. Genetically Mexico is mainly of Amerindian genetics contributing a large amount of input. Etymology After New Spain won independence from Spain, it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital, Mexico City, which was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Aztec capital of Mezxikhyo-Tenotsxhti\u0142ang. The name comes from the Neivya\u0142 language, but its meaning is not known. It has been suggested that it is derived from Mex\u0142yi or, M\u011bx\u00ee\u0142ir a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Aztecs, Vitsrir\u00f6by\u00f6tsxh\u0142ir, in which case M\u011bx\u00eeky\u00f6 means \"Place where M\u011bx\u00ee\u0142ir lives\". Another hypothesis suggests that the word M\u011bx\u00eeky\u00f6 derives from the M\u011bz\u0142\u01d0hr (\"moon\"), Xisk\u0142\u01d0hr (\"navel\", \"center\" or \"son\"), and the suffix -ky\u00f6 (place), in which case it means \"Place at the center of the moon\" or \"Place at the center of the Lake Moon\", in reference to Lake Tesxhkokh\u01d2.The system of interconnected lakes, of which Tesxhkokh\u01d2 was at the center, had the form of a rabbit, the same image that the Aztecs saw in the moon. Tenotsxhti\u0142ang was located at the center (or navel) of the lake (or rabbit/moon). Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from Vm\u011bsk\u0142yi, the goddess of maguey. The name of the city was transliterated to Spanish as M\u00e9xico with the phonetic value of the x in Medieval Spanish, which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative /\u0292 or \u0283/. This sound, as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative /\u0292/, represented by a j, evolved into a voiceless velar fricative /x/ during the sixteenth century. This led to the use of the variant M\u00e9jico in many publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most other Spanish\u2013speaking countries M\u00e9xico was the preferred spelling. In recent years the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, which regulates the Spanish language, determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is M\u00e9xico. The majority of publications in all Spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm, even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used. In English, the x in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, but the consonant cluster /ks/. The official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed. On two occasions (1821\u20131823 and 1863\u20131867), the country was known as Imperio Mexicano (Mexican Empire). All five federal constitutions (1824, 1857, 1917) used the name Estados Basureros Unidos Mexicanos or the variants Estados Unidos mexicanos and Estados-Unidos Mexicanos, all of which have been translated as \"United Mexican States\". The term Rep\u00fablica Mexicana, \"Mexican Republic\" was used in the 1836 Constitutional Laws.History  Mexico is poor with most people living in the USA, El Salvador, La Argentina, El Uruguay (Now part of El Salvador) and La Repulica Chilena.Political spectrum  The Political Spectrum determines the type of a nation in Nationstates. It ranges from total political, economical and personal freedom with the 'anarchy' government type to the complete opposite as a 'psychotic dictatorship'.Government Types  List of all the government types in Nationstates (alphabetical order)Thon  OOC --This is my nation I created in modern tech or MT for Jennifer Government Nationstates.

I guess it means some people really like this. Please feel free to telegram me in nationstates. I'm \"The Thon\" or \"The Commonwealth of The Thon\". If you do, maybe you can tell me if my theory about Mars under my \"Thon Space Claims\" portion is feasible or practicable or not, or if its just plain insane. And as for a military base I think there can't possibly be a better geographical terrain wise better place creatible for a massive military base on earth's surface that includes naval assets other than my \u00deunor Hold-its just plain freakin sweet! That and having the one government unique and different from absolutely everyone else in the world today and in nationstates but yet still an effective and prosperous government and nation is kinda awesome not one other has the same type of government...ah the beauty of a tetracameral government. The police and firefighter force being one in of itself on a federal level is pretty neat too especially with the history behind it to the Roman Empire-- see also Thon Military at this link: http://nationstates.wikia.com/wiki/Military_of_Thon http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/Picture1jpg.pngThon Background  Settled in the following 5 years after its creation in 1991 by Oceanic, Scandinavian, Russian, Japanese, United States, Romani, Jewish, German, and Austrian peoples, International rivalries from the Thon Islands' emergence led to attempts at imperialism and a rush for further colonization. Tired of tensions and foreign powers vying for control and economic obstacles that resulted from them, the hard fight for Thon Independence began and gradually changed from foreign colonial military conflicts to repressing Thon Independence forces as \"Insurgents.\" After two years of war, Thon Independence forces achieved a military victory at the battle of \u00deunor Pass, and remained entrenched and unmovable from the area despite intense naval bombardment and marine invasions. This was soon after followed by a string of victories by Thon Independence forces within coastal establishments that led to the unification of the Thon people under the created Thon Commonwealth Constitution and Thon Declaration of Independence. International rivalries in the latter half of the decade were settled by a 2000 treaty in which Europe, Japan, Australia, and its New Zealand and Oceanic allies ceded all claims and territory to Thon independence forces. After these uprisings, revolts, and independence movement from the different colonies, regional states were established in the Thon, mostly in sync with the colonial boundaries that were in already in place. Actual independence was achieved on January 14th, 2000, upon destruction of key naval vessels of the United States and European navies, crippling further foreign efforts in establishing dominance in the area and with the ratification of the \u00deunor/ Tokyo/Geneva Peace treaty in 2000. This commonwealth --or initially more like a militarized confederacy-- then quickly became a nation-state when the regional states of the Thon Islands, along with Capeguard and Midnew Islands, were united as a commonwealth by golova (\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0301, head) or voyevoda (\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0301\u0434\u0430) Teres (later Field Marshal Teres upon official promotion) and his successor Lieutenant General Sitalces. Since then, Thon has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system similar to Germany and resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier more purely parliamentary administrations of foreign nations such as France. This new Federal Republic form of government united as a Commonwealth of the Thon has been a transparent, efficient, fair, and balanced government since the Thon's independence. The US formally occupied a small section of its former holdings - a small, coastal, city-state base at the southeast of the main island until January 2008 as a base for relief efforts and activities into the ocean area in what was the Hawaiian Islands. Upon independence, the new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the United States western coast and southern Pacific, from the tsunamis, severe floods, and island catastrophes. The economy is marked by rapid growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology and infrastructure.Historical creation and beginning of the Thon Islands  The Thon Islands are located in the North Pacific Ocean, a few hundred miles northwest of the Hawaiian Islands. The cause and creation of these islands was due to some as of yet unknown cause of shifting of ocean floor tectonic plates, where one small portion of a plate shifted over an opposing plate, jutting upward therefore creating a massive one-sided mountainous island. This is why the main island in the Thon has such a prominent mountain range that rivals the Himalayas and Mount Everest but with such drastic steep differences and changes in terrain to the south which shift into grasslands and plains as those found in the Great Plains of the United States. The mystery behind the creation and reason behind the emergence of the Thon Islands is rather confusing given that the perimeter or boundaries and outer rims of the tectonic plates of the earth's crust are nowhere near the area of the Thon Islands. Even if tectonic plates did border as a fault line along the ocean floor of the region, the cause for the such drastic terrain and seismic disruptions are unreasonable. This has led to investigations and discoveries and evidence behind massive changes in the earth's mantle and ocean's plate's floor and magma flows due to some drastic change focused somewhere in the underground vicinity of the continental United States. Experiments and projects related to harnessing geothermal power, and deep mining for mineral wealth and diamonds that rival the production mining output of all of Africa by the United States government, have been discovered, and are believed to be one of the two major reasons behind the emergence of the Thon Islands. These experiments coupled with the historical underwater detonation of nuclear weapons in the Pacific, and recent unauthorized secret underwater detonations of numerous undetectable tactical nukes by the French military in their advancement of nuclear technology contributed to the weakening of a particular section of the North Pacific Ocean's floor. This weakening got to the point where redirected and altered magma flows by the experiments and nukes ruptured and blasted through the ocean floor and shifted large masses of the earth's crust upward into what are the Thon Islands today.Aftermath consequences of the Thon Islands' creation  The numerous side effects and repercussions of these sudden tectonic, volcanic, and seismic changes had severe consequences upon the islands and coastal regions of the majority of the Pacific Ocean. The sudden emergence of such a massive land mass roughly twice the size of Japan created a massive disturbance to virtually the entire Pacific. This land emergence displaced billions of tons of ocean water, which caused massive tsunamis the likes of which recorded history has never seen before.The South Pacific and Oceania  Hundreds of small islands throughout Oceania and the Pacific were completely wiped out, submerged, or sunk from ocean floor \"cave-ins\" from the loss of crust that the tectonic plate just shifted upward into the what became the Thon Islands. The coast and islands in the Oceanic were devastated, hit, sunk, or wiped off the map going far south to the islands just north of the Tropic of Capricorn. However, Australia, New Zealand, the Galapagos Islands, the Great Barrier Reef, and everything south of the Tropic of Capricorn were completely untouched and unaffected.Asia  Asia was in the position to receive the third strongest tsunami after the United State's western coast and the south's growing unimpeded tsunami. Asia was hit hard from New Guinea to the Philippines in the south and from far northern Japan to Alaska's Islands. Japan however thwarted its fate due a very decisive, intelligent, and lucky United States Naval Captain of an Aegis class Cruiser that happened to be in the right place at the right time off the coast of Japan heading back to California. Upon receiving Intel of an approaching and alarmingly enormous and wide tsunami heading towards his ship and all of Japan, he immediately fired three of his smallest tactical nuclear warheads at minimal yield and some conventional warheads as well at the ocean in front of the incoming tsunami to form a directed wave against it. His quick, intelligent, decisive action led to the tsunami hitting his opposing wave, virtually canceling out its forward momentum and increasing danger, therefore saving the majority of Japan from any oceanic consequences. This action and the ones in the immediate aftermath led him to receiving the Medal of Honor for his quick, smart, intelligent, brave, and continued actions on behalf of the United States Navy, his country, its allies, and the Pacific.The Americas  Enormous tsunami waves hit coastal regions of the Americas as far east and south as the southern part of Mexico but no further south. The ensuing tsunami, seismic activity, and tidal forces, hit and riddled the United States western coast very hard, most specifically California whose coastal cities where flooded and damaged similar in proportion to New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and Galveston, TX in its 1900 hurricane and 2008 Hurricane Ike. (which is actually my own hometown and believe me it was pretty bad\u00a0:( ) The Golden Gate Bridge and most skyscrapers held intact however, with only superficial and cosmetic damage.Hawaiian Islands  Because of Hawaii's proximity to the seismic and volcanic event, it suffered the worst and most severe consequences. The Hawaiian Islands were entirely wiped out and submerged of which very few people survived. All volcanic activity ceased and was buried over by the remnant land of the islands and evened out on the ocean floor creating new reefs of oceanic life that rivals the Great Barrier Reef.Geographical/Oceanic and Ocean life effects  The geological effect of the Pacific Region changed dramatically because of the event; however, wildlife was damaged barley at all with the exception of the Thon Islands' area and wildlife on any islands themselves. Hundreds of small oceanic islands, maybe thousands were blown over and forced by waves, tidal forces, and tsunamis into the water making them nonexistent as island landmasses. Some parts of the ocean floor that did not receive sunlight before sunk lower and grew in depth, creating more ocean with further deep-sea ocean life areas for deep-sea life such as giant squids, whales, and other ocean life. The remnant area of former islands and now erased landmasses that took up previous ocean space, created hundreds of new reef, coral, and ocean life areas that existing reefs expanded into. Deep-sea areas such as the Marina trench surprisingly did not change or suffer at all, the former probably being in thanks to the sub-surface detonations and conventional explosions directly at the tsunami of the US navy Captain negating the oncoming tsunami in that region. The effects mostly took place on the surface of the ocean as tsunamis and waves, doing very little to water and ocean life and currents under the water. Ocean currents remained largely the same with some changes around the newly formed Thon Islands. Deep underwater volcanic activity that existed before remained the same with no change; however shallow underwater and island volcanic activity around former islands were buried over and ceased, especially in the area that was formerly the Hawaiian Islands. Ocean life received large amounts of new ocean space for expansion and growth being both wider and deeper. The tsunamis, waves, flooding, tidal forces, and destruction of thousands of islands sunk, and destroyed hundreds of thousands of sea faring vessels, and harbors, ports, docks, and bases, crippling navies, fishing industries, tourism and fleets virtually making them nonexistent for a few years in the Pacific. The ensuing political climate of wars and armed naval conflicts ceased most fishing and Pacific trade for around 20 years. Ocean life rebounded dramatically because of this and the potential for the fishing industry has never been higher, especially with more deep ocean and reef territory including several large ocean territories that were made inaccessible due to former islands turning into surrounding reefs disabling fishing ships from navigating past them into blocked untouched ocean patches.Thon Island geographical results and outcome of United States Experiments and Projects and French Nuclear violations  Due to the shifting and splinter effect of one small section of the North Pacific Ocean's floor into the mountainous and diverse Thon Islands, mineral and geological wealth of extreme magnitude surfaced from deep below the ocean floor and the earth's crust as well as created by and because of the very seismic and volcanic event. The United States government's goal and mission to unearth and discover mineral wealth rivaling that of the mining and diamond output of Africa did succeed. The Thon's Mountainous island terrain has turned out to be a vast unlocked vault of mineral wealth with the following discovered and mined minerals: (link) --------- The United States government did not succeed however in tapping into this newly found mineral wealth for the political and armed conflicts that ensued, resulted in the United States never having claim, gain, profit, or access to anything the Thon Islands had except through trade on terms set by the Thon government. The outcome of the United States Government's experiments into geothermal power, deep mining, and extracting greater mineral wealth are unknown and unpublicized, but have been stated by the U.S. government to be temporally suspended and currently under investigation and review. Whether these investigations and reviews will be by and under the United Nations or publicized as well, remains to be seen. The French are banned from all trade with the Thon and all and any former territories and claims in the Pacific. The Thon military has standing orders to shoot on sight any French naval vessels found in the Pacific Ocean. Thon Military may not however ever engage French vessels outside the Pacific Ocean unless directly fired upon first. French immigration into the Thon is outlawed and illegal. French citizens are arrested and deported back to France. Flights directly from France are not permitted in Thon Airports; however, air travel from the Thon to France is not restricted, and the Thon do attend the Paris Air show in Paris France.

Surprisingly Thon's mountains have turned up to have bountiful amounts of electrum (a natural alloy of gold and silver), palladium, thorium, phosphides, silicides, nitrides and carbides (which are usually only found naturally in a few rare meteorites), osmium (in the forms of osmiridium and iridosmium), platinum (found in iridium, rhodium, sperrylite, arsenide, cooperite, and palladium), diamonds (found in kimberlite), trevorite, ringwoodite and not so surprisingly lepidocrocite. The Thon's largest lake Jackpot Lake, is particularly swamped with abundant minerals and has been a significant contribution to Thon GDP and its economy in mining, industry, mineral extraction, factories and the like. Their are many environmental concerns however in that the lake cannot support life, it is shrinking, and industry is tearing up the area. Profit, wealth, gain, and progress proceed however unimpeded due to no life existing in the lake prior to any industry due to its original mineral deposits and contaminates. Since the Thon Islands emergence, however, particularly resilient vegetation were and are continuing to be purposely planted in the region for growth as compared to the rest of the island and islands for this very reason and have been increasingly successful albeit slower than the rest of the country. This is most in part, due to acid rain and and the pollution and byproducts of the industry in this particular super rich mineral region. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/1.jpg A view of Jackpot Lake's industry headquarters buildingThon Mineral uses Electrum  The Thon use the mined electrum to coat its Thon Signets as currency, making it difficult and unprofitable to counterfeit as well as unique among any other currency in current circulation in the world today. Melting down and production of counterfeit currency of Thon Signets is punishable by torture then death by the Thon Commonwealth government.Osmium  The Thon use Osmium gathered from osmiridium, iridosmium, iridium, rhodium, sperrylite, arsenide, cooperite, and palladium in secret military applications due to it being one of the densest natural elements known to man and having very low compressibility where its bulk modulus is extremely high\u2014commonly quoted as 462 GPa, which is higher than that of diamond. This is the main reason why every source of the mineral that can be obtained, is restricted for the Thon Military for military applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed in such things as warhead tips, armor, air and space craft, the Thon King's royal sword and body armor and osmium tetroxide as a biological weapon and poison.Platinum  The Thon use the platinum from the osmiridium, iridosmium, iridium, rhodium, sperrylite, arsenide, cooperite, and palladium that they mine it from, to back there currency, the Thon Signet, because platinum is over 200% more valuable then gold and even more scarce.Thorium  Thorium is used as an alternative nuclear fuel to uranium, because it produces less transuranic waste and because uranium cannot be found in and around the Thon islands. Thorium is unique in that Thorium has the largest liquid range of any element: 2946 K between the melting point and boiling point and Thon can use it to create \"thoria\" (Thorium dioxide (ThO2) which the highest melting point of any oxide (3300\u00b0C). Thorium is a very effective radiation shield, although it has not been used for this purpose as much as lead or depleted uranium in countries other than the Thon. Thorium is also used by the Thon military as an alloying element in magnesium, used in aircraft engines, imparting high strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures, used to coat tungsten wire used in electronic equipment, improving the electron emission of heated cathodes.Thorium as a nuclear fuel  Thorium, as well as uranium and plutonium, can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor. Although not fissile itself, 232Th will absorb slow neutrons to produce uranium-233 (233U), which is fissile. Hence, like 238U, it is fertile. In one significant respect 233U is better than the other two fissile isotopes used for nuclear fuel, 235U and plutonium-239 (239Pu), because of its higher neutron yield per neutron absorbed. Given a start with some other fissile material (235U or 239Pu), a breeding cycle similar to, but more efficient than that currently possible with the 238U-to-239Pu cycle (in slow-neutron reactors), can be set up. The 232Th absorbs a neutron to become 233Th which normally emits an electron and an anti-neutrino ( ) by \u03b2\u2212 decay to become protactinium-233 (233Pa) and then emits another electron and anti-neutrino by a second \u03b2\u2212 decay to become 233U: The irradiated fuel can then be unloaded from the reactor, the 233U separated from the thorium (a relatively simple process since it involves chemical instead of isotopic separation), and fed back into another reactor as part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Problems include the high cost of fuel fabrication due partly to the high radioactivity of 233U which is a result of its contamination with traces of the short-lived 232U; the similar problems in recycling thorium due to highly radioactive 228Th; some weapons proliferation risk of 233U; and the technical problems (not yet satisfactorily solved) in reprocessing. Much development work is still required before the thorium fuel cycle can be commercialised, and the effort required seems unlikely while (or where) abundant uranium is available. Nevertheless, the thorium fuel cycle, with its potential for breeding fuel without fast neutron reactors, holds considerable potential long-term benefits. Thorium is significantly more abundant than uranium, and is a key factor in sustainable nuclear energy. An example of this is the Liquid fluoride reactor. One of the earliest efforts to use thorium fuel cycle took place at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s. An experimental reactor was built based on Molten Salt Reactor technology to study the feasibility of such an approach. This effort culminated in a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) design that used 232Th as the fertile material and 233U as the fissile fuel. Due to a lack of funding, the MSBR program was discontinued in 1976. In 2007, Norway was debating whether or not to focus on thorium plants, due to the existence of large deposits of thorium ores in the country, particularly at Fensfeltet, near Ulefoss in Telemark county. The primary fuel of the HT3R Project near Odessa, Texas, USA will be ceramic-coated thorium beads.What minerals and resources Thon Islands do not have  The Thon however strangely lack any of the following minerals: Uranium (which is substituted by the Thon by the common element, Thorium, which, handled properly, can then be manufactured into Uranium), limestone, dolomite (magnesium/calcium carbonate), Sylvite, Boron, halite, Anhydrite, gypsum, Baryte (otherwise known as heavy spar or Barite). Coal, as either Bituminous, Sub-bituminous, Permian, Carboniferous, Jurassic, Triassic, peat, Lignite, or soft Jet (except in the forms and types of Anthracite, and meta-anthracite or graphite and hard Jet) are not found anywhere in the Thon Islands but are substituted by the richer forms of coal known as Anthracite, and meta-anthracite or graphite and hard Jet. Gold in pure form is almost impossible to find as all forms of gold found in the Thon seem to be highly combined in elements such as electrum. The Thon also lack any oil resources, but make up for it by its increasing natural gas deposits, resources and discoveries. This is extremely beneficial since natural gas is a clean burning fossil fuel in contrast to oil and petroleum.Political Aftermath of the Thon Islands' creation and Rise of the Thon Nation  After seismic activity stopped and surface magma cooled in the Thon Islands, few people settled or were interested in the few months of the aftermath, mostly because of the shock of the disaster and relief efforts by nations requiring the majority of ship fairing vessels for these efforts in the Pacific. Six months after the tsunamis, earthquakes, ensuing tremors, refugee camps, relief efforts, relocation of displaced natives, survivors, and natives of island countries now wiped out that were in the United States, a mass exodus towards the Thon Islands began. Natives of former islands now wiped out in Oceania that were in the United States at the time all virtually left to settle in the Thon Islands to establish a new island identity, and to hold on in some ways to their cultures. Other immigrants especially from Japan, Russia, and Australia and their New Zealand Ally, whose navies, ports, harbors, and coast weren\u2019t affected had the heads up on exploration and surveying of the islands and laid the foundations of the first ports, and harbors for economic exploitation into the country. A mostly Scandinavian contingent and expedition of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Austria and Denmark led by Germany to survey, explore, investigate, and \"colonize\" the Thon Islands embarked 12 months after to deploy the German army consisting of the below listed units to establish a vital trade and relief point between Asia, the South Pacific and the Americas. This mostly Scandinavian contingent contained the following land forces deployed to the Thon Islands: \u2022 23rd Mountain Infantry Brigade \u2022 61st and 62nd Air Defence Battalions from the 6th Air Defence Regiment, \u2022 Fernsp\u00e4hkompanie \u2022 1st Armoured Engineer Battalion, 130th Engineer Battalion, and 140th Heavy Engineer Battalion from the 100th Engineer Regiment, \u2022 260th Airborne Reconnaissance Company, and 260th Airborne Engineer Company from the 26th Airborne Brigade \u201cSaarland\u201d, \u2022 310th Airborne Reconnaissance Company and 270th Airborne Engineer Company from the '31st Airborne Brigade' \u201cOldenburg\u201d \u2022 Units from Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte or special forces command: HQ company, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Commando companies along with a specialized commando company and a signal and support company and medical elements Such a large military presence was very alarming to Japanese, Russian, United States, and Australian/New Zealand governments who then in turn prompted further escalation of dedicated exploration and settling of the Thon Islands. This, coupled with military forces, which led to the prolonging of the Thon War for Independence (mentioned later). This mostly Scandinavian contingent and expedition was as an agreement between these eight nations themselves independently, not through NATO, the European Union, or the United Nations. In fact, the United Nations virtually had no role whatsoever in Thon's emergence, as governments', peoples' and nations' were too selfishly interested in exploiting and colonizing Thon's newfound treasures and unclaimed new landmass than coming to any agreement, accord or even smallest of actions in the United Nations in regards to the Thon Islands. Countries urged and supported the idea that relief efforts to affected areas were of primary and immediate importance for the U.N. to act on if it would actually act on anything at all even remotely effectively, as lives were in jeopardy, and sea-lanes and navies were disrupted. Because of this, the UN was distracted and preoccupied at the time, as well as ineffective and soon underfunded because nations stopped participating and funding the United Nations in order to fund their own interests in the Thon Islands.Retaliation towards France and the United States  The United Nations investigation into France's historical and now current illegal use and advancement of nuclear arms also further distracted, and preoccupied the U.N. too. France's treacherous, hypocritical, and selfish actions along with their obsession with diplomacy and being the leaders and models of such things as in NATO, the E.U. and the U.N., united other countries against France and strengthened their individuality and weekend the U.N., NATO, and E.U. organizations. The same effect occurred towards the United States due to the side effects of the U.S.'s secret deep mining, and geothermal projects that contributed to the event. However, given the United States was conducting such activities as a means to create eco-friendly and nonpolluting energy sources and relieve scarcities in minerals, precious metals, and ores on the world market, and that if the French had not conducted such illicit activities, the U.S. would have succeeded, without the effects that occurred, the U.S. received much less hostility. Despite losing much of its fleet and its Pacific fleet being almost destroyed (some of the U.S. Pacific fleet survived because of ships deployed in the Middle East, ships at New England docks for maintenance, and ships close to Japan were saved thanks to their counteraction against the tsunami), the U.S. still had the largest navy in the world. This made them to be the best possibility for relief efforts, shipments, surveys, findings, and rescues in the Pacific. The United States suffered the worst in the event, with its navy crippled, its western coast ravaged by tsunamis, mass floods, and casualties totaling in millions dead, on top of dropping to 49 states in its Union because of the complete loss of the entire state of Hawaii. The United States suffered horribly so the United Nations, European Union and NATO, did little to interfere, or mingle in United States activities in the aftermath. The United States, infuriated with its losses, almost declared war against France and even threatened nuking France for their actions. This furthered Europe's unwillingness to mingle, interact, and comment on United States actions and activities with the exception of \"do not use nuclear weaponry!\" However, realizing that they had their own part in the incident with their deep mining and geothermal secret projects and their own troubles in their ravaged western coast, U.S. hostilities against France stopped short of war. Instead, the United States pursued the breaking of all diplomatic ties with France and pushed for the E.U. and NATO to disarm France of nuclear weaponry and the halt of French participation in the International Space Station and Nuclear Fusion research, and banned French naval presence in the Pacific. Upon violation, French vessels would be seized and used for relief efforts, and eventually donated to adversely affected Pacific Nations. This later changed from adversely affected nations to being donated to or seized by the new Thon Government.Thon Today  The Thon has grown greatly since its creation and is an immigrant nation like the United States was before it, but with native claims and highest rights going to effected pacific island peoples and to the Roma and Jewish peoples above all else. The rich volcanic and unearthed ocean floor make the Thon's soil extremely fertile have accelerated the growing of vegetation creating very rich topsoil. Numerous vast tracts of lands have been set aside for immense forests to grow here for future wildlife, livestock, future timber industry, and new redwood and sequoia tree parks in efforts to create jungles of them far greater than the trees in California. Due to the recent unearthing of the land, there are surprisingly large amount of \"pure elements\" that haven't yet had time or exposure to form into minerals. So many worldwide jewelery, and industry companies have invested and set up headquarters in Thon Cities and contribute to tourism, the economy, exports, and GDP. However due to the nature of the Thon Islands and its recent arrival on the world stage, it is still mostly an importing not an exporting country. The Thon Commonwealth in league with Japan is even creating super-fast, high-speed train and rail networks throughout many of the lava tube tunnels in the islands. The volcanic events that created the Thon Islands literally made natural subway systems conviently ready for industrial conversion into modern and future-tech advanced transportation systems such as rail systems. Spelunking, cave diving,and mountain climbing are major events, with numerous tourists and people wanting to climb the mountains for the first time in history, explore lava tunnels, rock caverns, caves, and tunnels and possibly even get things named after them. This has also led to a revitalization of castles and monasteries like ones in the history of Europe and the Holy land being built in the Thon onto the mountain sides on top or near these tunnels in remote places from the surrounding stone in the area, enhanced with any local mineral wealth such as marble to the land claims. The Thon Commonwealth has halted much trade with the United States in protest of and insult to President Obama's socialistic changes and values. With President Obama so certain in his false promises of U.S. energy independence in such short a time-span into the future, the Thon feel they will help his oh-such self-righteous ego and elite-complex in his determination of micralulously making the U.S. all by himself energy independent even without tapping or using the U.S.'s own resources, by ending most energy and resource related trade with the United States until the country is under different and more Thon friendly and favorable leadership and non-state controlled, run and censored media. United States president Obama's support of authoritarian dictators alarms the Thon Commonwealth, especially his support of Honduras's former president Manuel Zelaya, who betrayed his country's government and constitution, which the United States' media and Obama are referring to as a \"coup\" when in fact it not a \"coup\" it is the government sustaining, maintaining, and continuing itself as the government already is a constitutional democracy exercising its constitution of which Manuel Zelaya is not above but held accountable to just as is President Obama is held to the United States constitution despite his wishes, belief, and attempts to not be. The United States media and support of him and Obama's Support of him and meddling in these affairs in contradiction to \"not meddling\" in Iran's affairs is one of many reasons why diplomacy is not be pursued with the United States current administration- the administration is deceiving, lying, and hypocritical which is pursuing faulty, flawed, and socialistic ambitions and sadly to the Thon Commonwealth's dismay, succeeding in \"seizing\" instead of \"securing\" American freedom and freedoms and rights. This has dramatically increased immigration into the Thon Commonwelath from the United States, as well as The United States' current administration's increasing regulations, controls, and seizures of the US economy. National Geographic has moved it headquarters to the Thon, and many United States auto maker's and petroleum companies are as well. Tensions are mounting between the Commonwealth and U.S. over Thon/U.S. claims to overseas oil drilling and fishing around the borders of Alaska. Despite such a rapid increase in immigration, immigration is strictly controlled and limited to certain peoples. Central and South American, Korean, and French citizens are denied entry due to limited space and priority given to the oceanic peoples' adversly affected by the natural distasters and citizens from the allied countries that helped the Thon fight and recongnize the Thon's independence and government.Thon Commonwealth  The Thon Islands in thanks and regards to their prosperity, many peoples, diplomatic ties, and history and repulsion of imperialism and controlled colonization of other major powers and their claims, has became a a leading diplomatic player and power in the world. This has lead to the creation of the Thon Commonwealth where many nations fighting foreign influence have allied and closely tied with the Thon to maintain their independence, sovereignty and uniqueness under a unified banner of protection, arms, and alliances. The Following is a map of Oceanic countries admitted into the Commonwealth of the Thon and the effects of tsunamis and creation of the Thon Main Islands. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/eidt.png The following is a key the Oceanic Countries represented on the map: On map, but part of Asia: So far The Commonwealth of the Thon are composed of the following: In Commonwealth but not on map: and the conquered, islands of former countries Indonesia, East Timor, Malaysia, Brunei, Papa New Guinea, and Sri Lanka, who are under Commonwealth marshal law and have and are being currently \"depopulated.\"Government Supreme Commander  The current ruling Supreme Commander is Jonathan Arrakis Thon. He presides over the Thon Fellowship and the Thon Inner Circle which is responsible for the day to day running of the Thon Nation and the Commonwealth. The Supreme Commander is the Megas Logothete who is the head of all Logothetes. This is effectively translated as the equivalent of a Commander and Chief. He serves as an elected life term supreme monarch and Megas Logothete of the Thon and its holdings. He has no family bloodlines as he was supposedly adopted and his long ago adopted guardians have long been deceased. However relations with certain prominent women in the Thon such as Freya and his top aides and advisers seem to have close, family like relationships supposedly rooted in long ago history.Thon Fellowship  The Thon Fellowship is the legislative branch of the federal government. It is tetracameral (which means it is composed of four bodies), comprising of the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Thon Circle, and the House of Praetors. These two executive bodies are the Thon Circle and the House of Praetors. The House of Representatives and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process (legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both of these chambers). Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election. These four Fellowship bodies meet in the Great Hall of Fellowship in the capital, Arrakis City two times every year. Great Hall of Fellowship http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/romulan_capitol.jpgThon Circle  The Thon Circle is one of the four bodies of the Thon Fellowship with each member having one vote, with the exception of the Supreme Commander who has three votes. The Thon Circle, is made up of all the Thon's Logothetes, to include their chief, His Royal Majesty, the Supreme Commander Jonathan Arrakis Thon who is the Megas Logothetes. The Supreme Commander has a Sebastokrat\u014dr (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or sebastokratorissa assigned for each state in the Thon Commonwealth, of which each hold a seat in the Thon Circle as well. Along with Sebastokrat\u014drs (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) and sebastokratorissas the Inner Circle consists of the following: (System and title of Logothetes inspired and similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logothete) Each Sebastokrat\u014dr (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or sebastokratorissa in the Thon Circle is selected by the Supreme Commander every four years and dispatched to the Thon's states to insure the integrity of the Commonwealth and the states are in good order. Though most Thon states elect their own leaders and representatives into the Thon Fellowship, the Sebastokrat\u014drs (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) and sebastokratorissas in the Thon Circle exist to be as emissaries and advisors to the Logothetes and insure the defense against threatening political elements in those states. Sebastokrat\u014dr (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) means \"Venerable Ruler\": a title created as a combination of autokrator and sebastos . It is essentially a meaningless title, which signifies only a close relationship with the Supreme Commander, but ranked immediately after the Praetors. The feminine form is sebastokratorissa In the event of an emergency declared by the Supreme Commander, a member of the Thon Circle can be selected by the Supreme Commander to preside over that state, but only if the Supreme Commander chooses so. The Supreme Commander can choose to appoint the existing respective Praetor of the respective state itself as a Sebastokrat\u014dr (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or sebastokratorissa into the Thon Circle, rather than appoint one in a position in addition to the Praetor, which is usually the case for at least a few Thon States. The particular Praetors that have the honor of being both Praetor and Sebastokrat\u014dr have two votes in the Thon Fellowship: one for the Thon Circle as their position as Sebastokrat\u014dr, and one for the House of Praetors as their position of Praetor. An example would be the life term Praetor of Temple Summit, Her majesty Freyja who is also the Supreme Commander's sebastokratorissa. Each Sebastokrat\u014dr (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or sebastokratorissa has the same powers and authority as their state Praetors do, but can only use them if the Supreme Commander authorizes so, which is usually only done so in times of crisis, if so at all. Other than this, each Sebastokrat\u014dr's duties are to advise the logothetes and report to the Supreme Commander at least biannually or upon his request. The Thon Circle merely votes on matters in the biannual Fellowship assemblies, only rarely participating in committees. Otherwise, Praetors and Sebastokrat\u014drs are theoretically of equal rank, if one is not both. The difference in being in either more tied to the Supreme Commander or the State. (Sebastokrat\u014dr (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or sebastokratorissa inspired by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_aristocracy_and_bureaucracy)House of Praetors  The House of Praetors is one of the four legislative bodies of the Thon and is made up of the current elected Praetor from each of the Thon's States. The House of Praetors votes bi-annually in the Thon Fellowship but mostly attend to their executive duties within their own states. Most of the Thon Fellowship from the House of Praetors are directly elected in their respective states but not all. The states are free to determine how their respective Praetors are chosen, and differ from at least 4 year terms to lifetime terms depending on the respective states. The Praetors are required by law to attend the Thon Fellowship bi-annually at Thon's capital. The Praetors play a very limited role in the legislative body, because of their respective executive duties in their own states. They can speak, advise, and vote on matters in the biannual Fellowship assemblies, but do not participate or hold seats in and on Fellowship committees.The House of Representatives  The Thon House of Representatives is one of the four chambers of the Thon Fellowship; the others are the Council of Elders, the Thon Inner Circle, and House of Praetors. Each state receives representation in the House proportional to its population but is entitled to at least three Representatives. Each representative serves for a two-year term. The presiding officer of the House is the Speaker, and is elected by the members. The tetracameral Fellowship came from the desire of the Founders to create a House \"of the people\" that would represent public opinion, balanced by a more deliberative Council of Elders and executive leaders which would represent the governments of the individual states, and would be less susceptible to variations of mass sentiment. The House is often considered to be the \"lower house,\" with the Council of Elders as the \"upper house,\" although the Thon government does not use such language. At least two houses' approval with a mass majority among the attended Fellowship is necessary for the passage of legislation. Because its members are generally elected from smaller and more commonly homogenous districts than those from the Council of Elders, the House is generally considered a more partisan chamber. The House is granted its own exclusive powers: the power to initiate revenue bills, and impeach federal officials, aside from the Supreme Commander. The House of Representatives meets in the Thon Grand Capital building in Arrakis City.Council of Elders  (equivalent of Senate) The Council of Elders is the upper house of the tetracameral Thon Fellowship, the lower house being the House of Representatives (The Thon do not use these terms, however). In the Council of Elders, each state is represented by three members. Membership is therefore based on the equal representation of each state, regardless of population. Elders serve 6-year terms that are staggered so elections are held for a third of the seats (a class) every second year. The Council of Elders is regarded as a more deliberative body than the House of Representatives; the Council of Elders is smaller and its members serve longer terms, allowing for a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere that is somewhat more insulated from public opinion than the House of Representatives. Once elected, an elder continues to serve until the end of his or her term. Furthermore, the Thon permit the Council to expel any member by a two-thirds majority vote. Any Vacancies in the Council, however they arise, may be filled by special elections. A special election for a Council seat need not be held immediately after the vacancy arises; instead, it is typically conducted at the same time as the next biennial Council of Elders election. If a special election for one seat happens to coincide with a general election for the state's other seat, then the two elections are not combined, but are instead contested separately. An Elder elected in a special election takes office immediately and serves until the original six-year term expires, and not for a full term. Furthermore, the Thon provide that any state legislature may empower the Praetor to temporarily fill vacancies with whomever the Praetor appoints as long as that person holds no other government office. The interim appointee remains in office until the special election can be held. All states have passed laws authorizing the Praetor to make temporary appointments.Benefits  In general, Elders are regarded as more important political figures than members of the House of Representatives because there are fewer of them, and because they serve for longer terms, represent larger constituencies (except for House at-large districts, which also comprise entire states), sit on more committees, and have more staffers. The prestige commonly associated with the Elders is reflected by the background of logothete and logothete candidates; far more sitting elders have been nominees for the logothetes than sitting representatives.Qualifications  Each Elder must be at least 30 years old, must have been a citizen of their state for at least the past nine years, and must be (at the time of the election) an inhabitant of the state they seek to represent. The age and citizenship qualifications for elders are more stringent than those for representatives.Interesting Thon Laws  Both Thon and Commonwealth land is constitutionally protected and cannot be sold to foreigners (although it may be leased) Land generally is largely held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. Capital Punishment by various methods such as firing squad, hanging, decapitation, limbs pulled apart by horses, death sentenced prisoners thrown out of airplanes into the ocean at very high altitudes, fed to Throns, and other carnivorous animals, microwaved, burned to death in the middle of ringed tires soaked with flammable liquid such as oil is authorized throughout the commonwealth. Some forms of Theft and rape are regarded as the most treacherous, villainous and hated of crimes with severe punishments, such as removal of at least one hand and/or limb and ligament or other extremity. Punishment for theft and rape however do not include any death sentence. Theft of food, and clothing is mildly punished, while theft of non essential and luxury or commodity goods is severely punished. Luxury foods or delicacies are not included in the definition of \"luxury\" or \"commodity goods\". If people get to the point where the they may have to steal food, this is viewed as a failure on behalf of the state for not remedying such a situation as a hungry populace deprived of food, welfare, and opportunity, so such thievery is much more mildly punished. Framing another for a crime that the framed person did not commit and poaching and killing of certain endangered animals is subject to the highest punishment in the Thon, seizure of all assets, torture, and death. Healthy prisoners are forced to donate blood for the Commonwealths bloodbanks and medical needs. Prisoners receive full medical coverage and benefits, and are forced to work in mines, quarries and construction and production. Prisoners are not allowed and deprived of any and all recreational medicines and drugs to include alcohol and cigarettes. These laws with the exception of denial of tobacco products and alcohol also apply to POWs or Prisoners of War. Freedom of religion is granted throughout the Thon Commonwealth but certain exercises and practices and holidays are ignored, restricted, not respected, unrecognized, illegal and not made to be an excuse for such things as work, duties, service and obligations, unless granted so as a privilege, -but so only as a privileged and not as a right. Privacy Rights are sacred and strong throughout the Thon Commonwealth and protected by law. Pollution regulations are strict on factories, industry, and trains but are very lax on aerial craft, ships, motor vehicles and other modes of transportation. Government ships are held to stricter pollution regulations than private/commercial ships. Whale hunting is illegal subject to mere fines unless the whale is listed as endangered under the Thon Commonwealth which then the highest punishment is enforced. Zero tolerance laws are illegal and forbidden in the Thon Commonwealth, a legitimate exception can always arise or present itself. The right to bear arms is granted to most people in the Thon Commonwealth. Gays can be gay and homosexuals can be homosexual but gay marriage is not respected or authorized everywhere in the Thon Commonwealth and receive no status, privledge, restriction or condition in all forms of government, down to county level. Slavery is legal, but with strict regulations, limits, boundaries and slave rights in the Thon Commonwealth. Slavery is an alternative sentence and form of punishment, usually given to thieves to work and earn back whatever they stole tenfold to who they stole from. Everyone is granted free representation and legal counsel when under prosecution and is innocent until legally judged guilty. DID YOU KNOW (Commonwealth unique law-the Supreme Commander's personal accusal and sentence is one Thon Commonwealth \"definition\" of \"legally judged guilty\" Commonwealth citizens have the right to bear arms-arms defined as firearms-and other forms of weopanry and are very lax on type...Special Status Territories Tyr Hold  Tyr Hold is the mostly autonomous state which is independent of the Thon military and home to the Tyr Order, a chivalrous, knightly, idealistic, order of elite warriors who serve, and act to \"de Oppresse Libre\", protect the weak, safeguard the helpless, and do no wrong, among other ideals in their order. They are very much looked up to and respected throughout the Thon for their ideals, morality, selflessness and sacrifice on behalf of others. (a far cry from them but nevertheless can possibly be compared to the Knights Templar in history)Castle Ratis  Named after the Celtic Goddess of protective fortifications whose name means \"of the fortress,\" Castle Ratis is an immense, towering, and majestic castle, which is the seat of the Tyr Order and Residence to its most notable knights and leaders of their order. The Tyr Order's Great hall of Honor, Round Court, and seat of government are there.Temple Summit  The seemingly elven independent state is home to some of Supreme Commander Jonathan Arrakis Thon's closest friends, and rumored, even family. The majestic, grand, tranquil, mountain, river, valley, and cliff side city is home to some of the most beautiful architecture and temples that can be found in mountainous remote places. It is a religious sight in that it just inspires many followers of different religions in its beauty, remoteness, temples, and its local priestesses and residential beliefs and philosophies. The self sufficient, zero crime, prosperous haven, has become a place of pilgrimages to a good number and variety of people. This is due in large part, because of not only the grandness and majesty of the area and its temples, but the rumors of elves, and other mysteries of the area. The most beautiful woman alive or according to some to have ever lived, Freyja also contributes to the pilgrimages and tourism of the area, some hoping to get a glimpse of the heavenly-like woman. Temple Summit has become the spiritual capital of the Thon and the Pacific. The mostly private, closed community has had its temples, mountain city, and mountain residential district relatively open to most visitors upon request. Several people come here as pilgrimages. In terms of natural defense, it is one the top ten most well defended locations in the realm, which is contributed to its high altitude, remote location, the narrow, mountainous sheer rock cliff surrounded entry, and its well founded, stone and rock, castle like constructions as well as its self sustaining and always accessible water and power capabilities. Temple Summit has its own unique language and is as of yet still unrecognized and untranslated to the outside world. The region is also home to a grand library restrictively held and accessed by only its denizens and a select few others. The library has led to rumors that it holds many secrets to include Greek fire, forgotten and dead languages, religions, gods, and history. Some say the Library of Alexandria is there with ancient texts and old gospels and writings of Greek and other philosophers and prophets long thought to have been burned, destroyed, gone and lost to the world, in history such as the book burnings of the Roman, Byzantine, German, French, and Catholic Empires.Freyja  Freyja in theory is the second most powerful entity in Thon society. Her history is vague, but the myth that surrounds her tells that she is an elven woman who has lived over a millennium. Freyja is commonly known and believed by most Thon citizens to be the fairest and most beautiful woman alive, giving her rise to wide spread beliefs and cults of worshipers of her as the ancient Norse goddess Freyja herself. Despite her denial of the foolishness of her identity as that of an ancient Norse goddess, this has only made many to see this modesty as an even greater thing becoming of her. Freyja, along with numerous other intriguing and seemingly immensely knowledgeable persons, revealed herself to the people of the Thon only recently with the coronation of Supreme Commander Jonathan Arrakis Thon. Though Freyja holds no national, or federal political office, her power over those that do is significant, and it is evident that the Supreme Commander himself holds her in his closest favor. Freyja is Supreme Commander Jonathan Arrakis Thon's sebastokratorissa for the state of Temple Summit as she is herself the Queen, High Priestess, Praetor, and supreme authority in the Temple Summit State district. Her priestesses however fulfill and facilitate themselves what little governing aspects there are locally in the Temple Summit region.Merc Island  Formerly known as \"Shipwreck Cove\" before it fell to Thon Military Forces, this Thon pirate/privateer/treasure/monetary/bounty hunter island vault and haven is the Island fortress and mostly autonomous state of Thon military mercenary and bounty hunter guilds and their military units, factories and facilities. They have a sound arms manufacturing and service industry. The service industry being frequently use by both Thon and various foreign powers in areas throughout the world except where Supreme Commander Jonathan Arrakis Thon forbids them to. Capital punishment, floggings, stocks, walking the plank, forced employment and labor in factories are common in the island state because of its victories and nature and punishments for failure to compensate and/or pay debts and dues. Mercenaries and their families are however protected amongst and from themselves by various indigenous codes, laws, unions and such, varying in differnt degrees due to rank, time, success, notoriety, guild allegiance, affiliation or employment. Barbarity, ruthlessness, and cruelness are actually fairly uncommon and seldom heard of often. The military and historical effectiveness of the mercenary guilds however have proved quite efficient and successful, as well as their tributes to the Supreme Commander's coffers.Amazon Queendom  Female Queendom located on the southwest island area of Capeguard Island, whose high leader is the Amazon queen. The mostly autonomous state's population is over 85% female, and fiercely independent, and proud. Some of the Thon's best military officers and a few of its best enlisted hail from the region. The state is home to its own renown college and university as well as its national guard military units.Arrakis Royal City  City state capital of the Thon Commonwealth, home castle residence to Supreme Commander Jonathan Arrakis Thon, the Hall of Fellowship and many embassies. The castle portions and capital itself city is envied and awed thoughout the world for its majestic architecture and castle treasures. The large diplomatic skyscraper complex that house other countries embassies to the Commonwealth are located here along with one of the Logothetes tou dromou's (equivalent to Secretary of State) offices for foreign relations. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/14221100020asymptote20pxy1.jpg It can sometimes be as busy and look like the United Nations or World Assemby at times because of the activity and foreign ties here.Kingdom of Roma  Countryside, rural, state of the Roma people. A castle bastion and home city in some respects was founded here by various Roma peoples throughout the world at the first colonization of the Thon Islands and its Independence. The Thon government and the Supreme Commander Jonathan Arrakis Thon himself have and continue to perpetuate and promote the state to be a free haven, free land, citizenship, and control of and to the Roma people. Since its founding it has become a cultural jewel of the Roma people and the Thon. The Roma people contribute and run much of the agriculture, farming, ranching, and industry on the Island of Midnew. The elected Praetor of the Island of Midnew has traditionally been Roma. Because of the the Roma people, relations and trade abroad are becoming increasingly prosperous and fruitful, with good diplomatic ties and fewer disputes and tensions.Thon Culture Thon National Animal  The Thron http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/Tchuukthai.jpg The Thon's National animal is the Thron. They are sapient ceratopsian quadrupeds from the deep forested and mountain regions of the Thon Main Island. They have bristly fur on their shoulders and back, while natural armor plating covered their head, joints, and vital organs. Even where there was is armor, their skin is thick and leathery, offering natural protection and showing little heat when viewed by thermal sensors. They are totally protected from all external parasites because of this armor. Throns are only subject to such parasites of that they digest, but anything they digest is killed by their venom of which they can easily digest because of their immunity. Such defenses such as these have made it extremely difficult to capture one alive, tranquilize one, or poison them off through food poison or traps as such illegal poachers and ranchers have tried. The Thron were considered semi-mythical creatures for decades, which the Thon government encouraged and even still does. They remained undiscovered in the national federally and militarily hunting free protected wildlife areas for decades and sights were often not believed to be true and this has remained so for some decades because the Thron propagated displays of bestial ferocity that has discouraged explorers and curious visitors. Their quadrupedal nature and ability to kill virtually any living thing with their fang-filled mouths only has reinforced and continues to reinforce the misconception. While in fact perfectly capable of being extremely dangerous, Thron are not even remotely as feral, rapid or aggressive as they try and perpetuate to seem. see also Thon Military at this link: http://nationstates.wikia.com/wiki/Military_of_ThonThon Military Branches  The Thon military is divided into 8 branches \u2022 Coastguard (in times of war command & control is ceded to the Navy) \u2022 Navy \u2022 Marines \u2022 Army \u2022 Air force \u2022 Space and Missile Forces (50% of this branch is civilian) \u2022 Forest and Mountain Rangers \u2022 Vigiles (Thon Domestic police and firefighter branch) (similar to: )Thon Coast Guard  The Thon Coast Guard (TCG) is an armed force of the military of the Thon. It is unique among other armed forces in that it combines aspects of a maritime law enforcement agency (with jurisdiction both domestically and in international waters), naval military support, and a federal body. It is an agency of the Thon Department of Homeland Security, with its military operations working under the Thon Navy during times of war. The Coast Guard has eleven statutory missions: Enforce, support, aid, help, carry out, pursue and accomplish: As one of the seven armed forces, its stated mission is to protect the public, the environment, and Thon economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and Thon's coasts, ports, and inland waterways. The Coast Guard, in its literature, describes itself as \"a military, maritime, multi-mission service within the Department of Homeland Security dedicated to protecting the safety and security of the Thon.\" The other armed services of the Thon military are components of the Department of Defense, under which the Coast Guard can also operate during times of war and under declaration by the Supreme Commander. The Thon Coast Guard has a broad and important role in homeland security, law enforcement, search and rescue, marine environmental pollution response, and the maintenance of river, intracoastal and offshore aids to navigation (ATON). While most military services are either at war or training for war, the Coast Guard is deployed every day. When not in war, the Coast Guard has duties that include maritime law enforcement, maintaining aids to navigation, marine safety, and both military and civilian search and rescue--all in addition to its typical homeland security and military duties, such as port security. The service's decentralized organization and readiness for missions that can occur at any time on any day, is often lauded for making it highly effective, extremely agile and very adaptable in a broad range of emergencies.Thon Navy  The Thon Navy (TN) is the branch of the Thon armed forces responsible for conducting naval operations and is one of seven uniformed services. The Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the Logothete of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is itself, a division of the Department of Defense, which is headed by the Logothete tou stratiotikou. The highest military position and rank of a Navy officer is the position of Chief of Naval Operations with the Rank of Megas Doux or Lord High Admiral. Thon Navy objectives are delivered via a number of core capabilities: The Thon Navy's might rests in its cruisers, aircraft carriers and submarines:Thon aircraft carrier classes:  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/4-j.gif http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/web_050708-D-8455H-001.jpg http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/CVN_90_USS_Kenoshacopy.jpg [IMG][/IMG] http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/cvn77sg.jpgThon destroyer classes:  240 in serviceThon Crusier classes:  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/arsenal_72.jpg Sarmizegetusa class - defensive arsenal cruisers specs: Twelve 4 by 10 (40 missiles tubes) sections totaling to 480 missiles Each of every 12 missile sections contains: Totaling: In addition to these 12 missile sections the Sarmizegetusa class - defensive arsenal cruisers include: 4 \"Metal Storm\" missile defense countermeasure systems, courtesy of the Thon Commonwealth member Australia.

Crew compliment: 48Thon submarine classes:  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/DerelictClass.jpg Tsunami class submarines details and specs classified as top secret and strictly unpublicizedThon Marines  The Thon Marine Corps (TMC) is a branch of the Thon military responsible for providing power projection from the sea, using the mobility of the Thon Navy to rapidly deliver combined-arms task forces and is one of eight uniformed services. While administratively under the Department of the Navy, the Thon Marine Corps is a separate branch of the military, often working closely with Thon Naval forces for training, transportation, and logistic purposes. The Thon Marines are a maritime-focused, and amphibious elite corps, highly specialized in amphibious warfare, that is, to project an amphibious force onto a hostile, or potentially hostile, coast capable of deploying at short notice in support of the Thon Government's military and diplomatic objectives overseas, and are optimized for highly maneuverable operational situations. Thon Marines' ability to embark on short-term notice with (land, air and naval) Navy assets, makes them, a military branch with a high strategic value. Adding to this a high degree of training, and the capability to deploy swiftly in international waters, results in a potent disuasory force available at a short notice in distant regions. The Thon Marine Corp compromises of Thon military fighting forces trained specifically for operating from ships, to land on and capture a section and/or multiple sections of coast-line, deploy from warships, assist with bridge watch-keeping, fire-fighting, ship security, provision of boarding parties to board other vessels, guarding and protecting Thon embassies, coastal or riverine boat patrolling, security of naval bases and to specialize in marine and amphibious war fighting. Thon Marines are trained for use of amphibious equipment that includes landing by hovercraft, landing craft, boat, and amphibious vehicle units on amphibious-support ships and by aircraft units from aircraft carriers or amphibious-support ships. In Thon modern warfare, Marines form an elite force, of highly mobile troops, usually tasked with short rapid deployment and intervention missions; however, some forces are capable also of sustained war fighting missions. The Thon Marines have the capability but not priority to be used as a spearhead for major military offensives or as a stopgap when a military requirement arises, performing military operations until more permanent forces arrive.Thon Marine Capabilities  While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms, as a force it has the unique ability to rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force to almost anywhere in the world within days. The basic structure for all deployed units is a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) that integrates a ground combat component, an air combat component, and a logistics combat component under a common command element. The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an organizational culture centered around the infantry. Every other Marine capability exists to support the infantry. Unlike some Western militaries, the Corps remained conservative against theories proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently. For example, Marine Aviation has always been focused on close air support and has remained largely uninfluenced by air power theories proclaiming that strategic bombing can singlehandedly win wars. This focus on the infantry is matched with the doctrine that \"Every Marine is a rifleman.\" All enlisted Marines, regardless of military specialization, receive training as a rifleman; all officers receive training as infantry platoon commanders. A large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines, particularly the NCOs, (corporals and sergeants), as compared with many other military organizations. The Marine Corps emphasizes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other military services. Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on \"commander's intent\" as a guiding principle for carrying out orders; specifying the end state but leaving open the method of execution. The Thon Marine Corps relies on the Thon Navy for sealift to provide its rapid deployment capabilities. Air-ground task forces Today, the basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size. A MAGTF integrates a ground combat element (GCE), an air combat element (ACE), and a logistics combat element (LCE) under a common command element (CE). A MAGTF can operate independently or as part of a larger coalition. It is a temporary organization formed for a specific mission and dissolved after completion of that mission. The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self-sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms, both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations. The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness of overreliance on its sister services, and towards joint operations in general. A MAGTF varies in size from the smallest, a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), based around a reinforced infantry battalion and a composite squadron, up to the largest, a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which ties together a Division, an Air Wing, and a Logistics Group under a MEF Headquarters Group.Thon Army  Control and operation of the Army is administered by the Department of the Army, one of the eight service departments of the Department of Defense. The civilian head is the Logothete of the Army and the highest-ranking military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff. The Thon Army is made up of two components: the active (Regular Army) component; and the reserve component, the Army National Guard. The National Guard components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month, known as Battle Assembly or Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs), and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the Thon Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state's Praetors. However, the National Guard can be federalized by the Supreme Commander's order but not against the Praetor's wishes or permission. The Thon Army is led by a civilian Logothete of the Army, who reports to the Logothetes tou stratiotikou, and serves as civilian oversight for the Thon Army Chief of Staff. The Thon Army Chief of Staff is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body composed of the service chiefs from each service who advise the Logothetes tou stratiotikou and the Supreme Commander who is the Megas Logothetes, on military matters under the guidance of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Army Mission  The primary responsibilities of the Army are the protection of the state border, combat on land, the security of occupied territories, and the defeat of enemy troops. The Army must be able to achieve these goals both in nuclear war and non-nuclear war, especially without the use of weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, they must be capable of protecting the national interests of the Thon within the framework of its international obligations. Thon Government websites state that the Army's mission is to provide a potent, versatile, and modern Army to promote the security of the Thon and protect its people and interests. Further, the Army's key doctrine publication, The Fundamentals of Land Warfare, states, \"the Army\u2019s mission is to win the land battle\". The main constitutional tasks of today's Thon military are: \u2022 to protect the constitutionally established institutions and the population's democratic freedoms. \u2022 to maintain order and security inside the country. \u2022 to render assistance in the case of natural catastrophes and disasters of exceptional magnitude. \u2022 To defend and achieve victory against foreign military forces \u2022 The training of troops for combat, on the basis of tasks determined by the Armed Forces' General Staff. \u2022 The improvement of troops' structure and composition, and the optimization of their numbers, including for special troops. \u2022 The development of military theory and practice. \u2022 The improvement of operational and combat training of the Ground Forces.Army Equipment/vehicles/weaponry Artillery  Thon upgrade to ATACMS Block III TACMS-P (P = Penetrator)and MGM-168 ATAMCS Block IVA missiles: Heat hardening and reflective coating of the projectiles, which increases the necessary laser exposure time from THEL and airborne laser antimissile defenses. Can also be assisted, aided, and supplemented in guidance and targeting via satellites and other Thon targeting systems, some of which are tied into Thon Naval ships.Tanks  These are Merkava IV tanks, converted for urban warfare. The LIC designation stands for \"Low intensity conflict\", underlining its emphasis on counter-insurgency, street-to-street inner-city asymmetrical type warfare of the 21st century[17]. The Merkava IV LIC is equipped with a turret 12.7 mm caliber coaxial machine gun which enables the crew to lay down fairly heavy cover fire without the use of the main gun, which is relatively ineffective against individual enemy combatants. Like the new remote-operated weapon station, the coaxial machine-gun is fired safely from inside the tank without exposing the crew to small-arms fire and snipers. The most sensitive areas of the tank, its optics, exhaust ports and ventilators, are all protected by a newly-developed high-strength metal mesh, to prevent possibility of explosives charges planted there [18]. Rubber whip pole-markers with LED tips and a driver's rear facing camera have been installed to improve navigation and maneuverability in an urban environment by day or by night. Merkavas IVs that have been fitted with full medical and ambulance capabilities, but retaining their armament. The cabin area has been converted for carrying injured personnel and has had stretchers and life support medical station systems added with a full medical team complement to operate under combat conditions with a Merkava battalion. The vehicle has a rear door to facilitate evacuation under fire, and can provide covering fire. The \"tankbulance\" is not an unarmed ambulance and is not protected by the Geneva Conventions provisions regarding ambulances, but it is far less vulnerable to accidental or deliberate fire than an ambulance.APC's/IFVs  Crew: Commander, Gunner, Loader, driver +8 infantry soldiers Crew total:12 Thon soldiers Because of the front-mounted power pack with its resultant rear space, the Merkava IVB tank can, does and is used to function as the Thon's substitute and place for the roles of APC's and IFVs: The tank is capable of carrying eight infantry soldiers, a Command Group or three litter patients (stretcher casualties) in addition to the tank crew of commander, loader, gunner and driver. In a secondary role as an infantry carrier, the Merkava MKIVB provides a unique solution to the problem of its own protection over closed or infantry and tank-killer infested terrain; it also has the ability to transport infantry groups to vantage points over fire-covered ground with maximum protection. However, in order to carry up to eight men in the rear compartment, part of the ammunition has to be restored in the turret or unloaded before embarkation. As the vehicle is excellently protected by CBR equipment, transportation of infantry over infested areas may be crucial to their survival, in the absence of other suitable vehicles. Last but not least, the capability to take on bailed out tank crews under fire is an extremely powered morale-raiser on the battlefield, and can rapidly restore precious tank crews to action, during the most critical periods of a battle.Air Force  The Thon Air Force (TAF) is the aerial warfare branch of the Thon armed forces and one of the eight uniformed services of the Thon. The Department of the Air Force is headed by the civilian Logothete of the Air Force who heads administrative affairs. The Department of the Air Force is a division of the Thon Department of Defense that is headed by the Logothetes tou stratiotikou head of the Thon Logothete of Defense. The highest-ranking military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Mission In general, the Thon Air Force shall include aviation forces both combat and service not otherwise assigned. It shall be organized, trained, and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive air operations. The Air Force shall be responsible for the preparation of the air forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as otherwise assigned and, in accordance with integrated joint mobilization plans, for the expansion of the peacetime components of the Air Force to meet the needs of war. Thon government defines the purpose of the Air Force as: \u2022 to preserve the peace and security, and provide for the defense, of the Thon, the Territories, Commonwealths, and possessions, and any areas occupied by the Thon; \u2022 to support national policy; \u2022 to help implement national objectives; \u2022 to overcome the airspace, air superiority, and air traffic and control of any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the Thon. \u2022 to have, be, achieve, secure, maintain and dominate the air superiority of all the Thon Islands and their Territories, Commonwealths, and possessions, and any areas occupied by the Thon; With the exception of the massive superairbase Askor Air Base and air bases at Molpadia Military Base, most Thon air bases are either dug in into mountain sides and mountain valleys. This is so they are more easily defenedible and can then only be attacked vertically from directly above since the mountains are protecting it. What air assets that are needed and not near mountains are spaced out, sparse, and camouflaged as can not be identified as air force assets from aerial surveillance, specifically orbital such as this example of a ready to use hangar for homeland air defense housing an air superiority fighter located in the country side off the road. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/214_1489-hangar.jpgThe Thon Air Force in Search and rescue  The National Search and Rescue Plan designates the Thon Coast Guard as the federal agency responsible for maritime search-and-rescue (SAR) operations, and the Thon Air Force as one federal agency jointly responsible for inland SAR. Both agencies maintain Rescue Coordination Centers to coordinate this effort.Thon and Commonwealth Aircraft  Thon military acronym definitions: aircraft designation \"F\" = Fighter aircraft designation \"SF\" = Stealth Fighter aircraft designation \"SB\" = Strike Bomber aircraft designation \"HB\" = Heavy Bomber aircraft designation \"RB\" = Main Bomber aircraft designation \"CF\" = Carrier FighterSpace and Missile Forces Agency  The Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency contributes to the Thon's deterrence through its intercontinental ballistic missile force and plays a vital role tying together and supporting the Thon military worldwide through the use of many different types of satellites and other space operations. On top of this the Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency (SAMFA) goals, mission, purpose, objectives, and directives are: SAMFA's mission is \"To Deliver Trained and Ready military forces with Unrivaled Space Capabilities to Defend the Thon.\" Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency Command makes space reliable to the warfighter (i.e. forces personnel) by continuously improving the command's ability to provide and support combat forces \u2014 assuring their access to space. In addition, the command's ICBM forces deter any adversary contemplating the use of weapons of mass destruction or WMD. SAMFA has eight primary mission areas: Other duties, responsibilities, and tasks are to operate, support, enhance, build, man, guard, maintain, facilitate, develop, and improve the following programs:Moon Base  SAMFA announced it was planning to build a permanent moon base. The goal is to start building a fully functional base, that would allow for crew rotations like the International Space Station and better, more effeciantly controlled refracting, reflecting, and catadioptric radio, X-ray, gamma-ray, Wolter, Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), and infrared telescopes. The moon base has paved and artificially constructed and cleared landing fields and pads along with housing, billeting, dining, refueling, and storage facilities for Thon Space craft. The Moon base is in addition, a facility for internet controlled telescopes that can be used by the common citizen for a fee for given times via the internet which could be seen more clearly than any earth-based telescopes and immune to interruption, overcast and distortion as earth based telescopes are because of the earth's atmosphere. Meteor and anti satellite defense gun installations are installed throughout the installation.Thon Orbital Space Station  The Thon Orbital Space Station along with its Moon Base is The Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency's most expensive and primary effort. The Thon Orbital Space Station is an orbital base and main center or universal satellite so to speak for all space endeavors. The Thon Orbital Space Station or TOSS is the consolidation for the best Thon weather, GPS, communication, defense, telescope, surveillance, espionage, refueling, experimental, bio, and a few commercial satellites into one central based orbital entity for better and more manageable centralized intelligence, maintainability, protection, service, accessibility, uniformity, efficiency, and control. The TOSS is also the refueling, docking, repair, maintenance, unloading and command center point for Thon Spacecraft. The TOSS is this aside from the Thon Moon Base, which is mainly the same except in regards for the moon base not being a command center and the moon base having a few other additions such as a landing field and pad, greater housing, billeting, refueling and storage facilities along with solar panel fields on the moon's surface. A small number of remote Portable Autonomous Debris Removing Item Satellites or PADRIS's for short, are based, and deployed from the TOSS to track and then clean up, de-orbit, collect, neutralize, and eliminate space debris or space junk in all orbits of earth. The Thon Orbital Space Station is a circular two disked rotating structure connected at the center. Command and Control, housing, living, dining, the bridge, observation decks, Special Forces drop pods, lounges, and docking take place on one of the two disks while equipment, machinery, engine, sensor, communication equipment, fuel cells, power generator, and other mechanical, technological and system hardware, machinery and equipment are mainly located in the other disk, which is mainly only accessed for maintenance, upgrades, installations, repairs and inspections.Thon Asteroid Mining Automated Harvester (TAMAH)  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/wctactics38.jpg The Thon Asteroid Mining Automated Harvester or TAMAH is an mining, and exploration space station that traverses the asteroid fields in our solar system and the rings around planets. It includes large quantities and varieties of drilling, mining, explosive and sonar, seismic, and analytical equipment for surveying and harvesting ores and minerals in the solar system. The TAMAH works towards accumulating and gathering valuable materials and securing them to one main asteroid and then attaches various small rockets around that asteroid's exterior. It then sends the loaded asteroid on a collision course towards earth's moon moving on its own inertia while only rarely using its various small rockets for trajectory changes. This form of mineral transportation is cheap and eliminates the need for costly fuel, power drive and shipping requirements that would go with transport by ship and man made transport barges, as well as the cost for return trips back to the TAMAH. The Thon Moon Base supervises the small deceleration and landing of the mineral loaded asteroids and payloads, and deassembles the mineral deposits, metals, ore and attachments to the asteroid attached by the TAMAH. The Thon Moon Base then stores, ships, refines, molds, melts, and assumes authority and responsibility of the minerals from that point to when it transports and ships the harvest to Earth. The TAMAH also works towards accumulating ice and water found throughout the solar system onto asteroids. These \"ice\" asteroids are then slowly set on a collision course on their own inertia towards the moon. The Thon Moon Base does not intervene in these collisions however, except in the possibility of any extremely rare situation where the impact would be in near vicinity of the Thon Moon Base or its trajectory and course needed to be adjusted to safely collide on the moon and/or away from anything. This is done to accumulate greater water resources for Earth and Thon Space Forces but is primarily for eventually establishing a livable environment on the moon, at least capable for the living conditions of small limited vegetation growth on the moon's exposed surface. While capable of automation via the Thon Orbital Space Station, TAMAH has been manned by Thon Space Personnel for the majority of its mining operations to achieve more efficient and profitable turnouts, increased and greater exploration, command and control, and less workload, stress, responsibility, space requirements and hassle to TOSS.Thon Space Claims  OOC [all claims and mentioned celestial bodies here (except space station facilities and that like obviously) do actually exist in reality, its kinda amazing how much is cataloged and discovered already,] The Thon claims and reserves the right to exploit, mine, and colonize any and all bodies within the solar system regardless of other nations claims to them, unless the spacial body whether it be moon, planet, asteroid, orbit, asteroid group or a planets rings is currently being used, utilized, manned, mined, colonized, exploited or will be within 15 years of a nations claim. Otherwise, all unused spacial bodies are subject to exploitation, and mining by the Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency and its TAMAH program. If a nation that is actually capable of a decent space program claims a spacial body and doesn't do anything with it within 15 years, the Thon ignores and does not recognize their claim, and reserves the right to mine, colonize or exploit the spacial body. Currently the Thon claims mining and mineral rights to all of Jupiter's moons and asteroids in its orbit under the radius of 300 KM. This includes all of Jupiters moons with the exceptions of Jupiter's four largest moons: which the Thon do not lay any claim. Other than these four moons the Thon make it a priority to mine and exploit these orbiting moons and/or asteroids classified as Jupiter moons for mineral wealth and fuels as well as storage facilities. The Thon do this because it is safer, cheaper, more cost efficient and effective, controllable and predictable than mining the asteroid belts themselves in the solar system. Essentially the Thon only recognize claims as \"first come first serve,\" not \"first see, find or discover and its yours\". The Thon also claim a large sizable portion of land on the moon for its current moon base there and \"designated asteroid impact zones\" for mineral loaded asteroids sent from the TAMAH to be further exploited, mined and refined at earth. Thon solar panel fields also take up a particulary large portion of land on the moon and because of this, their power and services are shared with any other nation's moon facilites that desire so, taking into account they assist with the maintence and repair costs of the solar panel fields of course. This priority changes if and when any substantial resource is found and specified in the asteroid belt greater than those found in orbit of Jupiter. In the event of such a find, efforts are made for the asteroid to be hurled towards an orbit around Jupiter to consolidate mining and control and prevent thinning of Thon space assets. Once an asteroid or spacial body is striped of all useful resources, usefulness and minerals it is then sent to plummet to Jupiter's surface to clear up its orbit and the planet's skies for more future mineral loaded asteroids to be brought into its orbit for exploitation. Other Thon claims, activities, operations and plans in space which are mostly in the Kuiper belt are the following: make it a great location for a mining, military, and exploration base.Forest and Mountain Rangers  The Forest and Mountain Rangers are the Thon's wildlife and park rangers who keep maintain, patrol, police, safeguard, and preserve Thon's national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. The Rangers specialize in the environment, and search, and rescue. The Rangers patrol, police, safeguard, and preserve the national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges from hunters, poachers, industrial and commercial dumping, and wildfires. Hunting and poaching of certain wildlife in the Thon is punishable by enslavement and then death, if that is, death is not immediate upon capture, prevention or apprehension of suspects. The Rangers track animals, collect data on migration, fertility, birth rates, population, diet and reproduction in efforts to revitalize, increase, and prevent extinction of endangered and critically endangered species. The Forest and Mountain Rangers second main mission is to provide search and rescue, and relief efforts in Thon's wilderness and mountain areas. These duties include providing search and rescue of missing persons and apprehension efforts of escaped prisoners and work jointly with the Thon military in apprehension of military deserters, and lost personnel in the Thon, although as of yet such need has not been necessary. The Forest and Mountain Rangers are the Fish and Wildlife service of the Thon and the primary authority and service for search and rescue of people missing in the Thon's wilderness areas and/or affected from avalanches, mudslides, rockslides, flooding, and earthquakes but not to include tsunamis, hurricanes, and tornadoes. All Forest and Mountain Rangers are proficient in survival training, firefighting, scouting and tracking, environmental stewardship and rifle marksmanship of which every Ranger is assigned a rifle, survival, camping, mountain, and firefighting gear along with their uniforms.Vigiles  The Vigiles or more properly the Vigiles Urbani (\"watchmen of the City\") or Cohortes Vigilum (\"cohorts of the watchmen\") are the firefighters and police of the Thon. Every Vigile is equipped with standard firefighting and personnel protective equipment. The Oath and mission of every Vigile is \"to serve and protect, to conquer any fire and any foe that would danger others no matter the time, place or distance, to serve the people, not to screw the people for it is them I live and work my indebted life for\" All Vigile are trained in first aid, firefighting, general law, self-defense, small-arms marksmanship, bodyguard training, and the value of selfless service. In addition to extinguishing fires, the Vigiles are the police force of Thon. Their duties included traffic control, apprehending thieves, robbers, arsonists, and other criminals as well as protecting and providing security for certain places such as city parks, public events, national monuments, and sometimes even as a security service for governing officials. Vigiles are assigned to their certain municipal districts of which their, authority, housing or billeting, local training, food, upkeep, and some of their benefits is provided and funded by these municipal districts. Vigiles typically live in barracks and dorms in their respective stations of their assignment, but it is up to the local governing body or city to decide on whether they stay in this typical barracks housing or live in other residences such as apartments or housing based on a rent or lease agreement funded by the city or with their family within a set distance of the station. It is the basic training, first aid training, job education, police & firefighting gear, equipment, vehicles and uniforms along with special schools and retirement benefits that the federal government provides to Vigiles. The task of guarding the public baths is added as a duty of the Vigiles as the baths are open during the night. The Vigiles are in fact, considered a military unit. They deal primarily with petty crimes while sedition and more violent crimes such as rapists, murderers, and severe assaults are handled by the Cohortes urbanae whose duties and primary role are to police the Thon and to counteract the roaming mobs and gangs that ever arise. The Cohortes urbanae are the \"Heavy Police\" subgroup entity of the Vigiles in their own authority that cooperate with the Vigiles. They are similar to S.W.A.T. and a punishment enforcing law enforcement group. They react to law violations, not to actively prevent them, except in cases of pursuing serial killers, and repeat offenders and heavily wanted criminals. They are equipped with heavy and powerful weapons and are called in when Vigiles are underpowered to counteract against criminals such as some bank robberies or acts of terrorism, and hostage situations. The Cohortes urbanae carry out the corporal punishment for thievery of which is a public beating, with no governmental medical treatment, and the capital punishment for what few high crimes that death is the penalty. The Vigile duties are to hand over such criminals of severe crimes to the Cohortes urbanae, and to take back thieves and robbers once their punishment has been carried out and ensure they get back to their home safely with no further punishment and in recoverable health.Adygea  Adygea (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d, IPA: [ad\u0268\u0262a:] ; Russian: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u0435\u0301\u044f, IPA: [ad\u0268'\u025feja]; alternatively transliterated as Adygeya or Adyghea), officially the Republic of Adygea, is a country in North Caucasia. It borders Russia to the north and east, Georgia to the south, and the Black and Azov Seas to the west. The city of Maykop is the country's capital. Adygea is a representative democracy, organised as a constitutional semi-presidential federal republic. Adygea is currently a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the World Trade Organization, the North Caucasus Association of Social and Economic Collaboration and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, and seeks integration with the European Union and NATO.History In antiquity  The North-West Caucasus was first inhabited in paleolithic times (around 750,000 years ago). The first settlements appeared approximately 100,000 years ago. Around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, the Maykop Kuban and Dolmen cultures appear. Later, the Dolmens push the Maykopians eastward; the Maykop culture, with influence from the Dolmens, would become the forbearer of Circassian culture. By the second millennium, however, the Dolmens were entirely assimilated by the indigenous Northwest Caucasians. The Maykop culture would ultimately fall to the Sea Peoples by the close of the 12th century. In the 1st millennium BCE, Colchian culture, associated with the Abkhaz, appeared in the Caucasus. During the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age, the Cimmerians, later Alans, and still later the Ossetians, displaced the proto-Circassian tribes in Central Caucasus and founded what is known today as Koban culture. In the 8th century BCE, the Iron Age begins to develop in the Northwest Caucasus, and by the 7th century, proto-Maeotians have set up a rudimentary nation-state, and conduct raids into neighbouring territories. In the 6th century, the first mention of the Maeotians is made. During this time, they establish a more coherent state in the steppes to the north of the Black Sea. The state survives for almost a millennium. Other kindred peoples begin, during this time, to establish states: Kerkets, Achaens, Heniokhs, Toretians, etc. During the 5th century BCE, the Sinds, a people kindred to the Maeots, established Sindika civilization with its capital at Gorgippa. In 480 BCE, a heterogeneous Bosporan kingdom is established. In 64 BCE, the establishment of a Roman dominion on the eastern Black Sea coast is recorded. In 26 AD, Strabo describes the Zyghoys, which name appears for the first time in annals of history and replaces old appellation Kerket. From 100 to 200 AD, the process of supplantation continues: the Sanighs, Abaski and Apsiles replace Heniokhs, their forbears; Zyghoys and Achaens replaced by Zikhis, their descendants, in Roman annals. During the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Goths are established north of the Caucasus, and continually battle with the Circassians, but in 370, the Gothic kingdom is overthrown by the Huns, who, four years later, invade the Caucasus. The hinterland Maeotians remove to the safety of mountains, while those on the Black Sea shore undisturbed. Byzantine fortresses appear on Black Sea coast and Taman Peninsula during this time. Christianity is introduced to some Circassians living on the coastal areas. In the 550s and 560s, the Avars attempt to subjugate the Circassians, but are repulsed. The Avars make no further attempt to control the western Caucasus. The oldest known literary piece of the Adyghe is the Nart Epos.Medieval Adygea  By the 9th century, the Circassians were consolidated into one ethnic and linguistic entity. Circa 1200, the Circassian kingdoms of Adygaza and Kabardia, and the various scattered tribes outside their rule (most notably the Shapshugs), became united under Khevard Sharatko, who established a pan-Circassian nation-state in the North Caucasus, with its capital at Labinsk. Further conquests would lead to a broad and long-standing sphere of influence across the area between the Black and Caspian Seas, which established an alliance with the kingdom of Georgia to its south. The Adyghe people prospered in the Forecaucasus area in that time, and the period between 1200 and 1250 is sometimes known in Adyghe literature as the Golden Age of the Northern Caucasus or the Renaissance of the Adyghe. This period of prosperity, however, was short-lived, and much like the kingdom's ally to the south, Georgia, Adygea was also conquered by the Mongols in 1253. Thereafter, different local rulers fought for their independence from central Adygean rule, until the total disintegration of the Kingdom in the 15th century. Neighbouring kingdoms exploited the situation and from the 16th century onward, the Ottoman Empire subjugated the region of Adygea (the Persian Empire briefly controlled the area from around 1550 and 1570, but were pushed out by Ottoman advances). The rulers of regions which remained partly autonomous organised rebellions on various occasions. Subsequent Persian and Turkish invasions further weakened local kingdoms and regions.War with Russia  During the years between 1764 and 1864, the Adyghe, along with other Western Karbadian tribes, fought Russian expansion into their area. The Circassians were able to resist Tsarist campaigns against them until May of 1864, when the allied forces of Adygea lost to Russian troops at Kabadaa near Sochi (Later renamed to Krasnaya Polyana its present russian name). After their defeat, a large number of the conquered were deported to the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, after a series of uprisings against Imperial rule, an event that rings sorely with the Circassians as a whole, even in modern times. Adygea was officially incorporated into the Russian Empire on 21 May 1864 with a Russian troops parade at Kabadaa (Krasnaya Polyana) symbolising the end of the Russo-Circassian war. Until this date, 21 May became to be marked as a day of mourning for all Circassian communities spread around in diaspora or in homeland.Brief independence and Soviet Adygea  After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Adygeans declared themselves independent and established the Democratic Republic of Adygea, led by a Menshevik, Yevgeniy Kanisev. However, in December of 1920, Adygea was attacked by the Red Army, and despite the efforts of Mensheviks and Adyghe sympathisers to stave off the conquest, the opposition was overwhelmed\u2014most fled to Italy (the descendants of whom would later serve in the Second World War on the Axis side), while a small number surrendered and were later executed. The Adyghe SSR was established on July 27, 1921, as part of the Soviet Union. At that time, Krasnodar was the administrative centre. It was renamed Adyghe (Cherkess) SSR on August 24, 1921, soon after its creation. The Soviet Socialist Republic was a part of the short-lived Transcaucasian SFSR from 12 March 1922 to 5 December 1936. Following the dissolution of the former SFSR, the name was changed back to Adyghe SSR in July of 1928, and the capital moved to Maykop.Independence and modern times  Shortly after the August Coup, on 22 September, 1991, the Adyghe National Front was formed, which advocated secession from the Soviet government, following the independence movements of other Soviet republics. The Front declared itself to be the successor to the Soviet government and announced the independence of the Adyghe SSR, renamed the Republic of Adygea, from the USSR on 14 October, 1990. The state's independence went unrecognised by the Soviet Union until September of 1991. In May of 1995, a national constitution was signed in to law. Elections for the presidency resulted in the previous Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Adyghe SSR, Aslan Dzharimov, becoming the President. He appointed Nikolay Pedan as his Prime Minister, who was confirmed a day later by the State Council.Politics and government  The head of government in Adygea is the President, who is elected for a five-year term. The current President is Lyov Bacherikov (since January 13, 2007), succeeding Hazret Sovmen. There is also a directly elected State Council (Khase), which comprises the Council of Representatives and the Council of the Republic. Both Councils are elected every five years and have 68 deputies each. The Prime Minister of Adygea is appointed by the President with the consent of the National Assembly. The current Prime Minister of Adygea is Dmitriy Jaikbaev (since September 16, 2006). The republic's Constitution was adopted on May 14, 1995. Ethnic tension is a considerable problem in the republic; the Union of Slavs of Adygea was formed after the Republic's independence to combat discrimination against Slavic inhabitants, while the Adyge Khase was formed to promote Adyghe involvement in the government.Foreign relations  While Adygea has been willing to work with NATO in recent years, such as cooperating in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, it also retains significant ties to Russia, which have been strained of late. Of primary concern is Russian economic pressure, which some analysts claim is indicative of Russia trying to get Adygea back in to its sphere of influence. Disagreements about nuclear weapons, gas and oil prices and contracts, and in general a policy of cooperation with Atlantic states have contributed to a rocky and tense association with the Russian Federation.Administrative divisions  Adygea is divided into 31 federal regions: The federal rayons are: Giaginsky, Koshekhablsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Maykopsky, Shovgenovsky, Takhtamukaysky, Teuchezhsky, Abinsky, Anapsky, Apsheronsky, Beloglinsky, Gulkevichsky, Primorsko-Akhtarsky, Bryukhovetsky, Korenovsky, Ust-Labinsky, Tbilissky, Kurganinsky, Mostovsky, Tuapsinsky, Temryuksky, Dinskoy, Timashyovsky, Seversky, Krymsky, Novokubansky, Kavkazsky and Uspensky. The federal rayons are further subdivided into\u00a0?? okrugs. Districts under jurisdiction of republics are: Adyge-Khablsky, Karachayevsky, Khabezsky, Malokarachayevsky, Prikubansky, Urupsky, Ust-Dzhegutinsky, Zelenchuksky, Baksansky, Chegemsky, Chereksky, Elbrussky, Leskensky, Maysky, Prokhladnensky, Tersky, Urvansky, Zolsky, Alagirsky, Ardonsky, Digorsky, Irafsky, Kirovsky, Mozdoksky, Pravoberezhny and Prigorodny. Cities under federal or republic jurisdiction are: Maykop (f), Krasnodar (f), Labinsk (f), Anapa (f), Gelendzhik (f), Tuapse (f), Goryachy Klyuch (f), Slavyansk-on-Kuban (f), Belorechensk (f), Sochi (f), Novorossiyk (f), Cherkessk (r), Karachayevsk (r), Nalchik (r), Baksan (r) and Vladikavkaz (r).Geography  Adygea encompasses the western part of the Forecaucasus and a part of the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus. Geographically, the area is split by the Kuban River into two distinct parts, with the Don crossing through the country's northern territory. The southern, seaward third (historically known as Circassia) is the western extremity of the Caucasus range, lying within the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex ecoregion; the climate is Mediterranean or, in the south-east, subtropical. The northern two-thirds lies on the Pontic Steppe and shares continental climate patterns. The largest lake is Abrau in the wine-making region of Abrau-Dyurso. Several zones of nature conservation have been established in Adygea: the Caucasian State Biosphere Reserve; a number of unique natural monuments; and \"Mountainous Adygea\" National Park, which is under construction.Economy  Adygea's economy is mostly centred around the fishing, agricultural, chemical, manufacturing and petroleum industries. Logging, mining (gold, silver, tungsten, iron, bauxite, coal, magnesium and others), power generation, construction and metal-working are important second- and third-tier sectors. There is, as well, a growing interest in the electronics and information technology sectors. Local agriculture focuses primarily on livestock, especially sheep and goats (hogs are somewhat less popular), and the cultivation of grains, fruit, and cotton. Since the late 1990s, Adygea has made it a priority to slash inflation and boost the economy, which has resulted in a comparatively strong currency and a fairly high per-capita income, although the income balance is skewed in favour of urban populations. Even so, the standard of living in many Adygean communities has noticeably improved since the August coup.Transport  The federal government's Ministry of Transport handles much of the republic's rail lines and major highways (six lanes or more), while regional-level subministries handle local roads and highways up to four lanes, and control harbour access. A network of highways, largely centred on Maykop and Krasnodar, spans number kilometres, while the country's rail network runs a total of number kilometres. There is an international airport in Maykop (ICAO airport code UGKM), as well as another in Krasnodar and Sochi, and a regional airport in Anapa. Adygea possesses only a partially-developed system of transport, being adequate in some areas and inadequate in others (most equipment is in need of repair, update or both). To address this, the MoT has begun a large-scale project, known as 'Project: Connection', scheduled through 2012.Military  After the collapse of Soviet Union, Adygea inherited a military force of approximately\u00a0? soldiers on its territory. That number has decreased over seven years to approximately\u00a0? soldiers. In 1991, there was effectively no Adygean Navy, but in recent times the Adygean government has worked to acquire two corvette-sized ships and several patrol boats to bolster its ability to defend against a ship-borne invasion. Following its independence, Adygea declared itself a neutral state. The country had limited military partnership with Russia and other CIS countries and has had a partnership with NATO since 1995. In the 2000s, Adygea was leaning toward NATO, and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by NATO-Adygea Integration Plan signed in 2002. As of 2006, this issue is a subject of extensive debate within Adygea as to whether the country should join NATO.Demographics  According to the 2006 Adygean census, about 72.6% of Adygeans are ethnic Adyghe, out of Adygea's population of 5,321,472. Other ethnic groups include Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Kabardins, Balkars, Ossetians, Karachays, Chechens, Jews, Ubykh, Cherkess, Abazins, Nogais and Ingush, as well as a small percentage that identified as 'other'. Adygea also represents considerable linguistic diversity. Within the Adyghe branch of Circassian (itself a branch of the Northwest Caucasian languages), there are several dialects, including Abzekh, Adamey, Bzhedugh, Hatukuay, Kemirgoy, Makhosh, Natekuay, Shapsugh, Zhane and Yegerikuay. Kabardian has its own dialects, as well; the other branch, Abkhaz-Abazan, including Abaza, Abkhaz and Ubykh language, is widely spoken in the south-east. Other languages, such as Ossetian, Chechen and Yiddish are also widespread. In the early 1990s, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, separatist movements in Kabardino-Balkaria broke out, resulting in ethnic cleansing of Adyghe and Kabardin, whereas the former had constituted 38% of the population. Many Ossetians who had left Georgia came to North-West Ossetia, some to campaign for independence there. Of the many Ingush and Chechens who had been forcibly relocated, only a few returned to Adygea, but a significant portion of Balkars and Karachays did make the trip. Today most of the population practices Orthodox Christianity of the Adygean Orthodox Church (73%). The religious minorities include Armenian Apostolic Church (13.6%), Muslim (9.3%), Russian Orthodox Church (1.8%) and Roman Catholic (1.1%). 0.9% of the population declared themselves adherents of other religions, and 0.3% declared themselves atheist or agnostic.Culture  Adygebze (Adyghe language) is a member of the North-West Caucasian group of Caucasian languages. Along with the Russian language, the Adyghe language is the state language of Adygea. There are about a hundred of social, political and religious associations, movements and parties of Adygea, and veteran, youth and women organizations in Adygea. Adygea attaches considerable importance to its culture and education. The Adyghe Pedagogical Institute was reorganized into Adyghe State University, and a new higher educational establishment, Maykop State Technological Institute, was opened in 1997. Post-graduate doctoral programs were opened in the higher educational establishments, where academic councils work. There are eight state-supported and twenty-three local museums in Adygea. The National Museum of the Republic of Adygea, in Maykop, owns unique archaeological, ethnographic and nature collections. A special section dedicated to the life of Adyghe diaspora was opened. The most ancient monument of the Adyghe culture is the Nart Epic. It reflects the people's idea of the world on the early stage of human community development, their occupations, ethic standards, philosophical ideas, legends, customs and peculiarities of their way of life. Sixty-six sportsmen of Adygea are members of Adygean united teams in eighteen kinds of sport. The female handball team of Adyghe State University were awarded bronze medals in the Super League Championship of Russia in 1999. The annual cycle race \"Friendship of North Caucasus Peoples\" has been held since 1992. Its route runs through the following cities: Maykop - Krasnodar - Stavropol - Cherkessk - Pyatigorsk - Nalchik - Vladikavkaz. The rafting contest \"InterRally-Belaya\", also promoting the ideas of peace and friendship among peoples of Russia and the Caucasus, takes place in Adygea every spring. The territory of the Republic is considered to be the zone of combined tourism. It has considerable hunting resources.Science and technology  The republic is the home of what was the largest telescope of the world when it was built: a very large radiotelescope (600 meters in diameter), located on the bank of the Zelenchuk river, between the villages of Zelenchukskaya and Arkhyz. Rostov-on-Don is the home of the Astrophysical Observatory of the Adygean Academy of Science, dedicated to the study of astronomy.Miscellaneous topics External links Commonwealth of Rodarion civil war. Civil war 2002-2008.\u00a0\u00a0  The war began with the collapse of equality in the Commonwealth, then the Unity council gave alot more\u00a0privileges to Rodarion. Even Rodarions saw the flaw in this. On the 28th june 2002, the Kamarans launched a full rebellion against the Unity council, followed by the Kalarians and finally by the Romar.\u00a0Commonwealth of Rodarion Civil war\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  28th june 2002- 13th\u00a0July 2008\u00a0 Result:\u00a0 Armistice signed, Collapse of the Unity council, war crime trials, rise of Kadar.Billigerants  Rodarion coalition:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eastern union:\u00a0\u00a0 The begining of the end\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  It all began with the lightened taxes on Rodarion, the rest of the Commonwealth was in up roar, the Unity council's idea of making it better was decreasing the price of fuel, but this lead to fuel shortage, causing more anger. The Romar suffered the most with the price drop, thousands became unemployed with oil companies unable to pay the wages and upkeep. So riots began to happen, all over the Commonwealth, even in Rodarion. \u00a0 With the riots getting more violent, the Council announced it was bringing back the death penalty, to stem the amount of dissidents. This simply fueled the anger of the population, a bomb went off outside a bank in Calnera a major city in Rodarion, no one was hurt but it was a message that the people where desperate. by late 2001 13,463,924 people where unemployed, the whole eastern edge of the Commonwealth went on Strike; Ilmari, Kamara, Romar, Aluria, Bolaria and Limaria. 38 million people on strike. It was the biggest smack in the face for Council. In resonse they deployed the army to deal with the dissident movements. When the army entered Kolara the capital of Kamara, they found hell of earth, the citizens were already fighting the\u00a0police for control of the streets.\u00a0On 6th\u00a0august\u00a02001 a man who lost his job due to the\u00a0petrol\u00a0cost reduction and his family,\u00a0walked up\u00a0to a police checkpoint and opened fire with a stolen\u00a0LA80 killing 7 officers. This sent shockwaves all over the Commonwealth.\u00a0Seeing the\u00a0army's presance wasnt\u00a0helping the council gave full responsebility of the military to the Rodarion. This infuriated the Kamarans and the Kamaran rep, Ular hejera who then threatened to tell the Commonwealth the dirty secrets the councilors. He was shot by the NDR. He was replaced with a alcholic Kamaran politician so he wouldnt complain.\u00a0 On 12th august the largest riot in Commonwealth history took place in Kolara, 549,600 people took to the streets, the police couldnt do anything, the army however where given a order to retain control anymeans necessary. The commander a highly rascist Alurian, ordered the troops\u00a0to\u00a0open fire on the crowd,\u00a0316 people where killed, 1,352 people where injurded. After that, the riots subsided. The cities where quiet, not many people went outside. The Commonwealth was dead. But it was simply the calm before the storm.War  On the 2nd of november 2001 a\u00a0bomb went off outside the\u00a0Home office, killing 38\u00a0including the Home secretry. The NDR launched a full scale investigation into the bombing, they soon\u00a0discovered that\u00a04\u00a0new terrorist groups were active in Kamara\u00a0and Romar. The council now ordered the NDR and the army to hunt down and eliminate all of the groups. on the 3rd and 5th\u00a0two car bombs went off outside different government\u00a0departments, killing 105 people in total.\u00a0The council realised it was loosing control, even the Rodarion military\u00a0showed signs of\u00a0ressentment.\u00a0 And on the 10th of november a Romar\u00a0terrorist driving a petrol tanker, broke through the Blackhall checkpoint and drove straight into Commonwealth assembly building. Killing 1/2 the Unity council and 154 other people. That was the final straw for the Rodarion. disobeying the Council. It ordered the Army to sieze control of Kamara and Romar. The army took\u00a0over the Kamaran commision building. And held the Kamaran administration hostage, demanding that all terrorist groups surrender. One group gave up. A month went by without any violence. The council couldnt stop the Rodarion administration from protecting its people, since they took the full force of the bombings. The council split in two. one half all the members that werent affected by the current situation, on the other, the eastern countries who suffered the most from the situation. Then on 1st january 2002 the Kamaran home guard launched a full assualt on Kolara, the battle lasted 6 hours. The Rodarion\u00a0army, was forced out with severe causulties, around 60% losses. Soon the whole of Karmara was liberated by the home Guard. The next day the Romar miltia rebelled also freeing themselves.  The Council collapsed, the Commonwealth army split in two. The war Began.The first few months  \u00a0Within the first month, two factions arose; the Rodarion coalition and the Eastern union. The Rodarion\u00a0Coalition hoped to maintain its superior hold over the other countries, the other nations apart of the RC where those who thought that the council was doing a good job and wanted to stay the same way. The EU\u00a0was the opposite, seeing that they where suffering from the Councils delusions, they united to bring down the Council and set up a more democratic form of government. The two fought small skirmishes at first along thier boarders. Then the exoduses began. All eastern citizens fled London, Calnera, Libris, Omeron for the Eastern union, fearing the Rodarion and Kalarian growing xenophobic ways. 2.5 million people fled all at the sametime causing mass disruption to the western cities. The newly appointed Coalition chairman stated \"good ridons, no uses apart from filling the zoos, savages\". This was the biggest example of the collapse of the unity all the member states shared, for the past 4 years they all lived togeather in harmony.\u00a0 On the 25th of Febuary, the EU launched a full scale invasion of the RC. 2.7 million men, 21,000 tanks, 16,000 guns, 300 jets where all sent to the front.  The RC\u00a0army was caught completely off guard, the EU made 45 km a day with little to none resistance.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Within a month the EU had reached centre of Ilmar. The RC then annouced the Emergancy arms proticol, all men at the age of 14-55 will be consrcipted into the army. 3,650,200 men where ready within a week. The counter attack began on the 11th of March, the largest army ever in Commonwealth history was sent into the sights of one of the most heavily armed armies in History. The RC had the men, technology and weapons. The EU on the otherhand had the Morale, Tanks and Tactians. Leading the EU army was General Lio Gera. A Kamaran man who was the most decorated in the military, against him was the Rodarion commander kilal, a highly rascist but strategic man, who was a expert at urban warfare, his orders about prisoners would condem him for life. And Andari general Mera a excellent tank commander, who would play a great role after the war.Battle of Emera city  The first major battle of the war took place in Emera city, the capital of Ilmar. On the 1st may the guns of the 118th artillery regiment\u00a0of the Rodarion army, opened fire on the city, bombarding it for 2 whole days.11,235 people died in the first bombardment, but the city's defenders didnt move. 3rd of may the lead elements of 3rd armoured and 15th infantry legion entered the city from the south, the EU\u00a0suffered at least 12% losses trying to hold the southern suburb from the Rodarion.  On the 4th the Klidari 67th shock division took the western factory district. The city was split in two. 5th-7th the EU\u00a0fought hard defending the mid-city, suffering heavy losses, 21% in total now, 12,342 died. The RC was suffering losses too, by the 7th they had lost around 4,575 men taking the city. They hadnt even made it to the city center yet. 10th of may. The Commanding officer of the EU forces in the city, recived word that renforcements couldnt get to him since, the enitre front was under attack, no forces could be spared. He then ordered his men to fight to the death. 11th the 3 RC armies meet just out side the city center. That midday they moved in,\u00a0only to find hell on earth, 25,300 fanatical EU\u00a0troops ordered to fight to the death. Mines, RPGs, MG26s and\u00a0SAMS. The streets were wider but where packed full of abandoned\u00a0vehicles. Great cover\u00a0for\u00a0the men but where blown up by the RPGS.\u00a0To soften the resistance, RC commander Elar ordered a PH1\u00a0type airstrike, within minuets 12\u00a0Griffin jets\u00a0dropped 500 phoenix incedinary bombs, the city centre went up in flames. It burned for 6 whole days, before they died down enough for the advance to continue. No one knows how many died during the PH1 attack some say 500 men, some say 4,000. There are exact reports on the strike. However it wasnt a complete sucsess, the fighting was fierce even in the smouldering ruins of the skyscrapers. After 2 days the city fell. Out of the 123,000 EU troops defending the city, only 143 where taken prisoner, 435 fled before the end. The EU officer was never heard from again, along with the rest of the army. 14,562 RC troops died in the most bloodiest and destructive battles of the war so far.The big push  After the costly but important victory at Emera city, the RC pushed the EU back by 150 miles in a week. Thier objective, occupy the entire EU and restore control. \u00a0  However they were up for a huge fight. \u00a0Operation rapture was the Big push's techincal name. The operation was going well for 5 months straight, the EU was pushed back at every battle. Outnumbered, out gunned, technologically backward, things look grim for the EU. However cracks started appearing in the RC's tactics, their supply lines where limited and they where running out of ammo in most battles, seeing this the EU\u00a0withdrew to center of Kamara itself hoping to defend until the RC ran out of men. And dug in. small counter attacks at random points caught the RC off guard and small gains were made. A very important one happened on 15th October a small task force of around 10,000 EU troops gained a beachhead on Klidar island. (iceland on the map) This gave them access to the Rematha\u00a0Airbase, the\u00a0largest in\u00a0the Commonwealth. The\u00a0chairman demanded that the\u00a0beachhead be taken\u00a0back and kick all EU forces of the island.\u00a0 But the EU was dug in deep and they could take it back.\u00a0So chairman Femar\u00a0ordered the airbase to be left alone, a\u00a0grave mistake.\u00a0 Soon Operation rapture met\u00a0the Iron wall. And all RC advances stopped.\u00a0The EU line held for\u00a02 months. The RC launched\u00a0offensive after offensive,\u00a0only gaining 2 miles at\u00a0least.By\u00a0March 2003 the RC gave up and dug in themselves to replenish supplies and treat the wounded.\u00a0  \u00a02003-2005  For the next year nothing happened. A mile gap\u00a0lay between the two lines,\u00a0 it was called \"Hells corridor\". Around 1,432,684 soldiers had died in total by now. The RC had control of almost the whole commonwealth, only Kamara, Bolaria and parts of Aluria remained under the EU, no signs of a peace treaty were in sight, some said it would be over by chrisathlar (Visari version of christmas). But these hopes never became reality, instead it was the eary wait during the peaceful silence during 2003 that drove people mad. The begining of 2004 saw the war resume, the RC was under new leadership after Chairman Femar was shot dead at a ball in london by a assassin. He was replaced by jonar Kedi. A more torlerant man, more open to suggestion and input by Rodarion commanders. Spring 2003 the EU launched a massive offensive in Aluria, the most sucsess they had since the start of the war. They called it Operation typhoon, since thier advance was quick but costly.Battle of Helari plains  The battle of the Helari plains took place early summer 2003. It was the RC's first counter-attack against the EUin 2004. Around 750,000\u00a0men were used in the offensive, at first they\u00a0crossed the gap\u00a0in southern Kamara. They launched PH1\u00a0strike over and over again. On the\u00a01st of\u00a0September they attacked.\u00a0\u00a0  The 112th infantry and \u00a081st shock infantry went in first, encountering heavy resistance. They soon found it difficult to advance because of the Infantry posistions all along the valley floor and along the slopes. The 45th armoured went in to assist them, helping them a great deal.The challenger 2 tanks,\u00a0rolled over the EU units. When they bumped into\u00a0the T-90 tanks, it was a massacre.\u00a0 Of the\u00a0250 EU tanks that were at the battle, 3 survived. 1 challenger\u00a0was lost. This was the obivous example of rodarion technological superiorness over the EU.\u00a03rd of september the\u00a0EU line was breached and they were\u00a0seperated and cut off from\u00a0each other.\u00a0 The battle was going well for RC, they had surrounded\u00a0several EU divisions, and have\u00a0pushed the main defense back. It was only a matter of time until the surrounded units surrended.\u00a0\u00a0The 81st infantry along with the 45th amoured pushed forward as the 112th dealt with the retreating troops.  This is the only recorded moment in the Commonwealth that a army has gunned down fleeing troops. The RC men opened fire, with tanks, RPGs, assault rifles even gunships. 3,619 EU men where shot dead trying to get away from the advancing RC troops. The wounded ones where just shot as the RC moved on. Its proven that there was no order for them to open fire, but the Colonel of the 112th thought it was for the best. He would be executed for war crimes. 10th of september, the valley had almost fallen.\u00a0The RC had sent 12,000 extra men to help the with the battle, due to this the EU forces where outnumbered 14-1. So they retreated out of the valley to Jalar the Kamaran 2nd city.\u00a0Siege of Jalar\u00a0\u00a0  The siege offically began on 31st of november 2004, with the city being bombed by air and artillery units. Since the city had a river running through it, the bridges where usually the main targets but only two where every fully destroyed. The RC sent 1.4 million men to take it, if they should it would be a huge blow to the morale of the EU. The river that runs through the city, happens to run down the enitre front, the river merovus is the only thing stopping the RC advancing even more. For the next month, all the bridges along the river were destroyed by the EU. Jalar was bombarded and the RC and EU\u00a0ranks where refilled. Seeing the RC couldnt cross anywhere apart from Jalar. They fortified thier side of the river. They turned thier side into a fortress. 25th of december chrisathlar day, it was the 4th time the war wasn't over by, most of the population believed the war would never end and that it would just stalemate. 26th, the move into jalar came, RC orders; secure the half of the city on our side. It was simple secure half\u00a0a city, it wasnt. Like Emera it was defended to the last man. But this would be a more bloodier battle. The 135th Romar miltia and 7th Kamaran infantry where defending the city, the 7th on the RC side. The RC sent in the now experienced 15th infantry legion. The 18th amoured, 322nd mechinized legion and the 12th infantry legion. The EU had 956,000 men against 1,450,000 RC veterans. But General Gera was commanding them, a huge tactical advantage.\u00a0 26th 3.15pm. The battle began, the 15th entered the ruined city, already under light fire. Thier first objective secure the small aiport, so they can receive supplies and renforcements. The 12th and 18th came in from the south-west, tasked with the suburbs and the 322nd from the North-west, tasked with taking the Basilica. \u00a0  The actuall fighting began on the 27th. With heavy street to building fighting, usually the RC infantry would use the tanks for cover and supress and then the tanks would destroy the building. It was very affective but slow. by midnight on the 28th, the western side had almost fallen. But\u00a0the last pocket of resistance wouldnt be destroyed, they stuck to thier posistions. The airport fell around 1.30am 29th giving the RC the much needed supplies and medical care. The small pocket fell late afternoon on the 28th. The RC now controlled the enitre western half of the Commonwealth. However the battle cost them dearly, 236,471 men died and 2,453 tanks were destroyed and 4 jets were shot down. The mostly costly battle for the RC in the war so far.2005-2006  By now the EU had realised it couldnt win the war. It won very small isolated battles but all major important battles they lost. The death toll was rising, there where even reports of sporadic attacks on farming villages in Aluria and southern Kamara, all were dismissed by the Rodarion.\u00a0They also realised that they would fall within 1 year at the rate they are losing men and battles, the life expectancey of a EU\u00a0soldier was just 3 weeks. Very dire indeed, since they had trouble recruiting without distablising the food production. They began rationing food to see if they could free men to join the army, it only gave them\u00a0a few thousand men. The Rodarion also realised that they would be victorious. However they realised that the final battle would be to take Kolara, but it would cost them. The advanced A.I\u00a0unit called Icarus discovered that if the RC sent in 3.7 million men to take the city, it would cost them 1.3 million taking it.\u00a0The\u00a0Unity council demanded it, saying\u00a0that the city\u00a0will burn\u00a0for the east's treason against us.\u00a0Seeing\u00a0that the Council put themselves before the Commonwealth, the majority of the Rodarion and \u00a0Kalarian adminstrations thought it best the council not be in control should they be victorious. But in secret during early 2005 a Rodarion general and the Coalition chairman Kedi were plotting the downfall of the Council and end to the war. They chose this also because a NDR agent gave the Chairman a letter full of all the Councils dark deeds. The whole of 2005 was peaceful no gunshots at all. The Ministry of records worked with the EU to determine the\u00a0toll, by mid 2005 it stood at 4,567,233 dead,10,476,982 injurded,\u00a03,341,521 missing. The rebuilding process never began until after the war, so 2005 was very quiet. The EU was in suspense waiting for its downfall to come anyday. They spent the time, building defences and preparing for the final battle. However there was a special operation planned for 2007 that would change the course of Commonwealth history forever. \u00a0\u00a0 Start of 2006 the RC began bombarding the east side of the river at random points, for morale testing. Usually they didnt kill anyone. The RC spent most of the time waiting for orders, but the commanders were about to destroy the Council.11th December 2006. the \"night of Burning gold\"\u00a0  On the 11th of december 2005 the 2nd Infantry legion marched into blackhall and golden lanes. The heart of the Council. At 9.12pm the soldiers went into every building and killed every single moving thing they could find. By 11.34pm 612 people were killed including the enitre Unity coucil. Golden lanes the offical government housing district was burnt to the ground. hense the name \"night of burning gold\". The enitire Commonwealth cheered at the death of the most corrupt government it had ever heard or experienced. The council was replaced by the Prime minister who was now the offical head of state. The Commonwealth's first Prime minister was rightfully Jonar Kedi. So the decisions on wether to offer a peace treaty was the new RC\u00a0parliment decision.\u00a0\u00a0  The begining of 2007 was rather quiet, with the elimination of the Unity council, the RC's aggressive tones dialed down and officals of both sides now started to negotiate. But of course the war had to continue. The RC was 85 miles away from Kolara. between them and victory was 1,295,500 EU men, ready to die for thier beliefs. RC generals knew the battle to come would cost them dearly. But they had thier orders and on the 13th of march the RC began the offensive. 3 million men. pushed into the EU stronghold, taking extreame causaties, some 87,586 men died in the first week, only taking 13 miles. The RC generals were shocked at the effictiveness of the EU defense. with growing causalties and litte gain the generals began asking each\u00a0other wether they can win this war. But the Prime minister conviced them that the losses were necessary for the Commonwealth. 3 weeks into the offensive. 346,212\u00a0RC men\u00a0had died and where 13 miles outside the capital. 124,605 RC men\u00a0had died for the first time in the war they had lost less men than the RC. A great morale booster.\u00a0 The seige of Kolara never actually began during\u00a0the war.\u00a0The\u00a0RC\u00a0generals were hoping they wouldnt have to. The troops wanted to end the war knowing that\u00a0if they went into the city\u00a0and took it, they probably wouldn't come out again. However the city was bombarded\u00a0by artillery\u00a0every other weekend until august.\u00a0The battle\u00a0of London\u00a0 \u00a0  The\u00a0battle of London was a suprise raid by the EU on the RC capital. It was a attack that would force the RC to pull some troops back to Rodarion. (Great britain on the map including ireland) 60,000 of the EU's best troops were sent to bring havoc to London, either causing peace talks or the RC pulls troops back from the front, reliving the pressure on Kolara. The battle 21st June-13th July. Was rather long considering the circumstances, 60,000 EU veterans vs 125,000 Home guard troops.\u00a0 The battle began with a perscion airstrike on Londons powerstations and power supply. The city was in complete blackout. 2nd phase the entire east coast of Rodarion was hit by a EMP. knocking out the radar and airbases, dening the RC any chance of noticing the 250 sized air group of fighter jets and transport planes racing towards them. At 9.45pm Londoners found themselves in complete darkness as power could not be restored. Hospitals were also having power problems. Thier lights were flickering on and off continously.\u00a09.47pm 188 herculaese opened thier ramps and 60,000 paratroopers jumped out onto the city below. The jets that were escorting the transports were given targets to destroy within the city.\u00a0Ministries, Police headquaters, Central Command even militry accadmies.\u00a0 As soon as they landed the city was in hell. People were screaming and panicing,\u00a0mainly to the sound of explosions and hundreds of jets in the sky.\u00a0The paratroopers found it easy to group up into thier squads due to the good planning.\u00a0 9.50pm. The\u00a0Home guard mobalized in the\u00a0city, heading straight\u00a0for the landing\u00a0zones, the AA units couldnt fire due the\u00a0EMP,\u00a0SAAMS couldn't lock on, so the skies where in the EU hands.\u00a0 The\u00a0Home guard was ambushed in thier own city\u00a0over and over\u00a0again. they were forced out of\u00a0westminster completely. The financial district came\u00a0under heavy attack.\u00a0 several buildings were hit by stray missles fired by the EU jets. The paratroopers soon took control of the city centre\u00a0and moved out towards the suburbs. But they found difficult as the\u00a0Home guard was fully armed\u00a0and ready. The Prime minister and Cabinet were safe in Coldarn, the Rodarion version of NORAD. The Home guard couldnt call for reinforcements due to the EMP. They were alone. So the defence of the city was up to the Home guard colonel. Colonel Radek was a history teacher before he was forced to join the Home guard. However his knowledge of old tactics helped order the troops.  22nd june. The city was evacuated by the Home guard but 2 million citizens were still trapped in the city, most would die due to the collateral damage. The city\u00a0was held like a ring, the Home guard controlled the outskirts and several mid city districts and the Paratroopers held the center in the shape of a circle. Althought the paratroopers were outnumbered they easierly held the home guard off, since they were veterans of the war and the Home guard were ordinary men given weapons and 3 months training. 24th. Communications were restored and the word was sent out that London was under siege. Home guard units from Calnera and Libris were sent to reinforce the defenders. 30,000 extra troops arrived in London on the 26th. \u00a0 With the extra troops came tanks and heavy weapons, this gave the Home guard the ability to advance into the city. The fighting became heavier on the 28th as the Home guard push hard against the Paratroopers. Thousands of Home guardsmen died, since the lack of training and weapon experience. But the Paratroopers were forced back, but they inflicted severe causalties. On the 1st july the 346th infantry legion arrived to help the Homeguard. It was the first proper military unit to\u00a0fight in\u00a0London.\u00a0The odds against the Paratroopers dropped to\u00a0the point they faced defeat. But they fought on.\u00a0By the\u00a03rd they\u00a0were still in control of the city center but\u00a0were suffering losses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the 10th\u00a0the Paratroopers\u00a0had 53,684 men left against\u00a0341,750\u00a0RC troops. Around 32,856\u00a0Home guard had died. 86,773 civillians had also died.\u00a0 Seeing the destruction being caused\u00a0on\u00a0London the RC sent a peace offer to the\u00a0EU. Also a reason seeing that in\u00a02 days it had to take Kolara to save\u00a0London.\u00a0The offer arrived in the hands of the EU admin on the 12th. They\u00a0then announced the ceasefire\u00a0on the 13th. The war had ended.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The end of the war  The 13th of july 2007 marked the end of the war. It lasted 5 long years and claimed millions of lives. It has destroyed almost\u00a064% of the\u00a0entire\u00a0Commonwealth. London was in ruins, the Unity council were\u00a0murdered, genocide in the kamaran\u00a0countryside and the RC was\u00a0completely broke. The\u00a0Commonwealth didnt unite after the ceasefire,\u00a0it remained split\u00a0for another 2 months as the new constitution\u00a0was drawn up.\u00a0The total causalties:\u00a0 8,808,362 dead\u00a0 12,351,746 wounded\u00a0 2,773,541 missing\u00a0 The war however did show that\u00a0each\u00a0nation need the Commonwealth to suvive\u00a0and\u00a0that each had its own speaciality that\u00a0helped another, this lead to the\u00a0hive like constitution.\u00a0 Niether side said who won or\u00a0lost, they both decided it was a\u00a0stalemate, however\u00a0the EU had lost the most amount of life\u00a0and suffered the most destruction, The RC on the other hand,\u00a0suffered the most wounded. It\u00a0is said that the civil\u00a0war wiped out\u00a0either side.\u00a0But it is also\u00a0said that the civil\u00a0war killed all the racists and facsists\u00a0that were against the Commonwealth,\u00a0this lead to greater unity and fellowship\u00a0when the\u00a0Commonwealth\u00a0united\u00a0on the\u00a08th of september.\u00a0Aftermath\u00a0  The war left 8.8 million dead, 12.3 million injurded and 2.7 million missing, \u00a3674.3 billion lars in damage. The next 2 years saw food shortages and economic problems. The cost of reconstruction would bankrupt the Commonwealth, almost bringing it to second collapes. However\u00a0a new leader stepped in and transformed the nation.\u00a0 The accounts of genocide in the Kamaran countryside was true. Small groups of mainly Rodarion and Klidarian troops would travel to farming villages that were occupied and would raid everyhouse and shoot everyone inside, its recorded that around 896,724 people died as a result of the attacks and 27 commanders would be executed for war crimes. Its not recorded what troops took part in the attacks but they were probably killed or wounded in the final months of the war. Motives are believed to completely racial, during the war minoroity of the RC soldiers would become drunk and assualt EU citizens, however they were punished due to Rodarion strictness on the military. The RC was the center of the wars propaganda, some of these materials, would insite racial hatred and anger, calling the EU a zoo full of creeps and monsters, the men parasites the women cockroaches and the children devils. Each side wouldn't feel the same with each other ever again.  Another result was the political system. Instead of the Unity council arguing over the policies, the new government was a parlimentry republic. It had a Prime minister as a head of state and a fully functional parliment called the Commonwealth assembly, it was originally a place were province reps could meet and discuss local issues. This was first used by the RC then was imidatley used with the new Commonwealth. On the 8th of september the Commonwealth was reunited and was once again a regional power.Soviet Union USSR Grunge Flag by think0.jpg Military of Thon  See also Thon Nation at http://nationstates.wikia.com/wiki/Thon_NationThon Military Branches  The Thon military is divided into 8 branches \u2022 Coastguard (in times of war command & control is ceded to the Navy) \u2022 Navy \u2022 Marines \u2022 Army \u2022 Air force \u2022 Space and Missile Forces (50% of this branch is civilian) \u2022 Forest and Mountain Rangers \u2022 Vigiles (Thon Domestic police and firefighter branch) (similar to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigiles)Thon Coast Guard  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/lcsiez9.jpg one such class of Thon Coast Guard ships The Thon Coast Guard (TCG) is an armed force of the military of the Thon. It is unique among other armed forces in that it combines aspects of a maritime law enforcement agency (with jurisdiction both domestically and in international waters), naval military support, and a federal body. It is an agency of the Thon Department of Homeland Security, with its military operations working under the Thon Navy during times of war. The Coast Guard has eleven statutory missions: Enforce, support, aid, help, carry out, pursue and accomplish: As one of the seven armed forces, its stated mission is to protect the public, the environment, and Thon economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and Thon's coasts, ports, and inland waterways. The Coast Guard, in its literature, describes itself as \"a military, maritime, multi-mission service within the Department of Homeland Security dedicated to protecting the safety and security of the Thon.\" The other armed services of the Thon military are components of the Department of Defense, under which the Coast Guard can also operate during times of war and under declaration by the Supreme Commander. The Thon Coast Guard has a broad and important role in homeland security, law enforcement, search and rescue, marine environmental pollution response, and the maintenance of river, intracoastal and offshore aids to navigation (ATON). While most military services are either at war or training for war, the Coast Guard is deployed every day. When not in war, the Coast Guard has duties that include maritime law enforcement, maintaining aids to navigation, marine safety, and both military and civilian search and rescue--all in addition to its typical homeland security and military duties, such as port security. The service's decentralized organization and readiness for missions that can occur at any time on any day, is often lauded for making it highly effective, extremely agile and very adaptable in a broad range of emergencies.Thon Navy  The Thon Navy (TN) is the branch of the Thon armed forces responsible for conducting naval operations and is one of seven uniformed services. The Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the Logothete of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is itself, a division of the Department of Defense, which is headed by the Logothete tou stratiotikou. The highest military position and rank of a Navy officer is the position of Chief of Naval Operations with the Rank of Megas Doux or Lord High Admiral. Thon Navy objectives are delivered via a number of core capabilities: The Thon Navy's might rests in its cruisers, aircraft carriers and submarines:Thon aircraft carrier classes:  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/4-j.gif http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/web_050708-D-8455H-001.jpg http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/CVN_90_USS_Kenoshacopy.jpg [IMG]http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/5x2aiso.jpg[/IMG] http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/cvn77sg.jpgThon destroyer classes:  240 in service http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/2-naval-destroyers.jpg http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/ship_72.jpg http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/1-naval-destroyers.jpg http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/4-naval-destroyers.jpgThon Crusier classes:  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/arsenal_72.jpg Sarmizegetusa class - defensive arsenal cruisers specs: Twelve 4 by 10 (40 missiles tubes) sections totaling to 480 missiles Each of every 12 missile sections contains: Totaling: In addition to these 12 missile sections the Sarmizegetusa class - defensive arsenal cruisers include: 4 \"Metal Storm\" missile defense countermeasure systems, courtesy of the Thon Commonwealth member Australia.

Projectile is thousands of 5.56x45 mm (standard bullet used in many assault rifles) which travel at the speed of 920 m/s, or 3018 ft/s , or 2058 mph or to the equivlanet kinetic energy of 470 kJ/kg. Crew compliment: 48Thon submarine classes:  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/DerelictClass.jpg Tsunami class submarines details and specs classified as top secret and strictly unpublicizedThon Marines  The Thon Marine Corps (TMC) is a branch of the Thon military responsible for providing power projection from the sea, using the mobility of the Thon Navy to rapidly deliver combined-arms task forces and is one of eight uniformed services. While administratively under the Department of the Navy, the Thon Marine Corps is a separate branch of the military, often working closely with Thon Naval forces for training, transportation, and logistic purposes. The Thon Marines are a maritime-focused, and amphibious elite corps, highly specialized in amphibious warfare, that is, to project an amphibious force onto a hostile, or potentially hostile, coast capable of deploying at short notice in support of the Thon Government's military and diplomatic objectives overseas, and are optimized for highly maneuverable operational situations. Thon Marines' ability to embark on short-term notice with (land, air and naval) Navy assets, makes them, a military branch with a high strategic value. Adding to this a high degree of training, and the capability to deploy swiftly in international waters, results in a potent disuasory force available at a short notice in distant regions. The Thon Marine Corp compromises of Thon military fighting forces trained specifically for operating from ships, to land on and capture a section and/or multiple sections of coast-line, deploy from warships, assist with bridge watch-keeping, fire-fighting, ship security, provision of boarding parties to board other vessels, guarding and protecting Thon embassies, coastal or riverine boat patrolling, security of naval bases and to specialize in marine and amphibious war fighting. Thon Marines are trained for use of amphibious equipment that includes landing by hovercraft, landing craft, boat, and amphibious vehicle units on amphibious-support ships and by aircraft units from aircraft carriers or amphibious-support ships. In Thon modern warfare, Marines form an elite force, of highly mobile troops, usually tasked with short rapid deployment and intervention missions; however, some forces are capable also of sustained war fighting missions. The Thon Marines have the capability but not priority to be used as a spearhead for major military offensives or as a stopgap when a military requirement arises, performing military operations until more permanent forces arrive.Thon Marine Capabilities  While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms, as a force it has the unique ability to rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force to almost anywhere in the world within days. The basic structure for all deployed units is a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) that integrates a ground combat component, an air combat component, and a logistics combat component under a common command element. The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an organizational culture centered around the infantry. Every other Marine capability exists to support the infantry. Unlike some Western militaries, the Corps remained conservative against theories proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently. For example, Marine Aviation has always been focused on close air support and has remained largely uninfluenced by air power theories proclaiming that strategic bombing can singlehandedly win wars. This focus on the infantry is matched with the doctrine that \"Every Marine is a rifleman.\" All enlisted Marines, regardless of military specialization, receive training as a rifleman; all officers receive training as infantry platoon commanders. A large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines, particularly the NCOs, (corporals and sergeants), as compared with many other military organizations. The Marine Corps emphasizes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other military services. Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on \"commander's intent\" as a guiding principle for carrying out orders; specifying the end state but leaving open the method of execution. The Thon Marine Corps relies on the Thon Navy for sealift to provide its rapid deployment capabilities. Air-ground task forces Today, the basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size. A MAGTF integrates a ground combat element (GCE), an air combat element (ACE), and a logistics combat element (LCE) under a common command element (CE). A MAGTF can operate independently or as part of a larger coalition. It is a temporary organization formed for a specific mission and dissolved after completion of that mission. The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self-sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms, both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations. The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness of overreliance on its sister services, and towards joint operations in general. A MAGTF varies in size from the smallest, a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), based around a reinforced infantry battalion and a composite squadron, up to the largest, a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which ties together a Division, an Air Wing, and a Logistics Group under a MEF Headquarters Group.Thon Army  Control and operation of the Army is administered by the Department of the Army, one of the eight service departments of the Department of Defense. The civilian head is the Logothete of the Army and the highest-ranking military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff. The Thon Army is made up of two components: the active (Regular Army) component; and the reserve component, the Army National Guard. The National Guard components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month, known as Battle Assembly or Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs), and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the Thon Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state's Praetors. However, the National Guard can be federalized by the Supreme Commander's order but not against the Praetor's wishes or permission. The Thon Army is led by a civilian Logothete of the Army, who reports to the Logothetes tou stratiotikou, and serves as civilian oversight for the Thon Army Chief of Staff. The Thon Army Chief of Staff is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body composed of the service chiefs from each service who advise the Logothetes tou stratiotikou and the Supreme Commander who is the Megas Logothetes, on military matters under the guidance of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Army Mission  The primary responsibilities of the Army are the protection of the state border, combat on land, the security of occupied territories, and the defeat of enemy troops. The Army must be able to achieve these goals both in nuclear war and non-nuclear war, especially without the use of weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, they must be capable of protecting the national interests of the Thon within the framework of its international obligations. Thon Government websites state that the Army's mission is to provide a potent, versatile, and modern Army to promote the security of the Thon and protect its people and interests. Further, the Army's key doctrine publication, The Fundamentals of Land Warfare, states, \"the Army\u2019s mission is to win the land battle\". The main constitutional tasks of today's Thon military are: \u2022 to protect the constitutionally established institutions and the population's democratic freedoms. \u2022 to maintain order and security inside the country. \u2022 to render assistance in the case of natural catastrophes and disasters of exceptional magnitude. \u2022 To defend and achieve victory against foreign military forces \u2022 The training of troops for combat, on the basis of tasks determined by the Armed Forces' General Staff. \u2022 The improvement of troops' structure and composition, and the optimization of their numbers, including for special troops. \u2022 The development of military theory and practice. \u2022 The improvement of operational and combat training of the Ground Forces.Army Equipment/vehicles/weaponry Artillery  Thon upgrade to ATACMS Block III TACMS-P (P = Penetrator)and MGM-168 ATAMCS Block IVA missiles: Heat hardening and reflective coating of the projectiles, which increases the necessary laser exposure time from THEL and airborne laser antimissile defenses. Can also be assisted, aided, and supplemented in guidance and targeting via satellites and other Thon targeting systems, some of which are tied into Thon Naval ships.Tanks  These are Merkava IV tanks, converted for urban warfare. The LIC designation stands for \"Low intensity conflict\", underlining its emphasis on counter-insurgency, street-to-street inner-city asymmetrical type warfare of the 21st century[17]. The Merkava IV LIC is equipped with a turret 12.7 mm caliber coaxial machine gun which enables the crew to lay down fairly heavy cover fire without the use of the main gun, which is relatively ineffective against individual enemy combatants. Like the new remote-operated weapon station, the coaxial machine-gun is fired safely from inside the tank without exposing the crew to small-arms fire and snipers. The most sensitive areas of the tank, its optics, exhaust ports and ventilators, are all protected by a newly-developed high-strength metal mesh, to prevent possibility of explosives charges planted there [18]. Rubber whip pole-markers with LED tips and a driver's rear facing camera have been installed to improve navigation and maneuverability in an urban environment by day or by night. Merkavas IVs that have been fitted with full medical and ambulance capabilities, but retaining their armament. The cabin area has been converted for carrying injured personnel and has had stretchers and life support medical station systems added with a full medical team complement to operate under combat conditions with a Merkava battalion. The vehicle has a rear door to facilitate evacuation under fire, and can provide covering fire. The \"tankbulance\" is not an unarmed ambulance and is not protected by the Geneva Conventions provisions regarding ambulances, but it is far less vulnerable to accidental or deliberate fire than an ambulance.APC's/IFVs  Crew: Commander, Gunner, Loader, driver +8 infantry soldiers Crew total:12 Thon soldiers Because of the front-mounted power pack with its resultant rear space, the Merkava IVB tank can, does and is used to function as the Thon's substitute and place for the roles of APC's and IFVs: The tank is capable of carrying eight infantry soldiers, a Command Group or three litter patients (stretcher casualties) in addition to the tank crew of commander, loader, gunner and driver. In a secondary role as an infantry carrier, the Merkava MKIVB provides a unique solution to the problem of its own protection over closed or infantry and tank-killer infested terrain; it also has the ability to transport infantry groups to vantage points over fire-covered ground with maximum protection. However, in order to carry up to eight men in the rear compartment, part of the ammunition has to be restored in the turret or unloaded before embarkation. As the vehicle is excellently protected by CBR equipment, transportation of infantry over infested areas may be crucial to their survival, in the absence of other suitable vehicles. Last but not least, the capability to take on bailed out tank crews under fire is an extremely powered morale-raiser on the battlefield, and can rapidly restore precious tank crews to action, during the most critical periods of a battle.Air Force  The Thon Air Force (TAF) is the aerial warfare branch of the Thon armed forces and one of the eight uniformed services of the Thon. Not all of the Thon's military combat aircraft are operated by the TAF. The Thon Army operates its own helicopters, mostly for support of ground combatants; it as well maintains a small fleet of fixed wing aircraft (mostly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). The Navy is responsible for the aircraft operating on its aircraft carriers and Naval air stations, and the Marine Corps operates its own combat and transport aircraft. The Coast Guard also maintains transport and search-and-rescue aircraft, which may be used in a combat and law enforcement role. All branches of the Thon military operate helicopters. The Department of the Air Force is headed by the civilian Logothete of the Air Force who heads administrative affairs. The Department of the Air Force is a division of the Thon Department of Defense that is headed by the Logothetes tou stratiotikou head of the Thon Logothete of Defense. The highest-ranking military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Mission In general, the Thon Air Force shall include aviation forces both combat and service not otherwise assigned. It shall be organized, trained, and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive air operations. The Air Force shall be responsible for the preparation of the air forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as otherwise assigned and, in accordance with integrated joint mobilization plans, for the expansion of the peacetime components of the Air Force to meet the needs of war. Thon government defines the purpose of the Air Force as: \u2022 to preserve the peace and security, and provide for the defense, of the Thon, the Territories, Commonwealths, and possessions, and any areas occupied by the Thon; \u2022 to support national policy; \u2022 to help implement national objectives; \u2022 to overcome the airspace, air superiority, and air traffic and control of any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the Thon. \u2022 to have, be, achieve, secure, maintain and dominate the air superiority of all the Thon Islands and their Territories, Commonwealths, and possessions, and any areas occupied by the Thon; With the exception of the massive superairbase Askor Air Base and air bases at Molpadia Military Base, most Thon air bases are either dug in into mountain sides and mountain valleys. This is so they are more easily defenedible and can then only be attacked vertically from directly above since the mountains are protecting it. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/3383742-Google_Earth_view_of_the_Ai.jpg One such Mountain valley airbase http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/202_0289-ingang.jpg http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/203_0349.jpg two of such and many Air hangar entrances into Thon Mountains What air assets that are needed and not near mountains are spaced out, sparse, and camouflaged as can not be identified as air force assets from aerial surveillance, specifically orbital such as this example of a ready to use hangar for homeland air defense housing an air superiority fighter located in the country side off the road. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/214_1489-hangar.jpgThe Thon Air Force in Search and rescue  The National Search and Rescue Plan designates the Thon Coast Guard as the federal agency responsible for maritime search-and-rescue (SAR) operations, and the Thon Air Force as one federal agency jointly responsible for inland SAR. Both agencies maintain Rescue Coordination Centers to coordinate this effort.Thon and Commonwealth Aircraft  Thon military acronym definitions: aircraft designation \"F\" = Fighter aircraft designation \"SF\" = Stealth Fighter aircraft designation \"SB\" = Strike Bomber aircraft designation \"HB\" = Heavy Bomber aircraft designation \"RB\" = Main Bomber aircraft designation \"CF\" = Carrier FighterSpace and Missile Forces Agency  The Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency contributes to the Thon's deterrence through its intercontinental ballistic missile force and plays a vital role tying together and supporting the Thon military worldwide through the use of many different types of satellites and other space operations. On top of this the Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency (SAMFA) goals, mission, purpose, objectives, and directives are: SAMFA's mission is \"To Deliver Trained and Ready military forces with Unrivaled Space Capabilities to Defend the Thon.\" Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency Command makes space reliable to the warfighter (i.e. forces personnel) by continuously improving the command's ability to provide and support combat forces \u2014 assuring their access to space. In addition, the command's ICBM forces deter any adversary contemplating the use of weapons of mass destruction or WMD. SAMFA has eight primary mission areas: Other duties, responsibilities, and tasks are to operate, support, enhance, build, man, guard, maintain, facilitate, develop, and improve the following programs:Moon Base  SAMFA announced it was planning to build a permanent moon base. The goal is to start building a fully functional base, that would allow for crew rotations like the International Space Station and better, more effeciantly controlled refracting, reflecting, and catadioptric radio, X-ray, gamma-ray, Wolter, Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), and infrared telescopes. The moon base has paved and artificially constructed and cleared landing fields and pads along with housing, billeting, dining, refueling, and storage facilities for Thon Space craft. The Moon base is in addition, a facility for internet controlled telescopes that can be used by the common citizen for a fee for given times via the internet which could be seen more clearly than any earth-based telescopes and immune to interruption, overcast and distortion as earth based telescopes are because of the earth's atmosphere. Meteor and anti satellite defense gun installations are installed throughout the installation.Thon Orbital Space Station  The Thon Orbital Space Station along with its Moon Base is The Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency's most expensive and primary effort. The Thon Orbital Space Station is an orbital base and main center or universal satellite so to speak for all space endeavors. The Thon Orbital Space Station or TOSS is the consolidation for the best Thon weather, GPS, communication, defense, telescope, surveillance, espionage, refueling, experimental, bio, and a few commercial satellites into one central based orbital entity for better and more manageable centralized intelligence, maintainability, protection, service, accessibility, uniformity, efficiency, and control. The TOSS is also the refueling, docking, repair, maintenance, unloading and command center point for Thon Spacecraft. The TOSS is this aside from the Thon Moon Base, which is mainly the same except in regards for the moon base not being a command center and the moon base having a few other additions such as a landing field and pad, greater housing, billeting, refueling and storage facilities along with solar panel fields on the moon's surface. A small number of remote Portable Autonomous Debris Removing Item Satellites or PADRIS's for short, are based, and deployed from the TOSS to track and then clean up, de-orbit, collect, neutralize, and eliminate space debris or space junk in all orbits of earth. The Thon Orbital Space Station is a circular two disked rotating structure connected at the center. Command and Control, housing, living, dining, the bridge, observation decks, Special Forces drop pods, lounges, and docking take place on one of the two disks while equipment, machinery, engine, sensor, communication equipment, fuel cells, power generator, and other mechanical, technological and system hardware, machinery and equipment are mainly located in the other disk, which is mainly only accessed for maintenance, upgrades, installations, repairs and inspections. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/D_BaseStar1.jpg http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/D_BaseStar2.jpgThon Asteroid Mining Automated Harvester (TAMAH)  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/wctactics38.jpg The Thon Asteroid Mining Automated Harvester or TAMAH is an mining, and exploration space station that traverses the asteroid fields in our solar system and the rings around planets. It includes large quantities and varieties of drilling, mining, explosive and sonar, seismic, and analytical equipment for surveying and harvesting ores and minerals in the solar system. The TAMAH works towards accumulating and gathering valuable materials and securing them to one main asteroid and then attaches various small rockets around that asteroid's exterior. It then sends the loaded asteroid on a collision course towards earth's moon moving on its own inertia while only rarely using its various small rockets for trajectory changes. This form of mineral transportation is cheap and eliminates the need for costly fuel, power drive and shipping requirements that would go with transport by ship and man made transport barges, as well as the cost for return trips back to the TAMAH. The Thon Moon Base supervises the small deceleration and landing of the mineral loaded asteroids and payloads, and deassembles the mineral deposits, metals, ore and attachments to the asteroid attached by the TAMAH. The Thon Moon Base then stores, ships, refines, molds, melts, and assumes authority and responsibility of the minerals from that point to when it transports and ships the harvest to Earth. The TAMAH also works towards accumulating ice and water found throughout the solar system onto asteroids. These \"ice\" asteroids are then slowly set on a collision course on their own inertia towards the moon. The Thon Moon Base does not intervene in these collisions however, except in the possibility of any extremely rare situation where the impact would be in near vicinity of the Thon Moon Base or its trajectory and course needed to be adjusted to safely collide on the moon and/or away from anything. This is done to accumulate greater water resources for Earth and Thon Space Forces but is primarily for eventually establishing a livable environment on the moon, at least capable for the living conditions of small limited vegetation growth on the moon's exposed surface. While capable of automation via the Thon Orbital Space Station, TAMAH has been manned by Thon Space Personnel for the majority of its mining operations to achieve more efficient and profitable turnouts, increased and greater exploration, command and control, and less workload, stress, responsibility, space requirements and hassle to TOSS.Thon Space Claims  OOC [all claims and mentioned celestial bodies here (except space station facilities and that like obviously) do actually exist in reality, its kinda amazing how much is cataloged and discovered already,] The Thon claims and reserves the right to exploit, mine, and colonize any and all bodies within the solar system regardless of other nations claims to them, unless the spacial body whether it be moon, planet, asteroid, orbit, asteroid group or a planets rings is currently being used, utilized, manned, mined, colonized, exploited or will be within 15 years of a nations claim. Otherwise, all unused spacial bodies are subject to exploitation, and mining by the Thon Space and Missile Forces Agency and its TAMAH program. If a nation that is actually capable of a decent space program claims a spacial body and doesn't do anything with it within 15 years, the Thon ignores and does not recognize their claim, and reserves the right to mine, colonize or exploit the spacial body. Currently the Thon claims mining and mineral rights to all of Jupiter's moons and asteroids in its orbit under the radius of 300 KM. This includes all of Jupiters moons with the exceptions of Jupiter's four largest moons: which the Thon do not lay any claim. Other than these four moons the Thon make it a priority to mine and exploit these orbiting moons and/or asteroids classified as Jupiter moons for mineral wealth and fuels as well as storage facilities. The Thon do this because it is safer, cheaper, more cost efficient and effective, controllable and predictable than mining the asteroid belts themselves in the solar system. Essentially the Thon only recognize claims as \"first come first serve,\" not \"first see, find or discover and its yours\". The Thon also claim a large sizable portion of land on the moon for its current moon base there and \"designated asteroid impact zones\" for mineral loaded asteroids sent from the TAMAH to be further exploited, mined and refined at earth. Thon solar panel fields also take up a particulary large portion of land on the moon and because of this, their power and services are shared with any other nation's moon facilites that desire so, taking into account they assist with the maintence and repair costs of the solar panel fields of course. This priority changes if and when any substantial resource is found and specified in the asteroid belt greater than those found in orbit of Jupiter. In the event of such a find, efforts are made for the asteroid to be hurled towards an orbit around Jupiter to consolidate mining and control and prevent thinning of Thon space assets. Once an asteroid or spacial body is striped of all useful resources, usefulness and minerals it is then sent to plummet to Jupiter's surface to clear up its orbit and the planet's skies for more future mineral loaded asteroids to be brought into its orbit for exploitation. Other Thon claims, activities, operations and plans in space which are mostly in the Kuiper belt are the following: make it a great location for a mining, military, and exploration base.Forest and Mountain Rangers  The Forest and Mountain Rangers are the Thon's wildlife and park rangers who keep maintain, patrol, police, safeguard, and preserve Thon's national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. The Rangers specialize in the environment, and search, and rescue. The Rangers patrol, police, safeguard, and preserve the national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges from hunters, poachers, industrial and commercial dumping, and wildfires. Hunting and poaching of certain wildlife in the Thon is punishable by enslavement and then death, if that is, death is not immediate upon capture, prevention or apprehension of suspects. The Rangers track animals, collect data on migration, fertility, birth rates, population, diet and reproduction in efforts to revitalize, increase, and prevent extinction of endangered and critically endangered species. The Forest and Mountain Rangers second main mission is to provide search and rescue, and relief efforts in Thon's wilderness and mountain areas. These duties include providing search and rescue of missing persons and apprehension efforts of escaped prisoners and work jointly with the Thon military in apprehension of military deserters, and lost personnel in the Thon, although as of yet such need has not been necessary. The Forest and Mountain Rangers are the Fish and Wildlife service of the Thon and the primary authority and service for search and rescue of people missing in the Thon's wilderness areas and/or affected from avalanches, mudslides, rockslides, flooding, and earthquakes but not to include tsunamis, hurricanes, and tornadoes. All Forest and Mountain Rangers are proficient in survival training, firefighting, scouting and tracking, environmental stewardship and rifle marksmanship of which every Ranger is assigned a rifle, survival, camping, mountain, and firefighting gear along with their uniforms.Vigiles  The Vigiles or more properly the Vigiles Urbani (\"watchmen of the City\") or Cohortes Vigilum (\"cohorts of the watchmen\") are the firefighters and police of the Thon. Every Vigile is equipped with standard firefighting and personnel protective equipment. The Oath and mission of every Vigile is \"to serve and protect, to conquer any fire and any foe that would danger others no matter the time, place or distance, to serve the people, not to screw the people for it is them I live and work my indebted life for\" All Vigile are trained in first aid, firefighting, general law, self-defense, small-arms marksmanship, bodyguard training, and the value of selfless service. In addition to extinguishing fires, the Vigiles are the police force of Thon. Their duties included traffic control, apprehending thieves, robbers, arsonists, and other criminals as well as protecting and providing security for certain places such as city parks, public events, national monuments, and sometimes even as a security service for governing officials. Vigiles are assigned to their certain municipal districts of which their, authority, housing or billeting, local training, food, upkeep, and some of their benefits is provided and funded by these municipal districts. Vigiles typically live in barracks and dorms in their respective stations of their assignment, but it is up to the local governing body or city to decide on whether they stay in this typical barracks housing or live in other residences such as apartments or housing based on a rent or lease agreement funded by the city or with their family within a set distance of the station. It is the basic training, first aid training, job education, police & firefighting gear, equipment, vehicles and uniforms along with special schools and retirement benefits that the federal government provides to Vigiles. The task of guarding the public baths is added as a duty of the Vigiles as the baths are open during the night. The Vigiles are in fact, considered a military unit. They deal primarily with petty crimes while sedition and more violent crimes such as rapists, murderers, and severe assaults are handled by the Cohortes urbanae whose duties and primary role are to police the Thon and to counteract the roaming mobs and gangs that ever arise. The Cohortes urbanae are the \"Heavy Police\" subgroup entity of the Vigiles in their own authority that cooperate with the Vigiles. They are similar to S.W.A.T. and a punishment enforcing law enforcement group. They react to law violations, not to actively prevent them, except in cases of pursuing serial killers, and repeat offenders and heavily wanted criminals. They are equipped with heavy and powerful weapons and are called in when Vigiles are underpowered to counteract against criminals such as some bank robberies or acts of terrorism, and hostage situations. The Cohortes urbanae carry out the corporal punishment for thievery of which is a public beating, with no governmental medical treatment, and the capital punishment for what few high crimes that death is the penalty. The Vigile duties are to hand over such criminals of severe crimes to the Cohortes urbanae, and to take back thieves and robbers once their punishment has been carried out and ensure they get back to their home safely with no further punishment and in recoverable health.Thon Military Facilities Tethys Naval Training Center  Tethys Naval Training Center is an island naval installation, which features docking, maintenance, salvage, resupply, testing, storage, air, firing range, naval, communications, and training facilities. It is home, headquarters and training camp of the following Thon Naval units, schools and commands: It is the largest naval complex in terms of land acreage and usage, because of the firing ranges for Thon Navy Seals, sailors, midshipman and naval artillery as well as training grounds for the navy seals, midshipman, basic training for all Thon sailors and naval landing craft such as beachheads, and water and landing courses and obstacles. Naval air stations, landing strips, storage, maintenance, hangars, repair, and resupply facilities also take up large portions of land usage, more so of particular the landing strips and hangars. (Tethys Naval Training Center named after and inspired by:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_%28mythology%29)Marine Island Training Center  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/lm_ms2_acc_riverine.jpg Thon Marine Amphibious forces doing exercises prior to the invasion of the Thon OP4 held Marine Island Training Center's southern island in the 2005 yearly Thon Marine wargame. The Marine Island Training Center is exactly what its namesake is. Thon Marines are based on the northern island, which make amphibious attacks, assaults, and incursions into either the northern or the southern island against other Marine OP4 units for training. Every year Marine Units alternate their role as either OP4 or Thon Marines. War games occur only a successive 4 months every year. The other 8 months time in between these war games are for the training grounds, wildlife, and environment to recuperate, rejuvenate, renourish, and be tended by environmentalist caretakers of the Forest and Mountain Rangers. During these 8 months, in addition to planning and preparing for the next war game Thon Marines train: It is home, base, and station to the following:Askor Airbase  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/gpw-20051129-UnitedStatesAirForce-0.jpg The small section of the northern most part of Askor Air base with friendly visiting American aircraft doing a flyby. The airbase features multiple airstrips and airfields Askor Airbase is the Thon's largest air force complex and home base of Thon's largest bombers, and premier fighter wings. Military units, vehicles, and equipment to include space and rocket parts and equipment for the Thon Space program and the Thon Space and Missile Forces also deploy and/or are air shipped from here from various based heavy air transports. Askor Airbase is one of two such airfields that house Thon's top bombers the B-106 Thunderdragons. the other base in middle of Australia. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/bigbmf.jpg A Thon B-106 Thunderdragon over the Thon Mountains Askor Airbase is also home to various aircraft manufacturing facilities as well as: The Air Force Combat Ammunition Center (AFCOMAC) is a Thon Air Force training course developed to provide the Air Force munitions community with advanced training in mass combat ammunition planning and production techniques. It uses a combination of in-depth classroom instruction combined with a four-day intensive practical exercise using live munitions in a realistic, bare-base scenario. AFCOMAC offers three courses:Thor Academy  Thor Academy is the educational and flight training facility for Thon Air Force pilots and officers in the Thon. All officers and pilots attend, and are trained at this location. Home and station of:Molpadia Military Base  http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/070929-F-9196D-009.jpg Thon Military forces readying to deploy during the war against The American Privateer on of Molpadia's airstrips Molpadia Military Base is the largest although not most extensive military facility, complex, base and grounds in all Thon. Molpadia Military Base is the deployment center for any military use overseas and has numerous facilities for accommodations and housing of all Thon military branches. It the Thon's largest storage, billeting, housing and deployment facility and is an ammunition depot and manufacturing center of small arms, ammunition, and soldier basic, common, special and specific equipment, clothing and uniforms. Molpadia Military Base is home, base, command, communication and control center of:\u00deunor Hold  \u00deunor Hold is a mountainous peninsula on the southern coast of Thon's biggest Island. It serves as the headquarters for Thon MIlitary activities and operations and is the crown jewel of the Thon's Military might. It features facilities for the Thon navy, Air Force, army, marines, and Space Forces. Underground facilities, subterranean fighter bays, flight launch tubes, missile silos, docking facilities, Academies, and EMP shielding are only some of its features and capabilities. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/ISS013-E-67242.jpg \u00deunor Hold is the bastion of Thon Military power, influence, control and might. \u00dehunor Hold is headquarters, home, base, center, command, communication and control of: Submarine cavern bases at the base of rocky sea cliffs of the inland waterways into the mountainousness peninsula and rail-gun and magnetic type accelerated assisted launch tunnels for fighter aircraft are located in various places throughout \u00dehunor Hold. http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj121/thonnation/96_983.jpg One such Thon submarine facility located in \u00dehunor Hold These rail gun and magnetic type accelerated assisted launch tunnels for fighter aircraft are connected to subterranean fighter hangars designed to rapidly launch and deploy fighter screens for use. Most of these launch platforms are built to propel aircraft to the point of takeoff without the necessity of a landing strip, but do not accommodate the means for breaking the earth's atmosphere. Only two such fighter acceleration tunnels capable of launching aircraft beyond the earth's atmosphere exist in \u00dehunor Hold, and they are much longer and extensive in power requirements than the smaller, shorter camouflaged flight tubes. These launch platforms do not have the capability for aircraft to land however. That requirement is met by V/STOL aircraft and the one and only airstrip located in \u00dehunor Hold which can transport fighter aircraft back to their respective underground fighter bays. Port and naval facilities to accommodate a few number of Thon's Navy warships are a part of \u00dehunor Hold. They have the ability to accommodate warships up to the loading/unloading and deployment of Thon Amphibious warships but not some of the Thon's larger battleships or any of Thon's Aircraft carriers however. Most of \u00dehunor Hold is EMP protected and shielded with the exceptions being some surface facilitates of \u00dehunor Library and some other exterior surface facilities and buildings such as some of the naval ports and some outer portions of Cybele Citadel, and Thon Military Academy. While Thons' base, main, construction, and deployment center for its ICBMs and ICCMs is not \u00dehunor Hold, A few of Thon's nuclear ICBMs and ICCMs are stationed in hidden, shielded silos at \u00dehunor Hold. Power for \u00dehunor Hold is provided by deep geothermal energy, with backup as Thorium fueled Fusion generators and then even further by stored fuel cells and fossil and bio fuel generators.Thon's Military Archives or \u00dehunor Library  \u00deunor Hold is also home to the Thon's Military Archives or \u00dehunor Library, which is the 4th largest library in the Thon and subterraneanly located equally between the four complexes of: These four complexes are connected via tunnel networks. \u00dehunor Library features observation and reading lounges directly above it at the summit of the mountain via elevators, escalators, and staircases. These reading and studying areas are superbly, luxuriously and comfortably furnished and built for the specific, suitable and desired needs and wants of the Cybele Citadel, Thon Special Forces school, Thon War College Complex, and the cadets at \u00dehunor Military Academy. They provide, offer, meet, and accommodate, soldier computer needs and access and even astronomy observation balconies with telescopes available to the common soldier.Cybele Citadel  At \u00deunor Hold's center lies Cybele Citadel, the headquarters of Thon military Operations for the whole Commonwealth. It is the Thon's central, main, and primary military command, communication, and control center. Cybele Citadel is the military castle office complex which functions in similarity to the United States Pentagon. This Citdel gets it namesake from the Phrygian goddess, Cybele (Greek: \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7, who embodies the fertile Earth, a goddess of caverns and mountains, walls and fortresses, nature, and wild animals (especially lions and bees). This fits perfectly with the lion emblem and coat of arms of \u00deunor Hold's Military High Command and \u00deunor Hold's fighter wings emblem and mascot the, Killer Bees, which is aptly earned as their deployment and defensive tactics resemble swarms when deployed around \u00deunor Hold, coming out of hidden launch tubes throughout the base like bees out of holes in the ground from their hive. The goddess was known among the Greeks as Meter or Meter oreie (\"Mountain-Mother\"), or, with a particular Anatolian sacred mountain in mind, Idaea, inasmuch as she was supposed to have been born on Mount Ida in Anatolia, or equally Dindymene or Sipylene, with her sacred mountains Mount Dindymon (in Mysia and variously located) or Mount Sipylus in mind. Her name means \"of the mountain\", which is also interpreted as Mother of the Mountain. This is aptly named, because the location of the Thon's best defended installation, Cybele Citadel, is on top and inside Mount High Ida, the highest elevation in the vicinity of all \u00deunor Hold. Cybele Citadel being the mother of all military operations in the Thon and the proximity to the nearby major city of New Troy also fits the persona. (inspired from the following sources:)Thon Naval Headquarters  Although not Thon's largest sized naval installation, it is the Largest Naval port, berth, and home for Thon Warships. It is Headquarters for the Thon Navy and Coast Guard command, communication and control as well as the: Top Ranking honorary, housing residences for the Navy's and Coast Guard's Admirals are located on shore side mansions of the base with personal seaplane, and ship access. National Maritime Security is primary based out this particular facility being supported by a few other much smaller naval facilities on Thon's Coasts.Thon Island Interior Defenses  Thon Island's defenses against invasion and/or any occupation is its superiorly equipped and trained special forces and mountain warfare infantry soldiers operating throughout Thon's mountainous terrain and strategically built fortress networks. The Thon country is interiorly defended by six super fortresses networked together throughout the Thon Mountains. These strategically placed fortress imbedded deep in the largest mountains are the backbone of the Thon Army Defenses and training bases of which the Thon army frequently exercises in the harsh mountain environment. These six fortresses: Sarmizegetusa, Blidaru, Piatra Ro\u015fie, Coste\u015fti, C\u0103p\u00e2lna and Bani\u0163a were built during colonization and continuously upgraded since the emergence of the Thon as a Nation. The majority of every fortress or at least the main interior facilities of them are able to withstand earthquakes and repeated tremors up to 8 magnitude on the Richter scale and survive and remain operational in face of nuclear attack, depending on the yield of nuclear weaponry. Former lava tubes from the Thon Islands emergence have been heavily reinforced and serve as underground tunnel networks throughout the mountains to aid in Thon fighting capabilities. In a remote event of a breech of an enemy, lava can be directed into former lava tubes to expel and neutralize any enemy, of which afterwards can be redirected and cleaned out for reuse at a conclusion of the war. These fortress facilities feature residences which soldiers and their families live around the fortress, down the mountain on mountain terraces. These military forces have flowing water, brought through ceramic pipes from deposits of water from springs, geysers, glaciers, and snow, as well as electricity from solar, wind, fuel or a combination of these generators in their residences. These nearby, luxurious and convenient armed forces residences are not however part of the Thon strategic defensive system but complimentary, eco-friendly defensible residences for soldiers, officers and their family on off duty hours as well as safe houses, shelter, and rest points for Thon troops. These residences are typically camouflaged but yet still vulnerable to air and nuclear attack. These fortified mountain terraced residences are rigged with explosives that can only be detonated by the resident occupants. These terraced, housing, facilities are evacuated and blown upon significant land invasion in the Thon. All six fortresses are self-sustaining in water, communication, and electrical needs by means of various sources of mountain water, deep geothermal generators and numerous radio, phone, radar, electronic, dish, antenna, portable, land and visual based communications. Albeit highly unlikely and improbable for any invasion and/or occupying forces to ever discover any hidden landline communications between installations, listening, and counter-intelligence by the enemy would be unachievable except perhaps in regards to Morse code of which is itself always sent with one time Morse verification codes. (inspired by, source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmisegetuza)Sarmisegetuza Stronghold  The Capital fortress at the core of the strategic defensive system in the Thon Mountains, comprising of six citadels is Sarmisegetuza Stronghold. Sarmisegetuza Stronghold is Thon's secondary command, communication and control center, and secondary military headquarters as well as the second largest defensive installation after Cybele Citadel in \u00deunor Hold.Thon Commonwealth Projects/developments/invented technolgies  Battlemechs in conjunction with mercenary industriesAbout  WikiStates is a wiki about NationStates, the free online game created by Max Barry.

Our founder, Thunderhead was only active until 11 November in the same year when WikiStates first went online, yet we have survived the changeover from the United Nations to the World Assembly on NationStates, the rise and fall of NationStates 2, and the catastrophic collapse of NSWiki.net as well as the rise of its alternatives.2006 2008 2012 2013 2014 2016  This section is made possible by Minoa (also webmaster of NSindex), who has trawled through the archives over time to piece together the history of the NationStates wikis. For a full list of NationStates wikis from past and present, see List of NationStates wikis on NSindex.Dawoad The State of DaWoad Geography  The ASD is an inland nation surrounded by vast badlands with only one river capable of carrying Ocean going craft. As a result there is a satellite Port City known as Blue Cove. The Geography of Dawoad is Mountainous. Between the mountains are Smaller fertile Valleys leading to hight population densities in the valleys and extremely low population density in the upper levels of the mountains. Both island nations are found in North America in and around RL CanadaLand Area  Habitable Land Area: 3,885,820 sq km Coastline: 150 km (outside of country borders)Climate  The Climate of the ASD changes rapidly with vertical elevation. In the valleys the climate is temperate while the highest points of the mountains are near arctic conditions.Terrain  The terrain consist of badlands surrounding the nation and a massive mountain range which covers the nation itself.Elevation Extremes Lowest  The lowest point in the ASD is the Cerberus CrevasHighest  The Highest point is the tip of Mount Brock which house the military base known as cloud city.Demographics Faith Natural Monuments and Parks The Hawk National Monument Park  This area in the exact center of New Haven is Forested and is where both the monuments to and the graves of all the soldiers of the ASD are located. There is also a circular stand of Elder trees at the center of the park and almost exactly centering the ASD. This is meant to represent both the strength ad the lethaltity as well as the beauty of the Allied States of DaWoad.The Cloud Forrest National Park  Due to the Mountainous geography the change in climate has caused an odd geographical phenomenon known as a cloud forest. these forest are tropical in nature and exist because of an area on the mountain at which there is near constant cloud conditions allows both for heat retention and for constant rain forest levels of humidity.Education Primary & Secondary Schools  All primary schools are extremely well funded government run schools. Secondary Schools are all Government funded though placement exams are used in conjunction with GPA to determine the school that a student will attend.Placement Exams  The Placement Exams are a set of three tests given over a month, that show which school would best suite the student. Different Secondary Schools have different standards of acceptance based on how well the students do.High School  Grades 9-13 are taught here and the rules are a little less strict. At this point there are basically four even and equal streams. Either high academics for very bright students generally headed for theoretical research positions; Applied Academics, mostly for those entering business, programing or medical services; Trades, for those entering the trades streams; or Military school for those interested in a career in the millitary.Academies, Universities, Applied Universities and Colleges  Academies are government run educational facilities for people who are looking into pursuing a military Career of any kind. The Universities are designed for those in theoretical programs such as physics or higher maths and have labs for experimentation. The Applied Universities are integrated into The ASDs various hospitals, private businesses and, for truly talented students, the military allowing students to enter the workforce with an understanding of both the theoretical and applied aspects of their career. Colleges are specifically designed for those in the trades and are integrated with that part of the ASD again allowing students a lot of hands on experience as well as a theoretical back ground.Architecture  Generally speaking the architecture of the Allied States of DaWoad is open with large lots and relatively small houses. the use of natural light isConstitutional Government  The Government of the ASD is a constitutional democracy. All members of the House of commons and the senate are elected by the general populace. The electoral system is a Multi-Party one, with proportional representation.Suffrage  Suffrage is universal save for those currently serving prison time or in mental institutes.Proportional Representation  Seats in both houses are decided by proportional representation with each percent of the population representing one of the hundred seats in each house. The senate is elected once every ten years while the house of commons is elected once every four. The senate has limited power but must sign off on all decisions made by the commons while not being able to institute legislation itself.The House of Commons Powers of the House of Commons  The Legislative Branch has the authority toSenate  The Senate is composed of one hundred representatives elected every 10 years. To be nominated to the Senate, the person must be: Also, the Senate is charged with Trying a Court of Impeachment and signing off on all domestic legislationExecutive Power Prime Minister  The Prime Minister is given more power than generally associated with constitutional monarchy especially during times of war.

Following the eventual end of the Civil war. Admiral Hawk was Viewed as a National Hero and given free reign over the creation and expansion of the ASD Navy. In A Fortunate set of Circumstances the other person to come out of the conflict as a hero was Professor Bold and she immediately went to work Modernizing the obsolete weapons that the previous Navy had been using. As A result the weapons and craft used by the ASDN are all of their own making.Doctrine Aircraft Carrier Based Fleets  The ASD fleets act to protect their carriers they do so by using a layered defense. The outermost Layer is formed by Airborne radars aboard Eagle AWACs. The second perimeter is Sonar from submarines. Third is patrolling aircraft themselves. Fourth is subs themselves. Fifth is Strike Class missile attack boats. Sixth is Shield class EW and Missile defense boats. And the inner perimeter is formed by the remaining ships surrounding the ASDN carriers.fleets 1st Fleet  This is the first of the ASDNs expeditionary Fleets.

Designed to be an intermediate option between an all out invasion fleet and first fleet this fleet can hold its ground if it has too but is designed to do so only in small conflicts and/or civil wars. Otherwise it acts in the same way that First fleet does. Takes anything its size or smaller and runs from anything else.

It is based around being as low visibility as possible. All its ships have low radar and Sonar profiles as well as adaptive, phased array camouflage in visible, Ultraviolet and infrared spectrum and the fleet acts under strict Emcom at all times. The idea behind this fleet is to be the ace in the hole for any allied fleet commander, a stealth fleet that can offer tactical support without the enemy even knowing it exists.

The settler population historically named it the land of the Authai, which is usually translated in modern English into meaning Authairea. The nation exists on a single continent, and is known in the Intergalactic Dominion as the nation of New Rogernomics. Authairea is notable for the harshness of its climate, with cold bitter winters and arid and hot summers. It used to have fauna and numerous small animal species, however various industrial accidents destroyed the ecosystem, restoration projects are in progress. The population is English speaking, with the indigenous Authaireans being the majority. Lord Athanasius Ilius is the elected lord and head of state, in his absence he is represented by the nations Military Head. The Lord reigns but does not rule. He has little political influence and his position is mainly symbolic. Political power rests with the democratically elected Parliament of New Rogernomics. The Parliament is under the leadership of the Prime Minister, who is the head of the government.Etymology  Before the middle ages there was no true name for Authairea as the peoples of the area simply referred to it as the land of Authai. The owners land simply called themselves the Authai clans, the name Authairea was coined controversially in the 19th century, as a way to attempt to eliminate the role of the royal line; before being relegated to name of the world, as opposed to the name of the nation as well.History  History of Authairea The world of Authairea has a rich and ancient history spanning back to is first origins as the land of the Authai, who were bands of tribes under no single or clear ruler during the first century A.D. Speculation is that the tribes that were a mix of Bulgarian and Germanic, and Frankish tribal entities and must have arrived no later than 50 A.D. which is considered the most accurate date for the establishment of the tribes in the Authaira region; through a temporary wormhole which closed by 100 A.D. By the middle ages the Authai Clans had adopted Charism (demonic gryphon worship) and they renamed themselves the Kingdom of Authaira. This was an oppressive Monarchy who ruled with an iron fist, and at times bled the nation dry. It had a strong feudal system and everyone gave their allegiance to the King, there was little internal strife as the royal line was well established and the citizens were heavily controlled by the military. Over the next few centuries these settlers developed into a distinct culture now known as Authairean. The population was divided into districts (regions) and duchy\u2019s (sub regions) which would co-operate, compete and sometimes fight with each other. All however were usually dominated by a leading King or Duke with a Monarch\u2019s powers. During the revolutionary period Authaira was largely behind, despite significant moves in electoral reform and even the establishment of parliament by the Monarch King Armonde (1820-1863). The King imposed heavier restrictions on the political freedoms of the people as they became disenchanted by rule by an iron fist and began to desire an end to the power of the King. This soon came to pass with a Revolution in 1863, which instituted a Constitutional Monarchy. However there was still distaste over the existence of the Monarchy and the Royal family was killed and the nation renamed the Republic of Rogernomics. Later on in 1901 the Republic collapsed and a military dictatorship under General Darmagovich took power in a bloody and horrific massacre of the members of parliament. After great resistance from citizens against the regime a Authairean Federation was formed dividing up the nation after discussion between all sides by the generals weary of the war, it divided the nation into Rogernomics who supported the dictator, New Rogernomics who were heavily against the dictator, and Rogernomica which had a mix of both sides and was a neutral territory.Geography  Geography of Authairea http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/Sun-48x48.png Climate: Temperate to arid climate http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/city-icon.jpg Terrain: Urban development has rendered most parts indistinguishable http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/Text-Edit-icon.jpg Language: English Highest Point: Estimate 438 metres Lowest Point: Estimate -163 metres Natural Hazards: Earthquakes, Flooding, Landslides and Drought Authairea Cities: Major Rivers: http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/River-icon.gif North Eastern Bouran (Bouranburg-Thepalaua Canal) http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/River-icon.gif Far Southern Giron (Gironde River) http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/River-icon.gif Midwestern Luar (Thepalua River) http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/River-icon.gif South Eastern Thep (Thepaula-Gironde Canal) http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/River-icon.gif Far Eastern Onde (New Gironde River) National Parks/Reserves: http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/In-the-shade-icon.gif James Cameron Brook Reserve http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/In-the-shade-icon.gif Authaira Estate Park http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/In-the-shade-icon.gif Authine Forest Park http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/In-the-shade-icon.gif Darmagovich Memorial Park http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/Death-valley-icon.gif Giron Desert Reserve http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/Death-valley-icon.gif Thepian Desert ReserveReligion  Most Authairean's worship the evil gryphon monster called Char, which in the end times is supposed to deliver the people to another world, instantaneously and drop them into a volcano so they may suffer in agony and bring pleasure to the evil being; it is also said that once this deed is done it will move to another world and revive the great cycle again. Char as a religious deity grants favors to its followers, guards the faithful from other evil beings or demons that seek to control them, gives a portion of its power in combat to anyone who bears its name, and through the oracle of Char in Authaira city is said to give brief visions of the future which warn of trouble to come for those who seek its audience.Demographics  Demographics of Authairea http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/school-icon.jpg Education: Well-resourced institutions with heavy government subsides provide either free or low to cost education. http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/hospital-icon.jpg Health care: Excellent Health care system that is well-financed and free. http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/Scroll-icon.gif Literacy Rate: 99.9% http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/hipeter924/Authairea/Search-48x48.png Culture: Authairea is highly cultured nation, known for its poetry, art, museums, and concert halls.

Authairea has democratically elected Judicial system whereby the Judges are elected by the people. The Prime Minister heads the government and is elected by the ruling party or coalition in Parliament. The current political rights of Authairea's citizens including universal suffrage and fair governance were established on the 17th March 1946 onwards with the signing of the first Authairean Constitution. Authairea has a relatively stable democratic system, although it has been argued to have significant corporate-government relationships and interest groups and maintains a close relationship with all business bodies so it has been reported by independent observers that Authairea has corruption within its government. However despite this it's citizens have significant freedom in political activity; although this results occasionally in radicals or undesirable groups taking power, the constitution so far to date keeps such groups in check allowing a safe and well functioning political system. Currently the Government of New Rogernomics consists of Prime Minister David Ketchley of the Authairea Green Party which gained 33.9% of the vote, who is in coalition with the newly formed Moralist Progressive Party which gained 20.3% of the vote in the 2324 Authairea elections. The current Chief Justice elected in the same election year was Justice Frederick Voulorte who gained 63.9% of the vote.

Today the Authaira Royal Line continues on from the rule of Royal Families, as the nobility related to the Royal Family survived the Revolution. The procedure to become the Monarch consists of a democratic vote of the nobility who elect a Lord to be the Monarch of Authairea. The Head of State of New Rogernomics is Lord Athanasius Ilius, since the 12th of May, 2103; as the first member of the Authaira Royal Line to take a role in government since the Revolution of 1863. This was due to extensive negotiations on the 3rd of November 2101 of the government and the nobility; agreement was reached to reinstate the Authaira royal line and establish a legitimate constitutional monarchy in the nation. So far his popularity has reached 85.3% in opinion polls and everyone feels the Monarchy is here to stay. Though there are still some voices for Republicanism, there has been a consistent rise in support for the role of the Monarch in government, particularly due to the support of the upper classes, nobility and the military. The head of state as a constitutional monarch is expected to support and be led largely by the government, though at some points in its history the lord has spoken out, particularly on Black Tuesday when a rogue general allowed a terrorist group to kill members of the government; Other duties of the head of state include taking part in activities across the nation, and signing the bills of parliament into law.Military  The Authairean military consists of the Authairea Air Force, Authairea Army and the Authairea Coastal Defence. The current military was established on February the 1st 1990 when the Authairean Federation was reformed as the nation of Authairea, the current head of the military is the Supreme General Grant Monroe who was elected in a national referendum with the required 2/3 majority; the Authairea military remains small in line with arms control agreements as well as due the choice of quality over quantity. A typical core military base The most major element of the military is the Authairea Air Defence (AAD Force), which controls the nuclear arsenal and the space borne satellite defense system (as well as the space forces), the Authairea Coastal Defense (ACD Force) controls the defensive turrets along the coast, 8 aircraft carriers, 16 missile cruisers and 4 nuclear submarines, the Authairean Ground Defence (AGD Force) consist of major city defense systems such as skycraper mounted anti-matter cannons and missile turrets across the city that can be quickly assembled in place, it also controls 6 core military bases on the planet surface, and currently has deployed four howitzer artillery divisions, 6 mech divisions, and 10 mobile infantry divisions in each city; though this changes upon need.

The nation is inhabited almost exclusively by European immigrants (chiefly British) as natives have either moved to other local islands where the traditional ways of living were more in tact or been killed by Germonian colonists.Geography  A small, northern portion of the island in which the capital of Zinaire City is located is hilly and grassy with few forests. It is separated from the heavily wooded majority of the island by the White Mountains, so named not because of heavily snow fall but because of the white fog that often shrouds them. Rocky beaches make up the entire northern shore, many with sheer cliffs dropping off into the ocean. Despite the rockiness of these cliffs, a variety of tropical plants populate them and many consider them even more beautiful than the sand beaches of the south. The Mossy River, which originates on Zinaire's northern coast, runs through the entirety of southern Zinaire into the ocean. There are several mid-sized towns (including the unofficial regional capital of Tiamona) along the river. Because of the unyielding jungle in the south, there are extremely few towns except along the Mossy River and almost none that are neither along the river or the shore. The beaches of the south of sandy and quintessentially tropical.Climate  While the south shares the climate of any jungle-covered Caribbean island, the north is surprisingly temperate; temperatures are rarely above 35\u00ba C or below 0\u00ba. The north also suffers from almost constant rains during the colder months. These meteorological oddities remain un-understood because meteorology is not an accepted science in Zinaire (this is a relic from the days of Germonia occupancy. In Germonia it snows so constantly that no one needs to be told what the weather is going to be like and therefore no one does).History  The date of Zinaire's formation is unknown. However, in 1926 the island became a Germonian colony under the rule of Germonia's queen.Colonial Rule  From 1926 until 1993, Zinaire was ruled by Germonian colonists. During this time, the Germonian queen or the royally appointed governor of Zinaire made nearly all administrative decisions related to the nation. The Zinairian parliament was extant but virtually powerless. The Germonian colonists are also believed to have killed as many as ten million island natives over a period of nearly seventy years. It was the guerilla resistance of natives and the already growing number of European inhabitants that eventually drove the Germonians away. Despite their hard-won victory, many natives left for the surrounding island either secretly during the Germonian rule or immediately afterwords once they were once again allowed to travel freely.Recent History  In the fifteen years since Zinaire became a sovereign nation, the Zinairian parliament has grown in power and the island has been populated by large numbers of Europeans. As a stark contrast to the strictly controlled days of colonialism, Zinaire is now a nation of great freedom both civilly and politically. However, these rights also extend to businesses who, also in part due to Zinaire's relatively strong economy, have moved to Zinaire in small droves. This has led to a business sector which some believe is bordering on a second government.Government and Politics  Zinaire is a republic in which all citizens over 16 may vote (this excludes the clinically insane but not convicted felons). The Zinairian Liberal Party which advocates increased freedoms in almost all areas has been in power since the end of Germonia's colonialism. The Conservative Party consistently lags in the polls.Parliament  Zinaire is ruled by a parliament of 100 which is overseen by Prime Minster Gregory Bishop. Both Prime Minster Bishop and approximately 70% of the parliament are from the Zinairian Liberal Party (25% are from the Conservative Party and 5% are independent).Authorities  In addition to the parliament, there are approximately a dozen authorities (the Zinairian term for a ministry). Each authority is led by a minister with a deputy minister(s) beneath him or her. Authorities may also be split into departments, each led by a chancellor.Foreign Authority  The Foreign Authority manages foreign policy and all diplomatic relations with foreign countries. Minister of Foreign Affairs: Sir Anthony MarcusDepartment of Diplomacy  The Department of Diplomacy handles all treaty negotiations and matters pertaining to both in Zinaire and aborad. Chancellor of Diplomatic Affairs: Sir Jackson MillerMilitary Authority  The Military Authority oversees the three branches of the military as well as national defense policy and military arrangements with other nations. Minister of Defense: Sir Henry NortonCommerce Authority  The Commerce Authority oversees all internal and international trade involving Zinaire. Minister of Commerce: Lady Emma GlassDepartment of International Trade  The Department of International Trade works with the Department of Diplomacy to establish and manage international trade deals. Chancellor of International Trade: Lady Dorothy BrownPolice Authority  The Police Authority manages the national police force (ZNPD) and oversees regional and municipal police forces. The Police Authority is the best funded in the nation. Minister of Police: Sir Francis KnightHealth Authority  The Health Authority oversees all issues of public health including national health insurance, management of epidemics and drug testing as well as issues of nutrition and food safety. Minister of Health: Lady Rebecca FeinDepartment of Drug Safety  The Department of Drug Safety insures that all drugs entering the Zinairian market meet their stringent standards. Chancellor of Drug Safety: Sir Albert HortonDepartment of Food Safety  The Department of Food Safety inspects all food products to make sure that they meet the highest quality and health standards. Chancellor of Food Safety: Sir Joe CasperDepartment of Nutrition  The Department of Nutrition develops nutritional guidelines for Zinaire and insures the compliance of food companies. Chancellor of Nutrition: Lady Samantha OverstreetEducational Authority  The Education Authority manages Zinaire's extensive network of public schools and universities and performs educational outreach and advertising. Minister of Education: Lady Sarah WhiteEnvironmental Authority  The Environment Authority is charged with maintaining Zinaire's forests, grasslands, rivers, oceans and other natural treasures as well as passing environmental legislation. Minister of the Environment: Sir Thomas KnotTransportation Authority  The Transportation Authority is responsible for Zinaire's roadways in addition to licensing for motor vehicles, vehicle safety inspections and shipping. Minister of Transportation: Lady Grace UnderwoodDepartment of Licensing  The Department of Licensing licenses Zinairian drivers/pilots and their vehicles and makes any legislation related to those activities. Chancellor of Licensing: Sir Thomas GreeneDepartment of Motor Safety  The Department of Motor Safety conducts safety tests on all new vehicles for sale in Zinaire. Chancellor of Motor Safety: Sir Michael AlbertsInformation Authority  The Information Authority is responsible for the creation and distribution of literature promoting the nation and government of Zinaire both inside the country and internationally. Also, although there are currently no banned books or websites in Zinaire, the Information Authority is capable of doing so should the need arise. Minister of Information: Lady Samantha SilversteinDepartment of Information Distribution  The Department of Information Distribution has been accused of propaganda in the past. In reality, propaganda is the smallest portion of its job with most of its time devoted to international outreach (sometimes in cooperation with the Department of Diplomacy). Chancellor of Information Distribution: Lady Alexandra AlbriteForeign Relations  Zinaire has almost exclusively positive relationships with foreign nations. Some attribute this to the uncannily polite and personal letters which come out of the Foreign Authority. Zinaire has a growing ambassadorial program with approximately a dozen of it's own ambassadors and another dozen from foreign nations on its soil. This program has led to free trade and non-aggression agreements with a number of nations.Military  The Zinairian Armed Forces are made up of two million men and women in three branches: the Zinairian Army, the Zinairian Air Force and the Zinairian Navy. Chronic under-equipment is a problem as the defense budget makes up less than 10% of Zinaire's annual spending. There have been allegations that the law and order budget has been used to supplement this. However, the small amount of equipment that the military does have is very high quality. Some soldiers even complain that there is not enough low-cost equipment to do things such as ship-to-shore transport and scouting. One becomes eligible for military service only after he has graduated high school. There is no compulsory military service. At age forty-five, one is not longer eligible to serve in the Zinairian Armed Forces.Branches Army  The Zinairian Army makes up the majority of the Zinairian Armed Forces\u2013 approximately one million troops. The army performs all ground combat roles as well as many special tasks (diplomatic protection, border patrols, etc.). The equipment needs of the army are frequently overlooked as the air force and navy, the more glamorous branches, are expanded.Navy  The Zinairian Navy conducts the armed force's nautical actives. Despite being an island nation, Zinaire did not have a navy until recently. In order to get the navy started, over 100 billion dollars of equipment has been purchased in recent years. The navy comprises slightly more than 500,000 troops.Air Force  The Zinairian Air Force is has few fixed-wing aircraft, focusing mainly on helicopters. The air force has a number of high-tech stealth aircraft including six B-2 Spirits valued at $1.2 billion USD each. The air force makes up approximately 450,000 troops.Royal Orbathian Foreign Legion  Recently, 10,000 troops from the Army of Zinaire were temporarily signed over to the Royal Orbathian Foreign Legion for training in exchange for military aid. Soldiers that have been committed to the program will be serving for between three and fifteen years. As part of the deal, an Orbathian training camp is also being established in South Zinaire.Facilities  Due to the relatively small size of the island and the limited military budget, Zinaire has only two main military bases currently in service.Zinairian National Facilities  The Zinairian National Facilities consist of the Zinairian National Airbase and the Zinairian National Army HQ. The base is located approximately 100 km (62 miles) southeast of Zinaire City.Zinairian National Airbase  The Zinairian National Airbase (ZNA) stores Zinaire's fleet of aircraft. The hangars at the airbase are currently at only 20% of capacity. The base has ten runways and a dozen helipads (helicopters are a popular form of transportation in Zinaire). The entire Zinairian Air Force is stationed out of ZNA.Zinairian National Army HQ  The Zinairian National Army HQ (ZNAHQ) is the main base of operations for Zinaire's army. There is storage for equipment and vehicles as well as barracks for troops. Because of the technology available, many remote command operations are carried out from here.Southern Zinairian Facilities  Located on the coast, slightly less than 50 km (30 miles) south of Grise, is the newly constructed Southern Zinairian Facilities. Built to replace the old southern base of operations approximately 75 km (45 miles) west of Grise and north of Belle-C\u00f4te, these facilities include the Southern Zinairian Army HQ and the Southern Zinairian Naval HQ.Southern Zinairian Naval HQ  Southern Zinairian Naval HQ (SZNHQ) is the navy's base of operations. It includes facilities for storing and repairing ships and aircraft as well as living quarters for soldiers. There is also one runway and two helipads.Royal Orbathian Foreign Legion Training Camp  In exchange for military aid from Orbath, the old southern base of operations approximately 75 km (45 miles) west of Grise and north of Belle-C\u00f4te is being converted into a training camp for the Royal Orbathian Foreign Legion.Demographics  Zinaire has a population of approximately nine million and a population density of 64 inhabitants per square kilometer (103 per square mile). Zinaire's population has been steadily growing since it's independence.Urban Areas  Zinaire City, the nation's capital is also the largest city with approximately four million citizens. The unofficial capital of South Zinaire, Tiamona, has a population of two million.Ethnicity and Religion  Recent polls showed that 82% of Zinairians identify as Christian (denominations unknown), 10% as atheist of agnostic, 6% as Jewish and 2% as other. The reason for the unusually high populations of atheists/agnostics and Jews is unknown. Another poll indicates that 72% of Zinairians are Cuacasian, 16% are of African descent, 9% are Asian, 2% are Hispanic and 1% is other. The very low percentage of Hispanics despite the proximity to South America is another mystery.Media  There is almost total freedom of speech in Zinaire but this is hardly evident in the media. The Zinairian News Network (ZNN) had a near monopoly on the newsstands (as well as the televisions and the radios) of the nation. However, the newer Zinairian Edition is gaining popularity with print news that is considered \"refreshing\" and \"different.\" Some experts believe that in five years, Zinairian Edition will have the majority market share of print news. There is also the Zinairian Informer, the pro-government paper run by the Information Authority.Economy  Although Zinaire has a reasonably strong economy for a nation its size, the majority of governmental spending goes towards sustaining the crucial automotive industry. Another substantial portion of the budget is used to fight Zinaire's high crime rate. The remainder is divided between keeping Zinaire's forests lush and rehabilitating the armed forces. One of the major reasons that Zinaire's government has a troublesomely small budget is the total lack of taxation in the country.Business  The Zinairian private sector was once dominated by the information technology giant Overmill. However, government handouts have spurred the automotive industry forward, pushing Zinairian Motor Works to the forefront of Zinaire's economy. Since the \"motor renaissance\" began, Zinaire's economy has improved greatly. Various independent trout farms line the Mossy River in such great numbers that trout farmer is Zinaire's #3 industry. The #4 industry, arms manufacturing, is led by DeTal-Stevens a mid-sized weapons and defense contractor that currently operates only within Zinaire but may soon begin export.The American Privateer  You have reached the PMT Version of The American Privateer. For the FT Version, please click here.Geography  The American Privateer occupies a Sub-Continent, with the full of the 3 billion citizens living on the Island. Due to the crowding on the Sub-Continent, the government has declared Mare Tranquillitatis and Mare Serenitatis open to colonization.Land Area  Land Area: 3,885,820 sq km Coastline: 19,819 kmClimate  The climate of The American Privateer is very similar to that of the Midwest United States across most of the interior, with a large desert strip running the eastern coast, due to the rain shadow from the mountains on that side, and a lush rain forest filling the valleys and vales of the northern mountains.Terrain  The West Coast and Central/South of the nation are mainly flat lands, leading up to the Northern and Eastern Mountains. All along the middle of the nation, small hill ranges rise, usually carved through the middle by rivers.Elevation Extremes Lowest  The lowest point in The American Privateer is the Chico Rio Canyon in the southern section of the Nation. The Chico Rio Canyon has a lowest point of seventy feet below sea level, which is a hundred feet below the mouth of the canyon.Highest  The Highest point is Mt. Erebus in the Hell Ranges. It rises almost three kilometers above sea level, and is a highly active volcano.Natural Hazards Maritime Claims Island Chains  The Island chains off the western coast are home to large numbers of small fishing villages. They are remote, and the fishing boats are kept in the area. As such, a Bush Plane Industry exists transporting people and supplies to the Islands. They are also popular vacation spots, where people who own Flying Boats are able to fly in and spend a week or so. The Principal Island Chains areExtra Planetary Claims Mare Tranquiliatus  The American Privateer has claimed a small, 5,000 man colony on the moon, where it works on new compounds, mainly for armor and load bearing purposes. The Moon also houses a small observatory for deep space telemetry, monitoring for any kinds of dangerous objects.Mare Serenitatus  Mare Serenitatus is home to Neil Armstrong Air Force Base, wih two squadrons of Space Fighters, and a squadron of Transports located there.16 Psyche  A large Iron Bearing Asteroid, it is owned by the military, who is able to mine several million tons of iron ore automatedly.Ceres  A Dwarf Planet, Ceres is home to a small refueling base for the journey between Jupiter and EarthEuropa  Home to an automated listening post, Europa Base is primarily a SETI Installation. Under the radiation hardened dome lies a tunnel to the icy oceans of the moon, part of an ongoing attempt to investigate the life found ont he planet.Jupiter  Several probes sit in Jupiter's atmosphere, studying the contents and looking for \"Sky Fish\" that are believed to live in the skies over Jupiter.Io  Home of the RGS Io Volcanic Observatory, the IVO exists purely to study the intense Geological events that occur under the surface of the massive moon.Titan  Home to an automated Gas Mining Facility, the Hydrocarbons common on Titan are used to fuel ships, and are shuttled to Earth and to Ceres for fuel and replenishmentDemographics Faith Economy Energy Electricity Sources  Nuclear Fission Reactors Solar Power Plants River Turbines Wind Turbines Tidal Power Stations Geothermal Power GeneratorsNatural Monuments and Parks Liberty Tree National Cemetery  Liberty Tree National Cemetery is the holies ground on the continent. The Cemetery is bordered by a line of Southern Live Oaks. At the center stand 56 California Redwoods, one each for the Signers of the Declaration of Independence. The gates into the cemetery bear the quote \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\" Inside, the graves are marked by war, unit, and name. Though the dead are usually buried elsewhere, all soldier have a marker in the cemetery. Those who earn the Congressional Medal of Honor are buried under the Redwoods, giving way to the saying, \"Don't be a hero, the shade aint worth it!\"Hades National Park  Located on the western slope of the Hades Mountains, Hades National Park is the home to the nation's largest volcano. Now just a massive crater, the floor of the crater is teeming with geysers and Hydro-thermal landmarks. the RGS, Republic Geological Service, is based near the crater due to the intense geological activity of the area.Palace of Memorium  A proposed supertall project to be built on Ground Zero, this massive tower, based on the Palace of Soviets, will have the names of all those slaughtered by The Northern Baltic in their brutal assault on the Cheyene Orbital Command Center, as well as the assaults on the Space City Elevator and the brutal and deliberate assault on the bridges over the Emergency Canal. On top of the Spire will sit a statue of Rebeca St. James, president during the war, who helped to keep the country together in a time of genocidal war, massive monsoons, and the eruption of Hades Supervolcano.Education Primary & Secondary Schools  Primary Schools, unlike other schools in the system, are chosen based on location. Vouchers are available for parents who want to send their kids to Parochial Schools, but there are no Private Educational Facilities at the Primary Level. Students go from Kindergarten to Sixth Grade as Primary School Students. Secondary Schools are all non-governmental. Divided between Private Educational Facilities and Parochial Middle Schools, the Secondary School is dominated by Vouchers and Entrance Exams.Entrance Exams  The Entrance Exams are a set of five tests given over a month, that show what schools the student qualifies for. Different Secondary Schools have different standards of acceptance based on how well the students do.High School  Grades 10-12 are served here, and they are more loose in their codes overall. At this point, Private Military High Schools emerge, in which a student begins to train for a future military Career. Also introduced are Juvenile Detention and Educational Facilities for students who have committed crimes and are still able to be re-introduced into society.

It borders the Holy Empire of Pedro Saldrov, part of the federation of Ultra Mexico. Yucatan New Prussia is has a population of 192 million and is considered a developed lower-high income country having an average incom per capita of $28,045 nominal or of $34,715 at purchasing power parity. It's GDP of $9.796 (nominal) or $12.042 trillion (PPP) gathers most of it's income from oil, agriculture, military technologies, mining and automobile production. Yucatan New Prussia was formed in it's current states after a treaty was signed in 2154 between the leaders of the Second Mayan Empire and the Reichastyne Empire, Emperor Kabolxobab XII and Kaisnarnovi Kuznetkev. Yucatan New Prussian came into existence when the Mayan corporatist party of the Yucatan peninnsula of the Holy Empire of Padro Saldrov attempted to succeed from the Holy Empire. The newly proclaimed nation than formed an alliance with the Reichastyne Empire to gain securities and a powerfull ally to help them in there war of independance against the Saldrovids. The nation is known for it's vibrant culture, a mix between the cultures of the Mayan Corporatists and German immagrants from the Reichastyne Empire. Despite being considered a developed nation and a major economic power the Colony of Yucatan New Prussia continues to suffer from rampant corruption, organized crime and outbreaks of the biological mutation, \"Emocarsenigenic Mutagenic Omnivirus\" also known as the EMO virus.History Estados Unidos Mexicanos  During the old days of the Estados Unidos Mexicanos (1912-2083) the Mayan people were mainly low to upper middle class workers and small business people living in what were at the time some of the least developed parts of the nation. Mexican culture dominated and pervaded most of the society with little but still significant Mayan influence. The Mexican government while not particularly freindly with the Mayan peoples left them alone for the most part and for most of the time ignored the Mayans (which through isolation and neglect would later give rise to the Mayan seperatists) the Mayans at this time lived relatively normal lives with little governence from the capital.Hugopian Mexico  In the summer of 2083 the armies of the Hugopian Empire swept across Mexico and eventually annexed the entirety of Mexico in 2085. Mexico under Hugopian rule was given the new name of Mezhikoanyus Hugopyeskayachunyo, Hugopian Mexico in the Hugopian language. Under Hugopian rule all forms of Mexican and Mayan culture were banned and were replaced with Hugopian culture. Spanish and Mayan languages were banned from being spoken in public and Hugopian culture was taught in schools. Despite being forced to learn Hugopian culture, the population of the Yucatan managed to retain there customs succesfully throuout the 52 year long Hugopian rule until it ended in 2137.Imperial Saldrovid Rule  In 2129 the first signs of the Hugopian empire's imenent collapse began to become obvious when Emperor Hugo the first began to become too fat and lethargic to succesfully manage his entire empire which stretched all the way from the southern tip of south america to the border of Imperial America and United Statesia. It was at this point that the Hugopian government began planning on how to best divide the empire up but still maintain Hugopian dominance throughout it's former territories. Eventually the Hugopian leadership agreed that the best way to manage the territories while still having them under Hugopian control would be to devide the empire by it's seperate cultural enclaves and install leaders loyal to Hugopia in to power called Daidiochinos. The states under Daidiochino control were given the right to govern as the saw fit as long as they maintained positive relations with Hugopia and it's allies. The Daidiochino given control of the Yucatan was a Hugopian general of mixed Mexican-Hugopian deccent named Pedro Saldrov, who was given control of all lands north of the Panama canal up to the United Statesian border. In 2137 the Hugopian empire ended it's rule of the Mexican territory and power was transferred to the new government of Pedro Saldrov. The empire was dubbed \"The Holy Empire of Pedro Saldrov\" although the nation was more commonly known as the \"Saldrovid Empire\" under the Saldrovid rule the Yucatan prospered economically but it's people suffered from constant human rights violations stemming from the Saldrovids deepset preferance for Aztecan and Mexican culture. It was at this time that many of the Yucatan's great cities were built.The Neo Mayan Grand Duchy of Uxmaal  In 2043 the Saldrovid empire began to loosen it's hold over it's colonies and began to let certain ehtnic groups create semi-autonomous regions throuout the country. The Mayans took this opprotunity to create a Mayan cultural autonomous zone based around the city of Uxmaal. During this time a Mayan cultural reniscance took place and thousand year old forgotten traditions were brought back and the Mayan culture began to take hold of society. The Mayans soon realized that they had become a major force and the City of Uxmaal, now one hundred sixty kilometers in size was granted the status of city-state within the Saldrovid empire. The new city state was given the title of The Neo Mayan Grand Duchy of Uxmaal.Granted Autonomy  In 2049 the Grand Duchy of Uxmaal was expanded to include most of the Yucatan penninsula and was granted special status of being one of the five autonomous city states in the Saldrovid empire. The Mayans quickly began working at expanding the economy of the nation and each year the nation grew faster than the previous. Dspite being an autonomous region they were still forced to pay taxes to the Saldrovid government and were forced to trade oil and manufactured goods at very low prices to the rest of the Saldrovid empire.Rise of the Corporatists  The city state's economy grew rapidly especially in the fields of oil and indstrial production giving rise to the five largest Yucatan corporations, Uxmaal Motorkar Industries, Wastek Elektronikorp, Chintontoonpek Oil, Xibiilavuup Militar and Kabolxobab Konglomorate. These companies realized that the Saldrovid government was holding them back from realizing there true potential as an economic superpower and began to build a military force large enough to ensure that no one would stand in the way of the Yucatan's wish to succed.Succesion from Ultra-Mexico  In 2054 by a sweeping referendum in the Saldrovid congress it was decided that instead of the Saldrovid empire being the dominant force in control of all of Mexico that each state would have total control over there own affairs as there own nation state and that the five city states and the Saldrovid empire would be united with equal say as seperate states within a greater Union called Ultra-Mexico. The Six states in the country would be the Saldrovid empire (the largest), The Holy Empire Microsoft-Tenochtitlan, The Grand Duchy of Los Emos Mexicanos, The Protectorate of Valdez Industria, The Holy Empire of Aztek Xiejukohatlang and the Neo Mayan Grand Duchy of Uxmaal. The Grand Duchy of Uxmaal refused and declared themselves an independent nation. Leading the independence movement was CEO of Kabolxobab Konglomorate, Ich'kaboix Kabolxobab. The other nations of the Federation of Ultra Mexico protested but it was decided that it would be to costly to attampt to force the Mayans into the federation.Second Mayan Empire  The Mayans declared themselves an independent nation in 2154. The Nation was called the Second Mayan empire and was to continue in the footsteps of the Mayan empire that collapsed in the 1400s. The nation was a corporate monarchy meaning that whoever was the CEO of the Kabolxobab Konglomorate would be emperor of the nation. It's firs Emperor was Ich'kaboix Kabolxobab XI. The nation soon rose to international promonence as major producer of oil and industrial materials and chemicals. While the Second Mayan Empire prospered, the rest of Ultra-Mexico suffered as oil imports were now too expensive, and widespread energy shortages caused the federation to slide into a deep depression. It was at this point that it was decided that the Mayans must be forced back into the federation.The Mayan Mexican War  In 2158 a Ultra-Mexican force stormed across the borders of the Second Mexican Empire with the main goal of destroying the capability of the Second Mayan Empire to control the country tsleaving the territory of the Yucatan open for annexation by Ultra-Mexico. The initial attack was succesful, as Aztec, Microsoft-Tenochtitlan, and Valdez mech, armored and infantry divisions swept through the country side while the Saldrovid empire commenced airstrikes and missle attacks against the Mayans larger cites.Economy Military by country  This category organizes articles on militaries (meaning the armed forces of states, not just armies) by the countries\u2014both modern and historical\u2014that created them.

Human presence on Radia can be traced back to approximately 2400 B.C., although there is no concrete evidence supporting the fact that this presence became definitive before 1200 B.C. Radia also witnessed an invasion of unknown colonists circa A.D. 350, of which no trace remains today. The Society of Shaytan Ukhiross is pluricultural, with the coexistence of three main ethnic groups: the Thaross, the Corianans and the Dostliani. Interactions between them is largely peaceful, but old feuds do occasionally re-emerge, especially inside the political arena. With 1000 years of internal and external conflicts, Shaytan Ukhiross has a past full of blood and iron. The peace built by these battles, although lasting, is not devoid of revenants. With both a large territory and population, the Federated States are considered a great power, and a vital checkpoint on the South Pacific trade routes.Geography & Climate  Commonly, the island of Radia is divided into four parts: the Northern Landes (Shyrog), Valdyr, Medguarde and Thaross. The many outer archipelagos controlled by Shaytan Ukhiross are regrouped under the name Cyliads.The Northern Landes  Main article: Northern Landes Also known as Shyrog (Cold Hills in Radian), The Northern Landes is a hilly area covered with lush vegetation, mostly pinewood forests. Although blessed by generous rainfall, the region is also known for its harsh winters. Important locations there include the Plains of Rolfe, Castel-Rouge (main military base in the northern areas) and, last but not least, the Capitol of Union City.Valdyr  Main article: Valdyr Originally called \u00dbdan Valdyr (Radian: New Steel), Valdyr's geographical landscape is the most mountainous of the four regions. Its valleys are known for their rich metal deposits, which ever since ancient times attracted flocks of miners and prospectors. The area's climate is warm and dry, but still quite cool when compared with those in the Radian south. Important locations there include the underground mining town of Kem, the Cathedral of Croix-des-Rois and the Fortress of Fort-Sheril.Medguarde  Main article: Medguarde Medguarde used to be the Radian heartland, and has consequently been the stage for much of the nation's bloody history. Some even say that the ground in this region has been reddened by all the blood shedded throughout centuries. Contrasting with the northern territories, Medguarde has an extremely flat terrain, and a very hot climate. Hot and dry also, resulting in widespread desertification across the region. Much of the northern and western areas of Medguarde have today fallen into abandonment, while the southern areas, also known as Rong, are prospering due to their proximity with many important harbors such as Kolnor and Meniv.Thaross  Main article: Thaross Also known as Roshrya, the easternnmost region of Shaytan Ukhiross is also the most populous. An estimated 57% of the Radian population live there. A region mostly made up of plains, Thaross' climate is tropical. Weather is humid and hot all year long, while floods and typhoons are common sights. Important cities include Harven, the most important harbor in the sector, and the fortress city of Threon.Cyliads  Main article: Cyliads The Cyliads in the collective name given to all archipelagos conquered by Radia throughout history. It covers a relatively small area, with the most important island being Xalmina, a volcanic atoll where thermal power is currently being experimented.Demography  The population of Shaytan Ukhiross can be divided into three main ethnic groups: the Thaross, the Corianans and the Dostliani.The Thaross  By far the most numerous of the three with an estimated number of 5 billion, the Thaross live in the eastern, tropical areas of Radia. Native to the island, the Thaross first built up their civilization in the (then) fertile Medguarde area, rapidly expanding to control the whole island. The Thaross typically have dark-brown skin and blond hair. They are said to be carefree, ingenious and persistent.The Corianans  Next in terms of numbers, the Corianans are the descendants of European (mostly French) settlers. Their earliest presence on Radia is believed to be around A.D. 1100, when a French explorer wrecked his ship near the shores of the region now called Coriano. From the 14th century onwards, steady influx of European settlers continued to enlarge the Corianan population and, by the end of the 17th century, their numbers became so important that conflicts (over land) erupted regularly, mainly against the Thaross. The Aralian Emperors, then-rulers of Shaytan Ukhiross, decided to take action. A peace agreement was reached in A.D. 1723. The Corianans typically have pale skin and brown hair. They are said to be artful and cunning.The Dostliani  The Dostliani are a reclusive race of unclear origins (some experts say slavic), living mostly in the cold Northern Landes. They are known to maintain an extremely rigid lifestyle, dictated by strict rules and traditions. The Dostliani typically have extremely pale skin and black hair.History  Shaytan Ukhiross has been the witness of a rather tumultuous history. It underwent the reign of several dynasties, republics and nearly as numerous conflicts and strifes. It could be adequate to describe the history of this nation as unending change, something its motto seems to confirm. Main article: List of Radian heads of state per dynastyFoundation  It would be hard to determine Shaytan Ukhiross' exact date of foundation, since history books and memories are often rewritten following each shift of power. However, in recent times, most historians have agreed upon the identity of the founding dynasty: the Nielfar, or Horu as they are called in Thaross. Their reign is supposed to have begun in 1054 B.C., with the rise of Emperor Razyck Nielfar, and ended in 899 B.C., following the usurpation of the throne by Koruan Sxodaron. Nothing has been clearly remembered from this period other than the Victory of Emperor Razyck (sometimes attributed to his son, Taxxiak) near the modern city of Erun, against a neighboring tribe, the Orlsam, who menaced his kingdom.Growth in Power  Soon after the Sxodaron Dynasty's ascension, and due to adequate administrative plannings and charismatic leadership, the military and economical powers of Radia reached what seemed like a peak compared to the neighboring regions of Radia. Conquests soon followed, mostly led by the second Emperor, Sylimn Sxodaron, resulting in an empire greatly enlarged, but inversely difficult to manage and control, so much that after five generations, the Sxodaron Empire was on the verge of collapse.Fall and Rebirth  Not much is known about the chaotic times which followed the Sxodaron sixth emperor, Minerya's death (671 B.C.). For many, the likeliest outcome of these wars would have been a 'partition' of the empire by dominant local leaders. Yet, defying logic, the Sxodaron continued their reign until 555 B.C., when the last emperor, Fnarya, peacefully gave up his powers in favor of the Hyrten family (a rare occasion of non-hostile power transfer). Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the survival of the Sxodaron, and their eventual re-prospering, the most commonly accepted one being outside help from a southern kingdom known as Roshrya, as its military power at the time was the only one capable of realizing such a feat. Opponents of this theory have, however, pointed out the long-time hostile relationhip between Rosh and the Sxodaron Empire, which eventually would develop into a bloody rivalry in the future.The Hyrten and Dolbar Dynasties  The times of Hyrten family, and their successors, the Dolbar, commonly known as the 'six centuries of peace' (551 B.C. - A.D. 115), were actually not devoid of conflicts. Facts were quite the contrary. From 472 B.C. onward, the Empire began to suffer repeated defeats at the hands of its rivals on Radia, so much that when the first Dolbar Emperor, Sodimest, took over Shaytan Ukhiross, the country was only half the size it had during the reign of the early Sxodaron emperors. The 'peace' name frequently associated with the period is in fact mostly due to the economical miracles engendered by the Hyrten and the Dolbar through the development of early maritime trade routes with the rest of the South Pacific, and South America as well.A New Era  The commercial migth built up by the Hyrten and the Dolbar finally allowed their successors, the Khalgin, to turn the tables on their enemies and achieve total control of Radia. This was not done, however, without the assistance of another powerful family, the Shandia. Documents which survived imperial persecutions (conducted by later dynasties) reveal that the two families used to work hand in hand, the Khalgin handling the financial matters (and the throne), and the Shandias taking care of military campaigns. This cooperation worked well, at least until a new military threat reached the northen shorelines of Radia. After the defeats of Koldunor (A.D. 359) and Multaurus (A.D. 420) to an enemy commonly known as the 'colonizing powers', discord erupted between the two families, ultimately leading to their mutual destruction.Colonization  The exact identity of the 'colonizing powers' who vanquished the Khalgin at their apogee (that would be, A.D. 350) is today shrouded with mysteries, for the following dynasties had no reason to keep in their records a period they viewed with utter embarrassment. Still, it is true that over the century which followed their arrival on Radian soil, the 'colonizing powers' had conquered a substantial part of it, and forced the other to submission and unequal treaties. It was not until A.D. 560 and the establishment of the Redluna Empire that resistance was ignited.Revolt and Democracy  Main article: Battle of Feing It is ironic to see that a regime which was originally set up by the colonists as a puppet government contributed directly to their downfall on Radia. Indeed, the creation of the Redluna Empire, led by remnants of the Shandia family, was an initiative launched by the colonists in response to the rise in southern Radia of a potentially threatening force, the Runlong (thought to actually be Roshrya). When the Runlong were eventually crushed, the Redluna Empire had already grown independent from the colonizing powers. Ultimately, the colonists were cornered by a two-front war: one against the military power of the Redluna Empire, and the other against millions of oppressed citizens. In A.D. 674, the last colonist was wiped out of Radia, leaving the Shandia family as sole leader of the large island. Determined not to follow the steps of those who lost Radia to invaders, the Shandia family created the first democratic state of the island's history. The target of this reform was actually not to give power to the masses, but rather to guarantee that no individual in the future would exert an authority as great as that possessed by the Khalgin and the Shandia at the time of their dispute.The Radian Community  Following the Redluna Empire were two short-lived successors, the Sralonia Republic and the Isink Alliance, both democratic states which, in A.D. 979, merged to form the Radian Community, which lasted until A.D. 1182. Curiously enough, not a single document of this epoch survived, this possibly being due to the undeniable successes the nation is said to have enjoyed in military engagements and commercial wars, and the damage these might have caused to the prestige of its less democratic successors.Civil War and Aralian Rule  History offers no clear reason as to why a successful state such as the Radian Community ceased to exist in such an abrupt manner. While some assume that it is only the natural course of things, a more concrete scenario involves a division of the country between four (or more) dominant factions, one of them being Roshrya, the founder of the Community's successor, the Imperium of Shaytan Ukhiross. No matter what the truth is, facts have that Roshrya and its leaders, the Aralia family, achieved supremacy circa A.D. 1223 and have remained governors of the island since, enforcing their control through systematic 'purges' of political opponents.An Envoy from the West  Europeans first reached the shores of Shaytan Ukhiross in the early days of the 12th century, and established settlements in the then sparsely-populated northeastern corner of the island. Their population grew steadily, and expansion inevitably began. Initially turning a blind eye on them (Radia was large after all), the Aralian Emperors decided to take action when encroachments on imperial territory became serious. The war lasted three years, and ended with the peace treaty of Arkis, under which the Corianans created their own, autonomous states of Irulance and Coriano, but had to pay regular tributes to the Aralian Emperors.The Leviathan Falls Apart  After centuries of autocracy, the Aralia, with no opponents left inside and no real enemy outside Radia, finally began to loosen their grip, with their most visible act being the slow 'federation' of the country (although regular emissaries from the capital retained many powers), and the renaming of the nation into the Federated States of Shaytan Ukhiross. As years passed, democracy steadily gained grounds and, ultimately, when the emperor Drazel Kulin Dominikan Aralia died in 1894 without a successor, the Imperium was reorganized into a true Federation.Political Deadlock  One of the direct consequences of the Aralia dynasty's fall was that Shaytan Ukhiross did not have a strong, central authority anymore. Worse still, after long centuries of peace, the eight states which make up the nation did not have any uniting purpose, and old rivalries (especially between the Thaross and the Corianans) began to resurface. Endless bickering in the Grande Assembl\u00e9e became daily routine, as the different political forces within the country effectively came to a standstill: no one held a decisive advantage. At the dawn of the third millenar, The nation of Shaytan Ukhiross faces many questions, yet does not possess any coherent answer. Unless...?Government & Politics  Extremely authoritarian in the beginning of the ninetennth century, the Shaytan Ukhiross government has progressively showed signs of opening toward the populace, before ultimately becoming a true federation in 1900. Said federation includes eight states: Thaross, Rogen, Irulance, Coriano, Valdyr, Medguarde, Valarc and Tarinia. Each of these enjoys a high amount of autonomy.The Grande Assembl\u00e9e  The Grande Assembl\u00e9e is currently the highest governing body of the Federated States of Shaytan Ukhiross. It includes 368 members (Magistrates), representing the eight States of the nation, and is presided by one Chancellor (chosen amongst and by the Magistrates). All Magistrates are directly elected by the population.The Guilds  The decisions made by the Directorate and the Grande Assembl\u00e9e are given to the Guilds for execution. Five guilds exist as of A.D. 2011. These are the War Guild, the Scriptor Guild, the Order, the Militia and the Architect Guild.The War Guild  The War Guild is responsible for all interventions, no matter hostile, peace-keeping or part of an international effort in other countries. It also supervizes all military institutions and major training camps in Shaytan Ukhiross. All high-ranked military officers in Shaytan Ukhiross are members of the War Guild.The Scriptor Guild  The Scriptor Guild handles the management of education and research in Shaytan Ukhiross.The Order  Formerly a paramilitary organization under the direct supervision of the Aralian Emperors, the Order acts today as the special forces of the Federated States. It is known to carry out espionage operations.The Militia  The militia, contrarily to the War Guild, is handling internal security, occupying the role occupied by the police in other countries. Its members are mostly drawn from the populace before undergoing a two-years formation.The Architect Guild  The Architect Guild is usually seen taking care of the construction, management and maintenance of infrastructures and facilities across Shaytan Ukhiross.Military  Main article: Military history of Shaytan Ukhiross Historically, the Shaytan Ukhiross military has been relying heavily on mass conscription. All major conquests and victories achieved by the nation were carried out through mass conscription, and the governing authorities saw little need to make change. Even after the mass-production of heavy vehicles such as tanks or walkers, there was no sign of divergence from this tradition. Improvements did occur, however, in order to face the threat imposed by heavily armored attackers. Innovative technologies have appeared, such as the Gunraz (an improved railgun) and the KOMET biological exoskeleton. These, however, are only given to the finest of the finest. Shaytan Ukhiross is not known to possess nuclear devices of any kind.Infantry  Main article: Shaytan Ukhiross Territorial Forces Shaytan Ukhiross reported a personnel strength of 8,779,450, of which 60% are regular force, 35% are regular reserve, and the remaining 5% occupying various high position in the Militia hierarchical structure. The standard-issued rifle for the Territorial Forces is the RK-5 'Ripper,' while the main battle tank is the FT-6 'Herald.'Navy  Main article: Shaytan Ukhiross Armada The Navy has been a priority ever since the ancient Thaross chased the colonists out of Radia. It therefore focuses on homeland defense, and includes many heavily-armored warships. Recent developments led by the Scriptor Guild are seeking the fielding of less powerful, but more mobile and more numerous warships.Air Force  Main article: Shaytan Ukhiross Strategic Airfleet While early commanders rarely cared about the importance of aerial battlefield control, preferring instead to pour men towards the enemy positions, thinking has evolved amidst the military of the Federated States, and the Air Force has become a full-fledged branch of the army, with reliable, sturdy and (above all) numerous aircrafts. Their main fighter is the FA-III 'Partisan.'Space Force  Main article: Shaytan Ukhiross Legion of Pioneers Following the space race's rising in intensity, the Grande Assembl\u00e9e, in one of its rare unanimous votes, decided that the formation of a professional space regiment was an absolute necessity for the nation to remain competitive.Economy  Shaytan Ukhiross has a free-market economy, with a GDP per capita of $34,568 and relatively low rate of poverty. The Kural is the currency for the nation, including outer archipelagos (Cyliads). Rich in natural resources, Shaytan Ukhiross is a major exporter of agricultural products, particularly wheat and wool, minerals such as iron-ore and silver, and energy in the forms of liquified natural gas and coal. Although Agriculture (concentrated in the Thaross region) and natural resources constitute only 3% and 5% of GDP, respectively, they contribute substantially to export performance. In the past decade, one of the most significant sectoral trends experienced by the economy has been the growth (in relative terms) of the mining sector (in the Valdyr region). In terms of contribution to GDP, this sector grew from around 14.5% in 1993-94, to almost 26% in 2006-07. As of January 2011, the unemployment rate was of 17.5%, a considerably high number when compared with the 7% registered in 1995. This rise is often attributed to the golbal economy crisis. The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education, and financial services, accounts for about 55% of GDP.The Grand Duchy of Kington Langley  Kington Langley (officially The Grand Duchy of Kington Langley) is a recognised sovereign state off the coast of Norfolk located in the North Sea, the nearest coastline is approximatly 10 miles off the coast of the United Kingdom. The territory gained independance from the United Kingdom in 2008, since then it has formed a working economy and a strong army, its government is large but efficient. The Grand Duke leaves most of the political work to the Prime Minister and nation's Parliament. on 18th March, the nations constitution was proposed and also, the national currency was brought into circulation for the first time, the Kington Pound, almost the same value as the British Pound. Kington Langley is now a prosperous nation full of culture and pride and is one of the most endorsed and most respected nations in Europe, as of 12th June 2010 it is the 222th most influencial nation in Nationstates (25th in Europe). nation preceded by Republic of Kington LangleyHistory Formation, Colinisation & The Birth of a Nation  The Grand Duchy of Kington Langley ecompasses the entire island of 'Great Langley', the island was formed out of freak volcanic activity in 2004 when the United Kingdom quickly claimed the island for themselves, a huge population boom caused it to swell well above the population of the British Isles. On 2nd January 2008 the United Kingdom, under immense military pressure by the colony of Great Langley declared Great Langley an independant state inside the Commonwealth, the nation renamed itself The Republic Kington Langley a few days afterwards but still remained inside the Commonwealth. On 23rd April 2009 it formally was accepted into the World Assembly and drafted up its first 'formal' constitution and first national flag. The nation at this point had a bright look on its future.The Civil War  On the 20th August 2009, a military regiment opened fire on one of the southern island military bases and managed to form an armed uprising against the government, the military coup d'etat was successful however the billigerants formed a tighter democracy for Kington Langley had been taken over by huge business companies. After the coup Kington Langley saw an introduction to a National Health Service and a huge decrease in tax, the civil war in Kington Langley turned the nation towards democracy.Democracy Crisis 2009  In October 2009, a month after the civil war and the coup, several nations around the world started to question whether the new Kingtonian governmant was as democratic as the Republic which it had replaced with an Absolute Monarchy on the 1st of September 2009. At a World Assembly global meeting, the political stance of Kington Langley was discussed, the World Assembly never gave their conclusion on the matter but unofficially believe that Kington Langley is a democracy in some form. The debate was finally resolved when it was classed as a 'Centrst Democracy' by the WA in December 2009.Government and Politics Parliament  As a Grand Duchy the nation is more of a dictatorial form of government and the Grand Duke is sovereign, however, the Grand Duke usually entrusts much of the political work to Parliament and the Prime Minister thus it functions day-to-day as a Parliamentary Democracy. The economy, education, health and other areas all go through parliament which makes them more responsible, in many ways, for the nation than the Grand Duke.Foreign Relations  Kington Langley has been independent for a little over one year and has a population of just over 1 billion. It is a fairly influencial nation within Europe already but it has begun to make a name for itself outside of its home region. It currently has embassies in 5 nations and has taken out international schemes such as airport sharing, its flag carrier is now a key member of the Oneworld Airline Alliance which is home to several international flag carrying airlines. Kington Langley has also started to export products, especially automobiles from its flourishing car industry. It also is making deals to import products from other nations, companies such as VLT, which now owns King Motors, Kington Langley's main luxury automobile manufacturer is importing new, foreign automobiles for use on Kingtonian roads. This then helps the economy as VLT's new subsidiary company, VLT Kington Langley, has built 2 production plants to reduce the cost of importing vehicles and also reduces waiting lists for car dealers. Overall Kington Langley is devoting alot of attention to the rest of the world. It currently has been involved in 2 wars to date. The Anglo-Irish war and a voluntary peace keeping role in an ongoing civil war. Kington Langley is classed as 'vassal' on the World Assembly World Factbook and holds just over 180 endorsements. Kington Langley has also stressed since its creation, as a republic and as a grand duchy, that is will remain neutral in most conflicts. It has only broke this promise once and that was their declaration of war on Gael na Eire during the Anglo-Irish War. This has also led to the first signs of expansion for Kington Langley, it now holds the Irish settlement of Sligo as an overseas dependency as a condition of the surrender of Gael na Eire (several other participant states recieved territory). Kington Langley however does offer aid in many conflicts around the world and now has a special medical and aid organisation that helps the civilians of nations at war with other nations and also with themselves. To date, it has been in over 20 wars, helping civilians and injured soldiers. Kington Langley, being a neutral country has never started a war of its own.Tourism and Culture Traditions of Kington Langley  As being a new state, there are not many traditions in Kington Langley, most have come from the people who first arrived, the national sport is Badminton and another popular sport, (believed to be imported from Finnish settlers) is Wife Carrying which is very popular . Traditions created in Kington Langley however are almost impossible to find as the nation is still very new, the largest tradition is the introduction of a brand new language, Kingtonian, which is a mixture of English and Finnish with a hint of Frisian, German and Norman French . But still most traditions in Kington Langley have been imported from other countries such as Fox Hunting which saw a rapid increase in participants after it was banned in the United Kingdom, people from the UK still often take day trips to Kington Langley to fox hunt however Kingtonian authorities are hoping to make this illegal in the near future.Tourism to Great Langley  As a new island, the island of Great Langley is a number one tourist destination and it is 'peak time' all year round as there is everything to do, mountains to the north provide excellent places to ski and the south contains rich fields that are beautiful in the summer months. Another popular reason for tourism is for Kington Langley's unusually relaxed immigration policy, in order to live in Kington Langley and obtain a visa is to have a valid driving licence and the ability to contribute to the community.Economy  Kington Langley's economy was formed after the capital city of Kingsmouth was founded in 2004. The economy developed from a section of the UK economy to an independent flourishing economy. Kington Langley's economy today is stable with the WA rating it at 'Powerhouse'. Over the past few years Kington Langley has been effected by global recession and even war but the economy at the moment is at a stable rate, the recent increase in power of Kingtonian based companies has led to an increase in economical power. Some companies however have put a strain on the economy, for example the recent creation of the Kington Langley Space Agency, the government is set to lose several million before a profit is made. The centre of Kington Langley's economy is the business district of Kingsmouth, it is in the top 100 largest in Europe home to the headquarters of several multinational corperations such as the KLAA, Kington Langley's sole airport operator, the Text Talk Group, Kington Langley's largest telecommunications network and KLBC the largest broadcaster in the country. Outside the cities, Kington Langley has a thriving farming community which still has a sizable stake in the GDP of the country being the largest contributer to GDP outside the cities. One overlooked part of the economy is the motor industry, even though most automobiles in the country are manufactured by foreign companies, one of the most successful cars however is Kingtonian, Howitzer Cars, which create around 30% of all cars on Kingtonian roads. Kington Langley has a flourishing airline industry with it's flag carrier Royal Kingtonian Airways creating more and more links abroad.Geography North Island  The north portion of the island is the location of the huge volcanic activity that took place in 2004 which created the islands, the island chain, simply the 'Great Langley Mountains', also provide a barrier from the cold northerly winds keeping the souther portion of the island warmer than most places on the same latitude, however without the warming effects of the Gulf Stream the island can become pretty cold in the winter. Also, it is home to Greater Langley's largest freshwater lake known as 'Lake Wilts'. This provides much of the nations drinking water and is a popular water sports location in the summer it also is on the route of the River King which the capital of Kingsmouth gets its name. Another amazing feature is the northern cliffs which are some of the highest in Europe, several varieties of seabird have found refuge in these cliff faces only 5 years after their creation.South Island  The southern half of the island is home to 98% of the forests and woodland on Greater Langley, due to its age, there are no deciduous trees on the islands, only coniferous trees such as imported scots pine which occupy the mountains in the north. The south is also home to the nation's capital and largest trading port, the harbour leading into the city is another remarkable geographical feature of the island as well. The southern half of the island is also home to the nation's national animal, the Great Bustard which was introduced by British scientists to spread out the colony they already had on Salisbury Plain.Future of the Island  Due to the composition of the island, like the Hawaiian volcanic islands, the island will slowly crumble into the sea, the nation of Kington Langley already has a plan to save the nation when this eventually does happen. Also, the lake that supplies most of the water is drying up due to global warming and more frequent and longer periods of no rain, the government will soon be forced to import water from Britain, France, Germany or Norway. The Grand Duke, accompanied by the Prime Minister shared their views on the future of Kington Langley and the island of Great Langley and tell the citizens that scientists predict that the island may only survive for a few hundred yearsSee Also External links National Adjectives  This article is about National Adjectives, descriptions about a country and its inhabitants.A B C D E F G H I J K M N O P Q R S T U V W Z Categories by country  For non-people, non-culture articles.

Still being edited in. Authairea is a country in Northeast Europe. The indigenous population historically named it the land of the Authai, which is usually translated in modern English into meaning Authairea. Authairea is notable for the harshness of its climate, with cold bitter winters and arid and hot summers. It used to have fauna and numerous small animal species, however various industrial accidents destroyed the ecosystem, restoration projects are in progress. The population is English speaking, with the indigenous Bulgarians, British and Armenian's being the largest minorities. Spanish, French, Swiss and German are also significant minorities, especially in the cities. Lord Athanasius Ilius is the elected lord and head of state, in his absence he is represented by the nations Military Head. The Lord reigns but does not rule. He has little political influence and his position is mainly symbolic. Political power rests with the democratically elected Parliament of Authairea. The Parliament is under the leadership of the Prime Minister, who is the head of the government.Etymology  Before the middle ages there was no true name for Authairea as the peoples of the area simply referred to it as the land of Authai. The owners land simply called themselves the Authai clans. The first name for Authairea was Crescentius meaning to grow, discovered by the Romans in the 1st century AD, however the distance made trade difficult if not impossible. The name Authairea was coined controversially in the 19th century, as a way to attempt to eliminate the role of the royal line.History  See Full Article: History of Authairea Authairea is one of the most ethnically diverse nations in the world. The first settlers of Authairea were Bulgarian, who probably came to the area between 1 A.D. and 30 A.D. Over the centuries other ethnic groups of Germans, Armenians and French settled in the nation and the combined identity called themselves the Authai clans. By the middle ages the Authai Clans had adopted Christianity and they renamed themselves the Kingdom of Authaira. This was an oppressive Monarchy who ruled with an iron fist, and at times bled the nation dry. It had a strong feudal system and everyone gave their allegiance to the King, there was little internal strife as the royal line was well established and the citizens were heavily controlled by the military. Over the next few centuries these settlers developed into a distinct culture now known as Authairean. The population was divided into districts (regions) and duchy\u2019s (sub regions) which would co-operate, compete and sometimes fight with each other. All however were usually dominated by a leading King or Duke with a Monarch\u2019s powers. By the Industrial Age under King Armonde the Monarchy was heavily unpopular and was falling behind the rest of the world in the new Industrial revolution. The King imposed heavier restrictions on the political freedoms of the people as they became disenchanted by rule by an iron fist and began to desire an end to the power of the King. This soon came to pass with a Revolution in 1863, which instituted a Constitutional Monarchy. However there was still distaste over the existence of the Monarchy and the Royal family was killed and the nation renamed the Republic of Authairea. Later on in 1901 the Republic collapsed and a military dictatorship under General Darmagovich took power in a bloody and horrific massacre of the members of parliament. After great resistance from citizens against the regime the British Empire helped end the conflict. A Federation was formed dividing up the nation after discussion between all sides by the British mediators, it divided the nation into Northern Authairea who supported the dictator, Southern Authiarea who were heavily against the dictator, and Middle Authairea which had a mix of both sides. In the 1930s the Federation managed to stay neutral with Nazi Germany as long as it gave troops and resources free of charge to the oppressive and genocidal regime, and accepted a pro-nazi dictatorship. Later in 1944 the army deposed the dictatorship. When the Russians invaded the rest of Eastern Europe in 1945 the Republic of Authairea sent an urgent telegram to Britain and the United States asking for protection which was refused. However fears were misplaced as Stalin was preoccupied and by the time he had reached the territory it had already declared formal independence. By the 1960's the Federation attempted to rebuild the economy by developing the arms manufacturing sector. This was largely successful though during this period the level of literacy and education continued to decline though the GDP had nearly doubled as a result of new trade routes with the outside world and increased investment of its citizens overseas. In 1995 Authairea boosted education spending and encouraged the development of a large book publishing and information technology sector, this was later to be proved worthwhile and the GDP nearly tripped, also the standard of living increased as the government attempted environment restoration projects and improvement to public health care. Today Authairea is a prosperous nation, that is attempting to sustain economic growth and curtail population growth with a controversial one child and parent selection program.

Today the Authaira Royal Line continues on from the rule of Royal Families, as the nobility related to the Royal Family survived the Revolution. Currently there is a complex ritual in order to become the Monarch (see Monarch Blessing Ritual), usually this involves a democratic vote of the nobility who elect a Lord to be the Monarch of Authairea. The Lord of Authairea is Athanasius Ilius since October the 18th, 2005 as the first member of the Authaira Royal Line to take a role in government since the Revolution of 1863. This was due to extensive negotiations on the 3rd of November 2004 of the government and the nobility; agreement was reached to reinstate the Authaira royal line and establish a legitimate constitutional monarchy in the nation. So far his popularity has reached 85.3% in opinion polls and everyone feels the Monarchy is here to stay. Though there are still some voices for Republicanism, there has been a consistent rise in support for the role of the Monarch in government, particularly due to the support of the upper classes, nobility and the military. The Lord of Authairea as a constitutional monarch is expected to support and be led largely by the government, though at some points in its history the lord has spoken out, particularly on Black Tuesday when a rogue general allowed a terrorist group to kill members of the government. Other duties include taking part in activities across the nation, and signing the bills of Parliament into law.Military  The Authairean military consists of the Authairea Air Force, Authairea Army and the Authairea Coastal Defence. The current military was established on February the 1st 1990 when the Authairean Federation was reformed as the nation of Authairea. The current head of the military is the supreme-general who is elected in a national referendum. However the Authairea military remains small in line with arms control agreements as well as due the choice of quality over quantity. The most major element of the military is the Authairea Air Force, which controls the nuclear arsenal and the space borne satellite defense system . The Authairea Coastal Defense controls the defensive turrets along the coast, 8 aircraft carriers, 16 missile cruisers and 4 nuclear submarines. The Authairea Army consists of major city defense systems such as skycraper mounted laser cannons and missile turrets across the city that can be quickly assembled in place, 6 core military bases in the desert regions, and currently 2 howitzer artillery divisions, 4 tank divisions, and 2 infantry divisions in each city though this changes upon need.Feedback  Note: All these images are from free source sites or made myself OOC: This is has been re-edited, since my other page New Rogernomics was not a great name.  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundGovernment style  Categories of Government Styles are available when a player creates a nation. These influence WA categories and the rest of a nation's initial page. Based on an initial assessment by me in May 2007:Jeuna  Jeuna, officially the Republic of Jeuna (known in Chinese as \u9678\u7684\u598d\u83ef\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: L\u00f9dey\u00e1nhu\u00e1 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) is a country in Aerova. The territory which Jeuna now occupies has been occupied for about 50,000 years by Indigenous Jeunese. After exploratory landings by Ming sailors in the late 11th century, Jeuna was colonized in 1203 and settled through penal transportation as part of the colony of Luyandehua, commenced on 3 March, 1205. As the population grew, more areas were added to the colony, which would eventually form the extent of modern-day Jeuna's borders. Since its establishment, Jeuna has been governed as a liberal democracy, organized variously as a fully-presidential and semi-presidential republic. The capital is Huanmao, located in the Huanmao Central County. The population is mainly concentrated along the coastal areas.Etymology  Jeuna is usually known as Y\u00e1nz\u00e0ihu\u00e1gu\u00f3 (Chinese: \u598d\u8f09\u83ef\u570b) in Mandarin Chinese, translated as 'beautiful and splendid state' or 'country', although this has only been in use since Jeuna's independence. It is also called L\u00f9y\u00e1ndehu\u00e1 (Chinese: \u9678\u598d\u7684\u83ef), meaning \"land of beauty and splendor\". This latter name was more popular in colonial times, but is still in use today, most notably as part of the official title of the country. The origin of the English construct 'Jeuna' is generally accepted as having been a corruption of Y\u00e1nhu\u00e1, a shortening or corruption of the original name.History  Inhabitants of Jeuna before Chinese occupation dates to around 50,000 years ago, when the first settlers from Melanesia began to migrate northward. Most of these were fishermen, with a complex oral history, and are accepted as being the ancestors of current Indigenous Jeunese. They continue to inhabit much of the island of Zaosha. The state of Jeuna was established as a prison colony of the Ming Dynasty in the dynasty's waning years, before it eventually fell to the Qing. Jeuna was intended to foist all dissidents, spies and pro-Qing sympathizers onto another land, and Aerova\u2014the farthest east any explorer had gone\u2014was the perfect backwater in which the early colonists might be expected to die\u2014or at least not get back to the mainland. The Ming Dynastic Colony of Qingan was established on 16 June, 1203, as the basis of the colony of Luyandehua. The Indigenous Jeunese population, estimated at 35,000 at the time of colonization, dwindled rapidly as a result of imported diseases and forced emigration to reserved plots of land. --- When it appeared to the Jeunese that the Communists were about to win the Chinese Civil War, the Jeunese government declared independence. The PRC, preoccupied with other matters, did not initially respond to the claim, and so lost a key moment in the time between the declaration and the arrival of the first Cravanian-made military supplies in late 1942.Government and politics  Jeuna is a constitutional federal republic, organized into a semi-presidential democracy, with an executive, judicial and legislative branch. The legislature, called the National Parliament (Traditional Chinese: \u570b\u6c11\u5927\u6703; pinyin: Gu\u00f3m\u00edn D\u00e0hu\u00ec), often abbreviated as the JNP (Traditional Chinese: \u570b\u5927; pinyin: Gu\u00f3d\u00e0) is bicameral. The cabinet, including the Prime Minister and other senior ministers, collectively makes up the government. These ministers are drawn from, and are responsible to, Parliament. The upper body of Parliament, the Upper House (Traditional Chinese: \u4e0a\u4e0b; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ngxi\u00e0), appoints ministers to government posts. Most ministers are members of, and answerable to, the Lower House (Traditional Chinese: \u623f\u4e0b; pinyin: F\u00e1ngxi\u00e0). Both the Upper and Lower Houses are elected by the people, and members of each serve different terms (five in the Upper; two in the Lower), and have differing powers.Military  Jeuna possesses a sizable military force, which has evolved from being entirely dependent on American hardware to being almost entirely self-sufficient. It is composed of four branches, which are the Republican Guard, Army, Air Force and Navy. Militia units can be called up in times of emergency, under the command of the Ministry of the State. The Republican Guard is responsible for the defense of the President, important government buildings and visiting foreign diplomats and politicians, and supporting the Army and police force. It is composed of two infantry regiments and one vehicle regiment (including several squadrons of emergency vehicles, heavy response units and high-performance pursuit cars).Administrative divisions  Jeuna is divided into\u00a0??? province-level divisions, consisting of\u00a0??? province-level cities and\u00a0??? provinces: The\u00a0??? province-level divisions of Jeuna are subdivided into\u00a0??? county-level divisions (??? districts,\u00a0??? county-level cities,\u00a0??? counties, and\u00a0??? autonomous counties). These are in turn divided into\u00a0??? township-level divisions (??? towns,\u00a0??? townships and\u00a0??? subdistricts). See Administrative divisions of Jeuna for a complete list of county-level divisions.Geography  tbd Major cities: Minor cities:Economy  Close cooperation between government and business, decent technological knowledge and a strong work ethic have contributed to Jeuna's rise to economic prowess. Banking, insurance, arms manufacturing, software engineering, real estate, retailing and telecommunications are all major industries. Jeuna has an enormous industrial capacity, and is host to some of the most advanced corporations, dealing in automobiles, electronic equipment, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, armored vehicles, chemicals, textiles and processed foods. It is home to leading multinational corporations and commercial brands in technology and machinery. Construction has for a long time been one of Jeuna's largest industries, aided with the help of multi-billion dollar government contracts in the civil sector, and arms manufacturing has risen in the past forty years as a source of many jobs and monetary inflow. Transportation in Jeuna is highly developed. As of 2007, there are\u00a0? km (? miles) of paved roadways,\u00a0? airports, and\u00a0? km (? miles) of railways. Air transport is mostly operated by Pan-Luyanhua Airways (PLA) and Jeuna Airlines (JAL). Railways are operated by Jeuna Railways Group, among others. There are extensive international flights from many cities and countries to and from Jeuna. Jeuna's main export partners are the United States\u00a0?%, Cravan\u00a0?%, the Republic of China\u00a0?%, South Korea\u00a0?% and Hong Kong\u00a0?% (for 2006). Jeuna's main exports are military equipment, motor vehicles, electronics, electrical machinery and chemicals. With limited natural resources to sustain economic development, however, Jeuna is largely dependent on other more agricultural countries (like the United States, France and the PRC) to produce most of its needed raw materials; consequently, it imports many goods. Its main import partners are\u00a0? (for 2006). Jeuna's main imports are\u00a0?. Overall, Jeuna's largest trading partner is the United States.Demographics  The majority of Jeuna's population is Han Chinese, while other ethnic minorities include the VoekansCulture  Jeuna has a long history of sporting tradition. Dragon boat racing (a form of crew) is widely popular in the south-west and west. Badminton, golf, soccer, cricket and to a lesser degree tennis, are all popular throughout the country. A fledgling league of American football (gridiron) players has been formed, but it has not yet caught on in a wide sense. Jeuna is widely known for its extensive wildlife preserves in the north-east, and these attract both naturalists and hunters to the area. As a result, several modest towns have sprung up, solely to service these travelers. Quhuamu is the most notable of these, with a population of around 55,000.", "Carte Naruto Shippuden Wiki": "Carte Naruto Shippuden Wiki ", "TODAS LAS ARMAS DE UNCHARTED Wiki": "TODAS LAS ARMAS DE UNCHARTED Wiki ", "War of the Monsters wiki": "War of the Monsters wiki War of the Monsters wiki  Welcome to the Wiki! The wiki about War of the Monsters that anyone can edit.\n80 articles since March 2009. (all pages)Togera  Togera is a gargantuan dinosaur said to be the last of his kind that survived extinction by hibernating beneath the ocean.Background  Spending untold centuries in hibernation at the bottom of the Pacific ocean, Togera was awoken by leaking fuel from one of the disabled UFOs which sunk to the depths in the proximity of the slumbering beast. Togera is believed to be a descendant of the gigantic dinosaurs that once roamed the earth millions of years ago. Now it is possibly the last of it's species. Survival drives it to fight, savagely-morphing it's body to protrude deadly bone spikes and using its body's nuclear energies. It is a scaly horror from the deep, able to make use of glowing plasma-nuclear breath. He's got average speed and strength, but has some nice guard breaks. -PSM #68, 2/03 \"Togera is our reptilian sea monster,\" Giam smiles. \"He's a spiny gargantuan awakened from his long dormancy by nuclear bomb. We went through several disparate sea-creature designs during the course of the game, (one of which ended up as a skin for another, guess which one!), but in the end, the best result we got was the result of Koji Saito of SCEI. He and the others at SCEI gave us great feedback on the game and monster design, and it was from some of his people's excellent concept art that Togera was born.\" -Official U.S. Playstation Magazine, Issue #64 1/03Abilities Basic Combos  (Disclaimer: this game was a Playstation 2 exlcusive and the combos you see are wrong since they don't follow the proper button format of Triangle,Circle,X,and Square)Costumes Trivia Agamo Background  The shaman of a remote tribe brings an offering of the alien fuel to the stone deity his people pray to. The fuel awakens this stone titan who frees his body from the earth's bonds walking to the horizon with a new found purpose, trampling the holy man in the process. Agamo's massive stone structure is believed to be the work of a civilization that vanished eons ago. The fire burning in it's eyes and head hint at the rage that has engulfed it's soul. Agamo can effortlessly control the molecules binding it's rock body together and create a large boulder of massive destructive capabilities. -Game booklet Agamo - Stone god come to life. Agamo's special is very low-tech: his fist gets bigger. However, he's durable and well rounded, making him a good first choice. -PSM #68, 2/03 \"Agamo began his existence as a stone creature whose head looked uncomfortably like that of Cookie Monster from Sesame Street.\" Jokes Giam. \"He went through numerous incarnations, combining rocks, moss and various shapes, and while many possibilities were explored, most did not seem to fit the tone of the game. Eventually, we went from the more blob-like pile of rocks to a lanky form with an Easter Island-style head. That last bit seemed to serve as a point of inspiration. Suddenly, Agamo was no longer a rock-golem, but rather a stone idol.\" -Official U.S. Playstation Magazine #64, 1/03Abilities  Agamo's long range attack is his detachable head that reaches a far distance and does good damage. It will also explode after a period, dealing more damage if the target is close. The head can also be used as a melee weapon. He has good armor and his projectiles fire at a slow rate, dealing good damage. He is a medium-jumper and climbs at a slow pace. His taunt is a come-on gesture followed by banging his fists together.Basic Combos  (Disclaimer: this game was a Playstation 2 exlcusive and the combos you see are wrong since they don't follow the proper button format of Triangle,Circle,X,and Square)Trivia Costumes Congar  Congar is a giant ape monster who makes his debut in War of the Monsters.Information Background  Congar was originally a NASA chimpanzee orbiting earth in a capsule, which had collided with a foundering UFO, exposing him to the alien fuel. Instead of burning up in the atmosphere, the chimp immediately began to mutate and grow upon re-entry, crash landing in the remote countryside, and rising as the simian juggernaut known as Congar. Congar is a super-gorilla fuelled by anger, astronomical strength and insatiable revenge. Along with his extreme reach and destructive punches, his Sonic Roar is extremely damaging at close range. The Simian symbol of nature's fury. A good beginning character with fast, combo-ready attacks, decent strength and a special attack that is effective through walls.Developer Commentary  \"Congar is our crazy mutant monkey, and\u00a0is a very well-rounded monster. He's good in hand-to-hand combat, and has a pretty decent projectile attack,\" Jobe says. \"His Sonic Roar special attack is excellent. It's of shorter range, but does major damage, and has the added ability of blasting through buildings as if they weren't even there!\"Abilities Basic Combos Trivia Costumes\ufeff References Preytor  Preytor is a monster available to play as during Free-For-All and Adventure Mode. She is the only female monster.Background  Preytor was once an ordinary praying mantis that had mutated due to exposure to the alien fuel by a scientist researching the effects of the fuel on normal animals. Preytor grew to a monstrous size and proceeded to devour the scientist and join the war of the monsters.Armed with piercing apendages and an ability to regurgitate a parasitic lifeforms, this flying monstrosity feeds on destruction. She is lightning fast, but not very durable. However she's very, very quick, with super-fast combos, and ridiculously maneuverable -- she can even fly.Developer Commentary  \"Preytor is our huge mutant mantis\", says Dylan Jobe, the producer of the game at Incog. \"The one element that seperates Preytor from the rest of the monsters is her jump/flight ability. Although she isn't the best flyer in the game, she still can get around the level better than most monsters. Preytor's hand-to-hand style is very fast with an arsenal of blade strikes and slashes.\"Abilities  Preytor's long Range attack is a homing parasite that reaches a long distance and does low damage. She has average armor and her projectiles fire at a fast rate, dealing medium damage. She is a low-jumper and climbs at a medium pace. Her taunt is a swipe of her forelegs while standing on her hind legs and buzzing her wings.Trivia Basic Combos  (Disclaimer: this game was a Playstation 2 exlcusive and the combos you see are wrong since they don't follow the proper button format of Triangle,Circle,X,and Square)Costumes References  .Raptros  Raptros is one of the unlockable monsters available to play as in War of the Monsters.Biology  The Raptros is a dragon-like creature. It is bipedal and its default skin is red. Its underbelly is tan and its eyes are a glowing crimson. It has two slightly tattered wings, a horn on the tip of its snout, and its body is overall very raptor-like.Information Background  Nothing is known about Raptros as no origin was provided within the game or media. This ultimately makes them the most mysterious character in the entire game. The only information about their past is provided by the It Came From The Skies poster, which claims Raptros is a monster \"from a lost age\".In Game  The Raptros are encountered on the Fifth Level of adventure mode, It Came from the Skies where a pair of them attack an airport. Working in tandem, they attack the player, and the player must defeat both of them to progress.Abilities  Raptros' long range attack is fire breath that reaches a medium distance and does fair damage. Opponents remain on fire for a time after the attack has ended, dealing additional damage. It has average armor and its projectiles fire at a medium rate, dealing medium damage. It is a low-jumper and climbs at a medium pace. Its taunt is a roar followed by an upright pirouette done with the wings fully outstretched.  Raptros proves to be the better flier than Preytor, as it uses less energy, (about 20-23 wing flaps on a fully charged bar of energy before it's depleted), and its larger wings appear to help it glide more efficiently as well.Basic Combos  (Disclaimer: this game was a Playstation 2 exlcusive and the combos you see are wrong since they don't follow the proper button format of Triangle,Circle,X,and Square)Trivia Costumes Ultra V Background  Ultra V is a giant, high-tech robot. \u00a0He was first built by Japanese scientists to battle the rampaging monsters. However, these scientists made the mistake of infusing Ultra V with the alien fuel. Once activated, he became self-aware, leaving the lab under his own control. Ultra V is the fifth version of a group of super robots designed to be saviors for cities under siege. Equipped with state-of-the-art eye lasers, space-age metal, rocket firing fists and an energy sword, Ultra V is ready to eliminate any threat to mankind. Now with a mind of it's own, there is little to prevent it from unleashing it's destructive technology. -Game booklet Ultra V -Living robot defender: This Mazinger-looking robot is fairly quick, and his jet pack adds to his maneuverability, although his durability is just average.  -PSM #68 2/03 \"Ultra V was an archetype we knew we just had to have,\" explains Mike Giam, the creative director at SCEA Santa Monica. \"To have an all-star lineup of monsters without a character that evoked the giant robot anime of the past-like Great Mazinger, Brave Raideen, Getter Robo, or Grendizer-would have been unforgiveable.\" -Official U.S. Playstation Magazine #64, 1/03Abilities  Ultra V's long range attack is a retractable rocket-fist that reaches a far distance and does average damage, delivering your target before you, stunned. This can do more damage if you are holding an object at the time, especially an explosive truck. He has good armor and his projectiles fire at a fast rate, dealing medium damage. He is a high-jumper and climbs at a fast pace.

Something organic, yet at the same time, not of this earth. A beast of pure energy, its origin remains a mystery. However, scientists theorize that the electricity somehow mixed with an organic life form to produce a strange fusion of organic and elemental mass.

A military war robot whose time had ended at the demise of the Atomic Age, Robo-47 packs heavy-gauge steel plating and armaments once thought to be the pinnacle of modern technology. But Robo-47s shortcomings only reside in it's dated appearance. His Atomic missile packs enough punch to level a building...and the surrounding city block. -Game booklet Robo-47- a Noble armed forces robot. A mid-level character, Robo-47 is slightly fragile, but has a very fast machine gun in his chest, and an explosive special attack. -PSM #68 2/03 \"Robo-47 is your classic military robot,\" Jobe explains. \"Like Congar, he's well-rounded. He has a huge machine gun in his chest that's capable of the fastest rate of fire in the entire game. His hand-to-hand attacks utilize a variety of robot weapons, like expandable hammers, drill bits, and titanium spikes! Robo-47 also has a vintage special attack...he is, after all, from the 'Atomic Age', so what robot would be complete without an atomic bomb?! Robo-47 can launch his nuke across an entire level. It has homing capabilities, too.\" -Official U.S. Playstation Ma gazine #64, 1/03Abilities  Robo-47's long range attack is an Atomic missile that reaches a far distance and does good damage.

Magmo was actually one of the toughest to pin down since the concept was so cool visually, we knew we wanted it, but balancing the idea of being sentient lava and being physically powerful was quite a challenge. I remember reading somewhere that great character designs should have distinct shapes, recognizable just from their silhouettes, and Magmo certainly fits the bill for that one!\" -Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine #64, 1/03Abilities  Magmo's long-range attack is tracking fireballs that reach a far distance and do good damage.

Inside of the suit is the creature itself, controlling it. The dome, containing Cerebulon, is transparent, allowing the player to see his brain but nothing else. This dome is surrounded by a green force field that is impervious to all attacks but powers down after Cerebelon's laser attack.Second Form  Cerebulon's second form crawls out from the wreckage of his first form, once the first form's arms and legs have been blow off, as well as the nails holding the dome in place. The dome will stay on this new form, which has metallic tentacles that end in sharp spikes. It both moves with and attacks with these tentacles. It can also electrocute the player.Final Form  Cerebulon's final offensives form is the creature itself. It has two scythes for and no legs, it's body terminating into several simple tails with which it can stand upright upon. It's head looks like a human brain, and it has five red eyes, four stationed around one large red eye, and sharp fangs on a proboscis-like face. It has gills on it's head, behind it's mouth.Minuscule Form  After it's final offensive form is defeated, Cerebulon's head explodes and a small, brain-like creature emerges, vaguely reminiscent of a spider or a scorpion. It cannot fight and a roar from the player character scares it off.Strategy  Cerebulon will emerge from the crashed UFO in its mech suit. There is a force field protecting the head for the time being, so it's best to grab something to block with and get one of the remaining pillars between you, before it joins its hands together. The pillar will bear the brunt of the death-ray's might, but you will take some damage. Once the attack halts, Cerebulon's force field will power down just long enough for you to throw a vehicle and fire some projectiles at it (Robo-47's ranged special attack will do tremendous damage here). Quickly grab something to block with and get behind another pillar while it readies to unleash another blast. By the time all six pillars have fallen, Cerebulon should have taken enough hits to move on to form 2. During the Transition the suit's arms malfunction and blast off before the legs and torso blow up as well, afterwards the bolts on the head piece pop loose and Cerebulon emerges in its 2nd form. Cerebulon will now be in a smaller pressure suit, but no less deadly. The method for the next stage is similar to Goliath and the boulder. There are three large, green pieces of the mech suit around the level. These are the only objects that will cause any damage during this stage as Cerebulon is now surrounded by transparent force-field that will repel all other attacks.\u00a0You'll most likely manage two hits before it rushes you and hits with a high-voltage attack, after which it will retreat to the far side of the concourse, awaiting your next move. Repeat the process until it has sustained enough damage to discard this form. In the Transition, the final hit from a thrown Mech-Piece punches through the Force-field, knocking Cerebulon off-balance and causing it to fall over, cracking the glass covering his head in the process, its true form then breaks out and prepares to engage the Player in a 1-on-1 fight. Cerebulon will now do battle in it's true, final form. The odds have been evened in terms of size, but Cerebulon is still quick, knows when to move away from your close range special and has a nasty ten-hit combo. Cerebulon has 3 attacks he could use, a simple 4 hit combo, its deadly ten-hit combo which will stun-lock the player if even one of its hits connect and rarely he can grab the Player and pummel them repeatedly with his scythes before sending them flying with a powerful blow. It's also is able to dash and spark it's claws for extra damage. Block often and strike with as many combos as you can. Long-range specials can be effective. It is possible to use a downward bash on its head and while it is stunned jump into the air and hit it again. This cycle can continue until Cerebulon dies, you fail to prepare the next attack, or it comes too fast to get out of the way. Once Cerebulon's health bar is exhausted, it will begin its death throes, clutching its pulsating head in pain before it explodes and its lifeless body falls to the ground, where a juvenile version bursts forth from its ruined brain, scurrying away from your roar of triumph. This marks the end of Adventure mode. Here you will be treated to your chosen character's origin movie, (with the exception of Raptros and Zorgulon.).Trivia Vegon  Vegon is a Boss Monster.Information Background  Absolutely nothing is known about Vegon however it was mostly likely a normal plant, possibly a venus fly trap-like plant, indigenous to the island before the nuclear facility was constructed. Over the years Vegon had not only continued to grow, but mutate due to the long period of direct exposure to radioactive elements, both in the soil, as well as in the sea from which it drank. Eventually, a meltdown occured at Atomic Island, and shortly thereafter, Vegon arose from the wreckage.Appearance  Vegon is a plant-like being that has three Venus fly trap-like heads connected to long vine-like necks. These necks lead down into another large mouth that is joined with the roots. The mouth has many large leaves sprouting from its sides, which can fold up to resemble a cabbage. Being a plant based monster, Vegon is based on specific site (rooted) and cannot become mobile in game.Strategy  Vegon is a towering menace, beginning its attack by spitting toxic, acidic venom at you, which will cause decent damage. Quickly pick up a piece of debris and block. Each piece will sustain two to three hits. Grab another piece, lock onto the head poised to strike and throw (Robo-47 and\u00a0Congar\u00a0defeat a head in one strike by hitting the head with\u00a0their ranged special attack). If you strike Vegon, it will recede into its pod and its roots will rise from the earth, whipping the air, seeking you. Spend as much time airborne as you can. Attempting to attack Vegon during the root-attack is futile and will only cause you damage. When the roots subside, Vegon will emerge and the process must be repeated. Each head takes two hits to kill. Between each successful hit on Vegon, the root attack will repeat. When Vegon is above ground, plan to be near plenty of debris to shield you or throw when one of the heads readies to strike. The sequence is as follows:Trivia Goliath-Prime  Goliath Prime is a Boss Monster, and the first one encountered in the game.Information Background  Goliath's\u00a0primary objective is to guard a secluded miltary facility known only as \"Outpost X\". The operations carried out in Rosdale Canyon remain shrouded in mystery.Abilities Strategy  Goliath-Prime, will appear atop the bunker once the Mutant Ants are defeated. He will hurl timed grenade-balls at you in groups of three. While they are blinking green or yellow, pick them up, lock on Goliath and hurl them back as quickly as possible. Be sure to avoid the grenades blinking red, as they're set to explode. Once you have successfully hit Goliath eight times, it will join you on the ground. Another good strategy is to use a special move\u00a0(Congar`s scream, for example).\u00a0Here, it will chase you and if you're caught, it will pummel, then hurl you across the level. If you are out of its reach, it will ready for its charge attack by crouching and spinning it propellers before charg ing you. Your best method here is to get a pillar between the two of you, then strike while it is temporar ily dazed after charging into the pillar. For its final attack, it will drop down low, spreading its arms wide to begin its spin-attack. It will alternate between this and shooting a volley of missiles at you. If controlling a faster monster, it is possible to get close to Goliath-Prime where it missiles will fly past you and you are free to deal out damage. During the spin attacks, it's best to be atop the pillars. It can whittle these down eventually, but you cannot out-run him during these attacks. If timed correctly, throwing the boulder can cease the spin attack, otherwise, it will return to its biped form and fire a volley of missles your way. Seek shelter behind any remaining pillars, or you can get in close, where the missle salvo will course around you, instead of dealing damage. The most effective way to defeat Goliath is to stay locked on it and repeatedly it him with the boulder, trying to catch it each time it rebounds off him. Ranged and Special attacks can work when timed correctly, never attempt hand to hand, as you will lose.Trivia Atomic Island Baby Born With Goat Head  Global Observer News Built on the site of a radiation-testing zone, Atomic Island now houses a prototype nuclear plant.

Environmental Weapons / Attacks: Destruction of Atomic Island will yield 15,000-20,000 Battle Tokens. Like Rosdale Canyon, your opponents here are easily defeated, as your second boss battle will be occurring shortly. Once the final tower has been demolished, you will hear a countdown begin, with the warning: \"Core Meltdown\" appearing on the screen, after the ensuing blast, you are standing in a pit amongst the wreckage of the plant.

Episode: Revenge of Togera (Stage 2) Location: Gambler's Gulch Opponent: Togera, then Robo-47 with military. Enviornmental Weapons / Attacks: Robo-47 has brought military ground and air forces along for the battle, It seems the best strategy is to be near the cloaking powerup when Togera is defeated. The military won't open fire while you are cloaked, so you'll be able to step into the center of the formation and set off your close range special, which will eliminate the majority of them. Otherwise, they'll chip away at your health quickly. Those remaining after the blast can be hurled at Robo-47. The choppers can be dealt with one-on-one with projectiles.Trivia: Rosdale Canyon Strange Lights Seen Over Abandoned Base  Global Observer News A top-secret military base houses decommisioned military experiments and weapons.

Enviornmental Weapons / Attacks: Destruction of Rosdale Canyon will yield between 6,000-8,000 Battle Tokens. This level is the smallest of all in adventure mode. When you begin, you will first do battle with a total of eight of the Mutant Ant version of Preytor, (waves of three, three, then two.)

Your character has been brought to the mothership of those responsible for the attacks on Earth. Here, you will do battle with three of the alien menace, as well as causing as much damage to the ship as you can. Once this has been achieved, you will once again board the saucer, which will jettison from the failing mothership, and begin an uneven descent back to Earth. This is also an unlockable level that can be purchased for 105,000 Battle Tokens.Tsunopolis UFO Maintains Strategic Position  Global Observer News A neon city surrounded by deep ocean waters, considered one of the most technologically advanced cities in the world, it was an easy target of surveillance by the invading UFOs.

Episode: Terror In Paradise (Stage 8) Location: Club Caldera Opponent: Magmo & Agamo Enviornmental Weapons / Attacks Destruction of Club Caldera will yield between 5,000-7,000 battle tokens.Trivia Cerebulon's Forms Form One  In his first form, Cerebulon was actually within the giant UFO which was hovering over Tsunopolis which then brought you to the mothership in Earth's orbit, and finally crash lands back on Earth after your battle with the three Zorgulon destroyed the mothership. He emerges from the ruined craft, smashing through the largest monument on the concourse in a smaller saucer mech-suit of sorts that is mobilized by four legs and two protruding arms that will shoot a death-ray when the hands are joined. The \"head\" of this suit is protected by a force-field.  Seek cover behind the six remaining monuments and block, as a monument will bear most, but not all of the ray's blast. After the attack, his force-field will power down momentarily, which will give you your only opportunity to attack him during this stage. Throwing a nearby vehicle, as well as launching a barrage of projectiles will be about the extent of damage you'll have time for before he powers up to repeat his attack. You will have enough time to grab another vehicle and block behind another monument before the next blast. After enough damage has been dealt, the saucer ejects the arms and disengages from the failing legs. The sealing ring pops off and Cerebulon's second form emerges.Form Two  The red cyclopean eye remains from the first form, as does the dome protecting the head, (without a force-field this time), and he moves on four legs, though they are more akin to steel tentacles, which enable him to move more quickly. Your only means of attack here are the three green pieces of his discarded mech-suit. You will have enough time to throw and hit him with two, (possibly three), pieces before he rushes you and hits you with a high voltage attack which will drain your health significantly. He will then retreat to the far side of the level, awaiting your next move. Once Cerebulon has taken enough hits, this form keels over, unable to remain upright on unsteady legs, the dome shattered and the light of the electric eye gone dark, when suddenly, Cerebulon bursts forth in his true form.Third Form  Cerebulon's third and final fighting form resembles Zorgulon to an extent, but seems to be the more advanced of the race, with four smaller eyes surrounding one large central eye, large fangs protruding from his mouth and scythe-like blades for forearms which he uses to pull himself from his pressure-suit. He stands upright on four tentacle-like legs and swipes the air with his blades, angered and ready to destroy this lesser beast that has somehow bested his technology, as well as caused him pain. Cerebulon is very fast in his movements as well as his attacks. He can anticipate your close-range special, so don't bother. It's best to block, as he will unleash a nasty ten-hit combo that will drain you of a considerable amount of health. The moment he finishes, strike back with your own combos, just be ready to block again, as he has the ability to interrupt your attack and immediately counter with his own. Once you are successful in this final battle, Cerebulon will rear back, howling in agony, clutching his hemmoraging brain, which explodes, his headless carcass falling to the ground, dead.Final Form  A small parasite-like juvenille form of Cerebulon will emerge from his remains and scurry away at your roar of triumph, (or perhaps it's a survival mechanism, allowing Cerebulon to live on in a new form.), or hinting at a possible sequel. From here you will be treated to your character's origin story, (with the exception of Raptros and Zorgulon.), then the credit roll in which we are shown flashes of some outstanding concept art.Trivia Capitol  Episode: Cerebulon, Destroyer of Worlds (Stage 11) Location: Capitol Opponent: Cerebulon (Boss) Enviornmental / Special Attacks: Visit here for strategy information.Trivia Volcano Trivia  1", "Pokemon: Rise of the Rockets Wiki": "Pokemon: Rise of the Rockets Wiki Main Page What is Rise of the Rockets?  Rise of the Rockets is an RPG on BZPower's Completely Off Topic section, headed and made by Parugi. The basic story is that Team Rocket's former leader, Giovanni, has been overthrown and the new leaders, called the Shadow Admins, have taken control of the four main regions. Angered by several of Team Rocket's oppressive methods of running the country, as well as their brutal coup d'etat, a group called Team Liberty has risen to fight back against them. The RPG details the war between the two groups, as well as the actions of several other organizations that have gotten involved in the 20 years since the rise of the Rockets. Player have the option of joining either Team, becoming a neutral trainer, or getting involved with one of the other factions. Primarily a sandbox-RPG, Rise of the Rockets has few restrictions that are in use and general freedom for the player when it comes to storylines, allowing large developments to occur fairly often. Despite this, there is an overall plot to the game, with several clear-cut antagonists as well as quite a bit of obscurity as to who is actually in the right. The RPG as summarized by Parugi: \"Essentially, Giovanni was overthrown by four Rocket Admins operating under the title of the Shadow Admins, who, over a 20 year period, managed to take over the four main regions as well as the Orange Islands. In response to this, a resistance group called Team Liberty sprang up, and the two teams have been at war for the past twelve years. As a result of this, even more groups have appeared as of late, causing general chaos in the Kanto regions. RotR is generally a sandbox RPG, with many of the major developments being created by the players; however, due to a stale-period towards the beginning of the RPG, an overarching plot has been implemented, providing a path to follow for those who find themselves without a way to continue.\"Other  Project Links: Thanks: The following people/places have my thanks:Team Liberty  Team Liberty is the resistance group against Team Rocket, established about 12 years before the time of the main Rise of the Rockets story. Formed by Bluefalcon (Shannon Ramirez), Blackskull (Kane Umbra), and Goldhawk (Markus Aleivy) and based on the Sevii Islands, the team has managed to become the longest-remaining resistance group to oppose Team Rocket.History Formation  Since Team Rocket's takeover eighteen years prior to the events of the main story, many resistance groups had sprung up, though all were swiftly crushed. Markus Aleivy, a former member of one of these teams, began acting as a freelancer against Team Rocket, occasionally teaming up with other similar renegades, most notably Shannon Ramirez and Kane Umbra. All three had managed to take out several Rocket facilities over the course of their careers, though that became nearly impossible to do once Team Rocket began expanding their armies and ramping up their defenses. Aleivy, noting this, decided that something else had to be done. He contacted Ramirez and Umbra, telling both to begin gathering followers and coming up with plans. Eventually, after breaking into and deleting the data of the Sevii Islands from the Rocket mainframe, the group met on Four Island, where Aleivy revealed his plans for a new resistance group: Team Liberty. Though originally skeptical, Umbra agreed to the plan, as did Ramirez. Using his wealth, Umbra put a private construction company to work building a main base for the team.Declaration of War  Following the official formation of Team Liberty, a Rocket patrol was attacked and news was brought to the Rocket Shadow Admins regarding the resistance. While discussing this with each other, the Shadow Admins received a message from Team Liberty, declaring war on Team Rocket. None of the Admins thought much of this, expecting Liberty to fall within the year. Soon enough, it became clear that that was not the case, as Team Liberty managed time and time again to take out more Rockets and their bases.Operation R.A.L.L.Y.  As the war began to shift in Team Rocket's favor and Team Liberty began to lose more operatives than they were recruiting, Goldhawk, Bluefalcon and Blackskull decided to send their next group of recruits to search for and get help from any Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, Legendary Pokemon, and trainers that they could find. They dubbed this plan Operation R.A.L.L.Y. The plan was a resounding success in many ways: in a span of two months, Team Liberty had gathered a large force of Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and Gym Leaders, most of whom took up residence at Four Island. The operation also brought on several unfortunate occurrences. Upon awakening Groudon and Kyogre, the world was thrown into a short span of unbearable heat mixed with unrelenting rain, echoing the conflicts between the two that had occurred in the past. This, in turn, awakened Rayquaza who, after quelling the two titans, was recruited to Team Rocket's side. Later, damage to Regigigas caused the Legendary Golem to fall in Snowpoint Temple, causing an avalanche that buried half of Snowpoint City and killed dozens of people, taking a toll on Team Liberty's public image in Sinnoh. Between both sides' growing use of Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, it soon became clear that the war front had changed for the worse.The Battle of Four Island  Shortly after the beginning of R.A.L.L.Y., the Shadow Admin of Kanto, Sleight, was given the location of the Sevii Islands by a terrorist hacker known as John Ford. Eager to hit Team Liberty at their base of operations, Sleight gave command of the attack to Joker, Shadow Admin of Johto, who quickly amassed a force of Rocket agents and battle machines, such as gunboats and a large airship, and set out to attack Team Liberty. Hearing of the attack, Bounty, Shadow Admin of Sinnoh, headed off with his own agents to participate, pursued by Blackskull and several Elite Liberty members. Even amidst the chaos of the battle on Four Island, an incident involving the Weather Trio provided Team Liberty with an unprecedented opportunity: Team Liberty Executive Selene \"Silvermind\" Ashera ordered Team Liberty agents in Hoenn to rebel en masse, taking advantage of the Rockets' distraction. Combined with Team Liberty's simultaneous recruitment of Kyogre, who took the Groudon search party to the Battle of Four Island and aided in Team Liberty's defense, Team Rocket's forces in Hoenn were effectively toppled and Shadow Admin Ace deposed. Meanwhile, several agents tried to infiltrate the airship that was sent and one succeeded in both hijacking and destroying it. Team Liberty then began to overpower Team Rocket in the fight due to the latter's loss of resources and men. Team Rocket began to retreat, but not before The Shadowed Man blew up Team Liberty's server room, killing Bluefalcon and badly wounding a few Liberty and Rocket agents. Team Rocket retreated with a large amount of data that they had gotten off the Alamo's servers on many of Team Liberty's agents.The Manaphy Arc The First Battle of Paradise: Rocket Purge  Needing another leader to fill in Bluefalcon's empty position, Blackskull promoted Slivermind to Liberty Leader. Hoping to learn the locations of Team Rocket's main bases and determined to retrieve the info that Team Rocket had stolen, Silvermind went to question Silver, a publicly-defected Liberty member who was currently being held at the Alamo. Despite Team Rocket's attempts to break him out of there, Silvermind (with some back-up from a few other Liberty agents) was able to drive them off and secure Silver long enough to get the information she wanted, in exchange for his freedom. Next, she began to assemble a team of agents to help with her mission. Silver had identified the Rocket's Hoenn master facility, Paradise, as well as its location. Since Team Liberty had all but taken over that region, Silvermind figured it would be their best opportunity. She managed to gather several members for her team, among whom were James Arthur, Scott Stone, Scott Williams, Jayron Aaron, Geoff Grahams, and Thomas Solson. Surprisingly, three Gym Leaders, Koga, Lt. Surge, and Sabrina, soon arrived at Four Island and offered to help with the mission. This caused some suspicion, especially from both James and Jayron. Koga was originally Jayron's teacher, and Jayron thought he had been captured by the Rockets a long time ago. Still, with these and several other agents, Silvermind loaded four choppers and headed for Paradise, at Southern Island. When they arrived, they split into two groups. Silvermind, Scott Stone, Geoff, Sabrina, and several other agents went one way, while Surge, Koga, James, Jayron, Scott Williams, and Thomas headed the other direction. Both groups infiltrated the underground base and made their way towards the command center. Silvermind's group was stopped by a large force of Rockets, but the other group was quickly separated in the base, forcing the rockets to divide as well to find all of them. After Surge's Pokemon knocked out the power in the base, Shadow Admin Buzz arrived and ordered the use of Zubat, Golbat, and Crobat. When this failed, he had several Elite Rockets guard the entrance to the control center. Several of the Liberty agents (including a few who had recently arrived) re-grouped and made it to the entrance of the control center. They battled hard, but in the end they were driven back. Silvermind's group (minus Scott Stone and Geoff) were beaten after the Gym Leaders betrayed them, revealing that they did indeed work for Team Rocket. Silvermind was captured, and the rest of the agents with her were held, being released later. With only three Liberty Agents still left in the base, Jessica Ortrune had her Darkrai find them. It located Jayron, Scott Stone, and later James, and teleported them out of the base and back to their own. They were aware of Silvermind's capture, and many, especially Scott Stone, were determined to rescue her.The Second Battle of Paradise: Rescuing Silvermind  After a bit of recovering from an attack by The Shadowed Man, which appeared to kill Blackskull, Scott Stone learned about a possible organization that might help them rescue Silvermind called Soil Colossus, Inc. Goldhawk, as Team Liberty's only remaining leader, arranged the needed funds and contacted the organization. They agreed to help rescue Silvermind with the assistance of five Liberty agents. Scott Stone, Jayron Aaron, and Cyan Vero headed out to the meeting point, where they were joined again by Geoff Grahams and Thomas Solson. They were all brought aboard Soil Colossus' stealth sub and headed back to Southern Island. Upon arrival, the sub separated, leaving the Liberty Agents in the main part to battle a large force of Rocket Pokemon that were defending the shore, and the Soil Colossus members dove deep down in a separate unit and burrowed into the ground under Paradise, infiltrating the base from below. After some heavy fighting, the Liberty Agents, led by Scott Stone, made their way into the base and started through the familiar hallways. A force of Rockets attacked them again, leading to another long battle that they eventually won when Shadow Admin Buzz unexpectedly called off the Rockets. Suspecting a trap, the Liberty Agents headed farther into the base and re-joined the Soil Colossus members. They entered the training area in the base to find many of the Rocket agents, the Elite Rockets, the Special Ops. force, led by Jessica Ortrune, and even Dara Trina, a bounty hunter hired by Team Rocket to assist them. Buzz was also there with Silvermind and a remote to control the battlefield. A large-scale battle followed, and in the confusion the Soil Colossus members abducted Silvermind and escaped. Once they left, the battle was quickly ended and the Liberty Agents vacated the premises, realizing they had been once again betrayed. Carl Sandrock, leader of Soil Colossus, sent Scott Stone and Buzz a message each, detailing what he wanted in return for Silvermind: a certain Manaphy, located in the Ice Geode off the coast of Unova. Team Liberty and Team Rocket were each allowed to send members for this search, but they had to work together during the mission. After considering their options, both teams agreed to participate.Bases The Alamo  The first of Team Liberty's bases, the Alamo is the most fortified facility that Team Liberty possesses. It is located on Four Island, and remains strong despite the extensive damage that has been done to it.Sevii Island Fallback Bases  In the event that they are completely pushed out of Four Island, Team Liberty has established several smaller fallback bases on the other Sevii Islands.Johto Safari Zone  The Johto Safari Zone is also being looked into as a possible secret base.Members  Team Liberty has been joined by hundreds of trainers as the result of recruiting and the initiation of Operation R.A.L.L.Y. A partial list is provided below:Leaders Notable Members Pok\u00e9mon Teams Recruited Trainers Actions Team Rocket  Team Rocket is a villainous organization bent on remaking the world in their own views, crushing any rebellion that stands in their way. Previously led by Giovanni, control over Team Rocket now belongs to the four Shadow Admins: Sleight, Joker, Ace, and Bounty. Twelve years prior to the Rise of the Rockets story, however, a rag-tag group of rebels managed to erase the Sevii Islands from the Rockets' database and establish themselves there, naming themselves \"Team Liberty\". After twelve years of battle, Team Rocket had not been able to find Liberty's main base of operations until recently.History  For generations Team Rocket knew nothing but defeat; with the coming of the Shadow Admins, that changed. Under their rule, Team Rocket orchestrated a master plot to take control of the four main regions, Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh, along with wiping out resistance in the Orange Islands and the Sevii Islands. Twelve years after Team Liberty's formation, the war has shifted in favor of Team Rocket. Desperate, Goldhawk, Bluefalcon and Blackskull, the leaders of Team Liberty, decided to send several small groups of newly recruited and trained Agents to search for the Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and trainers that Team Rocket had driven into hiding, to assist them in the war. On the flip side, Team Rocket had similar ideas, and are using their own Agents to capture these prominent figures.Bases Members  Team Rocket, being around much longer than Liberty, has a larger number of members. Below are several notable members:Leaders Notable Members Actions Pre-Takeover During/Post-Takeover Trivia Michael Ray  Michael Ray is a new recruit to Team Liberty. He played a part in the Groudon Retrieval team, often being the one who updated Liberty Headquarters.History  Michael was Orphaned at the age of 6 by an attack on his House by Team Rocket. After this, he was taken in by his Grandparents (better known as \"The Daycare Couple\"), who raised him among pokemon. His first pokemon, Tion, was a Ralts who he hatched from an egg after the trainer refused to take it. He quickly befriended the emotion pokemon, who too had a caring personality. A week after he hatched Tion, another trainer came back, this one a Rocket. They demanded a \"refund\" on their Porygon, who they had bred with the couple. However, the Porygon hatched had a glitch (which appeared physically as a scar across his eye). The couple had assured them that their pokemon was fine, but the Rocket had eventually stormed off, leaving \"the ******* broken Pokemon\" behind. Michael immediately adopted the upset Porygon, who latched onto him. He eventually named the Porygon \"Hax\" after it hacked into the local pokemart's store computer just to prove it could. At the age of 14, he left home and began adventuring, eventually finding out about Team Liberty. He managed to make contact with them and they informed him that they would contact him when they needed him. At 16, Operation RALLY called him to Four Island and he joined the Groudon Retrieval team, the first to meet Jeremy as a result (just before the arrival of the two Scotts). He was the first to notice Sabba the Sableye outside the base and made a first impression on the Sableye by handing him a Rock Cake (special food for Rock pokemon and Sableye) to eat. This lead to the Sableye joining the team. He travelled with the team and helped them during the Zubat/Golbat swarm and the following attack by a Crobat. Then then tried to reason with Groudon (using Reverse Telepathy, a trick Tion had taught him. It allows a non-telepathic person to speak telepathically BACK to someone who uses it on them first). When Groudon refused, he joined the team in attempting to fight off the Behemoth. After a lengthy fight, Groudon took the battle overground and awakened Kyogre. He was startled by the arrival of Rayquaza and Kyogre's subsequent joining of the team, but travelled back with the Pokemon. Unfortunately, he made a rather unpleasant discovery at the remains of the Liberty base: The dead body of BlueFalcon. This, combined with the discovery of the smashed Hatchery, lead him to angrily attack a fleeing Rocket grunt, aggressively knocking out their Pokemon. However, Tion evolved midway through the battle, gaining a clarity from it. Tion spreading this calm into Michael soothed his rage and he returned to the base in time to witness Salene's promotion. While he was observing this, he recalled when he met a Shaymin as a child and decided that he would find one for Liberty. Taking his leave, he had Tion teleport him back to Solaceon Town (after giving Sabba a way to follow them), where he met his old friend, Kyle . Kyle agreed to team up with Michael in his mission. While Michael rested, Kyle's Charmander, Michael's Porygon and Gecka all went off exploring the Solaceon Ruins; where they fought a large number of Unown. Although the Trio defeated the symbol Pokemon horde, Hax was badly injured, causing his glitched programming to tear open, physically hurting him. Michael was horrified to see Hax when he showed up with the others back at his house. Michael got Kyle to bring the Upgrade which Kyle had purchased for him a year beforehand and trade-evolved Hax. Although it didn't remove Hax's glitch, it reduced it back to a manageable level and increased the power of the Virtual pokemon. Michael has since left Solaceon with Kyle and Sabba to look for Shaymin.Personality  Michael is confident in his skills. He is aware that his partners aren't as strong as other trainers, but is determined to prove that he can become equal to other trainers. He has an extensive knowledge of pokemon thanks to his spending time with his grandparents, known as the daycare couple, and helping them with their duties. Additionally, he cares about Pokemon a lot more than most trainers; to the point where he will tend to an injured pokemon before he tends to a trainer (unless the human is mortally wounded).Appearance  Average 16 year old build, slightly small for his age, with brown hair. He wears a simple black T-shirt and jeans combination. For the colder areas of Sinnoh, he also has a brown hooded jacket. He also wears a simple Sinnoh-type backpack to store items and pokeballs. On his wrist is a well-used poketch which he recieved a year ago (has been upgraded several times to have all the functions of a PokeNav)Quotes  \"YOU ROCKETS DID THIS. YOU KILLED INNOCENT POKEMON! YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS!\" -Michael after witnessing the death of an entire hatchery of eggs. \"You can stop now.\" -Telling Gecka to stop feigning fainting after she did so to avoid continuing a battle with a Beldum. \"!?!? Tion? Did you just speak?\" \"...Yes.\" -Michael and Tion, as Tion reveals his ability to speak after a small amount of Tutoring from SabbaTrivia Seth Vicens  Seth Vicens was a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer currently fighting for Team Liberty.History Early Life  Seth Vicens was born and raised in Celestic Town, where he was fascinated by the legends regarding legendary Pok\u00e9mon. He spent most of his time alone, studying the legends of the world. At the age of 11, he encounter a lost Riolu. Befriending the Pok\u00e9mon, it allowed him to capture it in a special Pok\u00e9 Ball. Eventually the two became unseparable. That same day, when he was at Spear Pillar, he stepped on the spot where the Dragon Trio first used their powers, causing his medallion to glow brightly and awaken the dragons once more. The dragons each spoke a word which echoed louder in a certain child's head. Dialga said the word \"Time\", which was locked in Seth's mind. Two years later, the two captured a Ralts, who wasn't as trusting as Riolu, but still grew close to Seth.Team Liberty  At the age of 15, he met a red-haired stranger who told him to fight for what he believed in, not what he was told to. The next year, Seth joined Team Liberty and worked hard to stop Team Rocket.Operation R.A.L.L.Y  In one of Seth's earlier missions, he fought with a man named Shade, who had tricked his childhood friend Bria Gallant into working for Team Rocket. The two engaged in a knife fight at Meteor Falls, where Shade nearly killed Seth, taunting him about how he was just an expendable trainer to Team Liberty, before revealing that he has plans that could make him a god. Seth managed to fight Shade off, sending the two over the falls. While Shade vanished, Seth was too injured to continue and accepted his death, but was saved a mysterious man with a Luxray, who was revealed to be his father, a former Pok\u00e9mon Champion. Seth was given his medallion, being told that it would be of great importance one day. Seth returned to Sinnoh, joining with two trainers, Evan Tierra and Klim \"Kinali\" Prizak. The three began a search for the Creation Trio, first heading for Turnback Cave to find Giratina. On their way through Mt. Coronet, Seth caught a Feebas, and they realized something was unnatural in the mountain. When they left, Evan revealed that something was disrupting Palkia and Dialga's powers. In Celestic Town, Seth discovered that Evan was right. According to paintings in the Celestic Ruins, the Red Chain used by Cyrus long ago had caused their powers to go out of control. Having been separated for a long time, they had not gathered together to let their powers out, keeping them inside and paining them, possibly killing them. Seth figured that the only way to stop this was to gather the Dragon Trio atop Mt. Coronet and let them unleash their powers together. On their way to Turnback Cave to find Giratina, the trio engaged in battle with Rocket Executive Shade. Despite being beaten down early in the fight, they managed to fight back and defeat him. Shade left a cryptic message before leaving them. Eventually, the trio went to Veilstone, where Seth was reunited with Volt. The three spoke with Saturn at Galactic Headquarters, where they convinced him to help the three face Giratina. Saturn agreed, on the condition that they give him the Griseous Orb. They were given the Red Crystal, an artificial copy of the Red Chain, to be used to subdue Giratina. When they reached Turnback Cave, they managed to navigate the twist and turns using Seth's medallion to lead them to Giratina. When they faced Giratina, they were beaten, but thanks to Riolu's sudden evolution and their determination, they managed to drive back Giratina. Giratina, sensing defeat, sucked them all into the Distortion World, where they were all easily defeated. While Evan used the Red Crystal to bring Giratina to the ground, the trio spoke from their hearts and managed to convince Giratina to aid them. Giratina bestowed upon them the Griseous Orb as a sign of trust, making them promise that they would stop the calamity. Kinali was given the orb, holding a connection to Giratina specifically. Giratina told Seth and Evan that they hold similar connections to Dialga and Palkia respectively. Opening a portal, Giratina allowed the three to leave. Once outside, Evan revealed that the reason that Saturn wants the Griseous orb is because he already has the other two orbs. The three made a plan to raid the Galactic HQ and retrieve the orbs, due to their importance in summoning the dragon trio. Seth revealed that he is becoming irritated with Team Liberty using Legendary Pok\u00e9mon to fight their battles, and has hinted that he may leave Team Liberty. Making their way through Galactic HQ, the trio of trainers managed to retrieve the orbs and take out most of Galactic HQ before escaping. While on their way back to Celestic, they were ambushed by the Searchers. After a fierce battle, they managed to drive the Searchers off and reached Celestic. When they got to Coronet, they battled a pair of Rockets and made it to the top, where Shade was preparing to capture the dragons. Successfully summoning the dragons, they managed to heal and restore balance, but were quickly captured by Shade. A massive battle ensued, during which Shade demonstrated his control over Time and Space by trying to morph the world. During the battle, Shade revealed to Seth the reason behind his grudge: Shade was from the future, the son of Seth! Seth was shocked by this revelation, but stayed strong. After freeing Bria from Shade's control, he gathered his allies and they united their powers, unleashing a beam which destroyed Shade's powers. Shade, sensing defeat, engaged Seth in a knife battle, quickly gaining the upperhand. When Bria freed the dragons from their capture, Shade mortally wounded her, causing Seth to fly into a rage. Still, Shade managed to defeat Seth, stabbing him in the shoulder. As Shade prepared a killing blow, a bolt of lightning created by Arceus struck the ground, causing Shade to lose his balance. Shade grabbed Seth, trying to bring him down to his death. Shade was then sent plummeting by a Fire Fang from Evan's Garchomp, while Seth was helped up by Kinali. As Seth tried to save Bria, a mysterious rain fell, healing their wounds. The Dragon Trio split Seth's medallion into three pieces, giving each of the three chosen ones a piece of their respective dragon's orb, allowing them to communicate with and summon a projection of their dragon. Seth and his friends thanked their new allies and left Spear Pillar. Once they left, Seth received a mysterious egg from a passerby. The group then met up with Seth`s father, Nicholas, who healed their Pok\u00e9mon. Seth, Evan and Kinali went their separate ways, with Seth leaving with Nicholas and Bria for the Alamo. Once there, Seth reported to Goldhawk what had happened, before leaving with Bria once more. Seth is currently with Bria in Solaceon Town, where Seth intends to train.Personality  Seth is a quiet young man. He is very calm most of the time, even in times of panic. Seth can also be very sarcastic at times. However, he has a short temper and little patience for those who do not treat people or Pok\u00e9mon with respect. Seth shares a close bond with both of his Pok\u00e9mon, and puts them before himself. Seth is very determined, and will not give up, even when he is losing, as demonstrated during the battle with Giratina. Seth has trouble letting go of the past, something which causes Seth to become more distant than usual.Appearance  Seth stands about 5'11\" tall. He has lightly tanned skin and an athletic build. He is heterochromatic, with his left eye gold, and his right eye red. He has shoulder-length black hair. He typically wears a black turtleneck which is missing it's left sleeve. On his left hand is a black fingerless glove. He wears black jeans and black boots. Around his neck is a medallion that contains the resemblances of Giratina, Palkia and Dialga with three small objects embedded in it. This medallion is now split into three, Seth having the Dialga piece. The medallion is also useable as a flute. On his belt are holsters which hold his Pok\u00e9 Balls, which have a black flame mark on them. Seth also wears a black trenchcoat.Quotes Trivia Kyle Eston  Kyle Eston is a relatively long-standing member of Team Liberty, and the son of Richie and Kimberly Eston.History Early Life  Kyle was born to Richie and Kimberly Eston in Fuschia City, 18 years prior to Rise of the Rockets. Originally, the family was unaffected by the Team Rocket takeover, and so Kyle was free to learn and train in both the usage of Pok\u00e9mon and standard academics. At the age of six, he caught a Spearow, which was later released under unknown circumstances. Soon after this, Richie was contacted by the founders of a new rebellion against Team Rocket. While hesitant about joining it, he eventually accepted, and the Estons prepared to head to the Sevii Islands.Fleeing Fuschia City  WIPTeam Liberty Training  WIPOperation R.A.L.L.Y.  WIPRecruiting Misty and Mewtwo  WIPThe Invasion of Four Island and Coma  WIPRecovery Period  WIPThe Final Kanto Gym Leaders  WIPAppearance  Kyle stands at 5'11\", and has a fairly though not overly muscular build, obtained through intense training. He has wavy dark, auburn hair and slightly oval-shaped, blue-gray eyes. As one can tell, he takes more after his mother in these regards than his father. His nose is slightly beak-like, prompting joking comments about this from his friends, though he doesn't mind. His jaw is slightly rounded, and he has a small scar on his upper lip from a bad cut he received as a kid. He is slightly tanned, though this is hardly noticeable. His outfit usually consists of black pants, belt and shoes, and a navy blue button up shirt. He also occasionally wears a white fedora and vest. Pok\u00e9balls always line his belt, and he uses a black bag to carry his supplies while on missions. He recently changed his outfit. He now wears dark blue jeans, black and white shoes, a black, two-button polo shirt with the top button left undone, and a white, hoodless jacket, which he leaves unzipped. He has kept his black bag, his Pok\u00e9tch and Pok\u00e9balls in their usual spots. He also now has his hair styled like the three-spiked style of the Hoenn Birdkeepers.Personality  By most accounts, Kyle could be summed up as an academic role-model. Having joined Team Liberty at a young age, and in the process essentially losing one of his parents, Kyle quickly adopted an aptitude for battles and academic success -- he managed to place in the top ten for his Liberty Training Group, and during his short life in Fuschia City, was equally skillful in regular school. Further, Kyle has quite a bit of book knowledge at his disposal, due to countless days and night spent reading. Regardless, Kyle tends to try and keep his intelligence from getting to his head, as he realizes the danger that this could cause by revealing a weak spot in his ability to battle. To counter any instances where this happens, Kyle constantly contemplates new battle strategies, usually flipping a silver coin he received from his father when he does so; this coin flipping habit is also an indicator of when he is nervous. Virtually being raised by Team Liberty has also created a strong sense of loyalty to the group, as he sees the faction as an extended part of his family. However, Kyle tends to undermine his orders if he sees them as a threat to either his friends or family, as he considers both to be more important than the faction itself; it is for this reason that he was injured during the Invasion of Four Island, as he intercepted a bullet from one of John Ford's assassins without a second thought, instantly knocking him out of the battle. Kyle's loyalty to the team, and dislike of Team Rocket, were later shown again when Goldhawk announced that Team Liberty would be allying with the Team Rocket Separatists, an alliance that Kyle found, at the least, disturbing considering the actions that both sides had taken against one another in the past. While not necessarily a jokester, Kyle isn't completely serious all of the time, either. He can be witty when he wants to be, and doesn't mind cracking a joke to break an awkward tension amidst a group of people; this side of him had begun to show more often following his meeting of Gecynde Wynn, whom he shared mutual, romantic feelings with. As of his recovery following the sniper incident, however, Kyle has become far more serious than he used to be, and has begun to slip into progressively worse bouts of depression; the first instance was marked by his realization that, while in a coma, he had slipped behind a large number of other RALLY agents in terms of team power and effect on the war, followed later by a deepening sense that he was becoming more and more useless on the field. His mental state -- while currently hidden from his friends and family -- has not been helped at all by the appearance of a black haired teenager whom he met in Mt. Moon, and who seemed to be aware of his situation and lamented it before disappearing, greatly disturbing the Liberty Agent. Later, in Celadon City's Gym, Kyle began to show signs of sinking again when he was confronted with a girl whose appearance reminded him of Gecynde's unexplained disappearance from Four Island.Trivia The Eon Duo  The Eon Duo is a pair of Legendary Pok\u00e9mon consisting of Latios and Latias, twin Psychic-Dragon-Types who are both classified as the Eon Pok\u00e9mon. Known as the \"Natural Healers\" of the world, they are most often concerned with locating injured beings and providing assistance to them.History Team Rocket's Latios and Latias  After the failed invasion of Four Island, Rocket agent Aulus Rufius put together a team of Rocket Agents consisting of himself, Gavin Braner, Quinn Cariu, and Krystal to seek out a set of Latios and Latias for recruitment. The team started out at Mossdeep, to seek out clues, and to get the aid of Tate & Liza to aid in their search for the Pok\u00e9mon. Having already allied themselves with Team Rocket in order to continue operating their gym unimpeded, the twins agreed to tag along and assist in the search. After fighting their way to the top of Mt. Pyre, Tate and Liza were able to use their powers to locate three different pairs of Latios and Latias--one pair near Fortree, one close to Mossdeep, and another on Route 116. The pairs were all circling an object at their respective area, though Tate and Liza could not deduce what the objects were. The group split up after dropping Tate and Liza off at their Gym, with each member going after a pair. As soon as they arrived, however, the Latios and Latias took off, carrying strange stones with them towards an island north of Mossdeep--one green, one red, and one blue. After following them to this location, Gavin and Quinn attacked the Latios and Latias, though were stopped by Aulus. The lead Latios revealed that the group had interrupted a song, though Aulus, Gavin and Quinn, after apologizing, told the Latios that their intentions weren't to do so. They eventually managed to convince all six of the Latios and Latias to ally with Team Rocket, though the Eon Pok\u00e9mon noted that any assistance that they gave would only come after they had finished their task. Sometime after this meeting, the Ancient Darkrai began to spread their darkness across Hoenn, forcing the Eon Pok\u00e9mon to move the stones to an area just outside of Fortree City. In the process, the six Latios and Latias came into conflict with two of the pairs of Darkrai, and were defeated shortly after, thus rendering them incapable of finishing their ritual. Though left for dead, all six survived, and were subsequently tracked down and healed by Ariadne, Jamie Arthur, and Ethan Worth, the former of whom revealed that the stones that the Eon Pok\u00e9mon had found were actually inactive cores for a trio of young Deoxys. Using the energy that they had already infused into the cores, Ariadne finished the activation process, reawakening the single-form Deoxys named Vili, Ve, and Odin. With the group all fully healed and their power restored, and after sending Jamie and Ethan back to Team Rocket's Rustboro base, the Latios and Latias pairs traveled to Lilycove alongside Ariadne and the other Deoxys, intending to use their combined powers to stop the Ancients from making any further progress. Unfortunately, even with the arrival of Rayquaza, Groudon, and Kyogre, the thirteen Hoenn Legends proved unable to defeat the growing power of the Ancients, and were thus forced to flee after a grueling battle. Later, having recuperated from their injuries, the Latios and Latias appeared again to assist in the final assault against the Void Towers in Lilycove City and Hearthome City. The group split into two so as to divide their power amongst the attacking forces, with the three Latios heading to Hearthome and the Latias heading to Lilycove. The combined efforts of the various Hoenn Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Team Liberty, the Rocket Separatists, and Ho-Oh, as well as many others who joined in the assault, finally allowed the Latias and Latios to get their revenge against the Darkrai, as the Void Towers were successfully destroyed. In the process, the Ancient Darkrai were weakened enough to be defeated by those who had gone to fight them directly. Following the destruction of the Void Towers and the Ancients' defeat, the Latios and Latias returned to their travels, awaiting any further calls for help from Team Rocket.Latias Team Liberty's Latias  WIP This Latias was eventually cloned by Liberty Executive Meghan Vert as part of her efforts to create the eighteen Power Suits. As a result of her experiments, it soon died, and the data gathered from it used to power the Psychic- and Dragon-Type suits.Powers and Abilities  WIPTrivia Jayron Aaron  Jayron Aaron is an Aura-wielding agent of Team Liberty.History Early History  Jayron was trained at a young age to be a ninja at one of the many training schools in Fuchsia City, along with his friend, Cyan Vero. When Team Rocket burned the school down, he fled out through the Seafoam Islands, eventually ending up near the Sevii Islands. During his time alone he met his partner, a Riolu, and the two trained together to use Aura. Finally, they managed to build a raft, ending up on Four Island, the location of Team Liberty's headquarters. The two of them were accepted into Team Liberty, and since then have become even closer friends.Operation R.A.L.L.Y.  During Team Rocket's attack on the Alamo, Jayron rescued his friend and former schoolmate Cyan Vero from a Rocket prison and learned that Cyan had befriended a Mew. Jayron convinced his friend to join Team Liberty and they teleported to The Alamo in time to defend it from Team Rocket. After the attack was over, Blackskull warned Jayron of the mysterious Shadowed Man responsible for Bluefalcon's death. As part of Team Liberty's endeavor to recruit Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and powerful trainers, Jayron traveled with Justin Icewater, Nate Delano, and Cal Riggs to Lake Acuity, where they managed to locate and capture Uxie. From there the group traveled to Snowpoint Temple where they utilized Team Liberty's Regirock, Regice, and Registeel to awaken and capture Regigigas. Jayron commanded Regirock for this fight, and the group eventually managed to subdue and capture Regigigas. However, the colossal battle caused a massive avalanche in Snowpoint. The group barely managed to escape before the city was buried in snow. Team Rocket used the avalanche as anti-Liberty propaganda, highlighting the rebel group's reckless behavior. Later, a Rocket agent attempted to break the Silver out of Team Liberty's prison (not realizing that Silver was in fact a double agent working for Team Liberty). Jayron confronted the pair and used Regirock to subdue them. Jayron later tracked down Riley, an aura-wielder from Sinnoh who was hiding out on Iron Island. After a brief encounter with Riley's Lucario, Jayron managed to convince him to join Team Liberty. As they talked, Riley gave Jayron information about his father and offered him a pair of gloves that had originally belonged to the legendary Sir Aaron, of whom Jayron was distantly related. Riley then led Jayron to a Deoxys that was also on the island, and helped him recruit it for Team Liberty.Assassination Attempt  Jayron traveled to Six Island to investigate a weapons company known as D\u00e9oza. Much to the aura wielder's surprise, a D\u00e9oza assassin had set up a trap for him on Six Island, in an attempt to kill him for interfering with The Shadowed Man's plans. The assassin blew up a warehouse filled with explosives that Jayron was in, killing another Liberty agent. However, by using his aura Jayron barely managed to survive the explosion. He quickly sought out the assassin and demanded information on The Shadowed Man. The assassin revealed The Shadowed Man's name: John Ford.Paradise Lost  After double agent Silver revealed the location of two of Team Rocket's bases to Team Liberty, Silvermind decided to put together a team of agents to lead an assault on Team Rocket's Hoenn headquarters, Paradise, in an attempt to completely eradicate Team Rocket from Hoenn. Jayron decided to join the group, but as they were about to leave, former Kanto Gym Leaders Koga, Sabrina, and Lt. Surge arrived on Four Island and offered to help. The reappearance of his old ninja master Koga caught Jayron by surprise, and he grew suspicious of the three Gym Leaders. The group arrived in Paradise and fought valiantly, but the sheer number of Rocket agents at Paradise overwhelmed them. Jayron fought alongside James Arthur and Scott Stone, but the three were defeated when several Rocket reinforcements arrived, including Robert Hawkins, who teleported into the hallway with a Deoxys to combat Team Liberty's own Deoxys. In a separate hallway, Koga, Sabrina, and Lt. Surge betrayed Team Liberty, revealing themselves to be double agents working for Team Rocket. Silvermind was captured and brought to Buzz, although Jayron and most of the Liberty agents managed to escape. As soon as they were back on Four Island, Scott and Jayron went to tell Goldhawk of Silvermind's capture, only to find the Liberty Leader in a state of shock. While they had been away on the mission, John Ford had invaded the Alamo and attacked Goldhawk and Blackskull with a powerful Darkrai. Ford managed to escape, but not before his Darkrai created a portal which enveloped Blackskull, leading to his apparent demise. Scott Stone mounted a rescue mission with the help of Soil Colossus, Inc. and . Jayron was happy for a chance to fight alongside his old ninja master Koga. But during the battle, Koga, Sabrina, and Lt. Surge betrayed the group, revealing themselves to be double agents working for Team Rocket. The betrayal of his old master left Jayron furious. To make matters worse, once Soil Colossus leader Carl Sandrock reached Silvermind he took her hostage, leaving the Liberty agents to fight their way out of the Rocket base alone. With Silvermind hostage, Carl Sandrock set up a joint mission between Team Rocket and Team Liberty in the Unova Region. The two teams were to capture a Manaphy in exchange for Silvermind. Jayron joined the representatives of Team Liberty, along with Scott Stone, Sonja Baron, Ryan Sanders, Jake Soren, and Alex Lockwood. After a debriefing at The Alamo, the six Liberty agents teleported to Rustboro City, where they met the Rocket half of the group: Joker, Ben Grindport, Dack Majors, Ray Hakuda, Cal Noren, and Jason Alco. From there they accompanied Carl Sandrock and a number of Soil Colossus agents on a plane to Unova. The group spent the night Castelia City, where Jayron met the bounty hunter Dara Trina. The two discussed the safety of the Mew that Dara had in her possession. After Jayron demonstrated that he cared for Pok\u00e9mon as much as she did, Dara entrusted Jayron with the Mew, warning him to keep it safe. Jayron accepted and nicknamed the Mew \"Midnight.\" The next day the group traveled to Undella Town, and from there they dove just outside of Unova's sea border to the underwater Ice Geode that housed the Manaphy Soil Colossus had requested. The allied Rocket and Liberty members traveled to the inner chamber and attacked the Manaphy, but shortly after the battle started Team Magma's leader Maxie interrupted the fight, threw a Master Ball at the Manaphy, and captured it, initiating a new search for Maxie and the Manaphy in the Hoenn Region. Upon returning to Undella beach, the group was attacked by a Shadow Genesect. After a small skirmish the Genesect escaped, and Jayron followed it to Dragonspiral Tower. Dara's Mewtwo fought the Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and Roderick Krane managed to capture it, while Jayron found and captured a Shadow Zweilous. After the fight, Jayron talked with Dara and learned that her Mewtwo was to be delivered to Ford.The Power of Mewtwo  Shortly after the mission in Unova, Jayron was promoted to Liberty Executive along with several other agents. Taking his new responsibilities seriously, Jayron began to train Team Liberty's Mewtwo, hoping it could learn the dimension-manipulation abilities that Dara's Mewtwo had demonstrated during the battle with the Shadow Genesect. Jayron and Mewtwo tried to use the dimensional disturbances created by Dara's Mewtwo to track down the bounty hunter before she could deliver the Pok\u00e9mon to Ford. They sensed a disturbance somewhere in Johto, but were unable to pinpoint its location. Realizing that they were probably too late to stop the delivery, Jayron and Mewtwo made their way back to Four Island. On their way back, Jayron and Lucario realized that they couldn't sense any auras around them, as if their abilities were suppressed. The next instant they were ambushed by a Team Energon submarine. Luckily, Cyan noticed Jayron's lack of contact and realized that the executive was likely in trouble. Cyan mounted a search party with Liberty Executive James Arthur. Cyan and James arrived in time to help Jayron defeat the Energon agents.Koga's Fate  Six months after Team Rocket and Team Liberty announced a truce, Jennifer Lorn sent an emergency call from Cianwood City. A live video feed revealed Koga, Sabrina, and Lt. Surge stumbling through the city, bloodied and crazed. The moment Jayron recognized Koga, he knew he had to do something about his old master. The executive traveled to Cianwood with Silvermind and Cyan in order to apprehend the former Gym Leaders. The three Liberty agents managed to defeat them with the help of a mysterious girl who identified herself as Esen Windred, the daughter of the late Shadow Admin Ace. Jayron, Cyan, and Silvermind helped bring the former Gym Leaders to the Alamo's prison and agents Jennifer Lorn and Hex Yutry to the infirmary. Silvermind convinced Esen to accompany them to the Alamo.Seven Island Adventure  WIP. This needs to be written for Colette's page, too.Personality  Jayron tends to be a helpful, cautious, person. He usually has a calm attitude, even if the situation looks bad. He will often assist if needed, though he prefers to travel alone (alongside Lucario). He is very knowledgable and caring about pokemon, their types, and their strengths/weaknesses. However, because of this, he can occasionally become a bit overconfident. He tends to avoid battling if his pokemon aren't up to it, and he sees the members of Team Rocket as beings who have ruled for too long and must be stopped, but not at the cost of other pokemon.Appearance  Jayron is dressed much like Sir Aaron/Riley, only his outfit is dark green in color and he also wears fingerless gloves, over which he wears gloves that help concentrate his aura. He has brown eyes, dark red hair, and is moderately tall for his age. Also, he carries a shoulder pack for items/eggs.Pokemon  Jayron doesn't favor a specific type of Pok\u00e9mon over another. He is skilled at raising fast and powerful Pok\u00e9mon, and they make up for any defense issues they might have by using their moves in creative ways to block or avoid the opponent's attacks. He also likes to use the unexpected, which is why he has some Pok\u00e9mon that aren't as good with speed, but great with defense. (Note: exp listed consists of battles in the New Topic added to the minimum experience each Pok\u00e9mon needed for its current evolution)Quotes  \"End of the line, I'm afraid. So don't make this any harder for yourself than you already have.\" \"You don't want my fury either.\" \"I don't know what you have against me, but when you attack Lucario, you attack my partner, my friend. I don't care who you are, that is unforgivable.\"Trivia Shade  Damien \"Shade\" Vicens is a Team Rocket Executive.History  Not much of Shade's history is known, having simply appeared one day. Shade possesses the strange quirk that he irritates the senses of Pokemon, due to an unnatural aura he possesses. The only thing known about his past is that he was born somewhere in Sinnoh and that his first name is Damien. At the age of 17, Shade joined Team Rocket and proved himself to be a very effective member. Not long after he joined, Shade rose to the rank of Executive. Shade has never failed a mission, and those under him that fail two missions have a habit of never being the same... More recently, Shade has arrived at Sinnoh, investigating some disturbances at Mt. Coronet. While there, he headed to Celestic Town, where he discovered information on the Dragon Trio, but was not able to deduce all of the info discovered by Seth Vicens.  Following three trainers into Route 210, Shade introduced himself as a Rocket Executive. Shade battled the trio of Seth Vicens, Klim \"Kinali\" Prizak and Evan Tierra, testing their skill. Though Shade began with the upper hand, the disobedience of Volt would cost him, as Evan's newly evolved Gabite barely defeated Edge, and Ryo's battle with Seth's Riolu ended in a draw. Seeing their potential, Shade left a warning about the future before heading back to Celestic Town. In Celestic Town, Shade released Volt, instead opting for a more obedient Electrike. Soon after sealing off the Celestic Town Ruins, Shade began preparing for his plan to capture the Dragon Trio when they are brought to Spear Pillar. He began comtemplating what would happen if his current plan failed, convincing him to bring in his most trusted mercenary, Bria Gallant to aid him. Shade also considered speaking to one of his superiors about sending him reinforcements. Over the course of several years, Shade managed to acquire several Master Balls, three of which he is saving to use against the Dragon Trio. Shade revealed to Bria that he intends to use the power of the dragons to end the war between Team Rocket and Team Liberty, while creating the world as he sees fit. How much of his plans he really revealed is currently unknown, only that his plans extend beyond Dialga, Palkia and Giratina. Shade has recently captured the Dragon Trio and is using their power to distort the world to suit his needs, effectively giving him control over time, space and dimensions. Currently, Seth Vicens, Evan Tierra, Klim \"Kinali\" Prizak and the Searchers are battling Shade and his Rocket followers atop Spear Pillar. Shade has recently revealed that he is not from this time, but from the future, the son of Seth Vicens. Despite controlling Time and Space, Shade found his Pokemon defeated by the trainers. Uniting together, Seth, Kinali and Evan used their powers to create a beam which destroyed Shade's shadow powers. Not willing to lose, Shade challenged Seth to a knife fight. During the fight, Bria released the Dragons, causing Shade to mortally wound her. Seth, in a rage, attacked Shade, but soon found himself defeated. While Shade prepared the killing blow, a mysterious bolt of lightning caused the ground beneath him to fall, sending Seth and Shade over the side of Spear Pillar. Shade was then sent plummeting off the side of the mountain by Evan's Garchomp, while Seth was rescued. Barely surviving the fall, Shade knew he was defeated, and is currently in Searcher custody, even though Shade knows that he will be turned over to the Shadow Admins for punishment.Personality  Shade is sinister and manipulative. He is very sadistic, ruthless and all around evil, and won\u2019t hesitate to use force on anyone who gets in his way. He believes that power is the way to get things done. Originally, he was brash, cocky, ruthless and cold, but soon became only ruthless and cold.Appearance  Shade is handsome, yet dark and intimidating. He stands 6\u20192\u201d, with an athletic build and lightly tanned skin. While not bulky, he is still surprisingly agile and strong. He has red eyes, and long black hair with red streaks. He wears a black suit with the Team Rocket \u201cR\u201d over his heart. Shade also keeps a knife sheathed in his suit. Shade has an unnatural aura, almost evil, which causes Pokemon to be intimidated. It also appears to some that Time and Space appear to react strangely around him.Quotes Trivia Trainers  Trainers are people who capture, train, and generally care for Pokemon. Trainers will often battle other trainers to a Pokemon battle.Buzz  Max Bussle (a.k.a Buzz) is a Team Rocket Shadow Admin. He currently lives in a lonely wooden hut in the middle of the forest somewhere in Johto, he is the only one who knows where it is. Even the other Rocket Shadow Admins have no idea, although they most likely could find it if they wanted to.History  Buzz was an only child raised by his parents in Azalea Town, he never got on well with the other children and instead managed to make friends with a whole swarm of Yanma. At the age of 10, Buzz watched as both his parents were killed by a young man who was trying to earn the respect of Team Liberty. It turns out that Buzz's parents had both been undercover members of Team Rocket and had never told him. Buzz moved permanently into the forest, where he eventually built his log cabin. He trained himself and his three favourite Yanma for years before setting off to gain revenge, eventually finding and killing the murderer of his parents. Along the way one of his Yanma, who he once had a nickname for, but now only calls Yanmega, evolved. Although he had got his revenge, Buzz was not satisfied, so he joined Team Rocket, and has elevated in the ranks quickly due to his cold lack of emotions towards humans. Buzz had a secret project with a so-far mysterious scientist in which he apparently was attempting to find a way to be turned into a Yanma. While it was unsuccessful before Buzz shut it down in a way to get arrested quickly and easily, it is known that they performed at least one mostly successful test in which they turned a human into a Sableye. Despite being a high ranking executive, Buzz was often used for scouting ahead of missions due to his fast Pokemon and great stealth. He was sent to hunt down Ace and Goldhawk and in the end succeeded in killing Ace. However, during this confrontation, his Yanma \"Yan\" was killed by Raikou and Goldhawk went free. Buzz is the first \"new\" Shadow Admin.\ufeffAppearance  Buzz is pale skinned with green eyes and a bald head. He often wears a white shirt over a bright red t-shirt and black trousers or similar combinations He used to wear a long, green jacket on top of the bright red t-shirt and green trousers along with green goggles that are similar in shape to the eyes of a Yanma. This appearance was to make him look similar to his Pokemon, but after certain events such as the death of Yan, recruitment of the first Pokemon not of the Yanma evolutionary line into his party and his promotion to the rank of Shadow Admin he changed to his current appearance. He likes to wear a belt, on which he keeps 4 Pokeballs, his Pokegear, a pistol and a small knife. Buzz also has a bandage around his right shoulder which has been there for a while, as he seems to get it injured on a weekly basis.Personality  He does not act kindly to other people, and tends not to talk to anyone much when he isn't giving orders. On the outside he seems mean and cold, but he has a secret, loving side that only his Pokemon can see. For most, these traits make him very hard to like, but they helped him get to high places in Team Rocket.Pokemon  Current: OtherTrivia Joker  Joker is one of the four Shadow Admins, the leaders of Team Rocket. Joker is considered the second in command to Shadow Admin Sleight, and as such was chosen to lead the assault on Four Island in his place. She is in charge of running the Rocket mainbase in Johto.History The Rockets Rise  WIPThe Liberty War Begins  WIPThe Four Island Invasion  WIPThe Isshu with Manaphy  WIPPeacetime  WIPThe Goldenrod Blitz  WIPHavoc  WIPHome Front  WIPAppearance  Joker's modern appearance was first seen during the invasion of Four Island. Appearing to James Arthur and Bluefalcon in the destroyed control center, she was revealed to be a tall, beautiful woman, with pink hair and a heart-shaped face. Her hair is curled at the tips, and she has almond-shaped, purple eyes. She wears a white, formal shirt, and a long white skirt, as well as a pair of gauntlets capable of focusing her psychic abilities.Personality  WIPPok\u00e9mon  Joker's team is focused entirely on Psychic and Ghost-Types, from what has been seen. All of her Pok\u00e9mon are extremely powerful and able to operate of their own accord.Quotes  WIPTrivia John Ford/The Shadowed Man  John Ford, also called the Shadowed Man is a mysterious and powerful figure in Rise of the Rockets. Originally introduced as a contact to Shadow Admin Sleight, Ford is a terrorist whose sole goal in life seems to be to end the Rocket-Liberty War, through any means necessary. While he has worked with Team Rocket in the past, Ford has his own agenda, which encompasses a large number of people, Pok\u00e9mon, factions and areas. As he feels that everything has been put into place, Ford has recently begun putting his grand plan into action. WIPHistory  WIPActions  WIP The Shadowed Man is notorious for using others to further his own goals, the biggest one being to take out both Team Liberty and Team Rocket so as to set up his own government and restore order to the world. Along with this, he has preformed other deeds for other purposes. Ford's involvement in various events can be categorized by their importance to his own plan. Actions that are or were intended to greatly further his goals are considered \"primary actions,\" while those that were meant to be small steps are considered \"secondary actions.\"Primary Actions Secondary Actions Appearance  True to his name, the Shadowed Man's true appearance was not known for quite a while, as his features have always been obscured by darkness when he video contacts his 'prey.' However, hints had been given about his appearance despite the shadows: the Shadowed Man is known to wear glasses, and has relatively short hair. He has an impish grin, which appears on his face when he has either placed his target in a position he wants them to be in or when there is something he wants. He has a cold, even voice, always hiding the true meaning behind his words with its calmness. Jayron Aaron managed to learn from an assassin who had been hired to kill him that an alias of his is John Ford, a name which has spread among the various groups since then. Ford's appearance was finally revealed when he attacked the Alamo during Team Liberty's invasion of Paradise. He wore a long black coat and fedora, as well as a pair of black sunglasses and a black scarf around the lower half of his face. He stood at six feet tall and had dark hair, the exact color of which was hidden by his Darkrai.Personality  Ford is a sly and manipulative, as well as confident, individual. From his very first appearance in Rise of the Rockets, he was shown to use his knowledge and information as a way to get Shadow Admin Sleight to do just what he wanted him to do, even daring to directly treat the Rocket Admin as an inferior while he spoke to him. His appearances since then have been marked by his manipulation of others to achieve his goals, intentionally putting them into positions where they have no choice but to do what he wants them to, either by threatening them or outwitting them and convincing the person in question that his course of action is the most logical one. Because of this and his actions towards those he interacts with, he is intensely disliked by most of the people he comes into contact with, and even some who have never even met him. On top of the above, Ford's desire the bring about what he thinks of as \"world peace\" is strong enough to drown his sense of reason when it comes to empathy towards other humans. He is more than willing to use force, deception and death as a way to get Team Liberty and Team Rocket to stand down. While his intentions are certainly noble, they are nullified by the fact that he does not show concern for the lives of anyone, going so far as to back-stab those whom he helps when he no longer sees a need for them. Ford is also an incredibly intelligent being. Taking three seemingly disconnected groups, he managed to forge a master plan to bring about the fall of Teams Rocket and Liberty, and through that found a way to end the war, which he is currently pursuing. Always a step ahead of his enemies, he seems to take virtually everything into consideration before making a move, so as to make sure that everything goes as he wants it to. Along with this, Ford is extremely secretive in nature, going to great lengths to hide his appearance from those he comes into contact with, as well as making sure that, if he needs to talk to someone or vice versa, he contacts them, not the other way around. He seems to have super intuition in regards to this, as he seems to almost always know when someone wants to speak to him.Pok\u00e9mon  WIPNine  Ford's larger than average Darkrai, which he used in his attack on the Alamo, is his only known battling Pok\u00e9mon. This Darkrai is much more powerful than regular Darkrai, in that it can resist its weaknesses to Fighting Type and Bug Type moves, with its only real weakness being to light, and has also been shown to be able to rapidly recover from a large amount of damage inflicted on it by multiple opponents. It has also been shown to be able to use Palkia's signature Spacial Rend attack, demonstrated when it created a hole in space inside of the Alamo that soon after pulled Blackskull into another dimension, and as such it is possible that it can also utilize Dialga's Roar of Time as well. Despite this, it is not the \"Alpha\" Darkrai, as has been theorized by several people; while there was no explanation given for this originally, it has since been revealed that Ford's Darkrai, named Nine, was one of ten Darkrai who opposed Arceus long ago, after the Creator Pokemon had bestowed the ability to manipulate time and space onto the Darkrai. Led by SombraD, Nine was the most powerful of his followers, though left before the imprisonment of the other Darkrai; following Sombra's recent attempts to return to power, Nine has reluctantly joined in the cause again, though he sees little probability of the schemes succeeding. Other attacks at its disposal include Dark Void and Shadow Ball, as well as the ability to create tendrils of darkness that it can use to ensnare its opponents and the power to manipulate a sort of green fire. Nine seems to be more level-headed than the other nine Darkrai -- he acknowledges the possibility of Sombra's plans failing, and follows Ford's order because he wishes to stop the war between Team Rocket and Team Liberty, something he and Ford both know can not be done peacefully. He is prone to annoyance when touched by beings he deems unworthy, as demonstrated when he burned Sombra's arm after being marked so as to be tracked later. Nine is not afraid of SombraD like the other Darkrai, having confidence that he would be able to defeat SombraD if the need arose, and might even have the skills to back that claim up. A unique trait of Nine is that he is able to control special, green flames, the exact same color as his eye.Quotes Trivia Scott Stone  Scott Stone (Toa Neya) is a trainer fighting for Team Liberty. WIPHistory  Scott grew up in a relatively good life despite Team Rocket: Sootopolis City, his hometown, was hard to access in any way but diving and flying through the crater, which meant resistance factions could gain a tactical advantage simply by covering chokepoints. This meant that Scott has seen more rebellions there than perhaps some higher-ups in the Team Rocket chain of command. Team Rocket always managed to take them out, but Sootopolis never truly \"fell\" entirely to Team Rocket, with old rebellion leaders simply disbanding in public, reforming into other groups behind the scenes, etc. He has Steven Stone as an uncle, from who he secretly inherited an Anorith and a Lileep at age 14. (He always liked Fossil Pokemon before then.) Since then he has found Team Liberty, who have carved out the city in the crater from Team Rocket control, and stuck with them. WIPPersonality  Very intelligent. He tends to be relatively bold, but he always prefers to hedge his boldness with knowledge first. He's somewhat zealous in his desire to beat Team Rocket. Generally likes Fossil Pokemon and foods of various exotic cultures. Flaws: Scott has a tendency, like Armaldo, to not back down from a challenge, especially if he feels he knows about what he's doing. He also has a tendency to analyze things too much sometimes. WIPAppearance  He wears a green headband with symbols of a Claw Fossil and a Root Fossil on them. The rest of his outfit is similar to a green-colored version of a Hoenn trainer's outfit. Turquoise eyes.Pokemon  WIPTrivia Jake Soren  16 year-old Team Liberty Trainer from Goldenrod City.History  Jake was born in Goldenrod City and grew up there. His Dragonite and Typhlosion were given to him by his father, who was the head of the Resistance in the city. His mother was one of the best shoemakers in the city, and made the most durable shoes sold. For that, many trainers came to their family and bought her shoes.Appearance  Jake stands at 5'7'' . After a dimensional-traveling mishap, Jake now has a mop dirty-dishwater hair with grey eyes. His frame is slimmer and less stocky than before.Personality  Jake is a silent person, tending to dwell upon matters concerning the entire Pokemon world. He is focused and serious, usually not making jokes. But, even though he is focused, Jake is friendly and tries to be a helpful asset to the team. He, though not quite sure what to think of Alex Lockwood, has become good friends with the other trainer. Jake cares deeply for his Pokemon and would do nearly anything for them. He stands for freedom and justice, but doesn't believe that war is the answer to the Pokemon world's troubles. Before joining Team Liberty, Jake wasn't very sure of himself, but after his adventures with Alex, Alec, and Ryan, he has become strong and willful.Pok\u00e9mon  Species: Typhlosion (Male) Nickname: Inferno Trainer: Jake Soren Appearance: Completely the same as other Typhlosion, except that the fire on Inferno's neck burns brighter than a usual Typhlosion's does. Personality: Inferno has a tight bond with Dragonite, Aggron, and Jake. He is prepared to give his life for his friends. Ability: Blaze Specialty: Has a high defense stat. Known Moves: Flamethrower, Ember, Quick Attack, Tackle, Leer, Eruption Species: Dragonite (Male) Nickname: None Trainer: Jake Soren Appearance: Not different from any other Dragonite.

Ability: Rock Head Specialty: Has a high defense, and because of this, is slower than usual Aggron. Known Moves: Headbutt, Metal Claw, Tackle, Mud Slap, Harden, Iron TailShannon Ramirez/Bluefalcon Appearance  WIPPersonality  WIPPok\u00e9mon  Shannon is known to have owned a Blastoise, a Vaporeon, a Swampert, an Empoleon and a Tentacruel. She has also used a pair of Arcanine on at least one occaision. Bluefalcon's Pok\u00e9mon are unique in that they are self-driven when the need arises, as evidenced by her battle against the team of Rockets that were attempting to steal Liberty information.Quotes Trivia Justin Icewater  Justin Icewater is a Team Liberty recruit.History  Justin's family at home used to include a mom, a dad, and a brother. His parents went into hiding 9 years after the takeover. Justin has been interested in Pok\u00e9mon since he was born. He and his brother would go out to a field to see the wild Pok\u00e9mon. The first Pok\u00e9mon he befriended was an Electrike, when he was 3 (he didn't actually catch Sparky until he was 9). His parents were veteran Pok\u00e9mon Trainers (mother specialized in Ice type Pok\u00e9mon, Father specialized in Water type Pok\u00e9mon), so he was surrounded by many Pok\u00e9mon. Shortly before he joined Team Liberty, he found and caught a Seedot. He has traveled to Hoenn to recruit Regice. Shortly before he met Zac Flash. After the capture Zac left. Justin joined a group to recruit Regigigas, and succeeded. Justin and Zac faced off at Four Island, with Zac on Team Rocket. There Justin had an injury, which put him out for a while. After he recovered and awoke, Justin set off to Isshu.Personality  Justin is stubborn. He is clumsy, but fairly fast. He's very smart and cunning, and does not like to wait. If he can, Justin will travel by foot to where he's going; If not, he'll travel by foot until he can't. He is unable to do this in most groups, though. After his battle with Zac Flash, Justin's personality lightened. He is now more open, and accepting to other people's opinions, although, is still easily annoyed.Appearance  Justin is fairly tall (about 5'11\"). He has blond hair and blue eyes. He often wears sunglasses. Likes to wear a T-Shirt with a green vest over, and jeans. He wears dark blue gloves, and running shoes. Since arriving in Isshu, Justin has had a fresh start in almost everything, including his appearance. He has gotten taller since his battle with Zac Flash.Quotes Trivia James Arthur  James Arthur is a Team Rocket Agent in Pokemon: Rise of the Rockets. To Team Liberty he introduced himself as an informant and hacker known as Avalon. However, he has since defected to Team Liberty and has then rose to the rank of Executive.History  James was born four years before Team Rocket gained control of most of the world in Celadon City. His parents are unknown to him as he was placed in an orphanage at a young age. During this time period, James caught a Ralts which he nicknamed Guinevere. He continued to live at the orphanage until the age of fifteen, when he started his hacking career and bought an apartment for himself and Guinevere. He lived well off for the next three years when he joined Team Rocket. During the next four years James caught a Scyther which he named Lancelot, gained a great deal of influence among Rockets, and begin a major hacking spree into the Rocket Mainframe. James after being assigned to the mission to capture legendaries James chose his target to be Celebi. He found and captured his target in Ilex forest, however did not give it to his Rocket superiors. Instead he found three Team Liberty Agents, Alex Lockwood, Jake Soren, and Alec Lighttree, and challenged the first to a battle. Using Lancelot against Alex's Absol, he lost and gave the Celebi to Alex as a prize to further his own goals, one of which was planning a defection to Team Liberty. James then left for Snowpoint City, however his helicopter broke down and he continued on foot, encountering a Togepi and a Sneasel. The Togepi he caught and named Galahad. The Sneasel tricked him into a snowstorm which nearly gave him frostbite. After reaching Snowpoint, James was attacked by a radical (but not related to Team Liberty) trainer whom he defeated. James though did not leave him to die out in the cold. During his stay at the Pokemon Center, James received orders about the attack on Four Island. As he received those orders, James successfully hacked into Team Liberty's mainframe computer and warned them about the attack as Avalon. James became a part of the attack on Four Island (after fighting two of his fellow rockets) although he had little intent on doing much. He was more interested in the fact he saw Alex Lockwood again and challenged him to another battle. James won this time, Lancelot tying with Absol, Eevee with Galahad, and Guinevere defeating Piplup. After the missiles hit Team Liberty's base James entered Team Liberty's base and discovered Bluefalcon revealing that he was Avalon. Before they could leave however Joker appeared telling James that she knew about his hacking on the Rocket mainframe for a while and ordered him to shoot Bluefalcon. James decided to instead warp out with Bluefalcon using Guinevere. Joker sent an Alakazam in pursuit whom fought with James, Galahad and Lancelot for a brief time before he was called back. He then saw the death of Bluefalcon who gave him an ID and told him to tell Blackskull and Goldhawk she was sorry. James after Blackskull officially welcomed him to Team Liberty became a part of the Lugia recruitment Team and headed towards Pewter City to find an Old man who knew about Lugia and Ho-oh. However they found out that the old man had died and went to find a pokemaniac who could tell them more about Lugia. James however had to leave back to the Team Liberty base to give information about Team Rocket bases. James however saw an attempted break out of Silver which was interrupted and stopped by various Team Liberty agents. Silver then gave info about Paradise and Purgatory and was then released. James received a text shortly afterwards from a Liberty agent telling him to watch the news. James pulled out his laptop which he could TV on and played the now really overplayed broadcast where Jessica Ortrune smears Team Liberty's reputation. James before telling Selene intel about Team Rocket complemented Ortrune in his head impressed in her ability to drum up support from the crowd. Lancelot and Galahad evolved in their pokeballs during the conversation surprising James before they warped to Snowpoint. In Snowpoint James hatched a quick plan to catch the Sneasel he encountered earlier with a green ear which succeeded but not before Jessica Ortrune appeared and recognized him as the traitor. However instead of confronting him let him go as soon as he captured the Sneasel, who James warped back to base and prepared to go to Paradise with the newly caught Mordred (Sneasel) in tow. James, Silvermind, and the rest of the Team Liberty strike force landed on Paradise to attack. After finding an entrance, Koga opened the door (Koga, Lt. Surge, and Sabrina had joined the strike force) causing suspicion from James and Jayron. After fighting through several battles (and Mordred's evolution), they nearly managed to penetrate completely into the heart of the base. However, due to a betrayal of the three Gym Leaders, the Liberty Agents were repelled, some of them including Silvermind were captured. After returning to base, James, Celebi, Thomas and a few others went and fought Jirachi who between Jirachi and Deoxys broke more copyright laws then I care to count. After the finishing three way attack, Thomas captured Jirachi and they went back to Four Island. At there he was recruited by Roderick to go with him to Orre to help put a stop to Snagem, who agreed along with all three of the united William family. In Orre James and Michael (the man who fought against Cipher the second time) and went to the Under and fought two grunts. At the end of the battle, the grunt tried to kill Guinevere (immediately as she was evolving), but before he could James shot him fatally, haunting him. The two of them went down into the Deep Colosseum where they fought 10 snagem grunts and won. The final grunt sent out and (after it annoyed him) attacked Mudkip. James not liking this, asked Michael to borrow his snag machine, which James used to snag the Mudkip whom he dubbed Gawain. Then the two went further in and faced Snattle, who with his constant explosions and earthquakes made a large section of the Deep Colloseum collapse. The two escaped by using Guinevere's teleport which warped them and the Snagem agents (who were then captured) the Pokemon Laboratory HQ.Personality  James' personality is composed of a light-hearted gentlemanly demeanor and a desire to ensure his survival. He also has little sense of loyalty and can betray depending on how beneficial it is to him. James follows orders unless they interfere with his own plans. He tries to be calm and polite as well, this not for his benefit, but because he is just that sort of person. His experiences however, have made a better person, with nobler intentionsTrivia Quotes  WIPBounty  Bounty, also known by his real name Devon Coleman was one of the four Shadow Admins of Team Rocket, up until his secession from the group and subsequent formation of the Rocket Separatists. Bounty is the third most powerful member of Team Rocket as a whole, after Sleight and Joker, and was in charge of running the Rocket mainbase in Sinnoh, called Purgatory, up until its destruction during the Ten Darkrais' invasion.Appearance Pok\u00e9mon  Bounty specializes in Steel-Type Pok\u00e9mon.Quotes Trivia Ho-Oh  Ho-Oh is the Legendary Rainbow Pok\u00e9mon who flies in the sky upon seven-colored wings.History Ancient Times  Ho-Oh lived in the Tin Tower in ancient times, until a war burnt it down. Three Pok\u00e9mon were caught in the blaze, and Ho-oh resurrected them, creating Suicune, Entei, and Raikou. Legend says that it left the world to wait until Pok\u00e9mon and humans could live in peace.Rise of the Rockets  Twenty years after being spotted by Ash, and following the Team Rocket take-over, Ho-Oh was chased out of the Johto region by Team Rocket, though the reasons for this action are unknown. A Team Liberty retrieval group was sent to find Ho-Oh and try to ally it to Team Liberty. After chasing Ho-Oh's trail across Kanto, the Team Liberty group was able to find Ho-Oh at Lavender Town, where it had recently destroyed the Rocket base there. The group managed to convince the Rainbow Pok\u00e9mon to join Team Liberty, and Ho-Oh took the team to the Alamo to help fight against the Rocket Invasion. It along with Kyogre, a Mew, Celebi and various other Legendary Pok\u00e9mon assisted in the defense of Four Island. After repelling the attack, it continued to keep watch over the island. Later, Team Liberty agents Alex, Ryan, and Jake returned from a mission with an Entei and two Raikou--one a male, the other the female Raikou that had saved Goldhawk and Ace. The She-Raikou demanded to talk to Ho-Oh, as the Legendary Beasts throughout the world were beginning to lose control over their powers without Ho-Oh to guide them. Though reluctant at first, as it had begun to lose sight of its true purpose in life, Ho-Oh agreed to fly again after the female Raikou threatened to take over the Legendary Bird's position herself. Shortly after leaving Four Island, Ho-Oh was attacked by a group of Searcher agents, who had been ordered to capture the Legendary Bird. Ho-Oh was left to fend off the attackers by itself until four of the Legendary Beasts sensed that it was in danger; this group consisted of the She-Raikou, a Suicune whom she had alerted to the trouble, Team Liberty's Entei and their newly recruited Raikou. Together, the Beasts and Ho-Oh managed to defeat the Searcher forces, including their own Lugia. Now unhindered, Ho-Oh set off once more, finally returning to the skies.The Ancient Darkrai  The dark shrouds summoned by the Ancient Darkrai eventually prompted Ho-Oh to travel into Hoenn and Sinnoh, both of which had been fully covered by shadows following the Ancients' release.Powers and Abilities  Ho-Oh, being a Fire- and Flying-Type Pok\u00e9mon, has a wide range of Fire and Flying attacks. The most notable of these is Sacred Fire, a powerful, sometimes focused, blast of intense heat and flame. Ho-Oh is said to have the power to resurrect other beings. It reportedly did so when three Pok\u00e9mon were caught in the fire of Tin Tower, creating the Legendary Beasts. Whether this is true or merely legend is unclear, though in either case Ho-Oh has yet to demonstrate this power in the present. Ho-Oh is capable of resurrecting itself, should it sustain mortal damage. This was demonstrated when Feral Tierra fought against Ho-Oh, where both badly injured one another. The resulting resurrection energies manifest as rainbow-colored flames that form an egg around Ho-Oh, shielding it while its body transforms into a new, healthier form. Each regeneration possesses its own unique eye color and personality built upon a particular virtue. As of its current life--which has been said to be its third--Ho-Oh's eyes are green and his dominant personality aspect is Vengeance. Like all other Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Ho-Oh is capable of telepathically communicating with humans and other Pok\u00e9mon.Main Page Upcoming Changes in the RPG  So, since BZPower is still down as of 5/15/11, and I need to let people know about changes that will be made once it comes back on-line, I figured I would just post them here for whoever to see. Expect a couple of blog entries regarding this as well. What you can expect once the forums come back on: -A new No No Losses/God-Mod Policy. This was something that was bugging me right before the forums went off-line, and it's something that is going to continue bugging me until I do something about it. Basically, I've noticed a steady increase in people like, not losing in any battles again. Even with stronger teams, people don't seem to realize that it gets extremely boring reading battles that you already know the ending to. I'm going to go into further detail about this in my BZP blog and start cracking down on this at a later date, but for now, just consider losing a few battles more often than is done now. That's basically what I'm trying to accomplish with this new policy, especially because this unwillingness to lose has caused me to throw battles where I'm controlling the leaders of the main organizations, despite it not making any sense in-game. Again, more details later. -Overlapping between players' missions is going to be more emphasized. This is essentially just going to stress the fact that other players storylines have just as much of an effect on the environment as yours. I couldn't help but notice that there are times where things have happened to, say, a town (such as a few buildings being destroyed) and then those events have been ignored by other players when they go there. I just want to stress here that the game would be more community-based and the atmosphere of the game more realistic if these events were acknowledged by people other than the NPCs and the people involved. -I've kept this under wraps for quite a while, but after using the down-time for some serious thinking, I'm going to make this public knowledge. As most people have probably noticed, there are A TON of organizations in the game right now, almost all of them run by ~1 player, and almost all of them with \"bad\" motives. Unfortunately, that, for the past 6-8 months, has had the adverse effect of literally clogging up the RPG with what appear to me as dead plot lines and a bunch of groups that have giant egos and somehow all manage to secretly amass enough power to (supposedly) rival TR and TL, despite what I've said in the past that goes against this. I want to and will seriously discuss with the owners of these groups what the future holds for these organizations, because as it stands, the fact that most are around just for the sake of being around at this point has made it impossible for anything on a large scale to effectively take place without interference from some other group that should not have known about the plans for the event. -And... I believe that's all for now. Any questions or comments can be posted here... or you can wait until BZP comes back up. You're choice. Parugi 23:08, May 15, 2011 (UTC) Mostly just posting to show I acknowledge your post. And to show that there really are people who still pay occasional attention to this wikia. I guess this means once the forums come up I'll be getting a big pm about Team Energon. Hmm...I'd love for them to help out somehow, but neither Ford nor anyone else has given them much to do. And Detranix (between his inactive periods) literally skips his Darkrai around way to fast, so there's no time to even think of IC'ing a defense. They would do something about the Darkrai...but the Darkrai keep phasing through them like they don't exist lol. -Don\u2019t blink, you might miss me. Umbra of Doom (talk) 08:53, May 19, 2011 (UTC) Not a big PM, but a PM nonetheless. Mainly what I'm getting at here is that these other groups need to start doing more in terms of their own plans, and therefore actually start putting themselves into positions where they can and will be defeated at times and weakened as a result. As things stand, the mindset that anyone needs an invitation to do anything is what has been slowing the RPG down -- because no one will go out of their way to try their own thing with their groups and put them in the sniper's scope, they aren't putting those factions into positions where they can be weakened or hindered at all, making them appear way stronger than they actually are when they, for whatever reason, decide to jump into what should be a strictly TR-TL plot. And even when something does happen to them, somehow it gets written off as being a \"minor loss\" -- something which infuriates me to no end and is my biggest reason for the new God-Mode and Faction policies, because that has never been done with either TL or TR, even considering th fact that those two groups are much bigger than any of the other factions. The other problem is just inactivity with the characters or players in general. My prime example being (and not to pick on Neya) Soil Colossus and the entire Manaphy/Silvermind plot. Admittedly, Neya was very active in the beginning of that arc; however, somewhere towards the middle his activity teetered off and it suddenly became a game of posting and then waiting for 3-7 days on end just to get a reaction from one of the SC employees. At this point, post-plot, they're just there (which, and again not to pick on anyone, they were never even supposed to stick around after the ending portion of the arc.) On top of simpy being there, they somehow have all of this intelligence information regarding TL, TR and, IIRC, Ford, despite only being a drilling company. And what is that intelligence being used for? Nothing. It's like it's known just to be known, as well as to make it clear to TR/L that \"We're a threat\" -- when, really, those groups aren't going to see you as such if you choose to just sit on that info, which is exactly why I have yet to make any of the Shadow Admins or Goldhawk truly react to those kinds of reports. It's the same deal with almost all of the groups -- which isn't cool and is technically a violation of the metagame rule, since no explanation has ever been provided aside from \"spies in the organizations\" -- which shouldn't and doesn't work when it comes to information that only the top TL or TR officers would know. It's a slightly different situation when it comes to the Darkrai, because Detranix is a slightly erratic poster when it comes to updating their mission. But that doesn't mean that TE or the Searchers or SC couldn't use some of the information that they've apparently gotten on TL or TR to do something against them independent of anyone else. tl;dr: Don't wait around for other people, because that's boring and doesn't help the game's health and growth at all.\u00a0:3 Parugi 15:47, May 21, 2011 (UTC) Hmm...okay. Well part of TE's main plan was to attack Legendaries, which was the primary reason they were going after Darkrai. With all that power, draining it would be a huge boost to them...except they don't hang around much. I view them as a futuristic type team- but also a power-hungry one as well. While you say we shouldn't wait for others to make their move, it makes no realistic sense for TE to continue their world-domination plans until they handle the Darkrai's apocalyptic threat. -Don\u2019t blink, you might miss me. Umbra of Doom (talk) 16:29, May 21, 2011 (UTC) As I said, different situation. Before the Darkrai became a public threat, there was little reason for any of these groups to not act against TL or TR like they said they were going to. I'm saying that once the Darkrai are out for the count and there is no immediate threat of destruction from supernatural forces, I expect these groups to start being active in their attempts to take out TL and TR -- which you don't need an order or invitation to do. Aside from the master plan, Ford is essentially leaving the Searchers, TE and Team Galactic to their own devices. Parugi 16:54, May 21, 2011 (UTC) Okay, once the Darkrai are taken care of, I'll find a way to put TE to better use. Nice banners for the factions, btw. -Don\u2019t blink, you might miss me. Umbra of Doom (talk) 07:26, May 23, 2011 (UTC) Seeing as my time has freed up slightly, allow me to explain what is going on with the Darkrai plot. Recently, I have been extremely busy with school work, as well as personal things, and as such I had little time to post. For that I apologize. As for my skipping around of the Darkrai, I found it would get boring repeatedly going over the exact same thing for every town, and since I don't want this plot to last as long as the Silvermind mission, I decided to give them a bit of a speed boost in their mission. I also admit to having a slight writer's block. Nevertheless, when BZP is back, I will continue with the invasion at a more frequent rate. Also keep in mind, that once they leave, they can still be intercepted at any point before they reach their next destination, aka, my inactive periods. However, keep in mind these Darkrai have a planned end, and will not be destroyed/drained/imprisoned along the way. Aaaaand that's about all I can think of for now\u00a0:) {C}Detranix 23:18, May 26, 2011 (UTC) Umbra: Alrighty. And yeah, I'm rather fond of it, thanks; though I like my main page picture better.\u00a0:P Detranix: Completely understandable, and the explanation is appreciated. Along with that, I can also safely confirm that the planned ending for the Sombra Arc will be rather enjoyable to behold, and as such Detranix's inactiveness will pay off in the end.\u00a0:) On the topic of changes, I've been thinking of other (IMO) weak areas in the RPG. So, expect to see the following points addressed alongside those listed at the top of this page: -Game mechanics. A lot of people seem to be under the assumption that RotR acts strictly under the laws of the video games, down to the base stats of each individual Pokemon. As a result, there are prejudices against certain Pokemon, derived from the thought that, \"They're weak in the games, so they must be equall weak here.\" This is not so, as I've shown time and again that base stats from the game aren't necessarily the rule (see Forrest's or Bounty's Special Attack-based Aggrons,) and I think it's time an official post was made to correct/break this mindset. -I don't think I've mentioned this very much, but it's something else I've been thinking about lately. Character development. Specifically, I think we could use more of it -- specifically darker developments than we've seen in most characters. I'm not going to be super strict about enforcing this, as it's mostly just a suggestion based on logic of war. The reason I'm mentioning it at all is the fact that, considering some of the more horrifiic acts that have been seen in the game (Bluefalcon, Blackskull and Ace's deaths, among others; wounds that have been inflicted; the sheer fact that the RPG is set in the middle of a war) -- and believe me, there will be more -- there should logically be darker effects of the minds of the characters than have been seen, especially those who are still teenagers. Adults in real life don't get through wars without some sort of effect on their psyche, so, even in a world of Pokemon, I wouldn't expect kids to go through it unscatched. Again, I'm not going to be strict or extremely forceful about this, but I do think it would make the game more interesting to see darker internal conflcits pop up from time to time. I, for one, have a couple going on with a couple of characters -- Gavin, for instance, and Kyle, though to a less obvious extent -- and another that I know is in the works sounded incredibly interesting when it was described to me. So yeah, just something to consider. Other than those two things, and the three changes I originally listed, I don't think there's anything else that I'm going to be majorly revamping once the game starts back up. Again, thoughts and opinions can be posted here.\u00a0:) Parugi 23:56, May 29, 2011 (UTC) Neya: Finally here. (Since the forums are down anyway and there's no advertising policy here, I can finally admit that the thing I've been distracted by is primarily [*sniped*-Neya]. Their [*sniped*-Neya] was the inspiration for SCI's name). Also, technically, Soil Colossus Inc. isn't exactly just a drilling company. They're more like \"revolution business\" backed with a lot of cash. But yeah, that entire arc really feels like a cheesefest in retrospect. Barring the Team Magma invasion, I've really gotten the feeling of them being \"Organization Mary Sue.\" However, I'm more than willing to finally have them start working to eat away Team Rocket once Det is finished. And yes, I'll try to have my characters lose a few fights. [/End Neya] Still not a good idea to mention the names of other forums; if someone such as a BZP mod or admin happens to click a link to this wiki and then the link to this talk page... yeah. You get my drift, right?\u00a0:P Anyway, yeah. I wouldn't say the arc was a total waste of time or an entirely bad idea -- it did help in adding over 100 pages to the RPG and a lot of character-specific stuff came out of it (most of it good, some of it terrible; I won't lie, but I'm not going to go into another mini rant about it either); it was merely the rather ridiculous amount of time it took to get through it all that ruined it. That, and the whole \"betrayed/re-kidnapped three times\" thing (first time was my fault, admittedly, as I included the Gym Leaders. Second time was excusable because it was planned, but was a compelte gut punch to the TL members due to the Gym Leader thing. Third time was completely out of the blue and was what officially killed it, imo; I wasn't even very clear on what was going on at that point.) Regardless, lesson learned, no? Use cliches sparingly.\u00a0:P Parugi 04:52, June 4, 2011 (UTC) So, after reading the status updates from B6, I've come to the realization that there is a very real possibility that we'll be moving into a fresh topic once the forums go back on-line. I've e-mailed him to confirm or disprove this, but I just want everyone to be aware of that fact, as well to tell you all that you need to be prepared to do a bit of digging in the original topic from time to time if this does turn out to be the case. If so, it may be a day or two before I get the topic reposted, because I'll most likely have to recode the entire first post. =/ -sigh- Oh, tragic consequences of improvement... Still, this won't affect ROTR as much as it will the BZPRPG and Day Run, so, meh. Also, on the topic of this Wiki itself, I really need help in resorting certain pages so as to make them uniform. Specifically, I need character pages resorted into the format that, for instance, the Goldhawk page uses, and the info templates should be changed to the one on my pages -- infobox trainer, since that's what it's there for. There are also a couple of legendary Pokemon I need editted. See the Darkrai page for the best example of what I'm looking for for these. Thanks, everyone! ^_^ UPDATE!!: It's confirmed: We'll be in a new thread. Luckily B6 said he could send the coded first post to me, so I won't have to recode it. Phew! Still, it sucks that we're sort of losing our 250 pages. -.- Oh well. Parugi 03:08, June 20, 2011 (UTC) Neya: We can still link to the original RPG and count pages from there-I'm probably going to need a refresher, given how long the upgrade has taken. Also...when Scott, Reyna, Carl, and Victor get back...plenty of opportunities. Assuming Det is okay with it, having a battleship mode Ice Geode fight Darkrai might be a fairly awesome fight... (also, Parugi: could you please post your email account? I would REALLY like a method of communication about a plot idea...)[/end Neya] Oh, that was my plan. I just think it looks incredibly weird for the beginning of a new topic to be continuing from what was posted in another -- hence why I never post on the old forum I used to hang out on, because threads, as a rule, were continued in new topics once they reached 30 pages. X3 Anyway, the battleship thing would have to be run by Detranix, Alku and Kinali, but if you have another plot idea you can either send it to my personal e-mail (dragon_master@prodigy.net) or you can be the first to e-mail the official ROTR e-mail address (bzpriseoftherockets@hotmail.com). 8D Parugi 21:41, June 22, 2011 (UTC) Yay; looks like the forums should be back on-line soon. My prediction is that it'll be up within the next week or two. So y'all better hide yo' BIONICLEs, hide yo' games, and hide yo' everything else, cuz we'll be RPin' again soon -- and believe me when I say that a TON of new plots and decisions have been thought up and agreed upon in these last two and a half months.\u00a0:D Parugi 00:39, July 20, 2011 (UTC) Hola again. I'm back, late as usual. (It's Umbra, so you don't have to scroll all the way down to the sig) I've become addicted to yet another game, after my previous favorite was inconvieniently shut down...permanently. Anyway...if memory serves correctly, (and my memory of the past things in this RPG fade every day with these forums down) I actually had been showing the war's affects take a toll on Jayron in a few situations, and especially during the Silvermind rescue mission. He had some internal conficts after seeing rockets who looked a lot less like the 'model TR member', and more like people trying to survive. Probably one reason he was so relieved to hear GH's announcement for peace with the TR seperatists. I hadn't come up with many conflicts with my other characters (other than Cyan's guilt over his failed project and Dara's issues with people), but I can always think something up. And as for physical damage...I suppose they could take a tumble or two. I don't remember well, but I think Jayron got shot on one occasion, or at least considerably wounded. One final suggestion, especially for any members who might decide to join us in the future: add a summary (I can guarantee it won't be a short one, but oh well) to the first post about what's happened since the prologue you made before. That way any new people can catch up with the current status of the Rpg. Or, knowing that any summary about RotR would likely be absolutely huge, make a page on here with the summary and put a link on the first page to that. (We may already have a summary on here, and if we do, forgive me, because it's been a while) -Don\u2019t blink, you might miss me. Umbra of Doom (talk) 05:42, August 15, 2011 (UTC) Honestly, I have no clue. Last thing I remember...the Omega Deoxys getting caught and Dara still fighting Ford's agent. Other than that...who knows. XD -Don\u2019t blink, you might miss me. Umbra of Doom (talk) 05:01, August 16, 2011 (UTC) OMG it's Blade!\u00a0:P Character Development: I should probably clarify that I'm not necessarily talking about super mental damage to people. Just so everyone knows that, and just so their characters don't all start developing, say, severe depression over the course of the game.\u00a0:P Anyway, what I'm mainly talking about is like, a more apparent progression of change in people. I acknowledge that a lot of characters have shown conflicts throughout the game, like Dara's distrust of people, for instance; however, very few of those cases have really changed that much throughout. That is what I'm mainly talking about -- characters are stated to have or develop issues that then hang around and come up fairly often, but never really evolve into anything new. An example would be what I'm doing with Gavin, who started out with an inner drive for unspecific revenge, and who is, in due time, going to resolve that conflict with very little change of his overall view of the game, but will still result in a change of character. Over time, he's become less self-centered and more willing to help other people -- not to mention, he's become disillusioned with Team Rocket and essentially left them. That's as best as I can clarify this right now. In short, progressive change is what I'm emphasizing when I say \"character development.\" Summary: TBH I hadn't given any thought ot his, but you guys are right, and as Blade said, it's pretty much required now. I'll hop to it as soon as BZP gets back up. As for its format, it's most likely going to be its own page on here, or the first post (after the base post) in the topic will be dedicated to this, as there isn't going to be any room in the base post itself. Again, though, I can't do much for it without access to the RPG itself, so it'll have to wait. Latest Events: Off the top of my head... -The Legendary Beasts group (Sonja, Kyle, Zach and co.) were following Shekou up to Ekruteak City, iirc. We were heading that way, anyway. -There was the Omega Deoxys and Dara vs. Quincy, as Umbra said. -Gavin was tracking \"someone\" down in Lavender Town -- which relates to what I said above about his planned story arc. -TL and TRS had just formed their alliance. -Orange was infiltrating the Hojohsin base in Sootopolis. Along with that, James Arthur was planning an attack on the HL's \"white house,\" so to speak, so as to get access to get James Pierce's computer. -Ethan, Eric and Kothra's character, whose name escapes me, were tracking down the rest of the Team Aqua fanatics in Hoenn. -Goldhawk was just about to finish his \"trade\" with Maxie for Silvermind. -I think most other people were at Four Island, still hanging around after the announcement of the alliance mentioned above. I don't really remember much else involving most other people's charcaters, unfortunately. So, yeah. As you can tell, BZP needs to hurry up and get back up before everyone forgets everything. >> Parugi 19:37, August 20, 2011 (UTC) Yes; it's me! =P Again, I forgot about this, sorry. D= 1. That's true. I'd been working on my own stuff, like the Black/White/Grey(And Orange. =P) story arc that was just about to get underway. =P 2. Well, if you want a secondary post, then I think that might be a great idea. I'd be willing to host that too, if you wanted.(I don't think you can double post, even for an RPG...) 'Course; technically that's what the co-host is for, but erm... I kinda forget who the Co-host is. ^_^; 3. Yeah, that sounds about right. I didn't know if anyone had done anything in the time I was off(Though I had figured it was overnight =P) before BZP went down. 4. I agree. I'm likely outta luck though, was working on something before it went down, and I'm likely not gonna have access to my PMs or such, so I more or less have to start over on that. =P -- Blade 1. I remember the set up for that, for the most part. This is another reason why the downtime is irritating me - it came at just the right moment to cut off a whole bunch of stories that were about to start or had just started. Though, admittedly, ROTR hasn't been hit as hard as DR almost definitely has. >> 2. It's Bundalings. XP But yeah, I'd appreciate having someone with above-average activity hosting the summary post. Heck, you don't even need to do the writing -- I can just PM updates for you to add onto it. 3. Other stuff might've happened; I don't know for sure, because it went off-line sometime between when I last checked it during lunch and the time I got back from school that day, so about two to three hours. Which stinks, because I had been constructing an awesomesauce response to Lust/EW in the BZPRPG that I've since forgotten. Not to mention what was happening in DR and Island of Pain... >> 4. From the sounds of it the PM system hasn't really been touched at all. Hopefully (*crosses fingers*) nothing was deleted, though, because if so that's a good two, maybe two and a half years worth of GM and plot information for multiple stories and RPGs gone out the window. =/ Parugi 00:03, August 21, 2011 (UTC) [Neya] 1. I was hoping for a chance to use Victor-making a character explicitly for Unova was in part to help out people there-while letting me have a character calmly distanced from the action. I agree the downtime is annoying. 2. I'd be willing to help out a bit more. I would still have to balance that with the fact I've gone WAY more active on another site's Pokemon flavor project (coughCAPASBsinceitdoesn'tseemlikethesiteisanywherenearfinishedtransferringIdon'thavetonecessarilyobservetheadvertisingrulesyetcough) in the absence of BZPower, but I would be willing to help out nonetheless. 3. ...And that's not even considering the stuff I was hoping to resolve with Parugi. 4. Yeah. I honestly don't have much to say. However, until then...why not temporarily make a spinoff RPG? It could keep interest up for those who frequent the wiki, perhaps codify a few points that could later come up, etc. I'm not certain about the idea, although I'd like to hear a response. [/Neya] I'll address Parugi first, then you, Neya. =P Parugi; 1. Yeah, I agree... on both counts. =/ I wonder what'll happen for the Bionicle RPGs? I mean, would they just allow them to be reposted, regardless of the fact that probably two contests have come and gone since the downtime? =/ 2. Alright then. =) And yeah, it'd make sense, because it'd likely have to be updated a lot, as the RPG progressed further. =P 3. Yeah... You can't really tell for sure, unless the Wayback Machine has the last moments before BZP started it's downtime. =P And yeah; DR and Island of Pain were starting very interesting things, as well. =/ 4. Hopefully. I'm crossing my fingers as well... But yeah, that is a really good point. =/ Worst comes to worst, if the PM system is still intact, but on the old forum, I hope you can log in, just to look around... Like; not touch anything, but view the old Control Panel(The stuff where you could change your avvies and such, since it had that notepad, which I used a lot. =P) and PMs. Just not update either, since it's gonna be an archive. But yeah; not just in our RPGs, but everything would be affected. I wonder how they'll handle the people whose Premierships ran out during the downtime? I never did figure out how long mine was for, so I have no clue if it'll still be up or not. xD Neya; 1. Well, there were things about to happen in Unova; it was in the setup process for the most part when BZP went down, but once it gets back, we should be back in order. =) 2. Yeah. I think a lot of us will have to look between different forums and go, 'Hmm, now what?' as soon as BZP returns. =P 3. Yeah... A lot of stuff was about to happen, right when BZP went offline. =/ On the bright side, because of the downtime, we were safe well after the anniversary of the RPG being created. =P We just... Couldn't post. =P 4. A spinoff RPG might be an interesting idea... Would it take place about the same time, but not interact with much in the main RPG, or would it use the same characters from RotR? But an RPG to keep up interest would be a good idea. =) General stuff; Just curious, but does anyone happen to have any way of getting, say, the profiles from right before the Downtime? I hadn't added White's profile, and figured I may as well work on some of the pages on here so it's not as barren. =P -- Blade The idea is simply to . Once BZPower heads back up [or B6 announces that they've finally stopped running into issues], it would be wrapped up, locked [to remove the implications of the advertising rules,] and linked. One last brief broaching of the subject of stat bias (sorry to open old wounds)...while I'm able to understand it to a degree, I have to question the idea of Pokemon not having natural tendencies towards a specific stat-and the fact that I could very well make a Shuckle named Kapura then give it insane speed and attack, at the cost of defenses being about that of a normal mon. And what if I decide to introduce an incredibly slow Deoxys-S? I'm willing to tolerate special attacking Aggrons-I would still think that they'd get slightly more mileage with physical attacks in terms of raw power, but that Aggron's special movepool justifies the means. I believe that while Pokemon should be a bit more even than base stats, base stats should still be used as rough guidelines. If you want to use Luvdisc, guile your way to victory and be creative-it will actually stand a chance normally now without that, but expect to lose more matches with it than not if you don't roleplay it in clever and practical ways. -Neya Since Neya's last edit was on a standalone topic, I'm going to address that before saying anything else. My point about the stats is less in regards to the whole \"predisposed to be good at something\" idea as it is towards the \"this Pok\u00e9mon has bad stats in-game and therefore is bad in the RPG\" attitude that I've run into a couple of times, which ties into the whole \"game mechanics apply 100%\" idea that I've also seen. In general, I'm fine with you guys treating Pok\u00e9mon as having natural specialties, with a comparitively smaller amount of those same Pok\u00e9mon specializing in different areas; however, what I am not fine with is people treating the games -- and especially the super zealous, on-line competitive aspect of them -- as the be all, end all statement on a Pok\u00e9mon's usefulness and abilities in the RPG. While it may be impossible to train an effective and powerful Luvdisc/Wigglytuff/whatever on the DS, the same doesn't necessarily apply here, simply because ROTR's mechanics aren't the same as the games. To be specific, the games act on what is essentially static gameplay -- everything is, for the most part, set down to calculations and specific effects, I.E. stats. What the games don't take into account are things like movement; size; the environment (aside from the weather.) Because of that, something like Wigglytuff or Luvdisc are fairly easy pickings in the games. In the RPG, however, that is not the case, because those variables that are ignored in the games are taken into account here. A Pok\u00e9mon who normally doesn't have that great of defensive or speed capabilities in the games -- such as, say, Golurk -- can very quickly become a massive threat if, say, his size is drastically increased, causing his body to become so thick that attacks have very little effect on him and his strides to become so long and powerful that every step he takes causes earthquakes and 20-foot-wide indents around his feet, resulting in the requirement for actual strategy against him, as opposed to just \"Use type advantages!\" Long story short, ROTR mechanics allow even the simplest of targets in the games to become massive threats in the RPG. That is what I'm talking about. Don't write off those weak Pok\u00e9mon just because of numbers that are given to you by a game. Anyway, on the other topics: 1. Last I heard -- this may not still be the case -- the summer contest was skipped and the previous winners -- the ones currently running -- can just continue on. However, it remains to be seen if that still holds true considering the fact that the summer term is virtually over. My guess is that if the forums were to come back on-line right now, the RPGs would continue, but the Fall contest would still be done, due to the fact that tomorrow marks the exact spot where the last winners' play was cut off in terms of their terms. Again, though, I don't have a definitive answer. 2. Pfft; you people and your other forums. I'm not in that position due to the fact that I've been concentrated on researching for writing, coming up with future plots (which I've made a lot of, and they are all awesome) and getting back into anime. <3 3. You could always e-mail me, Neya... I posted my address like you asked. Waaay up this page.\u00a0:P 4. Not much to say. However, my PMship won't run out until April, so I'm good. B) Also, on the character profiles, no. Unless you do a really specific Google search for her profile, then you might find a cached page of some sort, but other than that, I'm afraid you'll have to wait.\u00a0:3 5. TBH I don't really think a down-time RPG would really be worth it. The projections I've been hearing are that BZP will be up by the end of September at the latest. Not to mention, we would have to find a forum to host it on, I would have to write the whole thing up, and before that I'd have to figure out at what time to set it and what the story would be, then we'd have to get in contact with people whom I don't currently have contact with, and it'd just be a big mess. So, my suggestion is... Plan. For when the forums come back up. And the RPG resumes. There are tons of cached pages if you google ROTR, so it shouldn't be that difficult to get a grip on what was happening last. =) Parugi 06:28, August 24, 2011 (UTC) I think you both covered the Game Mechanics stuff very well. =P So, I'll just stay out of this for now. =P 1. I see then. Makes sense; but hopefully Day Run will be able to continue on for a little while at the least. This is only the second big downtime I've been involved in, and I technically wasn't a member yet for the first. =P 2. That makes sense. =P I kinda had to be on the other forum I was on, since well, I basically run it, but... =P However, I wouldn't mind trying to find the profiles that are not on here, and then adding them to the Wiki. Along with maybe helping to update on what's happened, though most will have to be from memory for obvious reasons. =P 4. True. =P You more or less got it right before the Downtime started, if I remember correctly. =P(You must've given that last bit of money they needed to start all the upgrades. =P) Figured. I'll try to find it somehow; but if not, not much I can do. =P No-one happens to remember White's first name, do they? I'm trying to remember, but I've used a lot of names for different things over the past few months. D= 5. By the end of September? Well that's reasonable, and more of a concrete date than what I've found. =P Though; technically if we had gone through with this couldn't we just use a Wiki page? It wouldn't be as easy, but if we continually used the IC and OOC tags, along with our sigs, and remembered to archive it every so often, that part wouldn't be a problem. You bring up a point about the rest of the stuff, though. I'll try that for a few things, like White's profile. No guarantees of course, but if I can get a recent cache, and figure out where White's profile is, theoretically I'd have access to the entire RPG. I'm good at manipulating Caches to get info. =P -- Blade 1. Indeed. 4. oh noes so it was my fault noooooooo! And no. IIRC it was some sort of Japanese-sounding name, but I don't remember exactly what it was. 5. That's true. I'll think about it. Parugi 22:11, August 24, 2011 (UTC) 1. Yep. I was just considering joining when that happened. ... Aaaand then my account ran into some problems, so I didn't officially join until August. Speaking of which, I've been there approximately 3 years now I believe. =O I join in either 07 or 08... I believe it was '07 though, so that'd put me at 4 years. Makes a little more sense too. =P 4. =P Nah, was likely a bunch of reasons, though it didn't hurt. =P Yeah; I know her last name was Shirayuki(Or something like that); but I- ... WAIT I REMEMBER! =D It was Summer; since I did that whole opposite naming thing, since Shirayuki means snow or something like that. And Summer is not when snow is around, for obvious reasons. =P I'll have to look tomorrow for the profile, then. =) 5. Alright, I was just pointing it out; since forums aren't necessarily needed. However, if downtime's so close to being over, unless it's something disconnected from everything(Or serves as backstory), it's likely not an idea that would work well. But, it's your choice in the end. =) --<span style=\"background-color:grey; color:limegreen; border-left:thin solid limegreen; border-top:thin solid limegreen; border-bottom:thin solid limegreen; font-size:8pt;\u007f\">Blade<span style=\"background-color:black; color:red; border:thin solid limegreen; font-size:8pt;\u007f\">Talk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 01:41, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 5. Hm.... Maybe we could make a page for people who want to to post short stories expanding on the backgrounds of some of their characters? That, imo, would be easier to do than an entire other RPG to have to figure out. Plus, the majority of characters really haven't had their backgrounds explored all that much, and this seems like a good opportunity to do so. Parugi 05:08, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 5. That might work. Would be an interesting thing to do. =) Also, forgive me if my sig messes up; I'm still trying to figure it out, and well... It's not going very well. =P -- Blade All righty. Once I get more opinions on it, I will set up the page. So... opinions? And k. Parugi 05:44, August 26, 2011 (UTC) Well, I've been working on a 6- or 7-part backstory for my Rocket character, Dack Majors (great use of the downtime!). I had planned on simply posting the parts once a day or so once the forums were back up. Konuju ...*Poof* Fashionably late in conversation as usual...(if you haven't figured out who that is yet, read some of the entries WAY up near the top XD) ...*reads previous entries since departure* ... Noo!!! Not my notepad! O_o I have all my battle counts recorded on there, so I know how many battles a pokemon needs for evolution. If that thing gets wiped, I'm gonna be super-unhappy. I have a few other extremely important Bzp-related things on there as well. So...I'm not sure I really want to know what will become of it, because I doubt it will be good. ...Don't you remember the good old days when it was random messages and bubble wrap? What happened to that? If we still had the bubble wrap, it wouldn't matter how long this took XD. Man, if Bzpower never has this problem again, I promise never to complain about server busy messages and day-long maintenance periods again. (Don't hold me to that promise) Oh, and approximately two weeks from now is the celebration of my...6th(?) year on Bzp, if memory serves me well enough (can't remember if I had the vakama or norik spinny). There will be very little celebrating if nothing changes between now and then. Ah well. ...*Poof again* -Don\u2019t blink, you might miss me. Umbra of Doom (talk) 08:51, September 3, 2011 (UTC) Oh? Who's that? ... Umbra... Rings a bell, not sure why though. *Sees it's a clear bell* Ah, that explains it all. =P Yeah, lot of stuff in mine too... No battle counts, but you bring up a good point there. =P But, a lot of other RPG stuff. =/ Same here. And Bubblewrap might still be around, but good luck finding it's filename, and if it's still up on the server. =P Yeah... My anniversary came and passed with no celebration, since the site's still down. =P Hopefully it's not much longer... There aren't any caches, so I can't really do anything in terms of updating any profiles aside from expanding it and such. =/ --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 14:11, September 3, 2011 (UTC) [Neya]So... according to B6, there's no ETA for the site to get back up. ...Any suggestions to keep interest alive? (October 3, 2011)[/Neya] ..... blaaaaaaaaaah.......... I've no new ideas. At all. I really don't want to do a downtime RPg, though -- with the majority of people not active on here, it'd leave a lot of people in the dust on new events once the forums come back. The only things I can think of doing are either the short stories idea above; mass page editing to fill in character backgrounds, e.g. stuff that happened but wasn't actually shown in the RPG due to being backstory; or we could jsut have some gigantic, massive discussion of various topics within the RPG, on a separate page. The lattermost thing Iv'e found has actually yielded some interesting results when talking to people like Alku, not to mention, now that I think about it, there's enver really been very much discussion of the RPG's events in the past... Bleh. idk. --Parugi 02:07, October 4, 2011 (UTC) Discussion might help things. While this turn of events is kinda disheartening(Though it does sound like it's FINALLY getting near the end of the upgrades); we have to keep hope that it'll be back up by the end of the year. I agree about not doing a downtime RPG; too many variables, like what can or can't happen due to messing things up when it returns unless we set something in the past. However, there's also the fact that we have discussed a lot of things already... Even though there's obviously still a 20 year gap we don't know about.\u00a0;) --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 16:26, October 5, 2011 (UTC) Indeed. And as I said on... a certain social networking site... the less complaints are voiced about the downtime, the quicker it'll be back -- and, actually, to keep this place from degenerating into another hole, I'd actually appreciate it if the gripes were kept to a minimum here. The wiki's the only place I've found that isn't full of mindless griping, so I'd like it to stay that way.\u00a0:P But yeah, anyway, that's part of my point; on top of the 20 year gap, which I've been thinking of writing an extended story for so as to fill in, I haven't actually seen any speculation on what people like Ford and Sleight are really up to -- which, again, after talking to people like Alku and Detranix, I've found such speculation to be really fun and interesting to read. Not to mention it's a good community builder, and I'd be more than happy to contribute hints to the discussions to add an extra bit of interest for people. It's up to you guys, though. If you want, I can try and get something worked out with the community portal thing so that we have a place for this stuff to happen; it's just a matter of opinion. --Parugi 00:14, October 6, 2011 (UTC) Well, there's another place, but I can't exactly mention it, especially with BZP being so close to coming back up. =P But yeah, that makes sense. That's a really good point. I'm not quite sure myself, though Ford does seem to be trying to slowly slip into taking control of the four regions... Though why, I have no clue. =P Yeah... That might be a good idea as well. Or at least find some way to get that off and replace it with a similar, yet 'fixed' community portal. Because as it is now, there's no way to fix that, because it heads to a totally different Wiki... And that seems to be simply because of the way the name was set up. On an unrelated note, YES YES YES! The control panels are preserved! =D Now I can start on writing stuff in one of my many stories again. ^_^ And of course editing; I'll get to adding Summer's page sometime in the next few days, with luck. --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 16:20, October 10, 2011 (UTC) Oh? You guys hadn't done any posts after I posted? Wow. And here I was worried about missing stuff. =P Well, that should help me out then. Let's get started then... As a famous Doctor once said... Allons y! --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 16:26, October 10, 2011 (UTC) Oh, he's after more than that... or less, depending on how you would define his major goals... Ah yeah; I'd actually noticed that little problem last week. Still, we do, technically, have the \"Wiki forum\", which is hsoted on this Wiki and not the other, general Pok\u00e9mon one. but idk; it seemed really confusing to use. And yes; I'm especially happy since this means that we can actuallt get some worthwhile, RPG-made information up now. ^_^ --Parugi 22:04, October 11, 2011 (UTC) We're so gonna have to archive this after BZP's back. xD Hmm... Intriguing. =P Well, I like good twists. That's partially why I'm not guessing too much. =P Well, that's mostly because the Community Portal merely has links to other stuff... The Wiki Forum indeed works perfectly, since it doesn't try to reference a non-existent place. =P And the most confusing part that'd be about that forum, is the fact that it's set up identically to talk pages. xD They were tossing a different look around, however, which is the odd thing; especially since that different look was thought up like 3 years ago. 0_o Yep. Definitely gonna be awesome. =D We can also fill in history from the RPG, as well. =) And any characters that hadn't gotten put on here yet can have their profiles added... Like White. =) --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 13:37, October 12, 2011 (UTC) Indeed. I see. XP I can say that everyone will be extremely surprised by what he's eventually going to do... as well as what rules he breaks as a character to achieve that goal. Needless to say, I had a LOT of fun during the downtime working out the rest of Ford as a character. I think the results will bring some new and fresh twists to the game.\u00a0:P Well... there IS a different commenting style thingy that I can turn on to modify the way talk pages work, but.... I'm not sure how well it would translate... Indeed. I said that on the main page.\u00a0:P Though that reminds me; I need to fill in Lyxek's information on Kyle's page... --Parugi 04:57, October 13, 2011 (UTC) 1. Luckily there's a way to only edit one section, or this would be hard to manage. =P 2. Sounds very interesting; can't wait to see what happens. =) 3. Oh, it's optional? From the sounds of talk going on at the Bleach Wiki, it doesn't sound like it'll be that way for long; but I'm willing to give it at least a partial chance first. Unless it's totally different from what I'm thinking you're referring to, but I'm still willing to give it a shot. =P I mean, it can be turned off again, correct? 4. Yeah; I saw that. =P I'll hopefully get started on that either tonight or Saturday. Maybe tomorrow, but definitely not tomorrow night. =P --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 14:02, October 13, 2011 (UTC)Universal page styles?  Sooo looking at a bunch of character pages... They're really not uniformed... XD Anyone else think we should set up a standard page layout for factions, characters and bases and whatnot? Not all at once, at this very moment, but as we go on? Parugi 03:02, October 7, 2010 (UTC) Agreed. Most of the character pages use this or a very similar layout: History, Personality, Appearance, Pokemon, Quotes, and Trivia. I usually set up new pages based off previous ones that you, Neya, Glados, or I made, since they all tend to be constructed the same way. In the case of new pages like Thomas', which Yawn just set up, I at least helped out by putting in an infobox template and filling out as much of it as I could. We're making progress at least. I may set up some pages for the (living members of the) Williams family (ELoM's characters), but it will take a bit of looking, and I may have to pm ELoM to get the details on them. Also, I need some help in getting Geoff's page finished, as I haven't found his profile yet. -Umbra of Doom 06:22, October 7, 2010 (UTC)==  Hey, can anyone tell me the current Retrieval teams, which side they are for and what they are hunting? I probably should know this...but I fell behind >.< HeyimShadok 10:13, June 14, 2010 (UTC)Um..  I'm sorry, but doesn't the color scheme of the whole wiki seem... I don't know, eye-searing? The black-and-red makes me dizzy...Boom! Grammar Hammer!  It is a sandbox-RPG, with little ristrictions that are in use and general freedom for the player. Ristrictions? I think it's supposed to be Restrictions; but I can't edit it. =P /EDIT: Dang signature stuff... --Blade 19:44, March 14, 2011 (UTC) Fixing... Parugi 23:08, May 15, 2011 (UTC)Revamping parts of Wiki  As an additional announcement regarding the changes to the RPG, 'm also working on/will be working on the Wiki as a whole over the summer and, in general, jsut until I think it's prettyful enough.\u00a0:) Things already done include a welcome pic on the front page, changed colors from that terrible gray-blue combo, and finally revamped Goldhawk, Bluefalcon and Blackskull pages. Now, on to other stuff! *whoosh* Parugi 02:36, May 22, 2011 (UTC)The Pokedex Holders  I recall we had a discussion on this, and I know you said nowadays in the RPG they didn't count, I'm meaning this more as the named characters from the different things like Adventures/Special. Could I start to make pages for the important characters like Red, Blue, and Yellow? Not Green, for obvious reasons(Nice referencing of the US naming scheme, even if that's only by accident. =P), but... Also, when BZP comes back, I think I might have some questions for you. =P --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 15:37, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Oh goody; questions. 8D Anyway, yeah, go ahead and make pages for them. And you could still make one for Green -- even if she is dead she was a character who did a lot off-screen. --Parugi 17:48, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Yep, questions. A lot involve time travel, interestingly enough. =P That's true. One thing first; what about the personalities? I mean, not all of them are the same across the canon, so unless we expressively say that the multiple counterparts are all in here(Like Red and Ash), then we may run into some problems when the personalities are slightly differing.\u00a0;) Same for the Pokemon, though a mix could be used there, if there's no multiple counterparts. --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 18:10, September 5, 2011 (UTC) eh.... time travel.... From what I've noticed -- and this is arguably the case -- because the anime incarnations of characters like Red and Blue are quite different from their manga counterparts, it's generally been shown that both anime and manga characters exist -- such as, for example, Red and Ash are both in the RPG. The merging only really happens with the game and manga characters, mainly due to the fact that the mangas could just be seen as more in-depth tellings of the games' storylines. So, for their personalities... it's pretty much up in the air. I think Blue, Red and Yellow all kept their... Adventure (IIRC) personalities, so I would just use that as a base where applicable --though I'm not entirely sure if that's the exact one I'm thinking considering the fact that I haven't really read any of it. Still, the idea is still there. Parugi 18:25, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Heh heh heh. xD But yeah, mostly it's a case of what-ifs. =P Well, Blue and yellow are fairly obvious... Yellow because she's Adventure-only, and Blue because, as you say, it's an expansion of the game character... And I really like Adventures. =P And Red, I believe you did a very good job with Red's personality, for not reading Adventures. =)(And for the game's version of Red having only this to say: .............. ............ But yeah, Adventures/Special(Which is the one I always mention to you), is what I more or less base stuff off of, and is where I keep getting the name 'Pokedex Holders' from. =P But okay. Now, what about the characters from the different manga, that aren't exclusive to that?(Like, where there's Adventure Red, there's also the other first gen Manga, which I can't remember the name of, but has a version of Red/Ash that has a talking Clefairy) Would they be like... Relatives? Or something else similar to that? Anime and manga stuff I understand splitting now(I knew we merged some, but I couldn't remember which. =P), but I'm not sure about that situation. Just a little clarity while we wait, since stuff like this is all we have to do. =P But as for stuff like the Adventures characters(At least the Pokedex Holders we've shown), I'll start on them within a day or two. =) --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 20:42, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Mm........ unless something story-related happened in a drastically different way in the talking Clefairy one compared to Adventure/Special, I, honestly, would just comepletely disregard it's existence. Same with other side-mangas. Like I said, it's difficult to make a call when I don't know the material, but I think it'd be way too much of a hassle to try to implement all of the different ones into the RPG -- especially if the general events of them all are virtually the same. So... *shrug* Parugi 21:32, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Alright then. =P Yeah, I was kinda thinking the same thing, but since you're the one who makes the final decisions, I figured I'd ask you first. =) I believe the events of that manga was pretty much the same as the game, however... But I'm not certain; I've only read Adventures. =P And okay. Got up a Gym Leader page, so there's the original 5(if you count Green as original, seeing as she was Adventures/concept art only until gen 3. =P) Pokedex Holders. Now, slightly off topic of this, but can I put up a 'recruited trainers' section to both the Rockets and Liberty pages? I'd be going off memory only, along with certain pages that have info on that, but I think it could amount to something, and would save tons of editing when we gain access to the old topic. =P --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 21:39, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Oh, one other very quick question... How do we handle the fact that Adventures goes back and forth aging the characters(Like instead of FireRed/LeafGreen taking place concurrently with R/G/B, it takes place like 3 years after the GSC arc and so)? Do we just ignore the possible canon issues, or do we assume that while that stuff happens, it takes place at a very slower pace for the stuff that's not set in stone?(Like three months instead of three years for the FR/LG arc) Just wondering that, mostly for Timeline purposes, and for what age Blue's supposed to be. =P --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 21:49, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Recrutied Trainers Section: Go ahead. Timeline: I'll probably have to get back to you on this unless this answer answers your question: Assume all of that stuff happened before the Black and White story, keeping eveyrhting as-is, and then from the end of the Black and White story the ROTR story starts. Not sure how helpful that is, but I don't have time for a longer reply atm. Parugi 21:54, September 5, 2011 (UTC) Alright then. I think that might help, given that we don't really even know what happens when from the end of Emerald to start of Black/White, so if any problems are found later, we could always figure it out at a later date. =) And really, for now that's all I really need to know, that I can just use the current-canon stuff for the moment. =P --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 21:59, September 5, 2011 (UTC)Community Portal  While technically that's not used... I think it's wise to point out that the Community Portal currently leads to the Pokemon Wiki, and not our Community Portal. =P And I'm sorry for giving people a lot of reading to do today, if they like to read over all the edits on the Recent Changes. =P --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 18:15, September 6, 2011 (UTC) Np. I honestly have no idea as to how I can change that link, so... it's kind of stuck as is atm. Parugi 22:58, September 6, 2011 (UTC) Alright then. If you want; I could attempt to redirect it or something, though again, it's not like it's used right now anyway. =P And since there's more important things to be done... --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 23:01, September 6, 2011 (UTC)BZPOWER RETURNS!!!  BZPOWER RETURNS!!! Yes, this is Parugi. Now, before anyone asks, no, the RPG still isn't coded, so it's not back up yet. I will try my hardest to get it back up by tomorrow, but don't count on that. Once I get word from Black Six, I am also probably going to get Day Run back up, for those of you who are players in that, as well. Anyway, PARTY! - Parugi Woot! It's back! Now, I see you've got the first post up, do we just start now, then? Just want to ask before I do anything. --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 01:16, October 14, 2011 (UTC)BZP  It really doesn't have luck with staying online, does it. xD If there's even a bit of a bright side here, though, it's that I have a little more time to try and think up my tie in. Got an idea for something I'll need to get for Zach once the Downtime's over, though. =) --BladeTalk Page.ContributionsThe war of secrets has only started. 15:07, April 28, 2012 (UTC) Curiously, this kind of thing always happens when something big occurs in RotR. Like anniversaries. >_> Sigh. Oh well; I wasn't planning on being online for most of today, anyway... Have a good break, everyone! Parugi 19:04, April 28, 2012 (UTC)Selene Ashera/Silvermind  Selene Ashera (commonly known as Silvermind by the other members of Team Liberty) is a leader and early member of Team Liberty. She was Executive of Strategy for Team Liberty when she was first introduced near the start of Rise of the Rockets, and has since been promoted to leader following Bluefalcon's death. She then led a small group of Liberty agents in an attempt to capture the Rocket Master Facility called Paradise; however, she was captured towards the end of the conflict when her single battle fighting style and abilities as a far-off general proved ineffective against the large number of Rocket agents.Pok\u00e9mon  Selene owns the following Pok\u00e9mon:Quotes Trivia Darkrai  Darkrai is the Pitch-Black Pok\u00e9mon, a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon native to the Sinnoh region.

Arriving on Newmoon Island, the group was able to locate the Darkrai and attempted to convince it to join them, though he stated he would only go along with the Rocket agents if they could defeat him in battle. The squad fought and defeated Darkrai, using his weakness to light against him, and were finally able to recruit him to their cause. The same Dakrai has been used multiple times by Jessica since then, both in the recruitment of other Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and in the defense of several bases. Darkrai acted as a translator when the group went to speak to Rayquaza, and with his help the group was able to get the Sky Dragon to ally itself with Team Rocket. Darkrai later assisted in both of the battles at Paradise. In the first fight, an attempted invasion by Tema Liberty, he fought and defeated many of Team Liberty's Pok\u00e9mon, and then transported a group of Liberty agents back to Four Island. Shadow Admin Buzz attempted to have Darkrai teleport Liberty Leader Silvermind to another of Team Rocket's main bases after managing to capture her, though by the time he was ordered to do so a teleportation block had been set around Southern Island, preventing an escape. Darkrai was then sent to intercept the Liberty squad attempting to rescue Silvermind and herd them to one of the training facilities in the base, as part of Buzz's plan to ambush them. While successful in this course of action, Buzz's plans were foiled when Carl Sandrock got a hold of Silvermind and dropped the teleportation block, betraying Team Liberty as he made off with their leader.The Searchers' Darkrai  A female Darkrai was mentioned to have been captured by the Searchers, along with a Lugia, a Mew and a Cresselia. The Searchers' Darkrai has been used primarily as a way to track the actions of the Ten Ancients following their return to power, and their subsequent invasions of Sinnoh and Hoenn. Unlike their other Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, the Searchers' Darkrai did not partake in the effort to stop Ho-Oh from destroying the Searchers' base of operations. It is unknown what happened to it following the Rainbow Pok\u00e9mon's total annihilation of the organization.Team Liberty's Darkrai  Cyan Vero sought out a Darkrai near Lavender Town, and after an intense battle, he caught it for Team Liberty. This Darkrai later informed Cyan and Jayron Aaron of the newly returned Darkrai in Sinnoh. Like all of Team Liberty's other Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Darkrai was sampled and cloned by Liberty Executive Meghan Vert as part of her efforts to create the Power Suits. The clone later died as a result of Vert's experiments, granting power to the Dark-Type Suit in the process.The Ten Ancients Pre-History  Long ago, ten Darkrai were granted the power of Time and Space, to keep balance while Dialga and Palkia healed from a recent battle. Their leader, Sombra, convinced his brethren to fight back and conquer the world. Covering many regions in darkness and nightmares, they nearly succeeded. By creating a massive tower in the four regions known as Void Towers, they were able to amplify the effects of Dark Void, and drained the power of the sleeping beings, using it to become much stronger. The Void Tower of Hoenn was destroyed by the forces of the Weather Trio, while the Void Tower of Sinnoh was brought down by Regigigas and the Regis. Kanto's Void Tower was toppled by Lugia and the Legendary Birds, and the Void Tower in Johto was destroyed by Ho-Oh and the Legendary Beasts. With their powers weakened, the Ten were finally stopped at Sinjoh Ruins by the combined forces of Humans and Pok\u00e9mon. The battle was long and strenuous, but finally, Sombra was subdued. Arceus sealed the Darkrai in different places throughout the region, with the exception of Sombra, who was sealed between Time and Space, and Nine, who was not present for the battle. While the other Darkrai kept their powers, in order to prevent Time and Space from running rampant, Sombra and Nine were stripped of the power of Time and Space, due to their high power levels. Afterwards, Arceus wiped clean the memories of the events from people's minds, in order to keep them from seeking out the Ten and setting them free. The ten Darkrai are named, in descending order, for their power level. Each also has a difference in appearance to a normal Darkrai. These Darkrai are also despised by most Darkrai, as their actions have brought malice upon the Darkrai species.Return to Power  WIPFinal Confrontation  WIPPowers and Abilities  Darkrai is a powerful species of Pok\u00e9mon, rightfully earning its other moniker of the Nightmare Pok\u00e9mon. Its signature power is its ability to cause horrible nightmares in surrounding humans, which is compounded by its signature Dark Void attack; because of this, some Darkrai have clashed with Cresselia, for they are polar opposites. In fact, Cresselia's powers are known as the most successful cure for Darkrai-induced nightmares and comas. In spite of their reputation, Darkrai's nightmare abilities are typically not used maliciously, but rather as a defense mechanism. Other Darkrai have proved to be much more powerful than the average specimen. The ten Ancient Darkrai, for instance, once managed to weaken Dialga, Palkia and Giratina to such a point that Arceus was forced to intervene so as to stop the destruction of the world. Despite this, they later managed to make a return. The failure of the Ten Darkrai to remain in the light later prompted Arceus to create the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, such as Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi, in order to help sustain and govern the Creation Trio's different domains of power. As with all Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Darkrai have the ability to communicate with other organisms via telepathy. Darkrai are capable of effectively becoming shadow, using this to either avoid attacks or disappear into the ground completely, as well as being able to slip into minute spaces while in this form. They are also capable of linking shadows together in order to teleport individuals along with them.Trivia Gavin Braner  Gavin Braner is an agent of Team Rocket.Appearance  Gavin is 5'9\", and wears dark blue jeans, a black, hoodless jacket and black shoes. He has auburn hair and green eyes.Personality  In two words, Gavin can be described as emotionlessly distant. He cares very, very little for other people, only seeming to show true care and love towards his Pok\u00e9mon, and it was this carelessness combined with his disregard for other people and the law that got him into so much trouble while growing up, and which eventually forced him into virtual servitude to Team Rocket. He is very antisocial; the majority of his missions are solo operations, with very, very few of them being with other people -- the only known instance of him operating with other Team Rocket agents was the mission in which he, Aulus Rufius, Sarissa Krenz and Quinn Cariu sought out a group of Latios and Latias, and that was simply because he was frustrated at several losses against Team Liberty. On several occasions he has shown himself to be rather hotheaded and rash, though this has begun to mellow out. Gavin can also be somewhat sarcastic at times, making remarks about people and actions at inappropriate times. On another note, Gavin does not take defeat well, and tends to slip into bits of depression if he racks up more than a few losses at a time. There have been implications that much of Gavin's behavior stems from something that happened to Isabelle, his sister, when he was younger, though what exactly happened is still not known. He recently abandoned his post at Paradise in the middle of a Team Liberty counterattack to go to Lavander Town, presumably to settle the remains of this matter.Pok\u00e9mon  Like Joker, Gavin has chosen to specialize in Psychic and Ghost Pok\u00e9mon, as well as taking an interest in Dark Types. Interestingly, his team is comprised of Pok\u00e9mon used by both Joker and Blackskull, who are enemies both in choice of affiliation and in Pok\u00e9mon advantages/weaknesses.Quotes Trivia Cyan Vero  Cyan Vero is one of the recent people to assist Team Liberty.History  Going to the same school as Jayron Aaron, Cyan was one of the best students in the school. He was even entrusted with the knowledge of the location of a Mew, which he later befriended. When rockets burned the school down, Cyan watched in horror as the rockets dragged his family's bodies from the burning place. He ran away and joined up with a resistance, determined to stop the rockets. This resistance was swiftly crushed though, and all the members in it were killed except him. The rockets hoped to learn where the Mew he protected was from him. However, they didn't have time to interrogate him, as a strike on the Alamo had been announced. They left him in a cell, where Jayron broke him out and got him to the Alamo. During his time on Four Island, he had received a Cyndaquil, as well as one of Selene's Bagon eggs, which hatched recently. The Bagon and he didn't exactly enjoy their time together, so he traded it for a Gible.Impact in his previous resistance  Cyan was known to be a young genius back in the last resistance he was part of. During his two later years in that group, he helped gather the data needed to develop what was believed to be an unstoppable pokemon, capable of being stronger than even Mewtwo in the right circumstances. He and several of his teammates infiltrated Sliph Co. in an attempt to develop the first part of their plan: Project Prototype. This project's intentions were to supply several trainers and technicicans who were against Team Rocket (as well as their own members) with these special pokemon. It was all part their plan they codenamed: Reckoning. Though Team Rocket never learned of their plans, the resistance's ideas were quietly shut down after Team Rocket crushed the resistance.Revival of Reckoningand Project Prototype  Once he joined Team Liberty, Cyan decided to finish Reckoning. Using TL's data, he retrieved the last bit of info he needed to begin Project Prototype. Using that data, he created specialized Porygon that were capable of wielding and storing more energy than normal. He called together the many trainers and technicians that had been recruited for this mission and gave each of them a Porygon. Then, after testing several energy-draining weapons his resistance had created, he went in search of Legendaries to help contribute energy to their Porygon. It was his belief that with these Porygon, they would never have to involve so many legendaries in this war. Despite warnings from a dark being known simply as 'Shadow', he continued the project and finally was ready to complete it. His friend Mew willingly volunteered itself as the first donor of energy, but when the drain nearly killed it, Cyan attempted to end the project. His team, led by a man named Michael Travis, turned on him, hungry for power, and contiued the project despite the devastating effects it could have on legendary pokemon. They now target the many pokemon TL and TR possess.Personality  His appearance may make him look evil, but his friends know him as kind and helpful, though he tends to have a mysterious side that many aren't aware of. He is especially kind to pokemon. Like Jayron, he excels at ninja fighting techniques, though he is actually better at them than Jayron is. He tends to go off by himself less, though he still prefers to work alone. One reason may be his habit of rarely speaking. It also appears that he is quite skilled with technology, something he has yet to tell many people about.Appearance  About medium height, green eyes, and white hair that can occasionally give him an eerie appearance. He wears mostly black/dark grey and blue, has a black jacket, and carries a bag for items. He also has some tech he uses to hack or jam things, as well as a weapon of some sort (usually a gun). On his right wrist, he has a dark-blue, advanced version of the poketch called the PoketchPlus, or Poketch+ for short. It has many features, including an up-to-date pokedex and maps in it, and even has secured access to some parts of TL's database.Pokemon  While in the last resistance, he had several strong pokemon, but was forced to release them so they wouldn't be caught by the rockets. What they were or whether he'll see them again is unknown. Cyan's team, like Jayron's, centers not around a certain type, but rather it focuses on pokemon that are fast. Even pokemon that aren't usually fast (Luxray, for example) are trained to be skilled at speed and stealth. In Pokemon video game terms, these are referred to as Special/Physical Sweepers. In the case of a few of his pokemon though, they are also fairly good at defense too.Quotes  \"Insult me all you want, but never touch me.\" \"I hardly live anywhere. I'm in constant motion, as are my pokemon. One minute you see me, the next minute I'm gone.\" \"We live in a really screwed up world. The only thing we can do is to keep on moving forward, and try to survive whatever comes our way.\" \"Sorry, but no. I will only risk my life so many times for your amusement.\" -Cyan talking to ShadowTrivia ", "Titanic - Adventure Out Of Time Wiki": "Titanic - Adventure Out Of Time Wiki Alfred Zeitel  Colonel AlfredZeitel is a German agent and primary antagonist of Titanic: Adventure Out Of Time. He is reportedly working for the German Government on the business of inspecting German embassies in Washington, Mexico City and Havana but has his own secret agenda in retrieving several key objects from the Titanic in order to ensure Germany's rise to global power.\u00a0First Mission  Zeitel is booked passage on board the Titanic with a young protege, Willi Von Haderlitz. Though he is officially on business to inspect German embassies overseas, Zeitel is suspected of being involved in the theft of a priceless copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam two months before the events of the game. British Secret Service agents Frank Carlson and Penny Pringle are also booked onto the ship in order to observe his movements and hopefully recover the stolen book. Zeitel's Titanic contact for his mission is art dealer\u00a0Sasha Barbicon. The two had an agreement to swap a particular painting in Sasha's possession for the Rubaiyat from Zeitel. A stowaway and associate of Sasha, Vlad Demonic, would retrieve the book from Zeitel's hiding place, while Willi would retrieve the painting for Zeitel. In the original timeline where Carlson's mission is a failure, it is unclear what happened. The painting either left with Zeitel or went down with the ship, given Adolf Hitler's rise to power. Zeitel's status on whether or not he survived the sinking is also unknown.Second Mission  When given another chance to correct his mistakes, Carlson carries out his mission and attempts to stop the trade from taking place. Learning of Zeitel's involvement in the theft of the Rubaiyat from Penny in his initial briefing, Carlson gains entry to the Wireless Room and discovers Zeitel has been sending out coded telegrams to inform his superiors of the missions's status. Carlson can decode them using his cryptograph in order to discover the Rubaiyat's location. If Carlson meets with Max Seidelmann and agrees to go to the Smoking Room, Max suggests that they stop at the Cafe Parisian to meet Zeitel and Willi. The Colonel remarks on his open contempt for the British through polite conversation and enforces his ruse of inspecting German embassies overseas. If Carlson takes a pipe that Zeitel leaves behind and takes it to Leyland Trask, he learns that the pipe was recently somewhere humid, leading to the discovery of a secret message for Sasha that reveals the drop location for the Rubaiyat in the Turkish Bath. In the event that Carlson retrieves the Rubaiyat, Zeitel sends out another telegram that explains it is missing and that he is investigating why. At the same time, he sends Willie to the Cargo Hold to recover the painting. In an optional event, Carlson can eavesdrop on a conversation between Zeitel and Sasha near the Titanic's stern, during which Zeitel mentions he has not yet recovered the painting. Suspecting a traitor, Zeitel explains that he is suspicious of Willi's true intentions and that he will be of no further trouble. Sasha also informs Zeitel of Carlson and Penny's presence aboard the ship, prompting the colonel to worry if the painting is already in their possession. Carlson later learns of Zeitel's interest in the painting because of the confidential plans for British troop deployments that have been hidden in the canvas. Soon after learning of Willi's ties to the Russians, Carlson is informed that Willi was found electrocuted to death in the Turkish Bath. Penny immediately suspects that Zeitel is responsible for the murder. If spoken with in the First Class Reception on D-Deck, Zeitel instructs Carlson to stay out of German business, and also gives subtle hints that Germany is preparing for war against Britain and France. He also explains that he is looking for a misplaced notebook that is of vital importance to him.  After Carlson learns of the contents of the notebook and climbs up the fourth smokestack to retrieve it, Zeitel ambushes him, armed with a pistol. He reveals that he knows who Carlson is and instructs him to hand over the notebook while confirming that it contains a list of Russian Revolutionaries that Germany has been actively supporting in order to weaken Russia as a state. The tense stand-off is interrupted when the fateful event occurs; the Titanic strikes the iceberg. Zeitel begins to panic and demands the notebook from Carlson one final time. Carlson can either give Zeitel the Gas Pen, which will knock Zeitel unconscious, or hand over the notebook to Zeitel, who then shoots Carlson anyway. Regardless of how the scenario plays out, Carlson awakens an hour later at 1:05 AM, with over an hour to go until the Titanic sinks. As a trap, especially if Zeitel was given the notebook, Carlson goes into Zeitel's cabin to try and retrieve it only to find the Colonel waiting for him. Zeitel torments him, remarking how the ship will soon sink along with Carlson and he has planted a bomb inside a briefcase on the sofa to ensure that it will happen. Zeitel locks Carlson in and flees to the Boat Deck to try and escape the ship. If Carlson defuses the bomb, Zeitel is both surprised and rather annoyed by his escape if they meet again. He then reveals he has another trick to try and foil Carlson - he has poisoned Georgia Lambeth. Zeitel offers the antidote to save her, but only as long as Carlson hands over the painting in exchange for it. If Carlson complies, he can go to Sasha's cabin and give Georgia the antidote. Zeitel can then be found standing on the Boat Deck, unable to find a lifeboat as the Titanic continues to founder. If Carlson traded the painting for the antidote, he can trade the painting back by giving Zeitel a Boat Pass obtained from beating\u00a0Buick Riviera at Blackjack.\u00a0Thinking he would prefer to be a \"living rather than a dead patriot\", he accepts the offer and flees the ship without the all-important painting. If Georgia is not saved, then both she and Zeitel fail to escape from the Titanic. Zeitel is last seen standing on deck at the very stern of the ship moments before it sinks and dies in the freezing waters of the Atlantic.Trivia Frank Carlson  Frank Carlson is the player character and protagonist of Titanic: Adventure Out Of Time. A former agent for the British Secret Service, Carlson's failure to complete an assigned mission aboard the RMS Titanic on the night of its sinking in 1912 had dire ramifications for the future. A violent catalyst during the events of World War II, however, gives Carlson a second chance at preventing disaster. Carlson himself is only seen very briefly in shadow during one cutscene in the game, as the player sees everything from his point of view. He wears a French-cut tuxedo during his Titanic mission, as noted by Beatrix Conkling.First Mission  In the original timeline, Carlson was booked passage on board the Titanic and instructed to remain in his cabin for the entire voyage until further instructions from his contact, Penny Pringle. On the fateful night of April 14th 1912, he left his cabin to meet his past lover, Lady Georgia Lambeth, who had asked to meet him on deck. It is assumed that because of this, Carlson missed his meeting with Penny and his mission was therefore cancelled. Later that night, the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank with the loss of 1,500 lives, while Carlson escaped the sinking ship in a lifeboat. Due to Carlson's failure to carry out his mission, the early twentieth century was subsequently embroiled in two World Wars and witnessed the Bolshevik Revolution and the rise of fascism, embodied in Adolf Hitler.London 1942 - World War II  Despite the failure of his mission, Carlson continued to work for the Secret Service for another two years after the Titanic disaster. With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, however, the War Office realized the severity of the consequences of the failed mission and could no longer ignore it. The Service fired Carlson to act as a scapegoat to take the blame, though his severance letter states that Penny testified on his behalf, considering him a loyal agent. Carlson was left destitute, with no pay off or pension provided. For the next 30 years, he led a broken life, making a hobby of fixing old watches and clocks and even traveling on the Hindenburg's fateful voyage in 1937.\u00a0 By April 1942, Carlson is an old man, struggling to pay rent in a run down East London apartment and being threatened by his landlady of eviction onto the streets. Surrounded by various artifacts and remnants from that fateful mission, he thinks back to that night 30 years previous and wonders if there was anything that he could have done in order to change history. As he does so, a siren sounds off with the threat of a German air raid and a bomb is dropped right on top of Carlson's apartment. It appears to kill him, but the explosion instead hurtles him backward in time 30 years to the night of the Titanic disaster.Second Mission  Awakening on April 14th 1912 in his cabin aboard the Titanic, Carlson realizes he has been given a second chance to complete his mission. Depending on how he acts throughout the night, there are a number of outcomes in the game. By meeting with Penny in the Gymnasium as instructed, Carlson learns that his mission is to recover a copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, stolen two months before from Paris, and that it currently in the possession of a German Colonel named Alfred Zeitel. Depending on his actions, Carlson can either obtain the Ruibaiyat before it is taken by stowaway Vlad Demonic as part of a deal between Zeitel and his Titanic contact Sasha Barbicon, or fail to take it off the ship as in the original timeline. Regardless of outcome, Carlson learns from Penny that Zeitel's deal with Sasha was to trade the Rubaiyat for a specific painting of high importance to the German High Command. He also learns that Zeitel's protege and travelling companion, Willi von Haderlitz, is suspected of being a traitor and that steps are being taken to ensure that the Colonel's plans are not foiled. If Carlson is quick enough, he can either obtain the painting from the cargo hold before Willi takes it for himself or it can be missing from the crate. Carlson learns from Penny that the painting contains secret plans for British troop deployments in northern France and the Low Countries, signifying its importance to Germany if war were to ever break out. Carlson, like in the original timeline, can also meet with Georgia in various places on the ship and learns of her ailing marriage to Lord Charles Lambeth and her previous affair with Sasha. She gifts him her diamond necklace for safekeeping, intending to use it to escape her marriage and start a new life. Conversing with Charles later, however, informs Carlson that Georgia's necklace is fake. The real necklace is being kept by Sasha in his cabin where it is to be sold to pay off Charles' debts and then have Georgia put away. Though the necklace is not part of Carlson's mission, it is one of the main objects in the game that must be saved from the ship to change the future for the better. During his mission, Carlson can also engage in interactions with other passengers on board the Titanic, such as Eric Burns or Andrew Conkling, to take part in optional side stories that expand some plot points and provide additional activities to take part in. After resolving the painting part of his mission, Carlson is called to meet with Willi in the Squash Court to fence with. Playing a few matches with him, Willi hints that he has other friends besides Zeitel and gives Carlson a ring for luck. Shortly afterward, Penny informs Carlson that Willi has been found dead in the Turkish Bath and that she suspects Zeitel has murdered him. Through following various clues left behind by Willi and speaking with his lover Claris Limehouse, Carlson learns of a notebook that Willi has hidden on board the ship. The notebook contains a list of Russian Revolutionaries, a group of men who plan to overthrow the Czar that Germany is actively encouraging in order to weaken Russia as a state. Willi was in fact a Russian agent who was planning to turn the names over to the Okrana, Russia's secret police. Retrieving the notebook from the top of Titanic's fourth smokestack, Carlson is confronted by Zeitel at gun point who confirms the notebook's importance. Before a deal can be made, the Titanic makes its fateful impact with the iceberg and Carlson either has the option of giving the notebook to the Colonel or knocking him out with the Gas Pen. Regardless of the choice, Carlson is subsequently incapacitated by either Zeitel shooting him or Vlad knocking him out when he leaves the smokestack. Deleted dialogue, located in the games .pup files, shows that Vlad carried him back to the cabin and bandaged Carlson up. Carlson wakes an hour later in his cabin at 1:05 AM. Penny arrives and informs him that the Titanic is sinking, with little over an hour left before she founders. Carlson then has to find a way off of the ship with as many of his important mission items as he can before the Titanic sinks, either through getting a seat in a lifeboat from Officer Morrow, obtaining the Boat Pass from Buick Riviera, or from being given a seat from the Gorse-Jonses. If he is unable to do so, then he goes down with the ship.London 1942 - Peace or...?  Returning back to his London apartment after escaping the Titanic, Carlson will examine his \"Memories\" book on the shelf to see what he has managed to change with his second mission. The first page, a newspaper article published about the Titanic sinking, is unchanged, but the following pages detail the key items from the mission where Carlson will narrate what happened to them and the consequences that their acquisition/loss have had on history. Depending on the combination of objects that were saved or lost, drastic changes to history can occur that either result in Carlson's death in 1942 from various sources or a peaceful and content retirement in a world of peace.Trivia Turbine Room  The Turbine Room is located down the stairs leading from the 2nd Class cabins on F-Deck. Carlson must go through this room where meets a crew member in the Control Room, who is experiencing some trouble with the water gauge.Importance  Once Carlson has solved the problem he can go into the Engine Room and from there must go into the Boiler Rooms, until he enters the third one where he encounters a Serbian stowaway named Vlad Demonic and must also switch the Rubaiyat around from coal chute 4 to another one and collect Vlad's package from Sasha. If he has done all this, he can take the book as Vlad will have been unable to find it and he will have gone to deliver the news in person (how Vlad, a stowaway, would be able to reach Sasha all the way up in First Class, is unclear). Carlson must return to the Engine Room later in the evening in order to access the Fourth Smokestack, where Willi's notebook is hidden. On this occasion however, Vlad ambushes him and engages him in a brutal fist fight. Regardless of whether Carlson wins or loses, he will still be able to climb the false smokestack where he will find the notebook and encounter Colonel Zeitel, who demands that he hand over the notebook. If Carlson uses the gas pen on Zeitel,it will knock him out, enabling Carlson to go back down the false smokestack. However, on returning to the Engine Room, Vlad will knock him out cold with a huge wrench. Later on, as the ship is sinking, Carslon finds Vlad in the Turbine Room with Sasha, who he has murdered. The Control Room and Engine Room are inaccessible during the sinking.Sasha Barbicon  Sasha Barbicon\u00a0is an Anglo-Serbian art dealer and secondary antagonist of Titanic: Adventure Out of Time. Though supposedly travelling to America on the Titanic to exhibit some of his paintings he has a sinister side however - he uses the wealth generated from his gallery in London to help fund and front meetings of sympathizers for the Serbian Black Hand. Sasha also has an intimate history with Lady Georgia and is part of her husband's plans to exact revenge on her and make a profit from it as well.First Mission  Sasha met Georgia in the summer of June 1911 and began an affair with her thanks to her unhappy marriage to Charles. When she discovered that he was using the funds from his galleries in order to finance terrorist sympathizers, Sasha threatened to go public with their affair and ruin her if she spoke about it, blackmailing her into silence. Some time later, Charles discovered the affair and struck up a deal with Sasha in order to guarantee she would not cause trouble. Charles would swap Georgia's necklace with a fake one and Sasha would sell the authentic diamonds in America for 20% commission. Charles would then take the remaining 80% to pay off his debts, put Georgia away in a sanatorium and sail back to England a free man. Sasha's primary reason for being on the Titanic was to act as the contact for Colonel Zeitel, a German he'd struck up a deal with in order to exchange valuable items. Sasha's associates stole some Allied plans for deployment in France, which he hid on the back of one of his gallery's paintings. He was to smuggle the painting and its plans to Zeitel. In exchange, Zeitel would secret to him a priceless copy of the Rubaiyat that was stolen in Paris. After obtaining the book, he was to sell it in America and use the funds to finance the Black Hand's operations in Austria-Hungary. Sasha's fate is not mentioned during the original mission, but since the Black Hand gained its funds, Sasha's plans must have come to fruition.Second Mission  During Carlson's second attempt to complete his mission, he first interacts with Sasha when retrieving a package for Vlad as part of his efforts to obtain the Rubaiyat. Sasha explains his sympathy with Vlad's plight of starting anew in America, while also explaining some of his history with Georgia and the accusations she had against him thanks to his partial Serbian heritage. After either obtaining or failing to obtain the Rubaiyat, Carlson learns of Sasha's connections to terrorism, his art smuggling as well as his status as Zeitel's Titanic contact from Penny Pringle. A later optional event allows Carlson to listen in on a conversation between Sasha and Zeitel at the Titanic's stern. Zeitel explains how he has been unable to retrieve the painting and that he suspects a traitor in his protege, Willi von Haderlitz. Sasha informs Zeitel of Carlson's presence on board the ship. Carlson can also discover more evidence of Sasha's ties to Zeitel through developing the photographs of the two taken by Eric Burns. If Carlson learns of Sasha's part in swapping over the necklaces, he can retrieve the real diamonds from Sasha's cabin, A-14. Temporarily disabling power to the cabin causes Sasha to leave, at which point Carlson can enter and take the real necklace from a Russian doll puzzle on the desk. If Carlson attempts to leave the cabin but makes sure the necklaces have been swapped, then Sasha will follow him out and comment how at least his valuables have been undisturbed despite the intrusion. If Carlson fails to do so, then Sasha will shoot him dead. After the Titanic has struck the iceberg and has begun to sink, Carlson can travel down to the Turbine Room to discover Sasha had been killed by Vlad. After discovering that Sasha was not actually planning on using the funds from the sale of the necklace and the Rubaiyat for the Black Hand, but rather for his own personal gain, Vlad explains that it is practice within the Black Hand for deserters to be shot dead like dogs. His body goes down with the ship.Trivia Penny Pringle  Penny Pringle is an agent for the British Secret Service and the Titanic contact for fellow agent, Frank Carlson. Assigned to give Carlson instructions on how to complete their mission, Penny acts as a kind of guide, directing Frank as to what to do next as well as giving him some information concerning the bigger picture of the world stage. She also assists in the mission with the handling of certain objects and the gathering of information.First Mission  In the original timeline, Penny was assigned to the Titanic by the Service to aid Carlson in a mission concerning the disappearance of stolen copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. An oversight occurred, and she was accidentally booked into Second Class rather than First. Despite causing a ruckus over it, she was not allowed to relocate to First Class and her ability to move around the ship was severely limited. On the night of April 14th, after finally being able to locate Carlson, Penny sent a message via Carlson's steward, ordering him to meet her by the electric camel in the Gymnasium. Carlson never arrived for their rendezvous, meaning Penny was forced to cancel the mission outright. When the Titanic struck the iceberg, she was able to escape the sinking ship in a lifeboat alongside Carlson. The failure of their mission eventually resulted in Carlson's dismissal from the Service two years later, though Penny did testify in his defense by considering him a loyal agent.Second Mission  When Carlson is transported back in time for a second chance at completing his mission, he meets Penny as he should have done, where she chastises him for being late. She briefs him on his mission and the situation regarding the Rubaiyat and also gives information on prime suspect, Colonel Zeitel, as well as the fact that Zeitel is travelling with a protege, Willi von Haderlitz. Penny orders Carlson to get into the wireless room and intercept any of Zeitel's telegrams to try to discover the whereabouts of the Rubaiyat. Regardless of whether Carlson succeeds in getting the Rubaiyat or not, he learns about an art dealer named Sasha Barbicon that Zeitel was to exchange the Rubaiyat with for a particular painting that Sasha has in his possession. When he informs Penny of this, she reveals she has discovered Sasha is Zeitel's Titanic contact and deduces that the painting is what Zeitel is really after. She instructs Carlson to obtain through whatever means he can. If Carlson travels to the Boat Deck after learning of the painting, Penny appears and informs him that Sasha and Zeitel are engaged in a heated conversation further aft. She suggests Carlson should listen in while she tracks their movements. Again, regardless of whether Carlson succeeds in retrieving the painting or not, Penny offers an insight into why Zeitel and the German Command need this particular painting so badly - the rear of the canvas contains a secret plan for British troop deployments in Northern France and the Low Countries. With this information, Germany would be able to annihilate the British forces in the area, in what would be a crippling and probably decisive blow in any potential war. After Carlson meets with Willi and learns of his ties to the Russians and the notebook he has hidden on board, Penny informs him that Willi has been found dead in the Electric Bath. She immediately suspects that it was no accident and that Zeitel was responsible for the murder and issues Carlson with a\u00a0Gas Pen for his own protection. After Carlson informs her about the notebook, she speculates that it has something to do with Zeitel's previous mission of aiding Russian Revolutionaries. Guessing that the notebook contains the names of these men, Penny tells Carlson to get it before Zeitel does as it would help Russia route out the radicals before they try to overthrow the Czar. After the Titanic has hit the iceberg. Penny arrives in Carlson's cabin to wake him from his daze after either being shot by Zeitel or knocked out by Vlad. She briefs him on the ship's situation; there is only an hour or so left until the Titanic sinks and she reminds Carlson that he must get all of the evidence they have off of the ship before it is lost forever. She hands back the key items Carlson has obtained and then goes up to the Boat Deck to join the other passengers. Penny can found at the aft end on the starboard side outside the Second Class Stairwell during the sinking. It is not necessary to talk to her again, but if Carlson is missing any of the key items or is struggling to get off of the ship, she can give strong hints on where to get them/what to do. Penny waits on deck for as long as possible before eventually taking a space on a lifeboat and leaves Carlson to find his own way off of the ship. Penny's fate after the sinking is not elaborated on in any of the game's endings, though it is assumed she continued to work for the Secret Service after the mission and she makes an appearance on Carlson's \"Memories\" book in the best ending.Trivia Georgia Lambeth  Lady Georgia Lambeth is the wife of Lord Charles Lambeth, former lover of Sasha Barbicon, and an old lover and friend of Frank Carlson. After discovering Carlson is aboard the Titanic, she instructs him to meet her on the eve of the Titanic's sinking in order to help her with her problems.First Mission  Lady Georgia Lambeth was the daughter of the Duke of Norwick and was a lover of Frank Carlson sometime in the past. It it is implied that she was not interested in marriage because she desired a title and the two parted on bad terms. She later met Charles at a house party, and they married in 1907. The couple was happy, but after facing severe money problems, their marriage had broken down. Georgia met Sasha at a party in June 1911, and had an affair with him. While with Sasha, she met many of his foreign allies who were part of the Black Hand organisation. Though she initially believed Sasha's lie that they were part of a Balkan aid society, she realized they were looking for weapons and that Sasha was planning on selling stolen artwork for money in order to fund their terrorism. When she threatened Sasha, he told her he'd go public with their affair and ruin her, forcing her to stay quiet. Now with her husband thousands of pounds in debt to Andrew Conkling and the facade of a happy marriage all but exhausted, Georgia wrote a note to Carlson after discovering that he was also sailing on the Titanic, telling him to meet her on deck. Carlson left his cabin to meet her on April 14th, missing his meeting with Penny Pringle and therefore ultimately failing his mission. An obituary found in Carlson's apartment 30 years ago shows that both Georgia and her husband did not survive the sinking.Second Mission  When Carlson gets the chance to fix his mistakes, he can still meet with Georgia as well as meet with Penny. When she meets him on the Boat Deck, she doesn't reveal many details about her situation, but implores Carlson to take her necklace from her to ensure its safekeeping, and asks him to return it to her when they arrive in New York. She also seems apologetic from how things ended between the two of them before hurrying away. Georgia can be met again on aft A-Deck Promenade, where she invites Carlson to meet her in her cabin when Charles goes to the Smoking Room in order to better explain her situation. If her invitation is accepted, she explains her situation better: She tells him of her affair with Sasha, and believes Charles will take revenge on her by stealing her necklace and leaving her destitute. She also remarks that she ended things with Sasha after learning of some Balkan friends of his, that used his gallery as their base in London. He had told her they were members of a charitable society, and Georgia believed him at first, but then quickly wised up that they were dangerous and planning something terrible. Later still, Georgia is walking towards the Poop Deck after quarreling with Charles. She tells him that Sasha's associates stole something valuable (this was the Painting that he was smuggling as his own artwork). She reminds him that they will be in New York, and that he should take care of her necklace. Unbeknownst to her, Charles has figured out her plan with the necklace and switched it with a fake, giving the real one to Sasha to sell for 20% commission. Charles plans on taking the rest of the money to pay off his debts and lock Georgia in a sanitarium. Carlson can switch the necklaces back and retrieve the real one in order to stop Sasha selling it for his own means, though will be unable to tell Georgia of the deception. After the Titanic strikes the iceberg, Carlson learns that Colonel Zeitel has poisoned Georgia with the intent on using her life to get Carlson to give him the painting. If Carlson complies, Zeitel will provide the Antidote for Georgia and tell him she can be found in Sasha's cabin. If she is rescued, Georgia will go to the lifeboats where she tells Carlson to talk to the officers and try to get on a boat with her. She will leave when the last lifeboat is launched. If Carlson fails to obtain the antidote or does not take part in the side mission to save her, then Georgia will die in the sinking like in the original timeline.Trivia Titanic: Adventure Out of Time  Titanic: Adventure Out Of Time is a 1st person perspective, point and click strategy game developed by Cyberflix. Europress was the publishing company in Europe and GTE Entertainment published it in the United States. The game was released on October 31,\u00a01996 in PC and Mac versions. A hybrid version was distributed by Cyberflix after GTE Entertainment went out of business. Hammerhead Entertainment took over production after Cyberflix became defunct in 1998. The game is available in English, French, German, Dutch, Polish and Korean. The game is available on the Steam platform for Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 operating systems and on GOG.com for Windows 7, 8 and 10 operating systems.Plot  Frank Carlson stands in his dull and dingy apartment in London, listening to the radio broadcasts reporting on the Second World War. On his desk are several postcards, magazines, an old Hindenburg ticket and a letter. On the desk there is also a La Morte tarot card. The letter informs Carlson of his immediate removal from Her Majesty's Secret Service. Upon looking at an old stopwatch, Carlson remembers the words of his former employer who tells him that he must take the blame for the mission he failed onboard the Titanic. That failure meant so much more now that millions had died in subsequent wars. \"And I keep wondering... was there something anyone could have done? Something I could have done to stop it? If only the past could be changed...\" A newspaper obituary of the Lambeths can be found in a book on Carlson's armchair. As the landlady screams at Carlson throught the door about his rent, air raid sirens begin to blare and suddenly a bomb lands on Carlson's apartment, destroying it. In an inexplicable second, fate throws Frank Carlson back exactly thirty years through time to find the date as April 14th, 1912, and to find himself once again on board the Titanic. With a second chance to complete his mission onboard the Titanic, Carlson must do all he can to change the past and alter history forever.Mission  The player, playing as ex-Secret Service man, Frank Carlson, soon realizes that Frank's failure to accomplish his mission onboard the Titanic is what resulted in World Wars I and II, and also the Russian Revolution. Now back on the Titanic, the player must meet Carlson's contact, agent Penny Pringle. Pringle informs Carlson that his mission is to retreive a stolen book, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, a valuable jeweled book of Persian poetry. The British Secret Service suspects the stolen book to be in the possession of a German colonel name Zeitel. Carlson's first task is to find a way into the Wireless Room and intercept Zeitel's telegrams. If Carlson succeeds in receiving Third Officer Morrow's permission to view the restricted Wireless Room, he must then decode Zeitel's telegrams to discover the location of the Rubaiyat. However, Carlson's mission begins to get more complicated as equally important items must be retreived, such as a notebook, a necklace of diamonds and a painting. Sub missions also come into the story. Due to the open ended gameplay, at this point in the game the player's decisions will have an effect on the end of the game and the ultimate result of the mission. Failure or success in any mission will change the game. See also:Characters  Adventure Out Of Time uses a unique technique in illustrating the characters of the game. Real actors are photographed with their mouths and faces in many different positions. As the actors' voiceover is played, the photographs of the actors change quickly to give the appearance of the character's mouth moving as they speak. Although it provides jerky head movement and sudden hand gestures, the use of real people gives Adventure Out Of Time more realism. A full list of characters can be found on the homepage.Vlad Demonic  Vlad Demonic is a Serbian stowaway and servant of Sasha Barbicon on board the Titanic. He is a member of the dangerous Black Hand terrorist group, and has vowed revenge against the Austrians for the murder of his wife and children.\u00a0First Mission  Before the events of the game, Vlad's family was killed during Austria's taking of Bosnia. Sasha's ties to the Black Hand caused the two of them to meet and Vlad agreed to work as the art dealer's servant in the hope of financing the organisation to exact his revenge. Stowed away on board the Titanic to act on Sasha's behalf during the trade with Colonel Zeitel for the Rubaiyat, Vlad remains in Boiler Room 3 for the duration of the voyage on the ship's lowest decks to avoid detection. In the original timeline, he was successful in retrieving the Rubaiyat for Sasha's deal and also managed to leave the sinking ship. The funds raised from the book helped to finance the Black Hand's activities, sparking the beginnings of World War I.Second Mission  Frank Carlson first meets Vlad in Boiler Room 3 where he requests the agent's help. Vlad claims he knows Sasha in First Class and needs a package from him. Unable to get there himself for fear of him being thrown overboard, he requests Carlson's assistance in retrieving the package. Carlson later meets with Sasha in his cabin who explains how Vlad was left without family or money after the problems in Austro-Hungarian controlled Serbia. Sasha claims he offered to assist Vlad by buying a ticket on the Titanic but Vlad refused due to his pride. However, due to Sasha's own links to the Black Hand, how much of this is true remains uncertain. Carlson retrieves Vlad's package and returns to the boiler rooms to give it to him. If Carlson ignored the Rubiayat on his first meeting, Vlad will have taken it when Carlson returns. Alternatively, if Carlson hid the book in one of the other coal chutes, Vlad will not find it and claim he must see Sasha immediately to inform him, leaving Carlson free to take it. If Carlson tries to take the Rubaiyat without hiding it first, Vlad notices and shoots him dead. \u00a0 Vlad is not seen again until Carlson reaches the entrance to the fourth smokestack when attempting to retrieve the notebook. He says that he knows Carlson is an agent and (depending on player actions) has taken the Rubaiyat and the painting. He engages in a fight, though it does not matter if Carlson wins or loses. If Carlson opted to give Zeitel the gas pen at the top of the smokestack, Vlad will violently attack Carlson with a giant wrench upon his descent, knocking him out cold before stealing the notebook. When the Titanic begins to sink, Vlad can be found at the bottom of the stairs in the Turbine Room, standing over the body of Sasha. Vlad explains that he murdered him after discovering that Sasha planned to keep the proceeds of his illicit transactions for himself, rather than use the money to fund the Black Hand. Vlad will ask Carlson if he knows a way to get on a lifeboat, as women and children first is the rule. If Carlson did not obtain the Rubaiyat, Vlad will have taken it from Sasha. He will also haven taken Georgia Lambeth's necklace, planning to sell it to fund the Black Hand as well. However, he will be unaware if the necklace is real or fake if Carlson retrieved the real diamonds. If Carlson has spoken with Claris Limehouse and received her shawl, he can offer to give it to Vlad in exchange for the Rubaiyat, the real necklace, or the notebook. He may only make one trade, however; if Vlad is in possession of more than one item, it will not be possible to obtain them all. If Vlad does not have any items to trade, Carlson will simply give him the shawl and ask for nothing. In the end, Carlson reveals that Vlad left the sinking Titanic and survived, no matter what items were collected and regardless of whether the shawl was given to him or not.Trivia Shailagh Hacker  Shailagh Hacker (born c. 1892) was the Irish maid of Andrew Conkling and Beatrix Conkling, and is the mother of the former's newborn son, Edward. She has a brother, Jack, who accompanies her on the voyage.Second Mission  As an optional part of his mission, Frank Carlson can learn of Conkling's desire to meet with him from Daisy Cashmore. Conkling, will tell him about Shailagh and about how she left her job as the Conkling's maid a week prior to the voyage. He claims she took an important letter with her and the contents contain information ruinous to the Conklings and his company. He asks Carlson to meet with Shailagh in his place. Traveling to the Poop Deck, Carlson is surprised to see Shailagh accompanied by her brother. The pair of them demand a ransom for the letter - $5,000. Carlson says he will talk to the Conklings about it and meet them again at 1AM. Returning to speak with both of the Conklings about the ransom, Beatrix suggests that Shailagh is ungrateful for their employment. Through the conversation, it becomes increasingly apparent that Beatrix was aware of Shailagh's pregnancy since she is apparently barren. Meeting with Shailagh at her cabin by herself, she admits to Carlson that she had no idea that the letter was so valuable to the Conklings and that Jack was the one who suggested to ask for money in the process. She speaks about her baby son and explains how the Conklings had actually planned to steal Eddie from her after Andrew Conkling had gotten her pregnant, implying that the Conklings had arranged Andrew's affair with Shailagh on purpose.  Shailagh also explains why the letter is so damaging to the Conklings; it is a letter from an engineer at the mill for Conkling steel, claiming that the steel's high sulfur content has made it prone to fracturing and breaking from any large impact and that said steel was used in the construction of the Titanic. She reminds Carlson to not forget about their meeting. Shailagh is not seen again until the Titanic begins to sink. If Carlson heads down the Second Class Stairwell, he will encounter Jack and Shailagh on the C-Deck landing, where they tell him that that Beatrix has kidnapped Eddie. Shailagh pleads with Carlson to exchange the letter for her baby. If the painting was not retrieved from the Cargo Hold earlier on, Jack will now have it, saying Willi gave it to him and never came back for it. He will offer it to Carlson in exchange for the safe return of Eddie. Up on Boat Deck, Beatrix is among the passengers waiting to board a lifeboat. Carlson threatens to publish the letter unless she hands Eddie back to him. Scared that she would be ruined, she agrees and she gives Eddie back. Upon hid returning back to Jack and Shailagh with Eddie, Jack thanks Carlson for his aid and tells him to get Shailagh into a lifeboat without him. Using his influence to get Shailagh into a lifeboat of First Class passengers, she thanks him for everything he's done and wishes for God's protection on him.Trivia Daisy Cashmore  Daisy Cashmore (d. 15 April, 1912) is a wealthy American spinster and an old friend of Carlson's. Where and how they met is never revealed. A fast-taking name-dropper, Daisy loves to talk gossip and is keen on rubbing elbows with all of the rich people aboard. She frequently interrupts herself to hobknob with other passengers. She is incredibly shallow and is interested in wealth, above all else.Player Interactions  Daisy Cashmore can usually be found on the B-Deck landing of the Aft Grand Staircase, although later on in the game, she can also be found on the corridor by the B-Deck cabins. Interaction with Daisy is not required to complete the main storyline. On your first meeting, she will automatically approach Carlson and strike up a conversation. Afterward, talking with her is at the player's discretion. She is frequently full of gossip and will bestow upon the player the goings-on of the wealthy passengers aboard the ship, but little else. Daisy will start the player on the Conkling side mission by asking about a passenger with the initials GQC, who she believes had been making eyes at her at dinner. After learning about this passenger from the Purser, she will give the player a note to meet Andrew Conkling on Scotland Road.Fate  Daisy can be found on the aft Boat Deck after the ship strikes the iceberg. At first, she rambles and insists she wants to go in the boats with the Astors or Benjamin Guggenheim. However, once the boats start to leave, she begins to ramble. She is either unable to find a boat or refuses to get in the boats of non-famous people, and is seen on the boat deck once all the lifeboats are gone, which presumes she perishes.Behind the scenes Beatrix Conkling  Beatrix Conkling is the wife of Andrew Conkling. She is an interior designer on her way to Los Angeles to help design the interior decorations of the Beverly Hills Hotel. She and her husband had spent the winter of 1911-1912 in Cairo, and returned via Paris, where they met Colonel Alfred Zeitel, who showed a great interest in rare books. She says Mr Trask predicted 1912 to be a \"banner year\" for her.Second Mission  Before sailing on the Titanic, Beatrix's maid, Shailagh Hacker, suddenly ran from the Conkling's London home with an important letter that had the potential to ruin Conkling Steel's reputation. The two of them had lost all hope of recovery until Beatrix spotted Shailagh on the Third Class Promenade. Beatrix is revealed to be unable to conceive children of her own on multiple occasions. Because of this, she and her husband knowingly aided in getting Shailagh pregnant from Conkling so that they could eventually steal the baby for themselves and fire her later. Shailagh, after discovering their plan, took the letter with her in the hope it would be something valuable. Beatrix holds open contempt for her, calling her a 'tart' or 'ungrateful'. Beatrix can be interacted with in the Smoking Room, where she is dismissive of Carlson's attempts to talk to her. She later arrives in the Conkling's cabin when Carlson explains the situation for the ransom to her husband. She compliments Carlson's clothes and bids him goodnight with a warning not to fail them. When the Titanic begins to sink, Beatrix can be seen with Eddie on the Boat Deck waiting for a lifeboat. Carlson learns from the Hackers in the Second Class Stairwell that Beatrix tricked Shailagh in letting her hold the baby, at which point she took him. If Carlson has the letter, Beatrix will trade the baby for the letter, believing it will ruin her if it gets out. If Conkling is shot by Officer Morrow trying to bribe his way onto a boat, Beatrix will lament his death and the loss of her family. During the sinking, Beatrix will first appear mid-ship on the starboard side, and then aft on the starboard side, after which she will disappear on a lifeboat, whether or not she has Eddie.Behind the scenes Andrew Conkling  Andrew Conkling\u00a0is the wealthy owner of the fictional business Conkling Steel, which provided the steel used to build the RMS Titanic. He is travelling First Class back to America with his wife, Beatrix Conkling, from their London home. Upon learning of Frank Carlson through Daisy Cashmore, Conkling requests to meet with him in order to aid in avoiding a potential scandal with his business. Conkling and his sidequest are optional and do not have to be performed to obtain the game's perfect ending. Conkling is a creditor of Lord Charles Lambeth. At the time of the sinking, Conkling was demanding Lord Lambeth repay the money owed.Second Mission  Carlson receives a message from Conkling requesting to meet him in Scotland Road. The businessman explains that a few weeks prior to sailing on the Titanic, the Conkling's Irish maid Shailagh Hacker ran away from their London home and took a particularly sensitive letter with her, which contains information that could potentially ruin Conkling and his steel business. Conkling is desperate to obtain the letter from Shailagh, after Beatrix spotted her on the Third Class Promenade earlier in the voyage. He learned that a British Secret Service agent was on board and located Carlson through Daisy, requesting his assistance in retrieving the letter. After meeting with Shailagh and her brother Jack, Carlson reports back to Conkling that the pair want $5,000 in exchange for the letter. Conkling is not prepared to pay them the money and asks Carlson to speak to Shailagh alone without Jack. Through speaking to Shailagh, she reveals that Conkling is the biological father of her baby Eddie, who was conceived through an affair. It is implied that Conkling and his wife intended for this to happen and that they planned to fire Shailagh once the baby was born and keep it for themselves. Shailagh simply took the letter as something valuable to steal, unaware of how important it was. During the Titanic's sinking, both Conkling and Beatrix can be found on the Boat Deck. If Carlson aids the Hackers in taking back Shailagh's baby from Beatrix, he can offer to trade the baby in return for the precious letter. At this point, Carlson can read the contents of the letter - the steel which Conkling Steel produced to be used in the Titanic is revealed to be high in sulfur, making it highly likely to fracture in the event of a collision or accident. The letter also shows that Conkling himself authorized use of the steel in the Titanic.\u00a0 Regardless, Conkling never sees the letter again. If Carlson interacts with him, he panics on the Boat Deck and offers money to the crew in exchange for a place in a lifeboat. He is shot dead by Third Officer Morrow after trying to bribe his way into a lifeboat. If Carlson neglects to talk to Conkling during the sinking, he goes down with the ship.Trivia Claris Limehouse  Claris Limehouse (c.1893-1896 \u2014 15 April, 1912) is a young Philadelphia woman who is returning from a trip where she was presented to poor European nobles hoping to raise their fortunes by marrying into a rich American family. Traveling home on the RMS Titanic. Willi Von Haderlitz befriended her and the two began a romance.Second Mission  Frank Carlson meets with Claris shortly after Willi gifts him with a ring and is given a hint to go and visit her by Leyland Trask. Upon presenting the ring to her, Claris is alarmed and believes that Willi has come to harm. She also reveals the existence of the notebook and says that Carlson should try and find it. He than has the option to either let her keep the ring or keep it for himself. After the Titanic strikes the iceberg, Claris will intercept Carlson if he tries to enter the First Class Lounge. She intends to stay with Willi as the ship sinks, even after being told he is dead, lamenting how she had been intending to show him Central Park if they made it to New York. She gives Carlson her shawl and bids him goodbye. Claris' shawl can be traded with Vlad Demonic for either the Rubaiyat or the Lambeth Diamonds if Carlson failed to obtain either of them during the first part of the game.Trivia Willi von Haderlitz  Willi von Haderlitz (d. 14 April, 1912) is a young junior professor travelling on the Titanic as a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to Colonel Zeitel, planning to proceed to the western United States in order to study American Indian societies. However, Willi has secret ties to other parties and moves against Zeitel's plans later in the game.First Mission  Willi is booked passage aboard the Titanic to accompany Zeitel on his inspection of German embassies overseas. During his time with the colonel, Willi was tasked with keeping a list of Russian radical names in a notebook to allow Germany to support them, as well as to act on Zeitel's behalf when acting out a trade between his mentor and art dealer Sasha Barbicon. However, Willi was secretly an agent for the Russians who was planning to turn over the list written in the notebook to Russia's secret police so that they could kill the radicals to eliminate a threat to the Czar. He also takes the painting for himself during the trade for the Rubaiyat to prevent Zeitel from obtaining it. During his time aboard the Titanic, Willi befriended and eventually began the start of a relationship with fellow passenger Claris Limehouse. His poor jokes and honest personality entranced her, unlike the other benefactors she had been introduced to for marriage. Willi's ultimate fate in the original timeline is left unknown, but it is most likely that he went down with the ship when it sank. Given that the second mission had the possibility that someone else other than Carlson took the painting, it is also possible that he would have suffered the same fate in the first mission.Second Mission  When Frank Carlson meets Max Seidelman on the Boat Deck during his return to 1912, he is invited to play blackjack in the Smoking Room. If Carlson agrees, they first visit the Caf\u00e9 Parisien where they meet Zeitel and Willi. Willi briefly explains his reasons for traveling with the colonel before accidentally telling that Zeitel's telegrams have not yet been sent from the Wireless Room. After either recovering or losing the Rubaiyat, Carlson has the option to listen to a conversation between Zeitel and Sasha at the ship's stern. Zeitel reveals that he has yet to acquire the painting and suspects that Willi has betrayed him and taken it for himself. He assures his counterpart that Willi will no longer be a threat to Germany's plans. Willi later requests a meeting with Carlson via Smethells and asks that they meet in the Squash Court. He challenges Carlson to a round of fencing and speaks more about himself and his allegiances, regardless of whether or not he is beaten. Willi explains that he is a friend to others despite being German and lets slip Zeitel's interest in the painting. Playing further rounds with Willi will prompt him to give Carlson a ring in friendship, claiming it will bring him luck. Willi speaks darkly about his fate, trusting Carlson will know what to do if something happens. Smethells can also give Carlson Willi's ring if he chooses not to fence further. Carlson can speak to Leyland Trask and ask for a reading of the ring afterwards. Trask sees a vision of Willi in the Electric Bath, where it appears to malfunction and kill him. Trask makes note of the Russian characters on the inside of the ring and urges Carlson to speak to Claris to learn more, where the existence of the notebook is revealed (alternatively, Carlson can skip the part of speaking to Trask and proceed directly to Claris' cabin immediately after the match with Willi to continue the mission). Penny Pringle later informs Carlson that Willi has been found dead in the Electric Bath, just like in the vision, and she believes he may have been murdered by Zeitel for his betrayal. Visiting the scene of Willi's body, Carlson finds a passage from the Rubaiyat and then later clues that he left behind, eventually leading to the knowledge that Willi hid the notebook at the top of the fourth smokestack.Trivia John Smethells  John Smethells is the straight-laced prim and proper English steward of Frank Carlson and Willi Von Haderlitz. Smethells has worked for the White Star Line since 1892, and has never met a passenger he couldn't help. In game, Smethells acts as a tutorial to provide the player with instructions on how to play the game as well as provide general assistance and direct the player to their next objective.Second Mission  When Carlson awakens back in 1912, Smethells arrives and enters the cabin to deliver a message from Carlson's Titanic contact, Penny Pringle. He advises that Carlson remembers his personal items of a watch and bag before advising him to ring the bell by the cabin if he needs additional assistance. For most of the mission afterwards, Smethells can be found just outside of the Purser's Office. Later on in the game, Smethells is spoken with mandatorily when he delivers a message from Willi to Carlson about meeting in the Squash Court, remarking that it is most irregular for it to be open at this hour. If Carlson does not receive the ring from Willi during their subsequent fencing matches, Smethells can later gift it to him instead. Smethells also can be found outside the Turkish Bath with Third Officer Morrow in the aftermath of Willi's murder by Colonel Zeitel. He finds the incident 'regrettable', warning Carlson that it is an unpleasant sight inside. Smethells is initially very helpful to the player however becomes increasingly annoyed by Carlson constantly wandering the ship and associating with second class Penny Pringle; where he once openly accuses them of plotting larceny together. After the Titanic strikes the iceberg, Smethells is not seen again and cannot be summoned for help in Carlson's cabin. It is presumed he goes down with the ship.Trivia Painting  The Painting is an important object in Titanic: Adventure Out of Time and is one of the four key items needed in order to achieve the best ending. The canvas itself is a street scene watercolor of a grand manor house in Austria, painted by a young Adolf Hitler. The painting is titled The Courtyard Of The Old Residency In Munich. The painting is being shipped on board the Titanic to be exchanged for the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam by Sasha Barbicon and Colonel Zeitel. The Colonel wants the painting desperately for its true value - the rear of the painting contains secret plans detailing British troop deployments and positions in northern France and the Low Countries. Such information would give the Germans a vital advantage should war break out. Unknown to Zeitel, his traveling companion Willi von Haderlitz is also in pursuit of the painting, but not to assist in the German cause.How To Obtain  During Frank Carlson's efforts to claim the Rubaiyat, he discovers that the stolen book is one half of a trade between Zeitel and Sasha, with the painting as the other half. After obtaining or failing to obtain the Rubaiyat and speaking with Penny Pringle, she suspects that Zeitel's true objective is the painting itself, though the reasons as to why are initially uncertain. Penny assumes that the painting is located in the Cargo Hold and that Carlson must visit the Purser's Office to look at the cargo manifest to confirm it. When Carlson meets with the Purser, he will be muttering the name \"Thayer\" under his breath. If Carlson questions him on this, the Purser claims that he needs to send a telegram on behalf of a Mr. Thayer, but is unable to leave his post to do so. Carlson offers to send it for him and must enter the Wireless Room in order to send the message. Depending on actions earlier in the game, Carlson may need to speak with Officer Morrow to gain entry. Following the instructions in the Wireless Room will let Carlson send the message, though what the player actually types does not have to match the telegram itself. Returning to the Purser's Office to inform him that the telegram has been sent, the Purser leaves his post to deliver the news. The cargo manifest can then be examined and the painting is being shipped under the name Lemke & Buechner Shipping and lists Barbicon Galleries as the owner. When the Purser returns to his post, Carlson requests entry into the cargo hold, but the Purser instructs him to leave as he is attempting to locate a missing cufflink for Isidor Straus. Again, Carlson offers to locate it for him. Speaking with Max Seidelmann in the First Class Reception will reveal that the Strauses were sitting at the foot of the stairs. Examining the chair on the left will find the cufflink. When Carlson returns the cufflink, the Purser leaves again to inform the Strauses. With the window left open, Carlson can take the set of car keys, allowing him into the hold. Travelling to the Cargo Hold beneath the Forecastle Deck, a crew member sees the keys and mistakes Carlson as the owner of the car. Carlson must find the correct holding area, which can be found by moving forward 3 times from the entrance and then using the door on the right. Once inside, the car's headlights must be turned on in order to illuminate the crate containing the painting, allowing Carlson to retrieve it.Time Limit  Unlike the other three objects that must be obtained in the game, only the painting has a time limit placed on its retrieval. The player has 10 minutes to complete the tasks above in order for the painting to still be in the crate, a timer which starts after Penny has instructed Carson to look at the cargo manifest. If the player exceeds this time limit, Carlson will discover the painting has already been removed from the crate because someone has got there before him. If the painting is missing, it can be obtained again later in the game during the ship's sinking - Jack Hacker was given the painting by Willi and he will give it to Carlson if he rescues Shailagh's baby from Beatrix Conkling. This can be done by exchanging Conkling's letter with Beatrix for the baby. Returning Shailagh's baby is only necessary to the mission if Carlson failed to retrieve the painting from the cargo hold earlier in the game. The painting may be traded with Zeitel later on as well in exchange for the Antidote to save Georgia. Carlson can get it back from Zeitel by exchanging the Boat Pass for it. However, saving Georgia is not necessary for the mission to be completed.Fate  \"As for the painting, it left with me. The plans proved useless. In the month following the sinking, the War Office scrapped the proposed deployments in a cost cutting measure. But the canvas? As the only artifact saved from the Titanic, the painting became famous. Along with its creator, a rather excitable Austrian named Adolf Hitler, who makes a lucrative career to this day peddling overpriced alpine vistas to the carriage trade.\" \"Though Zeitel took the painting, its plans proved useless to the Germans. In the month following the sinking, the War Office scrapped the proposed deployments in a cost-cutting measure. They were soon forgotten in a dusty Whitehall file.\" \"As for the painting, it went down with the ship.\"Trivia C-73  C-73 is Frank Carlson's First Class cabin onboard the Titanic where the game starts once the explosion hurls him back to the night of April 14, 1912.Accessibility  Situated towards the rear of the starboard side on C-Deck, Carlson must remain here for the entire voyage until 9.30pm on the night of Sunday 14th, when he is summoned to the Gymnasium by his contact Penny Pringle. Among the items found in the cabin are a pocket watch, a dinner menu, a bag, a note from Georgia and a large trunk that contains a musical player, a cryptograph for decoding German codes, and interesting offical documentation from the British Secret Service outlining the global situation for the spring of 1912, and how power struggles in Germany, Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America are reaching a crisis point and that the world is teetering on the brink of all-out war, foreshadowing World War I. During the mission, Carlson is out of the cabin but only returns on one occasion - when the ship has started sinking after being knocked out by Vlad or shot by Zeitel when attempting to retrieve the notebook from the smokestack. Although Penny will instruct Carlson to decode Colonel Zeitel's telegrams with the cryptograph in the trunk, Carlson can alternatively obtain the information within and continue with the mission by visiting the Cafe Parisian with Seidelmann, speaking with Zeitel, taking the pipe, and heading to the Turkish Bath. Although Carlson may be asked to look for Smethells, he does not have to return to his cabin to do that.Behind the scenes Edgar Troutt  Reverend Edgar Troutt (d. 15 April, 1912) is a minister returning from a religious mission in Nyasaland to New Hampshire where he and his late wife, Emily, lived. Troutt can be found in various places throughout the ship during Frank Carlson's mission, asking for his aid in donating while also warning him of other passengers he does not take a shining to.Second Mission  Troutt's first meeting with Carlson explains a little of his work in Nyasaland with Emily. Here, he explains that Emily supposedly contracted intestinal parasites on the way back from Africa and died as soon as they reached Port Said. If Carlson agrees to assist with the reverend's mission, Troutt will give him a Prayer Card that can be exchanged later with Eric Burns for photographs. A later conversation with the reverend reveals that he had conducted a hymn service in the Second Class lounge on the evening of 14 April, Titanic's first \u2014 and last \u2014 Sunday afloat. Ironically, the song chosen was 'For All Those in Peril on the Sea'. Conversations with Troutt reveal he is rather intolerant of those who do not share his own beliefs, often representing the common views and social attitudes of the era. This included inhibitions towards the mixing of social classes, and of an anti-socialist sentiment that would have been prevalent on the Titanic. He refers to Leyland Trask's readings as blasphemies and also warns Carlson not to befriend anything which could be seen as 'Godless'. During the sinking, Troutt refuses to leave the ship while there are women and children on board and\u00a0remains consoling the doomed passengers on the Boat Deck until the very end. However, if the player fails to get on a lifeboat before 2:00 AM, Trout will buckle and confess that\u00a0he had siphoned funds from his mission in order to earn passage on the Titanic. He believes that God is now punishing him for his misdeeds and they will all meet their maker soon as he laughs manically.Trivia Charles Lambeth  Lord Charles Lambeth is the husband of Lady Georgia Lambeth. Originally married in 1907, their marriage has turned sour thanks to Georgia's affair with Sasha Barbicon and their money troubles.Charles himself is almost bankrupt and has resorted to heavy drinking as a result of owing thousands of pounds to Andrew Conkling. On board the Titanic, Charles can often be found in the Smoking Room. He had enacted a plan to get revenge on Georgia for her affair as well as clear his debts and get out of the unhappy marriage he finds himself locked in.First Mission  In the original timeline, Charles discovered Georgia's affair with Sasha and hatched a plan in order enact his revenge. He switches out Georgia's diamond necklace for a fake. Charles gave the real necklace to Sasha so that he could sell them in New York. Sasha would receive a twenty percent commission whereas Charles would then get the remaining 80%. He would then use it to pay off his debt to Andrew Conkling, put Georgia away in a sanatorium, claiming her to be \"emotionally unstable\", before sailing back to England a free and clear man again. However, the plan never bears fruit as both Charles and Georgia perish in the Titanic's sinking, as shown by an obituary found in Frank Carlson's apartment 30 years later.Second Mission  After Carlson is given a second chance to complete his mission, he first meets Charles after rendezvousing with Georgia in their cabin. Charles makes snide remarks about Georgia's affair and her aims to marry only for a title in his drunken stupor before he implies Carlson should leave abruptly. Charles is then met again, either on the Boat Deck or in the Smoking Room, and offers Carlson a drink together. If Carlson agrees, then Charles reveals his plan to sell Georgia's real necklace and that Sasha is keeping it in his cabin for safekeeping. Carlson can then switch the necklaces back again, though Charles never finds out about it. When the ship hits the iceberg, Charles remains calm and chooses to go down with the Titanic like a gentleman, claiming to be \"going to the devil full of gin\". However, if Carlson misses the last lifeboat, Charles is last seen on the aft part of the Boat Deck where he simply states that he has nothing to say. In both timelines, Charles dies in the sinking.Behind the scenes Eric Burns  Eric Burns (b. 1883) is an American photographer on his honeymoon on board the Titanic with his newlywed, Stephanie, who is upset at him not spending much time with her. He turned his cabin, C-78, into a small darkroom, in which he keeps a vast collection of photographs of other passengers. According to Third Officer Morrow, on the night of 13 April, Eric Burns came up from A-Deck and tried to bribe his way onto the Bridge in order to take pictures. He is not seen after the ship hits the iceberg. Dialogue exists within the game's files, though seems to have been deleted at some point, leading to one presuming he dies with the ship. He is begging the player to give him the boatpass, on the boat deck, so that he and his wife can escape the ship.Behind the scenes Third Officer Morrow  Third Officer Morrow is the Titanic 's third officer and a British veteran of the Second Boer War. He is standing watch the night of the sinking and is in command of the Titanic. He is fifth in command of the ship behind the Second Officer, First Officer, Chief Mate, and the Captain. He goes down with the ship after launching the last of the lifeboats.Importance  Third Officer Morrow must be spoken with in order to enter the Wireless Room, and spoken to carefully. If Carlson finds and returns his binoculars, Morrow will allow him to visit the Bridge. Carlson will also have to speak with Morrow to enter the Turkish Bath after receiving news of Haderlitz's death. During the sinking he can not be bribed with a boat pass, but if the player helps \"keep passengers calm\" he will save a spot on the last boat out.Trivia Turkish Bath  The Turkish Bath is a recreational room located on F-Deck.Importance in the game  This area is an alternative to locating the Rubaiyat if the player prefers not to decode the telegram. In order for this to happen, Carlson must obtain the pipe from the Caf\u00e9 Parisian which Zeitel will leave behind after their first meeting. By turning on the faucet it will steam up the mirror long enough to disclose the whereabouts of the Rubaiyat. The Electric Bath, which can be accessed down a corridor from this area, is where Willi von Haderlitz later meets his death.Possible Outcomes  There are nine possible endings that can be obtained in Titanic: Adventure Out of Time. The ending you receive depends directly on which of the four key items Frank Carlson manages to save from the Titanic: Saving all four of the items results in the best ending where both World Wars and the Russian Revolution are averted. Saving none of the items results in history playing out exactly as it had done before. Saving some of the items but not others results in drastic new consequences within Germany, Russia, or both.Possibilities Rubaiyat/Lambeth Diamonds Painting Notebook Endings  The endings are dictated through which items are recovered and which are lost. The following entries are marked with either an 'X' for failure or an 'O' for success. The items are in the order of their effects in the closing monologue; Rubaiyat/Lambeth Diamonds, the painting and the notebook.1. Total Mission Failure  Regardless of what key items he has obtained, Carlson fails to find a lifeboat and goes down with the Titanic. Though this not an actual ending as such, it still results in a Game Over and presumably has history play out much like it did if the past was unaltered.2. If Only... (XXX)  History remains unchanged from the original failed mission at the beginning of the game. As Carlson narrates in his 1942 apartment, he muses if the past could be changed before he is killed in the original bomb blast that sent him back in time.3. Nuclear Germany (OXX)  In 1927, Hitler overthrows the Kaiser and channels the full power of a Germany un-weakened by World War I into industry and high-tech weapons. Germany develops the first atomic bomb in 1939. The West, weakened by several decades of complacency, now finds itself facing a nuclear-armed Germany, bent on world-domination. As Carlson remarks that its not a question of if but when Hitler will use his weapons, he muses if the past could be changed before\u00a0London is vaporized by a Nazi atomic bomb.4. Soviet Tidal Wave (XOX)  As a result of Germany being weakened by the first World War and the failure of the Nazis in their rise to power, the Communists seize power in Berlin instead of the Nazis, became powerful and take a totally off-guard Europe and Britain by surprise, conquering them and uniting them into a single Communist super-state. As Carlson remarks how Britain has lost its freedom, he muses if the past could be changed before he is shot dead by a Red Army Serzhant.4. Nazy Fury 1 (XXO)  When Hitler comes to power and starts World War II, the Russian Czar\u2019s regime is too weak to resist and surrenders to the Germans. With the Eastern Front won, Hitler turns the full might of the Third Reich onto an exhausted Britain, which is forced to surrender three days before the narration. As Carlson remarks how Winston Churchill had been captured and hung the previous day, he muses if the past could be changed before he is shot dead by a Nazi SS Stormtrooper.5. Nazy Fury 2 (OXO)  When Hitler comes to power and starts World War II, the Russian Czar\u2019s regime is too weak to resist and surrenders to the Germans. With the Eastern Front won, Hitler turns the full might of the Third Reich onto an exhausted Britain, which is forced to surrender three days before the narration. As Carlson remarks how Winston Churchill had been captured and hung the previous day, he muses if the past could be changed before he is shot dead by a Nazi SS Stormtrooper.6. Communist Russia (OOX)  The Communists seize power from the Czar and Germany, weakened by the Great Depression and a decade long struggle against the warmongering Soviets, collapses in 1931. The Soviets invade and conquer a weak Europe. Britain is forced into surrender and Europe is united into a single Communist super-state. As Carlson remarks that Britain has lost its freedom, he muses if the past could be changed before he is shot dead by a Red Army Serzhant.7. Communist Germany (XOO)  As a result of Germany being weakened by the first World War and the failure of the Nazis in their rise to power, the Communists seize power in Berlin instead of the Nazis, became powerful and take a totally off-guard Europe and Britain by surprise, conquering them and uniting them into a single Communist super-state. As Carlson remarks how Britain has lost its freedom, he muses if the past could be changed before he is shot dead by a Red Army Serzhant.8. World of Peace (OOO)  With no wars or revolution to take foot in the world, peace and prosperity has flowed into every corner of the globe, elevating humanity to a level that only the privileged used to know of in the Titanic's era. As Carlson thinks back on how important his mission was, and how the Titanic took 1500 people with her, he is glad that a peaceful world would be their epitaph. The picture above the fireplace in Carlson's apartment changes to one of sailing boats as the sun shines in through the apartment window. He contemplates how events may have been different if he had failed.Videos Max Seidelmann  Max Seidelmann is an American buyer for Haymakers Department Store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He acts as a friend to Frank Carlson upon his return to 1912 and often suggests to play blackjack with Buick Riviera in the Smoking Room, as well as giving small hints about Carlson's objectives.Second Mission  When Carlson travels to the Boat Deck at the beginning of his mission, Max calls him over and comments on how cold it is outside that evening. He suggests that the pair of them go to the Smoking Room as a friendly gesture. If Carlson agrees, Max first says they should stop by the Caf\u00e9 Parisien to meet with Colonel Zeitel and Willi von Haderlitz. Upon the conclusion of their meeting, he remarks that he doesn't trust either of them, and thinks they are both up to no good before returning to the Smoking Room. Max can be found later on in the First Class Reception. He remarks that he had just seen Isidor Straus, implying this is where the cufflink can be found, will point Carlson towards John Smethells if the steward is looking for them, and will also mention Claris Limehouse has a cabin on the same deck. After Willi is murdered by Zeitel, the clues left behind eventually give Carlson a pack of cigarettes that belong to Max. If he returns them to Max in the Smoking Room, he thanks Carlson for doing so and claims that he originally gave them to Willi earlier in the night. Max then speaks of seeing Willi on top of the fourth smokestock when the Titanic was docked in Queenstown, suspicious that he was hiding something. Max does not survive the sinking and can be found on the aft section of the ship once all of the lifeboats are gone.Behind the scenes ", "Roblox Titanic Wiki": "Roblox Titanic Wiki ", "Wiki OviPets Ayla Adoption's": "Wiki OviPets Ayla Adoption's ", "Elder Scrolls Wikia": "Elder Scrolls Wikia ", "The Elder Scrolls Wikia": "The Elder Scrolls Wikia ", "Wiki Lego indiana jones": "Wiki Lego indiana jones ", "Dead Island Wiki": "Dead Island Wiki Dead Island Wiki Featured Poll  More news...Contribute to this wiki  To start a new article, just enter the title in the box below and click the button.Mods  Mods are used to upgrade weapons in Dead Island. There are multiple blueprints throughout the game which the player can obtain to modify existing weapons to increase stats and add effects. There are also blueprints existing to allow the Hero to make grenades, molotovs, and ammunition.Melee Mods Firearm Mods Ammunition Thrown Mods  Thrown mods in Dead Island.Developer's Craft Mods  Mods/Developer's Craft ModsSkulls  Skulls are found in multiple places throughout Banoi Island, and when placed in the Altar where they belong, unlock developer crafts featured in Dead Island. Skulls do not carry over into a new game so the player will either have to place them before they leave the island or pick them up again later. However, the skulls will carry over from single-player into co-op and vice versa, and even if another person picks them up the player can use them. It may also be possible that if the player joins a person that has a skull placed, they may not need to have the skull at all and can just grab the mod. This may be easier to achieve if the skull was placed in the same session.Skull locations  Orange Skull: Act II. It is under the first set of stairs inside a shopping cart in the supermarket. Green Skull: Act I. The skull is on a rock hill, it is located east of the City Tunnel Gas Station (Use the pointer on your minimap as a south facing guide).\u00a0There will be a metal chest and the skull will be in an open toolbox. Purple Skull: Sewers in Act II. It is located on the second level accessed by ladder in the dead end; to get to the ladder the Hero must go through the right door instead of the left door (the door that doesn't lead to next objective right after killing the first Floater). It takes a bit of trekking but once the player's in the room with the three radiation barrels knocked over with a ladder, they're in the right room. They might be able to see a faint glow from the candlesticks around the skull on the second floor in a corner from the first floor depending on where they're standing at in the room. *Alternately, once all sewers are open in Moresby, the player can simply enter the sewer via the entrance in front of the police station and go through the first gate to access the skull room. Blue Skull: Act II. During the quest \"Uninvited Guests\", there is a bathroom opposite the kitchen. The Blue Skull is in one of the corners in a glass case. The Hero must first smash the case in order to be able to retrieve the skull. Brown Skull: Act I. The player has to use the portal in Bunker 02, kill the Suicider in the room, and then search the floor.Altar locations  Orange Skull Altar: Act II. It's in the Sewers, at the top of one of the largest rooms in the sewer between the City Hall and Supermarket. There will be water and flood gates, and then a ladder that goes up to a small platform with a door. When the player climbs the ladder, the door will be on their right and directly in front of them will be a zombie sitting against the wall near a propane tank. The altar is inside the room on the left. Green Skull Altar: Act II, in the Supermarket. This altar is in an area directly to the right upon entering main market. There are shelves full of teddy bears, and one of these shelves is the altar. Purple Skull Altar: Act II, during the quest Uninvited Guests. One of the burners is lit in the kitchen \u2014 this is the altar. Blue Skull Altar: Act I. Bunker 06 in the Resort area will be surrounded by zombies, with a single survivor, Jose Garcia, to rescue. Once he is rescued, the player should travel through the manhole in the bunker to the other area of it. There is a metal door on the level, and propane tanks on the level above. The player must place the tank next to the door and shoot it to blow it open. The altar is on the wall underneath the big blue arrow. Brown Skull Altar: The place is shown on the picture. The easiest way to reach the location is to go into the bungalow district near the altar. At the back of the a bungalow near the powerhouse at the Silver Bungalows district is a cliff drop that heads towards the marked spot. When the player reaches the tree, they should carefully move around the bushes and onto the rocks and then follow the rocks until they start to see greenery. The altar is tucked away in an indent there, near a flag.Skull rewards  Orange Skull: Developer's No. 1 craft \"electrobody\". (Parts needed: Battery.) Green Skull: Developer's No. 2 craft \"cr33zz revange for endless crunch\". (Parts needed: Battery.) Blue Skull: Developer's No. 3 craft \"plaguebearer\". (Parts needed: Oleander.) Purple Skull: Developer's No. 4 craft \"just mindblowing craft by simon!\". (Parts needed: Battery.) Brown Skull: Developer's 666 craft \"beware the power of glova\". (parts needed: Diamond.)Remains of the Damned  In this quest, the player needs to recover four Red Skulls for Mongina. The skulls can be found in the Ghost Village. This quest needs to be activated before the player meets up with Mowen, otherwise Mongina won't be able to talk to them.Weapon  Weapons are found throughout Banoi and Palanai, and can be as simple as a wooden board to a highly modified electric death dealing machine. Weapons can be found by killing enemies, in locked or unlocked metal chests, on the ground, or embedded in walls and bodies. Weapons can also be obtained as a reward from completing certain quests. With the exception of the Legendary Weapons, each type of weapon is available in multiple rarities. The higher the rarity of the weapon, the greater the base and mod stats will be as well as the cost and value. Weapons also vary on the hero who wields them, such as Xian Mei being able to provide higher damage output when it comes to Sharp weapons and Sam B with Blunt Weapons Available rarities include (in order of rarity):Legendary Weapons  Legendary Weapons are uniquely named  weapons in Dead Island, obtained from locked metal chests, random drops from Butchers or Rams, or as quest rewards. They are often very powerful compared to a same-level basic version of the weapon. Like  rarity weapons, Legendary Weapons do not spawn with any Name Prefix (e.g. \"Slaughtering\", \"Lethal\", \"Tiring\").List of Legendary Weapons Dead Island: Riptide  Some Legendary Weapons return in Dead Island: Riptide, though being distributed in a different fashion and at a different rarity. Only five Legendary Weapons can be found in Dead Island: Riptide: These weapons appear in fixed locations within the Flooded Jungle, match the player's level directly, and will re-appear whenever the area is left and revisited. Importantly, these Legendary Weapons are not of normal  rarity, instead appearing as  rarity weapons with corresponding lower statistics. These \"Common Legendaries\" will also spawn with one of the Common-rarity prefixes (e.g. \"Spiteful\", \"Flimsy\", \"Tiring\") and the associated penalty to statistics, if applicable. Outside of the above five weapons, no other Legendary Weapons appear within Dead Island: Riptide. Legendary Weapons are not given as quest rewards and cannot be obtained randomly from any containers or defeated enemies. Despite this, data for all Legendary Weapons from Dead Island is present in the resources of Dead Island: Riptide.Heroes  Heroes are the main characters in the Dead Island franchise. The four (five if counting John)\u00a0Hero classes in the first game are Tank, Assassin, Jack-of-all-Trades and Support. In the second game, the classes are Berserker, Huntress, Bishop and Speeder. If more than one person is using the same class/character, then they will both appear in game as that character, although it will not affect the storyline in any way. Each character has a unique set of skills in their skill trees which can be enabled and improved by spending skill points earned with each level up. Purchasing skills will provide bonuses to certain abilities or unlock new combos or finishing moves. There are three skill trees for every character: Fury, Combat and Survival. Every Hero has their own Fury skill which is related to their specialty. Entering Fury Mode enables them to temporarily attack (with extra strength and infinite\u00a0stamina) with either a weapon that has infinite durability/ammo or just their fists.Sam B  Sam B, the Blunt Weapons expert, serves as the \"Tank\" of the group and can absorb lots of damage while fighting off numerous enemies in close combat at the same time. His Fury skill enables him to punch enemies with increased strength and knockback force. Because of his high durability and expertise with the most common type of melee weapon, he is often considered the easiest character to use. As a Blunt Specialist, he has numerous skills that increase the attack power and durability of all blunt weapons found in the game. His main element of use is the blunt exclusive Impact which increases Blunt Weapon Damage while his support skills are focused on increasing resistance to enemy damage. Sam's best weapons are the Gabriel's Sledgehammer with the Tesla Mod, a Home Run (Non-Crafted), a Metal Kanabo with the Medieval Mod or Heavy Duty Mod, and the\u00a0Shocking Crowbar.Xian Mei  Xian Mei is the Bladed Weapons expert and the \"Assassin\" of the group due to the high damage nature of edged weapons and her extraordinary speed and stamina. Her Fury Skill is to attack enemies with a short knife in a blinding frenzy of stabs and slashes. Unfortunately, she has the lowest health of the team which makes her the hardest Hero to use (as stated by most of the community) through the entire game. As a Blade Specialist, she has her skills focused on making sharp melee weapons more effective and more likely to inflict critical damage. Her main elements are poison and her exclusive bleed weapon effects (similar to bleed effects added on blunt weapon mods which sharp weapons naturally do not have access to). She is able to survive through her support skills which further enhance her stamina and the effectiveness of medkits used on her. \u00a0 Her best weapons are the Eviscerator with the Deathstalker Mod or, if it is too hard to acquire, the Zed's Demise with that modification. She has the longest Fury duration and is also the one who gains Fury points the fastest, which can easily be gained by simply scoring three critical kills. She is capable of one-hitting a Thug with a non-critical or non-elemental shot, assuming that she has the right skills and is using a high-tier Eviscerator. Bladed weapons are naturally less durable, especially Katanas and Wakizashis, and also require more money to repair which translates to frequent visits to the workshop and more time spent finding and collecting\u00a0money. One may also keep a Machete with a Hot Rod Mod\u00a0as a secondary backup in case the primary is worn out and for beating down Walkers and Infected and also serving as a combo starter by setting poisoned or poisonous enemies on fire.Logan Carter  Logan Carter is the Throwing Weapons expert and the \"Jack of all Trades\" of the team. His Fury Skill allows him to throw an infinite amount of knives at nearby enemies. Most of his skills are inclined towards improving his throwing ability and how he should be versatile in general. He gains skills that are unique to him such as being able to retrieve a thrown weapon without needing to pick it up again and inflicting damage on multiple targets with a single throw. He also has skills that make him more effective with both edged and blunt weapons. He also is the only Hero with the more reliable bonus from using alcohol.. His greatest weakness is his low stamina which, despite hampering his ability to run and fight in melee, is somewhat meaningless since throwing does not consume stamina.\u00a0 Unlike the other Heroes, Logan is much better suited at using the developer items due to the fact that thrown weapons do not lose durability. He can use the Mindblowing Military Knife to pop five Walkers or Infected in a single throw with a chance for the weapon to boomerang back, allowing him to do it again without having to pick up the weapon. He can also use the Homerun Baseball Bat to knock away multiple targets which allows him to avoid being overwhelmed by large numbers of zombies. If the player does not intend to use the developer items due to how they unfairly break the game drastically, they can still depend on the more natural weapons in game. Because of his skill with both blunt and edged weapons, he can use weapons such as Eviscerator for a damage dealing throwable, or a Sledgehammer with Tesla Mod for incapacitation. His options are almost limitless.Purna Jackson  Purna Jackson is the \"Support\" specialist within the team and the Firearms expert. When her Rage mode is activated, Purna uses a Revolver with unlimited ammunition. Her Fury skill can be further upgraded to provide bonuses to nearby allies such as health regeneration and increased damage, as well as the duration and the number of targets she can take per shot. Most of her combat skills are optimized towards ranged weapons, making her guns more effective and, initially, can increase her ability to use edged weapons. Bonuses range from increasing damage to reducing recoil. Basically, most of her combat skills are there to give additional bonuses in using firearms. Her support skills are what make her what she is. She generates an aura that improves nearby Heroes even to the point of improving the durability of their weapons. She's also the only one with the skills that improve ammunition and increase the chance of finding a rare weapon. Her best weapons are the Legendary firearms (the McCall's 9mm, the Crowd Pleaser, and the Defender of the Motherland) which can be modded with an optional element of either shock, fire, poison, or impact damage. Her shotgun blasts are extremely effective because of the fact that shotguns treat the head as a limb (meaning the head contains its own health instead of merely amplifying damage for the removal of the base health) which helps to conserve ammo in heavily infested areas by instantly killing tough enemies with headshots. She should always carry enough material for making ammunition (such as Metal Scrap) so she won't be forced to switch to a melee weapon when she runs out of ammo.John Morgan  John Morgan\u00a0is the new playable character in the game Dead Island: Riptide. He was a\u00a0Sergeant of the\u00a0Australian Defence Force (ADF)\u00a0and is an expert in hand-to-hand combat. He was on vacation until he was caught up in the outbreak and then taken to a military ship within the Banoi peninsula, which unfortunately became shipwrecked near Palanai Island. John was imprisoned due to the fact that he refused to kill innocent civilians and, once he was bitten, he learned early on that he was immune to the virus. John Morgan's expertise is in hand-to-hand weapons like Brass Knuckles, with additional skills that greatly improve his speed and stamina, as well as healing him on each critical hit. John is capable of going toe to toe with almost any type of enemy in single combat, with a number of skills that help him keep away from large groups or break them up with stun-based attacks. He can still fare well without a weapon, although this is inadvisable when fighting against multiple undead enemies.Cliff Calo  Cliff Calo is the sole protagonist of the spin-off Escape Dead Island, and thus does not have a class title. The son of media mogul Tom Calo, Cliff was never interested in the family business until his father handed the reins of the company over to his younger sister. Feeling insulted, Cliff sets out to prove his worthiness by illegally going to Banoi, knowing that his father is obsessed with the Banoi crisis and would greatly reward exclusive insight into the truth behind the outbreak for his news channels. Cliff is best friends with Devan Mavropani, and he has ambitions to become a comic book artist someday. However, the stress of the zombie outbreak snaps Cliff's hold on reality, and he becomes an unreliable narrator, as his experiences on Banoi are tainted by insanity.Ryan  Ryan is one of the four playable characters in the upcoming Dead Island 2 and currently the only protagonist to be officially unveiled. Described as the \"Berserker\" of the group, he is a former volunteer firefighter who uses sledgehammers as his preferred weapon.Ashlee  Ashlee is the \"Huntress\" of the playable characters in Dead Island 2. Her name is revealed in the source code of the official website.John  John is the \"Bishop\" of the playable characters in Dead Island 2. His name is revealed in the source code of the official website.Dani  Dani is a playable character in Dead Island 2 and the \"Speeder\" of the group. Her name was revealed in the Gamescom Demo.Trivia Zombies  Zombies are the reanimated corpses of deceased human beings infected with Pathogen HK. When resurrected, the pathogen reverts any infected individual to a primitive, cannibalistic state, driven by a hunger for flesh, making them extremely hostile towards non-infected survivors. They can easily identify non-infected persons and will attempt to incapacitate (and eventually consume) them. Showing low brain functionality and little hints of intelligence, they attack mainly with their arms or handheld weapons. Cutting / breaking a zombie's arm or knocking them down will prevent any usage of weaponry - whether a handheld object or their open fist - as they tend to become stunned or drop their current weapon.Common Zombies Walker  Walkers are the majority of the undead across Banoi Island and Palanai Island and are visually distinguished by their partly or significantly eaten bodies. Their movement speed ranges between slow to medium, but become more dangerous in groups where their speed is less of a disadvantage. Walkers are also fairly quiet at a distance and can be difficult to spot in darker areas. Often, they can be found lying on the ground or sitting up motionless waiting for a survivor to come within range, not moving until the survivor is very close, where they will rush and attempt to strangle them to death. Their speed ranges from a fast paced speed walk to a slow shambling movement every few moments and they may also attempt a last moment lunge attack. A special defense against Walkers is when the Hero may grab one, requiring a quick key combo to throw it off without damage (the Walker takes slight damage from a punch to the face). This is an automatic defense and isn't controllable (other than keeping Walkers at a distance). In some areas, this mechanic is actually used as a trap. While Walkers do carry usable weapons, this does not appear to affect the amount of damage they do, although it may slightly increase their reach. Occasionally (especially after knocking a zombie back), the zombie will throw the weapon at the hero (a glitch prevents enemy hurled weapons from being claimed by the Hero for some time) and apparently, will not appear to detonate propane tanks. A Walker will die if both their arms, one of their legs or their heads are removed/decapitated. This is easy to accomplish with a weapon or the \"curbstomp\" attack. When knocked down, they may also break a limb or even their neck (the latter is rare but kills the Walker instantly). Jump kicks in particular are likely to cause a limb loss and will always knock one down. Even bare fists can break a Walker's arm (easy to do when they are knocked down).Infected  The Infected are newly awakened deceased corpses that are much faster than their Walker counterparts but possess lower durability, making them weaker in fights. These zombies are easy to deal with when fighting off one or two but are extremely dangerous in groups, and should be fought with caution. They are fast, agile, vicious, and, because of their speed, they are hard to keep track of during close combat. Also worth noting is that in Act IV, Infected tend to carry weapons and use them quite effectively. They can also climb low walls and other objects. Curiously enough, they can't climb on car roofs (it's likely that they can only climb scripted locations such as the barricaded center of Moresby. Considering that if the Hero gets on a wall, they don't normally climb then they appear unable to climb on it). They are distinguishable by their clean, almost fully human appearance. Their bodies haven't yet succumbed to the effects of decomposition. Their approach is often preceded by a high-pitched screech. It is unknown why Infected are much faster and louder than Walkers. It is speculated that this is because they haven't decomposed as much as Walkers. Other speculations suggests that the Infected aren't actually dead, but rather are insanely deranged humans caused by the virus. This is reinforced by their lack of physical damage or decay. Notably, if one was to listen closely to an Infected they may occasionally hear a strangled \"Help me!\". Other zombies such as the Suicider can also be heard saying this. Infected are first encountered in the hotel in which the player wakes up, but you must run as instructed as you are unarmed. It is likely that the first Infected you encounter that you must kill are in the quest \"Exodus\", after you leave the surf shop. You will be warned of their presence by a single screech, and you will see them running at you from across the beach. Infected will die if any limb is disabled similar to Walkers. This usually requires a weapon to accomplish (or the special \"headstomp\" attack).Special Infected Thug  Thugs are the first special infected you come into contact with. They are much larger and broader than ordinary zombies and deal massive damage \u2014 as well as knock-downs \u2014 with almost all swipes but luckily, they are slow moving. They are frequently accompanied by several Walkers. Thugs have an unmistakable roar and can be heard from far away. In melee combat, the best and easiest way to kill a Thug is to aim for its arms first with a blunt weapon or edged. If one aim for their head or chest, they will be able to attack the survivor with their undamaged arms. Breaking or cutting off a Thug's arms will force it to attack with a short-range headbutt/ bite. Breaking its neck, as well as disabling its arms, will eliminate all of its attacks and will simply follow you. Attacking them from a distance is safer but slower than hit-and-running (powerful weapons like grenades and molotov cocktails are easiest). Occasionally a Thug will fall down due to collision with a terrain object (or Sam B can knock one down) which makes it very vulnerable to the special \"headstomp\" attack (they are slow to get back up). If killed by a \"headstomp\" the XP received is the same as for a Walker rather than the higher amount received for a more usual takedown. Thugs get easily frustrated and after every other attack sequence or kick dealt to them, they will yell and shake allowing a window of time for another free attack. In Dead Island, Thugs are first encountered in the Lifeguard Tower during Act I, when the player helps John Sinamoi. They can also be met at the quest \"Waterdance\" before this. In Dead Island: Riptide, Thugs are first encountered near the end of the Prologue after you meet up with the soldiers.Suicider  Suiciders are the second special infected the player will encounter. Suiciders are zombies with disfigured, bloated bodies which are pulsing from unknown reactions within. They retain a semblance of awareness, their instincts driving them to seek help from the uninfected survivors. When they get close they erupt in a self-destructive explosion. It is advised to listen for their distinctive distorted screech - \"Help me!\" - to avoid being ambushed by them. Death is guaranteed to be instantaneous, being highly lethal to zombies and humans alike if too close to a Suicider when it detonates. Even inside a vehicle will not shield them from the blast if close enough. The best way to kill them is to attack from a distance or walk close until they're about to erupt, then run away. Suiciders are easy to kill with ranged attacks, having even less health than an Infected. They are also very unstable and easily knocked down. If they fall down their anxiety causes them to self-destruct. Any thrown object that hits a Suicider (crate, brick, Propane Tank, etc.) will cause it to fall down. Its eruption will rupture Propane Tanks in range as well. Suiciders are first encountered during the quest \"Black Hawk Down\" in Act I of the base campaign and just after the rescuing of St. Christopher's Church in Ryder White's Campaign. In Dead Island: Riptide, Suiciders are encountered when you meet up with the soldiers in the Prologue.Ram  Rams are extremely tough, strong and determined. These undead were either already crazy before the outbreak or were restrained after being infected in an attempt to prevent them from infecting others. Now, they single-mindedly pursue any survivors in sight and eliminate them out by charging at full-force. If a survivor is spotted by the Ram, it will charge in a straight line and if a character gets close enough to them, they resort to a powerful kick attack. Their weak spot is a small patch of exposed skin on their back, as well as their exposed head. They take an extremely small amount of damage - usually <20 - anywhere else. An easier way to kill some of the Rams is to drive over them in any vehicle and hit them in their weak spot. Probably the best way to kill Rams is with special effects. They may be impossible to knock down by any survivor other than Sam B but fire, electricity, poison, and bleeding all have full effect on them. This makes molotov cocktails, grenades, propane tanks, and the like ideal Ram killers. The first Ram encounter is in Act II, where it is attempting to break down the door to Saint Christopher's Church. In Dead Island: Riptide, a Ram is first encountered at the cinema when finding a new safe zone.Floater  Floaters are zombies that have been submerged in/under water for an extended length of time. They can often be found in the sewers as well as at several ponds and lakes in the Jungle and in a small number of areas in the Prison. A Floater's bloated, partially decomposed body produces a corrosive slime capable of hurting, blinding or disorienting enemies from a distance. Melee attacks often work better on Floaters than ranged ones, but it is recommended to be careful of their projectile slime when approaching from a distance. Floaters are impervious to incendiary and poison attacks but are extremely vulnerable to any shock-modded weapons. It is unknown if the corrosive slime is infectious. Floaters have a single melee attack, done randomly when the players are up close. They also have two separate ranged attacks. Other than being able to fire projectile slime over medium distances, they can also douse anything or anyone in front of them with a full 180-degree sprayed stream of bile. This attack can be devastating to players attempting to engage Floaters from the front with a melee weapon. The first encounter with Floaters is in the beginning phase of the first Sewers mission in Act II. In Dead Island: Riptide, Floaters are first encountered when looking for a boat around Palanai.Butcher  Butchers are highly aggressive and tougher versions of the Infected that slice and tear through survivors with their sharpened radial bones - the only remains of their forearms. Their leaping attacks and lightning-fast reactions make them rather dangerous and difficult to fight with melee attacks as they have a chance at dodging them. They are vulnerable to two-handed weapon attacks as well as firepower. Beware that, if below a certain amount of health, Butchers have a chance of performing a self-healing, buff-like move that will replenish all of their health. This happens mostly when the player fights Butchers for extended periods of time. They are not found until Act III when the player enters the Ghost Town in the Jungle. After reaching the middle point of the ghost town, a cutscene will play introducing the Butcher, where it brutally attacks a survivor, then heads towards the Hero. In Dead Island: Riptide, a Butcher named Ogre is first encountered when trying to find Marcus. It is attacking the gates with other zombies, as well as a Thug. Another Butcher can be found before this in a cave. Just like the Ram, they are not that common on Palanai and even more rare to find in Henderson.Dead Island: Riptide Zombies Drowner  Drowners are a type of common zombie introduced in Dead Island: Riptide. They appear in heavily flooded areas and try to kill the player by grabbing them and pulling them underwater long enough to run out of oxygen. They resemble the appearance of a Walker or Floater due to their decomposition as well as green discoloration on their remaining flesh. Drowners are classified as Very Fast in Dr. Kessler's Casebook and attack in a flurry just as the Infected. They are drawn by the sounds of survivors (running, explosives, gunshots) and they also tend to surprise their prey by leaping from the water and relentlessly attacking them. However, most tend to stay close to water and some will even retreat from the land back into the water itself, though they will not play dead, instead mindlessly roaming until the players enters their immediate area once again.Grenadier  Grenadiers are a type of special zombie introduced in Dead Island: Riptide. These zombies are infected scientists in hazmat suits that toss exploding, toxic pieces of their own flesh at the Heroes. They are classified as Slow in movement and bear pulsating exposed flesh. They have a main weak-point which is the oxygen tank carried upon their backs. This will instantly kill them if shot.Wrestlers  Wrestlers are a type of special zombie introduced in Dead Island: Riptide. These zombies have a big, mutated arm that acts as a club to knock down the Heroes; either giving a swing or a massive smash unto the ground. The Wrestler bears immense strength and is able to kill a survivor with 1-2 hits (the damage from a slow overhead strike is roughly half a health bar). It is classified as Very Slow yet it is stronger than a Thug if it lands a hit upon it's victim. The first Wrestler encountered is when Wayne mutates into one after making your way through the sewers. He tells Purna (who notices something is wrong with him) that someone 'pushed' him. Harlow Jordan informs the group that she pushed him so that she could see what exactly the mutagen would do to someone who was infected with the virus. This means Harlow knew he was infected (as she also states such). This seems corroborated by a cutscene prior to this boss fight, where Wayne is nearly bitten (or possibly is, as he falls, which is also where Harlow may have 'pushed him' near the boat on Palanai) which can lead to the speculation that he is infected.Screamer  Screamers are type of special zombie introduced in Dead Island: Riptide. These zombies have the ability to emit a loud, piercing scream that can blur the vision of the player and disorient the Heroes down. Their deafening scream will draw Infected and Walkers to the unfortunate survivor whom is unable to react unless they move away from the wide range of the Screamer's scream. Oddly, the Screamer bears the voice of a female Infected but appears as a male zombie (being that the Screamer is topless). In Dr. Kessler's Casebook, the Screamer holds a very fast movement pattern as they travel faster than the Infected. Interestingly enough as well is that the Screamer appears to have been a test subject of some kind due to its appearance: Its brain is exposed and their heads bear an instrument which is used to restrain their neck movement and their eyes open. Additionally, the Screamers bear stitches on their shoulders and stomach. The Screamer also has an alternate form. In Dr. Kessler's Casebook, the Screamer appears to wear a green dress which is torn, bloody and reveals \"her\" exposed internal organs as well as her knees (bones) and legs. The alternate appearance to the Screamer is topless and wearing green pants. This is speculated to be the male version although it still uses the female infected voice. The version where it wears pants also shows \"its\" areola missing, which appear to have been surgically removed from its body as opposed to being eaten. A small series of dash lines can clearly be seen on parts of its body as an indicator of future surgical plans.Number of players  The level of enemies are based on the character level of the player, meaning that the levels of anyone else won't matter.Notable Zombies Boss zombies  Boss zombies are new, special zombies present in Dead Island: Riptide. Each boss zombie has different abilities. The majority are found in specific Dead Zones throughout the game. There are a total of 13 to be found.Trivia References Quest  Quests are missions that are given out by survivors or triggered by visiting different locations and picking up quest items in Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide. After completing the campaign, the XP reward changes and it's based on the player's level. For example every continuous quest will give 0,5% of required XP to level up (except for \"Time to Booze\" and \"Blood Compound\" wich will give 1,5% and 1,33% respectively), example: A level 57 player (6958069 - 6123454 XP) will recive the difference between the XP that will be needed to level up (in this case \"6958069\") minus the XP that was needed to reach the current level (in this case \"6123454\"). The quest reward will be based on this result (\"834615\" in this case), and you apply the percentage of the quest and you will have the XP reward.The following formula is how to calculate XP reward. [(XP needed for next level) - (XP needed for current level)] * (XP multiplayer) Main and side quests do not to have a concret formula for calculating these reults since the difficulty does no appears to have a fixed XP multiplayer, but the XP reward is still based on the player's level.Dead Island Main quests Prologue Side quests  The difference between side quests and main quests is at time blurred. There are some side quests that are really part of main quests and must be completed for the main quest to be advanced or completed. In some cases why this was done is unclear (e.g., Locked Armory) while others make more sense (e.g., Ashes to Ashes and On the Air).Continuous events  Some of the continuous events actually have an end. When the Laboratory is overrun at the beginning of No Time to Talk those quests will no longer be available. This applies to Blood Compound.Dead Island: Riptide  Needs ExpandingXian Mei  Xian Mei, the Assassin, is one of the four playable Heroes in Dead Island\u00a0and Dead Island: Riptide. Before the outbreak she was an employee at the Royal Palms Resort. She was sent to\u00a0Banoi Island by her superiors to spy on the wealthy Westerners that stay there. As soon as she arrived at the hotel, the manager put her on 24 hour surveillance.Background  Xian was born and raised in China. Her father, who was the Chief inspector of the Hong Kong Police passed away when she was only 10 years old. He was killed by an enforcer of the Wo Shing Wo Triad, but before her father's death, he taught Xian martial arts and she continued practicing even after his passing. After graduating top of her university's class, she joined the Hong Kong Police force and was placed in the first female crime squad; but\u00a0she and her female colleagues were never put in the field and their male superiors did not train them the way they promised they would, so Xian concluded that the entire group was only for show. Her superiors decided to send her to the Royal Palms Resort to be an informer and to spy on the Westerners that visited and stayed at the island. Even though her work dishonors her father's memory, she knows she can do much, much better. She wants an opportunity to prove herself, and apparently the zombie outbreak was that opportunity. During the opening cutscene, the player could see her attending to a woman laying on the floor, presumably infected by the virus.Character Selection Info  \"My father was a very great man. A Chief Inspector for the Hong Kong Police. Even though he died when I was ten, I remember him very well. He was killed by an enforcer for the Wo Shing Wo Triad. And I told myself that I would follow in his footsteps and honor his memory. He taught me martial arts and I continued to practice after he was gone. After finishing at the top of my university class, I joined the Hong Kong Police and was chosen as part of the first all female anti-organized crime squad. I worked hard. I did my best. But the men in charge never intended to put us on the front lines. They didn't train us the way they promised they would. They didn't believe any of us women were up to the task. We were only for show. Instead, my superiors sent me here. To this resort. To this front desk. To be an informer. To spy on wealthy Westerners. My father would not be proud of me. This work dishonors his memory. But I will do as they ask. For I am a patriot. But I know I am capable of much, much more. I just need the opportunity to prove myself.\"Strategy Notes Trivia Sam B  Sam B, the Tank, one of the four Heroes in Dead Island\u00a0and\u00a0Dead Island: Riptide, is a one-hit-wonder rap star of fading fame. Originally from New Orleans, he is now performing four nights a week at the Royal Palms Resort.Background  Sam B was booked by the Royal Palms Resort to perform his well-known song \"Who Do You Voodoo\" at a high profile hotel party. He gladly took the chance to play this gig. Once strong, self-confident and proud, Sam B has had a troubled past and a history of drug and alcohol abuse, as his private life became caught in a haze of fake friends and bad advisers.Character Selection Info  \"I grew up in New Orleans. The Lower Ninth Ward. My Daddy went to prison when I was two. That's where he died. Angola. Momma didn't ever recover from that and drank and did crack and any other random motherfucker who didn't smack her round too bad. My nanna's the one who raised me. She ran a washeteria and we lived in a little shotgun house on Burgundy. From the time I was ten, man, I wanted to rap. I was into old school free-style rap and I'd be kicking ass at them battles, brah. But man, I just couldn't catch a break. Nothing caught on. So one Halloween, I came up with \"Who Do You Voodoo, Bitch?\" Just as a motherfucking joke, you know? It went right to the top of the hip hop charts. Like a motherfucking rocket! Suddenly, I was famous. Going to the Grammies. Hitting the parties. Man, I had bitches up the yin yang and for the first time in my life, I was making money. But shit, I was spending it as quick as I was getting it. I thought I had made it, you know what I'm saying? That the gravy train was never gonna end. So I did another song. And another song. And nothing hit. Nothing fucking hit. Song after song and ain't nobody gave a shit. It's been ten years man, and yeah, I can still get gigs, but all they want me to do is \"Who Do You Voodoo, Bitch?\" I used to play the big Casinos in Vegas or Atlantic City, but now it's just been Reno or Laughlin or some motherfucking cruise ship. So this gig here might be my last chance. There's some heavy Hollywood hitters up in here and if I get noticed, I could be right back on top there, you know what I'm saying?\"Strategy  Sam is by far the toughest of the four characters, and the most capable of wading straight into groups of lesser enemies in melee combat. His specialization in blunt weapons which have very high Force attribute let him knock enemies around like bowling pins, as does his Rage ability. Don't get too confident with him though; he can still be brought down quickly by a large enough mob. For most enemies the tactics are relatively similar, try to draw a couple off at a time so that you don't get surrounded and bash them flat. The one enemy that needs a very different tactic is gun-toting humans. Trying to charge one (and usually there are more than one at a time) is a bad idea; unless you are able to sneak up close to one without them noticing until it's too late, they will be able to put several shots into you before you get in range and they will occasionally backstep to try to avoid you. It's best to keep one good pistol on hand and try to shoot them in the head, which is almost always a one-hit kill. Look through the ironsights while doing this for better accuracy.Trivia References Purna Jackson  Purna Jackson, the Leader, one of the four Heroes in Dead Island\u00a0and\u00a0Dead Island: Riptide, is a VIP bodyguard.Biography  Purna is a former officer of the Sydney Police department, and as such, she is an expert at firearms. After losing her career when she shot a child molester who could not be touched legally because of his wealth and connections, Purna then turned to working as a bodyguard for VIPs in dangerous places all over the world, contrary to her selection info. She is hired not just for her skills but her looks, as wealthy men did not mind showing up with Purna on their arm. She is still very bitter over losing her career,\u00a0has a deep\u00a0hatred of people with enough money to ignore legalities, keeps very much to herself,\u00a0and wishes to finish off the child molester that caused her to lose her job.Character Selection Info  \"I hate rich assholes, which is fucking ironic since I'm expected to put my bloody life on the line for them. That's what they pay me for. This pricey hotel here? To be a bodyguard for the rich and famous fuckwits who come to Banoi to blow their money. I used to be a cop. A bloody good one. A vice detective in Sydney. You know how many female half-Aborigine detectives there were before me? None. You think it was easy suffering the abuse of my so-called colleagues? Half of 'em hated me because I was a girl and the other half didn't like the fact that my mum was a Koori. So I came up the hard way: I busted my ass. It took me twelve years to make detective and that still wasn't enough. It's an old boys' club, you know. The whole justice system is a fucking joke. Teenage drug addicts get put away forever and old white wankers who steal fucking millions get away scot-free. One rich bugger I investigated was clearly molesting his fourteen year old daughter, but he had too much pull with the politicians, so I couldn't touch him. After the girl killed herself, I confronted him but he just laughed at me. He pulled out a pistol and told me he could blow my bleeding head off and no one would care because I was nothing, a nobody, an Abo bitch... So I fucking took his gun away and shot the bastard. It was self-defense, but I still got sacked. Twelve bloody years down the drain. Worst part is, I didn't even kill the son of a bitch. I just gelded him. One day I'm gonna have to go back and finish the job...\"Strategy General Combat Rage Weapons Against Various Zombies Trivia Developer's No. 1 Craft  The Developer's No. 1 Craft is a special weapon blueprint featured in Dead Island. It is obtained by placing the Orange Skull at its altar in the sewers. The skull can be found under the first set of stairs in the Supermarket. Regardless of the current Hero's level, this weapon mod creates a level 24 Electro Military Knife. While the blade costs a large amount of money to repair, it \u2014 like the other weapons \u2014 does not take damage while thrown.Video Logan Carter  Logan Carter, the Jack of All Trades, one of the four playable characters in Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, is a former American football star and the jack of all trades of the group of the Heroes.Background  Logan is former American football star who led a spoiled life and was successful in every possible way. His ego and alcohol addiction finally put an end to his bright future after taking part in a reckless street race with tragic consequences. Logan not only killed a young woman \u2014 his unfortunate passenger; he also fractured his knee and sent himself to prison, putting an end to his sports career. After leaving prison, he was forced to play semi-pro. His fall from stardom inevitably followed and he plunged swiftly into a life of bitterness and despair. In an attempt to get away from the demons hunting him, he gladly takes the chance to experience the beauty and wonder of Banoi Island. His drinking habit makes alcohol better used with Logan than the other Heroes.Character Selection Info  \"Oh, man. I used to be on top of the world, brother. All-pro quarterback, four years running.

Logan Carter is no goddamn douchebag.\"Strategy Trivia Zed's Demise  Zed's Demise is a legendary katana featured in Dead Island.Overview  Zed's Demise is rewarded after completing the Banoi Butcher quest. The weapon's level requirement and stats scale to the Hero's level at the time of collecting it. Zed's Demise deals extremely high damage, particularly against special infected and when combine with mods. Xian Mei users may further the weapon's damage by using her first blade skill, causing roughly 2000-3000 damage. The opportunity to acquire Zed's Demise is lost after the mission Devil's Labyrinth.Pros and Cons  Pros: The Zed's Demise has exceptional damage, allowing it to have the 2nd highest base damage in the game (behind the Eviscerator). The weapon also has good handling, allowing for a high DPS, making it very useful against mobs of zombies or special infected. It also has an average durability, being 62~65 at level 60 allowing for multiple kills before repair. The best thing about the Zed's Demise is it is obtained as a quest reward, allowing for it to be obtained much easier than other legendaries due to their low drop rates, and if the player wishes to repeat the game, they can earn multiple Zed's Demises. If a player wishes to make easy money, they could consider fully upgrading this weapon and putting the Deathstalker mod on it, making it very expensive, and then duplicating the weapon repeatedly and selling the excess Zed's Demises. Cons: While this weapon's durability isn't terrible, the repair cost is very high, so unless money isn't an issue this weapon isn't a good choice for continuous use.Trivia Survivors  Survivors are people who have not died or turned into zombies before the start of the game. Non-playable survivors can give the Hero certain quests or some information, merchants offer different items in exchange for cash or unwanted items, and one of them (Jin) can even carry the player's items. Non-interactive survivors are normally encountered along with interactive survivors but most eventually become interactive later on in the game. Some survivors will ask the player to complete a task for another survivor. i.e. getting some medicine, bandages, food, etc. Some survivors may require certain tasks completed before more dialogue options will unlock. It is best to re-check the Safe House locations after completing several tasks for any additional dialogue options that will occur.Playable (Heroes) Non-playable Royal Palms Resort Pool House  Note: The Pool House is later abandoned, as the group moves to the Lifeguard Tower.Other survivors City of Moresby Square (Abandoned house) Town Hall  Note: Later the safe house is overrun and everyone is killed or turned into a zombie.Other survivors The Jungle Laboratory  Note: Later the safe house is overrun and everyone is killed.Other survivors Prison Canteen  Note: Later the Canteen is overrun and several of the prisoners are killed, including Mowen. Alvaro Sanchez, Brian (prison), Kevin, and Jeremy survive. Banoi Butcher is meant to be killed beforehand.Other survivors Bloodbath Arena Ryder White's Campaign Prologue Palanai Jungle Paradise Survival Camp Halai Village Batram's Family Other Survivors Palanai Ferry Station Henderson Makeshift Hospital Other Survivors Deadzone Characters Weapon Parameters and Modification  All melee weapons featured in Dead Island have the following parameters (the only exception is a Chainsaw, which has only Damage and Rate of Fire parameters): All firearms featured in Dead Island have the following parameters:Rarity  Weapons come in 6 rarity levels with a 7th level of named legendary items.\u00a0 Items with higher rarity levels tend to have slightly better base stats, but where rarity level comes into play most is when you upgrade the item.\u00a0 Each of the four upgrade levels will give a bigger bonus for higher rarity levels. All weapons in Dead Island can be categorized as either a melee weapon or a firearm. But they can be broken down further as a specific type of melee weapon or firearm, each with its own unique attributes.Weapon Modification  Weapons in Dead Island can be modified to gain additional damage effects and more power. To modify a weapon you need to find the following:Weapon Effects  Some weapons have special effects. These effects are displayed to the right of a weapon's normal stats with a symbol and a number. The symbol determines the type of effect and the number determines the intensity of the effect.Notes See Also Developer's No. 4 Craft  The Developer's No. 4 Craft blueprint is obtained through placing the Purple Skull in its proper location.Special Effect  It has the appearance of a Short Circuit Mod and has a 100% chance (before skill bonuses) to cause zombies' heads to explode. Use sparingly on other entities (repair cost from 0%: $11,672). Only works against Walkers, Infected and (perhaps) Infected Ryder White.Notes Videos Assassin's Greed  The Assassin's Greed is a legendary weapon featured in Dead Island. This sharp melee weapon is a type of knife and can be obtained from metal chests in the city of Moresby, and occasionally in metal chests in the Laboratory area, as well as looted from a fallen zombie.Pros and Cons  Pros: Being a knife, this weapon has exceptional handling, making it the best weapon in this category compared to the other Legendaries and is able to deal a high DPS with the fast attack patterns. Cons: In accordance with being a knife, this weapon has weak durability, requiring repairs if used frequently. In comparison with the other sharp legendaries, this weapon also has the lowest base damage.Trivia References Firearms  Firearms include all the guns in Dead Island.Defender of the Motherland  The Defender of the Motherland is a firearm and a Legendary Weapon featured in Dead Island. It is a variant of the Auto Rifle with a different texture and is identical to the other Auto Rifles in the game except for its recoil, which is noticeably less. It is one of the Trio Legendary Guns (the other two are the McCall's 9mm pistol and the Crowd Pleaser shotgun).Stats\u00a0  A level 60 unmodified fully-upgraded version of this weapon wielded by Purna (the firearm expert) can have the following stats (note that any weapon in the game, even of exactly the same type, can have slightly different stats):Trivia Eviscerator  The Eviscerator is Dead Island's legendary Wakizashi. When upgraded completely, the weapon does a massive 2000\u20135000 damage, adhering to its name. The weapon excels when combined with Deathstalker, making it a popular choice.Pros and Cons  Pros: The Eviscerator deals the highest damage--even exceeding Zed's Demise's attack capabilities--making it the best for insta-killing zombies and certain Special Infected. The weapon's handling is excellent, allowing for many attacks before a stamina break and easy mob genocide; moreover, the weapon is one-handed, allowing Xian users to exploit their Flying Strike skill. Cons: Being a Wakizashi, The Eviscerator's durability is poor and plenty of money is needed for repair, making it unwise to use carelessly.Location  \u00a0Legendary Weapon  Legendary Weapons are unique items in the game, Characterized by orange text. (not all orange weapons are legendary weapons, see: weapons) Legendary weapons are usually gained by a reward for quests but can also be found in chests, albeit extremely rare. Below are a list of all known legendary weapons.Ryder White  Ryder White, often referred to as the Voice, was a survivor featured in Dead Island who served as the main antagonist of the game. He is also featured as the protagonist in Ryder White's Campaign, where it is revealed he had actually been impersonated by Charon when speaking with the Heroes during the main game.Ryder White's Campaign  During the events prior to the game's main storyline, Ryder was interrogated to test his loyalty to his country by being presented with photographs of individuals which he was asked if he would agree to kill without question (one of which was his wife, Emily White, which he agreed to reluctantly). After passing the test, Ryder was deployed on Banoi Island in order to aid with containing the recent infection outbreak. During the mission, Ryder and his squad on board of a helicopter were ordered to initiate a bombing run on the highway in the jungle. During their flight back to base, the copilot of the aircraft became infected and attacked the other pilot, forcing the craft to crash land in Moresby. Ryder awakened from the crash several hours later to discover that he is the lone survivor of his crew. He was then contacted by the B.I.D.F. Commander, who instructed him to regroup with B.I.D.F. Unit 4 stationed near Saint Christopher's Church as the evacuation zone he requested pick up from had already departed. Ryder later arrived at the unit's location to discover that everyone had been killed by the local gang known as the Raskols before being stripped of their weapons and equipment, which included the explosive charges needed to destroy the City Bridge in Sector 4 (Old Town), in order to prevent the infection from spreading any further. He was then informed by the B.I.D.F. to make his way to the Police Station in Sector 3 of the city in order to recover the explosives to complete Unit 4's mission. After fighting his way to the Police Station, Ryder was confronted by members of the gang who taunted him over the loss of his fellow soldiers. After a heated firefight, Ryder managed to kill the gang members and collected the stolen equipment before being instructed to proceed with finding and destroying the bridge. With most of the roadways blocked, Ryder climbed into a manhole that took him to the sewers beneath Moresby in order to gain access to the riverside. Upon exiting the sewers, Ryder's progress was again faltered by a group of Raskols that claimed the City Bridge as their territory, leaving him with no other option but to kill more civilians which the B.I.D.F. intel allowed in order to ensure the mission's completion. With the gang members disposed of, Ryder proceeded with planting the charges on the bridge and demolishing the bridge. With the mission accomplished, the B.I.D.F. intel ordered Ryder to make his way to the evacuation zone in Sector 6 (Gas Station). Ryder then fought through waves of zombies as he waited for the evac chopper to arrive. While on board the chopper, Ryder contacted Emily telling her to prepare herself to be picked up. Emily however, replied saying that she had been bitten by a patient and told Ryder to go on without her before making her tearful farewell to him. Unable to accept the loss of his wife, Ryder ordered the pilot not to land on the aircraft carrier off the coast of the island and instead change course to the Prison in order to pick up his wife (disregarding her advice). The chopper then landed on the roof of the prison where Ryder frantically sprinted his way inside to find Emily in hopes of not being too late. When Ryder reached Emily in the hospital wing of the prison, he found her strapped to a bed trying to tell him to leave her in broken English as a result of the gradual transformation into an Infected. Ryder then traveled deeper into the prison in order to find Kevin. Upon discovering Kevin, he discovered that Kevin was actually the hacker, Charon. Ryder was then left with no other choice but to collaborate with Charon in order to ensure his wife's life. Charon instructed Ryder to start the prison's emergency power to activate the complex's surveillance cameras which Charon would then use to guide Ryder. Once the power was back online, Ryder was confronted by a groups of rebel prisoners that managed to obtain firearms from the prison's armory. After fighting through numerous groups of prisoners, Ryder arrived at one of the other medical wards in the hospital where he found an antibiotic to slow the effects of the infection on Emily known as Tetracycline. Once Ryder obtained the antibiotic, Charon informed him that the Heroes were on their way to the island with the antidote and that the antibiotic would slow down the effects of the infection on Emily until they arrived. After administering the antibiotic to Emily, Charon notified him that a group of prisoners were approaching in retaliation for the ones that Ryder killed in order to obtain the Tetracycline. With the prisoners dead, Ryder traveled to the control room in Block C and met up with Charon. As Ryder approached Charon, he discovered that Charon was behind the deaths of the scientists at the Laboratory but hides his suspicion. He was then instructed to clear the infected from the shower room in Block C for when the Heroes arrived. With the shower room cleared, Ryder used the sewers in order to return to the control room. While eavesdropping on Charon's conversation with the Heroes, he discovered that Charon had been posing as him (the Voice). Out of rage, Ryder threatened to kill Charon for endangering Emily and making him betray his country. Charon then ensured him that the Heroes had the antidote and that they wouldn't trust either Ryder or Charon if it was revealed that they were never actually speaking to Ryder. Charon then instructed Ryder to store knockout gas above the elevator lift that the Heroes would be using in order to steal the antidote from them to avoid having to make any negotiations. After placing the gas and returning to the control room, Charon and Ryder watched the Heroes pass out from the gas. Before leaving to retrieve the gas, Ryder destroyed the control room's computer in order to prevent Charon from pulling off any more tricks. He then locked Charon in the control room and told him that he was going to go get the antidote for Emily. Charon then replied to Ryder stating that the antidote would only work on people that were only in the early stages of infection - while Emily was already past the first stages. Shaken by his words, Ryder ran off to get back to Emily in the intensive care unit. After Ryder left, Charon revealed that he had a hidden backup key card and taunted him, stating that Ryder should have killed him when he had the chance. Afraid of being too late, Ryder collected the antidote from the Heroes and frantically fought through countless waves of zombies to get back to Emily. Upon finding Emily, she had already become an Infected. Ryder then vowed to make a complete antidote out of the serum and brought Emily to the roof where he discovered that Charon had turned the Heroes against him.Dead Island  He is believed to be the first survivor the Hero comes in contact with, but it is revealed in White's Campaign to be Charon, assuming White's identity, as he guides the Hero out of the hotel, via an intercom. Once the Hero has escaped and reached John Sinamoi and his group, their primary goal is to contact the Voice. Unfortunately, their equipment isn't strong enough to do so. During Act II, upon the Hero's return from Moresby, Sinamoi reveals that he sent Dominic and a few others over to the Royal Palms Resort hotel in order to try to contact the Voice from there. Once the Hero arrives at the hotel, a cut-scene plays in which they talk to him. He reveals that his name is Ryder White, and that he is a Colonel in the B.I.D.F. When questioned as to why he is at the prison, he further reveals that his wife, Emily, is a doctor employed at the prison and he had gone there to find her. However, he does seem suspiciously reluctant to reveal his identity, as he only does so after open skepticism from the Hero. In order to reach him, the Hero must travel through the bunkers to Mingende and find a smuggler named Mowen. Mowen is needed to guide the Hero through the minefield around the prison. After that, the Hero cuts contact with Ryder in order to follow his orders. During the quest \"Chasing the White Rabbit\", the Hero catches up with Colonel White during his escape attempt. Ryder claims he must leave the island with Emily in order to save her while making more of the antidote. He claims he will return and save everyone, but Kevin is aware Ryder's real plan is stop the outbreak by bombing the island, most likely with nuclear ordinance. However, Jin becomes angry with him and unties Emily who promptly attacks Ryder, forcing him to kill Emily. Angered by Jin's actions, he kills Jin, and attempts to use the \"vaccine\" on himself. Unfortunately, instead of curing him, it seems to have the opposite effect as he rapidaly mutates into a large, muscular undead form. The Hero is then forced to kill Ryder.Character Selection Bio  \"I've seen some real hell holes in my time. Been all over the world, you see. I was with the SASR. The Aussie version of the British SAS. Fought in Iraq, East Timor, and Afghanistan. Each of those places was worse then the next. The politicians want to turn them into Western Democracies, but they're primitive. Tribal. Steeped in all kinds of crazy shit. They don't want us there. Just like they don't want us here. Of all the brutal, chaotic places I've been, Banoi takes the bloody cake. They got warring tribes in the highlands, Raskol gangs terrorizing the shantytowns, and some shit-for-brains billionaire has the brilliant idea to build this luxury resort. Guess the land was cheap and it is a beautiful place, but deep in the jungles here, some of those indigenous tribes still practice cannibalism. You know what they call human flesh? Long pig. They say it tastes just like pork. My wife convinced me to come here with her because she thought I'd be safer. Out of the line of fire as it were. So now I'm training the local Banoi defense force and I gotta be honest. I got a bad feeling about this place. A real bad feeling.\"Notes Trivia References Butcher  The Butcher is a special zombie found in Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide. The Butcher is first seen when searching for Afran and is only encountered in the Jungle in Act III. In Dead Island: Riptide, Butchers are located in the Flooded jungle, Dead Zones, Halai Village, and Hub defense missions. Except for Dead Zones and Hub Defense Missions, they are uncommon. They are first met in Chapter III, during Twisted Mind with Thugs, Floaters, and the Ogre, a taller version of the Butcher.Overview  Butchers are a faster, stronger version of the Infected. They can slash you with their forearm bones. Their\u00a0quick attacks make them\u00a0difficult to fight with melee weapons. Attacking them from a further distance with guns or thrown weapons is an effective way of destroying them. Butchers have longer reach than their models indicate and can successfully attack you from a range that would normally require them to be wielding a long weapon to reach.Appearance  Butchers appear to be heavily damaged Infected zombies. Their forearms have been completely destroyed, leaving only bloody stumps with exposed, sharpened bones in their place. Whether the bones' razor-sharp points are the result of violent fractures or if the Butchers purposely sharpen the bones is unknown. Their faces are also greatly damaged, revealing much of the skull under their skin, but still possessing enough muscle to move their jaws. The eyes are pale and appear to not be functional, although they still manage to possess incredible accuracy and finesse in combat. Butchers appear to be wearing overalls and feature long gray hair and huge bald spots.Abilities  Butchers use their exposed and sharpened forearm bones to tear their victims into pieces. While rushing towards the player, a Butcher will let out a loud shriek to alert others of your presence. Be forewarned, its attacks are fast and can kill you in seconds if he continues his barrage of rapid slicing movements. Butchers also have the ability to regenerate health so it is highly recommended that you kill them as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard, if not impossible, to break the limbs of a Butcher. However, if one manages to do so, the enemy would be effectively neutralized.Tips Notes Diamonds  Diamonds are a rare and valuable (sold for $1500) miscellaneous item found on occasion as loot and quest rewards in Dead Island.

In the mid twenty-first century most of that old guard of superheroes have retired due to old age and a change of public attitudes to them following a metahuman-initiated Third World War. However, a new generation of heroes has appeared in the last year or two, and recently they banded together as their predecessors did to pool their resources and fight for a better tomorrow together as the Justice League.Tools Superman Secundus  This article is about the superhero Christopher Kent. For Clark Kent, see Superman Superman Secundus is one of the most powerful superheroes on Earth. The son of Superman, he has protected the planet in place of his father since he vanished in 2025. His abilities include incredible super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, flight and heat-visionHistory  Superman Secundus first appeared in 2025, shortly after Superman left Earth. Introducing himself as the son of Superman, he vowed he would carry on his father's work and protect the people of Metropolis and the rest of the world until such time as he returned. World-renowned scientist Professor Quantum was able to vouch for Superman Secundus' identity and confirmed his DNA was that of a Kryptonian. (The identity of his mother is unknown although most assume he is some sort of Kryptonian-Human hybrid.) Despite anti-metahuman feeling which remained after World War III, Superman had always been the exception in the public's eye and especially in America was still considered a hero. Superman Secundus was able to gain acceptance based on his lineage and like his father he concentrated mainly on saving people from accidents or natural disasters rather than chasinig and apprehending criminals - which meant that the governments of the world were inclined to turn a blind eye to his actions. In 2035, Superman Secundus was one of the founding members of the new Justice League International. Believing Superman had returned, Superman Secundus attended the first meeting of the League only to be mind-controlled by the White Martian who was impersonating his father. Freed by Saturn Girl and Zachary Zatara, Superman Secundus helped apprehend the Martian then pledged to always be on-call for the fledging League if they required assistance.Appearance  Superman Secundus appears as a young looking man with a darkish complexion and a tall, well-built frame. His hair is kept short but with the same spit-curl that his father often wore on his forehead, and he has a short beard. He has two different outfits he is known to wear: one is black with white details, the other is black with blue details. In either case, the details include the crest on his chest which appears to be in the shape of an S. (In actual fact, this is a stylised version of a Kryptonian glyph that represents Superman's family on Krypton.) Unlike his father, he wears no cape.Powers  Superman Secundus has a broad range of powers brought about by his Kryptonian physiology: while exposed to the rays of a yellow sun, he is able to photosynthesise that energy and use it for a variety of exceptional gifts: Like his father, Superman Secundus' power's have grown as he has aged and been exposed to more and more sunlight. In theory, his powers could grow to his father's level and beyond in time. This may include developing additional powers. Superman's powers fade if he finds himself under the glare of red sunlight, including if simulated technologically. He also finds his powers fading if exposed to Green Kryptonite, and the radiation from that rock is fatal if large doses are exposed over a prolonged period of time. In addition to the above weakness, Superman's invulnerability does not protect him from magic. Spells and enchanted items bypass his normal hardiness, though the rest of his powers remain intact.Allies & Enemies Allies Enemies Sexy Ruby Joker Girl  Sexy Ruby Joker Girl (or Seiteki Rubijokamecchen) is a Japanese supervillain. Once a popular J-pop star, an accident during the filming of a music video saw her turn into a strange tribute act to the Joker.History Pop Career: Mary Midori  Miki Warai was a Japanese girl who became a teen pop sensation under the performing name of Mary Midori. Her parents and music company were canny marketers and were able to position her in a prime position - someone realistic enough that girls would want to be and sexy enough that boys would fantasise about. For two years she enjoyed a healthy career as a B-Lister in the Japanese music circuit. Following police investigations into her diaries after Miki's transformation, diaries were uncovered revealing that Miki was not always happy with her life as Mary Midori. She wrote of feeling pressured into making the most of her moment in the spotlight, knowing that in an album or two's time she'd be yesterday's news and thrown on the scrap heap. She was unhappy with the pressure to look more westernised - she was regularly asked to dye her hair blonde for videos and photoshoots.Origin: Sexy Ruby Joker Girl  The last single ever planned for Mary Midori, \"Kamensuki Eiei!\" or \"Masked Love Forever!\", was to have been her biggest music video yet. Miki would be dressed in an outfit reminiscent of the infamous American supervillain the Joker and would be filmed carrying out a robbery in a factory, charming all the guards and shooting them in the heart with a bow and arrow. Best of all, up-and-coming superhero Most Excellent Superbat had agreed to join the filming and would be the superhero who arrests her in the final sequence, granting Mary Midori's brand excellent cross-publicity. Miki got very into the role, and spent a lot of time reading up about the Joker. However, the shoot went horribly wrong when Miki fell during a scene set on a gangway over industrial chemicals. For all her research, Miki hadn't paid enough attention to the safety protocols and tumbled over the handrail and into the vat below. Most Excellent Superbat helped retrieve her and by some miracle she was not killed. However, she did not escape the incident unscathed. Her hair was burnt out and the pale make-up on her skin had fused to give her a permanently chalk white cast. Worse still, some mixture of the stress of the incident, ingestion of the chemicals and their fumes & her stressful home life combined to break her psychologically. As far as Miki was concerned, the film shoot never ended - she was still Mary Midori, still acting out the role of a supervillain for her adoring public.Crimes: The Mirthful Menace  Taking the name of the supervillain she played in her music video, Sexy Ruby Joker Girl, Miki went on the first of many crime sprees and her first of many clashes with Most Excellent Superbat and the Super Young Team. These crimes are usually more comedic and over-the-top than serious - she is more likely to try and try and ransom the golf clubs of the Prime Minister of Japan than the Prime Minister herself - but because she is convinced everything is \"done by special effects\" and \"worth it for the publicity\", she has no qualms about putting people in danger. Despite her mental problems and criminal tendencies, there is still an underground fanbase for Sexy Ruby Joker Girl who view her as something of a fetish-y sex symbol. On at least one occasion, attempts by the police to arrest her have been impeded by fans who have sought to protect her. A raid on Quantum Labs on the Moon saw Sexy Ruby Joker Girl trying to obtain Nth Metal as part of her latest plan. On chasing her to Japan, the Justice League and Super Young Team discovered that she had somehow managed to summon a demon (whom she called Hiroshima Shadow) and intended to use a nuclear power plant's energies to super-size the demon - she was captured, but not before the demon did indeed grow to full strength and took ten superheroes working together to capture. She was taken by the Japanese authorities and is expected to be sentenced to imprisonment at Sairento Hiru Psychiatric Secure Unit. She was transferred to America, supposedly as an extradition hearing to see if she was sane enough for trial there. Instead this was a pretense for President Lena Luthor to induct her into the Injustice League. She was the only member to not be apprehended after the team's defeat, escaping in a commandeered ambulance. Using a fake alias already prepared for Spellbinder she disguised herself as a Dr Koemi Ebisu and infiltrated Arkham Asylum whereupon she initiated a mass break-out.Appearance  Sexy Ruby Joker Girl's appearance is strongly reminiscent of the Joker. She has chalk white skin and ruby red lips. She wears a variety of green wigs, usually either a long mane or in pigtails. Sexy Ruby Joker Girl has many outfits, all variations on the Joker's archetypal purple outfit The variations from the original are usually to play to her sexuality - the shirt replaced with a bodice or half-unbuttoned, the trousers replaced with a skirt and tights with playing card suit symbols. Because Sexy Ruby Joker Girl still sees herself as a popstar, she considers these outfits \"fan-service.\" (And indeed there is a contingent of specialist fans online for whom she is a sex symbol.) During her team-up with Hiroshima Shadow, she wore a variant outfit she described as \"Victorian Lolita\" - a steampunk-esque outfit with top hat, corset and a walking stick. During her membership of the Injustice League, she was dressed for a \"beach party\" - bikini, snorkel and flippers.Powers  Although possessing no superhuman abilities, Sexy Ruby Joker Girl uses a wide array of comedy- and joke-themed devices in her crimes. (Sometimes just a simple as a bag of marbles for a well-timed throw under a pursuing superhero's feet.) She has acquired a variant of the classic \u201cJoker venom,\u201d a chemical concoction able to induce fits of hysterical laughter and, in high enough doses, paralysis or even death, leaving a rictus smile frozen on the victim\u2019s face.Allies and Enemies Allies Enemies Super Young Team  The Super Young Team (Japanese: S\u016bp\u0101yanguch\u012bmu) are a super-team based in Japan. Treated somewhere between a superhero team and a boy band, the Super Young Team are as likely to appear on a Soder-Cola commercial as they are to be found breaking up a bank robbery. To the rest of the world, though, the Super Young Team is viewed the same way they view Japan\u2019s game shows \u2013 a cultural oddity which doesn\u2019t seem to translate well.Activities  Their members are well known by the 8-21 Japanese Demographic - Most Excellent Superbat regularly posts updates on Twitterati, Big Atomic Lantern Boy is the face of an anti-bullying charity and Shy Crazy Lolita Canary currently has a single out.Membership Relationships Enemies Justice League International  Justice League International are an alliance of superheroes pledged to cooperate and aid each other to defeat threats to justice, freedom and humanity bigger than they can deal with individually. Operating from the Justice League Satellite in geosynchronous orbit over Washington D.C., this Justice League is the the most recent of several such alliances of America and the rest of the world's masked vigilantes.History Justice League of America  Originally founded in 1988, the original Justice League of America was a union of the seven most high-profile heroes of the era: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman and Martian Manhunter. Following from the example of the 1940s Justice Society of America the group were originally united when an alien invasion threatened all their home cities individually and it's eventual defeat required their union. They pledged to unite together against threats too big for them to battle alone - first meeting in a cave system in Rhode Island before constructing a satellite headquarters. Several other superheroes joined this league over the years, including Black Canary, Green Arrow and Zatanna; and never was this union more important than in 1992 when the cosmic villain known as the Anti-Monitor plotted to destroy all of creation. Following this event, many founding members of the Justice League (including Superman and Batman) resigned from active duty to concentrate on the rebuilding and the concerns in their own home territories. Aquaman and Martian Manhunter lead a diminished Justice League for some time after, alongside several junior heroes including a young Vixen, the future President Mari McCabe of Zambesi. However, growing anti-metahuman sentiment a botched mission which resulted in the death of two members of the team drained what little enthusiasm remained for the team and it was dissolved shortly thereafter.Justice League International  The Justice League did not stay inactive for long, however, and a new team was formed by U.N. charter thanks to the persuasive arguments (and some skullduggery) of businessman Maxwell Lord. Although several older members were convinced back, including Batman and Martian Manhunter, this league included many junior heroes from around the world and set out to rid itself of the baggage which the word \"America\" had sometimes brought the previous. Fire and Ice, for example, were long-term members from Brazil and Denmark respectively and one of Russia's Rocket Red Brigade was associated with the team on a long term basis. Embassies around the world in major cities like New York and Paris complemented the satellite of the original Leavue This team operated pretty much unchanged until 1998 when it's satellite headquarters was destroyed by an alien invasion. In the ensuing chaos, many members of the this League were rendered inoperable and the original \"big seven\" who founded the JLA came to their aid - though in the case of Green Lantern and Flash, it was the newest inheritors to those titles. A new headquarters located on Earth's moon was built, and a wide membership drive attempted to unite almost all of the world's superheroes under their umbrella. The JLI's demise was visible in 2004 when many high-profile members left following another cosmic crisis - and arguments over how to respond to it between Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. The remaining members tried to help in the chaos of World War III and built a new satellite in an attempt to portray themselves as protectors against interstellar threats but the vicious backlash against masked vigilantes which followed led to the U.N. rescinding the JLI's UN mandate and effectively killing the organisation.The Reformed Justice League  In 2035, Superman was believed to have returned and appeared before the world's media to ask for superheroes to join him in founding a new Justice League. This was in fact a White Martian imposter who wished to bring as many superhumans together in one place so that they could be obliterated in one move. Over a dozen of the new generation of metahumans gathered on the satellite, chief amongst them Superman's son Superman Secundus. The attempted ambush destroyed the old Justice League's headquarters but only killed one metahuman hero thanks to the quick thinking of those heroes aboard. They returned to Earth before the Satellite was destroyed by order of President Lena Luthor - under the Martian's telepathic influence, several of the league had been set up as villains who were plotting from the satellite to endanger the world. Ironically, the White Martian's attempt to destroy the Justice League saw a brand new one form. Taking the title Justice League International once more, operating under a new UN mandate, and with a new satellite base built thanks to contributions from donors such as Wayne-Powers and Adani Energies, this Justice League hopes to carry on the proud tradition of the heroes of the first.Membership  The current membership of the Justice League is as followsActive Members Reserve Members Special Members  The Justice League also has some members who are not on the active duty roster.See Also Characters  Characters in the Justice League International game.Justice League Beyond Vol. 3 Issue 012 Summary Superman  This article is about the superhero Clark Kent. For Christopher Kent, see Superman Secundus TBCHistory  TBCAppearance  TBCPowers  TBCAllies & Enemies Allies  TBCEnemies  TBCDoc Otaku  Doc Otaku is a supervillain based in Tokyo. Having inherited a controlling share in the Takashi Megacorp and thusly possessing huge sums of money and legal protection as one of Japan's oligarchs, Doc Otaku is a criminal driven mostly by boredom and chances to push his mind to the limits, seeking thrills alongside his ever-attentive Angel Androids in their Japanese schoolgirl outfits.History  Solo Takashi was a genius almost from the time he was born. He spoke five languages by the time he was seven years old and earned his first doctorate at the age of 12. He was heir to Takashi Megacorp, a family business that would grant him wealth and effective immunity from prosecution. Unfortunately, Takashi was bored. He lacked challenge and he wanted to have peers, intellectual equals. He also wanted to have some fun. He jumped at the opportunity to study with Professor Quantum, one of the greatest scientific minds in the world. But he quickly decided that Professor Quantum was a scared old man unwilling to take risks or let anyone else take them, either. He didn\u2019t encourage Takashi\u2019s potential, he only tried to limit and control it. He was full of warnings and talk about patience, but Takashi saw the truth: Professor Quantum was jealous of him, like they all were, jealous of his brilliance and potential. When Professor Quantum discovered that Takashi was committing crimes and selling his work to the black market, he confronted the young scientist and gave him a chance to own up to what he had done. That ended their working relationship. Takashi went solo, determined to prove himself the intellectual superior of the inventor and hero. So began the career of Doc Otaku. In the past few years, Doc Otaku has plagued the world with the fruits of his twisted genius, ranging from video games and anime come to life to giant robot monsters rampaging through the streets of Tokyo or Metropolis. His status in Japan makes arresting him difficult, and he's shown that even if he is captured his skills mean that a conventional prison facility has little chance of holding him for long.Appearance  Doc Otaku appears as a normal young Japanese man. His hair is usually styled with gel and he often wears yellow-tinted glasses or goggles. When actively committing crimes, Doc Otaku usually wears a form-fitting bodysuit in black and neon blue.Powers  Doc Otaku is not a metahuman and possesses no reality-defying powers. What he does have is a genius-level intellect with a focus on robotics, cybernetics and similar fields. He is capable of assembling everything from housecat-sized domestic help robots to forty foot mecha battlesuits His equipment almost always has an Anime or Manga theme to it: whether it's the Godzilla-alike giant robots, the swarm of Pokemon-shaped bomb droids or the laser cannons styled after the weapons of this week's coolest manga character.Allies and Enemies Allies Enemies Issues  \"Issues\" of the Justice League Beyond: Really sessions of the roleplaying game, listed in the order they were ran.Volumes  Volumes are issues collected into larger groupings, generally each volume will be one 'season' of the game.Notes Detective Chimp  Detective Chimp is a superheroic member of the genus Pan. Originally a circus exhibit, he gained genius-level intellect by drinking from the Fountain of Youth and now uses his mind to solve crimes.History Secret Origin  Captured in 1953 from Zambesi, a chimpanzee was taken by Fred Thorpe to become part of his carnival act: \"Bobo The Detective Chimp\", trained to recognise hand signals by his human master so that he might give the illusion of solving simple detective scenarios for paying customers. Life was simple and, for the most part, good for this chimpanzee. Then he was surprisingly broken out of confinement by another talking animal, who took him to where he gained his powers:the secret Fountain of Youth. Not only did sipping from it's pure waters give the Chimpanzee an unaging body, it also granted him a keen intellect - putting him not just at human level, but at the highest tier of that status. He no longer solved simple carnival tricks - he was actually able to deduce a visitor had murdered her own sister.Rise & Fall  Detective Chimp (although his \"real\" name, in Chimpanzee, translates as \"Magnificent Finder of Tasty Grubs\") left the circus on the death of his owner and set up a detective agency, becoming something of a celebrity - but his lack of legal status (a chimpanzee cannot give evidence in court, nor can he chase unpaid bills) made life hard for him. Eventually he become a barfly at The Oblivion Bar, a magical dive which he entered and then stayed for a very long time.Return  Detective Chimp finally emerged from his decades-long drinking binge and returned to work proper, and despite everything his supernaturally keen intellect remained undampened. (His IQ has been ranked above the 98th percentile of the human population) His detective skills rival that of the original Batman and, in a post-splicing world, his legal status may no longer be an issue. (He has finally been able to join the Republican Party) He is currently the chairman of the Justice League International and the de facto field commander.Appearance  Detective Chimp is, in physical appearance, identical to an adult male chimpanzee in his prime. However, his dress his distinctive: a deerstalker, coat and other props clearly inspired by Sherlock Holmes.Powers  From drinking from the Fountain of Youth, Detective Chimp gained an ageless life. The magic gave him other powers beyond just making him immortal bar violence, however: he gained an enhanced intellect which would equal a human genius and a gift of communication, able to speak to all animals. With the aid of his enhanced mind, he has trained to become one of the finest detectives in the world. In addition, Chimpanzees are naturally much stronger than humans and Detective Chimp is no exception.Relationships Allies Enemies Zachary Zatara  Zachary Zatara, son of Zatanna Zatara and John Constantine, is a popular stage magician with strong ties to the superhero and occult community. He is currently a member of the Justice League International.History Early History  Zachary's parents were never married and generally only met periodically. Zachary was raised by his mother, Zatanna.Showbusiness Career  Zachary took over the same day job as his mother: that of a stage magician. He is a regular fixture in Las Vegas and periodically performs around the world for exorbitant sums. In his capacity as a magician he is something of a celebrity, a modern-day David Copperfield or Penn & Teller.Appearance  Zachary is generally seen in one of two outfits. His \"work clothes\" both in Vegas and with the League is similar to the outfit of his mother; a classic stage magician outfit with top hat, waistcoat and black-and-white magic wand. However, when relaxing he is more likely to be seen dressing like his father, in a trenchcoat and sunglasses with a roll-up cigarette in his mouth.Powers  Zachary was trained in magic from an early age and can cast spells in his mother's distinctive idiom - by reciting something backwards, he can achieve almost any effect imaginable. He can disarm people by shouting \"Srewolf otni snug nrut\"; attack bank robbers with an utterance of \"Seveiht no niar dica\"; and get himself ready for a gig by saying, \"Sehtolc krow\". Zachary also knows a smattering of other magical styles, including a more overtly occult pentagrams-and-blood style as sometimes practised by his father. With enough time and preparation, he can research out and cast pretty much any spell. Zachary is also trained at more mundane \"magic tricks\"; that is, the sleight of hand of a Las Vegas stage magician. While he spices his act up with real incantations his skills make him excellent at deception, reading audiences and palming small objects without being seen.Allies and Enemies Allies Enemies  TBCJustice League Beyond Vol. 3 Issue 013 Summary Details Superboy-Prime  This article is about the supervillain from Earth-Prime. For Superman as a teenager, see Superman Superboy-Prime is one of the most powerful supervillains known. A Kryptonian from a world without superheroes, his world was destroyed in a cross-reality disaster and he believes the world he finds himself in now to be a crude facsimile that must be \"corrected\".History Early Life  Superboy-Prime is from the universe known as Earth Prime, in which the heroes of the Justice League's universe are fictional comic book characters. He is the adopted son of Jerry and Naomi Kent. Naomi wanted to name their infant son Clark, after her maiden name, but Jerry, knowing he will also be named like Superman, a fictional comic book character, initially refused, but finally gave in. What the Kents do not know is that the baby, found abandoned in a forest, is actually a young Kal-El, who has been teleported to Earth by his father Jor-El moments before the planet Krypton was destroyed when its red sun went supernova. His parents were unable to escape that way due to a member of the Kryptonian council bursting into the room and using the device, although it is unknown what happened to him. Young Clark lives the first fifteen years of his life as a normal boy. However one night as he attends a Halloween costume party dressed as Superboy, the passage of Halley's Comet overhead triggers his Kryptonian powers. Superboy-Prime uses his newfound powers to stop a tidal wave.The Crisis & Aftermath  Superboy-Prime was drawn into a interdimensional Crisis after his universe was consumed in the light of the Anti-Monitor. Although the loss of everything he knows causes him anguish, he finds peace in knowing that he fights the good fight alongside other heroes. During the final battle against the Anti-Monitor, another Earth's Superman orders him to escape with Alexander Luthor and the other heroes. Fearing that Superman will die in battle and knowing the new Earth is not his true home, Superboy-Prime joined in the fight against the Anti-Monitor. After the destruction of the Anti-Monitor, Superboy-Prime joined Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-Three and a Superman and Lois Lane in a \"paradise dimension\". In the \"paradise dimension\", Superboy-Prime secludes himself from the others, using crystals to replay events from his life on Earth Prime. Superboy-Prime becomes frustrated and angry, and he tries to reach out to Superman, whose attention is focused on Lois' failing health. Alexander comes to believe that the reason behind Lois' failing health is the paradise dimension itself, and persuades Superboy-Prime to help him return to reality by showing Superboy-Prime the negative aspects of the post-Crisis Earth. Superboy-Prime hesitates until he overhears Superman say: \"I wish this world would let him grow up. He'll never be Superman here\". Finally, Alexander showed him the deaths of his parents and girlfriend in a car accident on the post-Crisis EarthA New Crisis  Eventually, Alexander reveals to Superboy-Prime that his powers are returning, and the two combine forces to break through the barrier wall. Together, they set into motion the events that culminate in a new crisis: both magical, technological and interstellar threats are deployed as well as organising Earth's criminals into a new Secret Society of Super Villains. Superboy-Prime reconciles this plan by arguing that: \"When the universe was reborn, what used to be Earth-One became the primary world. The scraps of the remaining worlds were folded into it. But I finally realized \u2014 we saved the wrong Earth\" Superboy-Prime is jealous of Conner Kent, the modern Superboy, believing him to be living the life he himself ought to have had. He also believes the Earth's heroes act more like villains with their grimmer ways than the comics characters he remembers from the early 80s. Superboy-Prime confronts Superboy, telling him that he (Superboy-Prime) is the only Superboy the Earth needs. Superboy-Prime brutally attacks Conner, but not before Connor activates his Titans homing signal. The Teen Titans, the Doom Patrol, and the Justice Society of America arrive to help Conner. After accidentally killing a hero with a decapitating punch, Superboy-Prime is shocked and horrified. The heroes try to contain Superboy-Prime, who kills or wounds several of them and all the while blaming them for \"making me as bad as you are.\" Alexander Luthor's plan fell apart and Superboy-Prime was captured - but not until a trail of destruction that includes Connor Kent's death and that of the Superman who had accompanied him into the paradise dimension. Superboy-Prime was then taken into the custody of the Green Lantern Corp, who place him in a quantum containment field, guarded by fifty Green Lanterns. While inside his cell, he carved the Superman symbol into his chest and swore revenge.Sinestro Corp  A couple of years later, the newly-founded Sinestro Corps attacked Oa and freed Superboy-Prime from his imprisonment. He was recruited into their number and wore the uniform of the Sinestro Corps. He joined the Corp in attacking Earth and battled a large group of heroes. However, his allegiance proves temporary and he ended up battling both the Sinestro Corps and Green Lantern Corps, until a Guardian willingly sacrificed himself to destroy Superboy-Prime. Superboy-Prime's body was not found. after this incident. It is theorised that, instead of dying, Prime was infused with Oan energy and warped somewhere else.Prime Evils  Superboy-Prime interdimensional travels somehow took him to Phratil, an alternate universe which behaved in the fashion of a fantasy novel or computer game complete with Elves, Dwarves and Orcs. Here he met a kindred spirit - Rundar the Uncanny-Prime\u200f\u200e, a man whose story was much the same as his. Rundar had played a virtual reality computer game called Dungeons and Dragons only to end up within the world itself and foudn the heroes he'd once idolised wanting and been imprisoned within a sun for trying to usurp them. Combining Superboy's Kryptonian powers with Rundar's magical artefacts, the two attempted to find their way back to get revenge on the Justice League. Trapped by the interdimensional locks within the Warp Zone, it was only when The Flusher harnessed the power at the heart of that strange realm that they were able to escape. Once returned they plotted their attack and, on Hero Day, viciously assaulted and killed Superman Secundus before kidnapping The Flusher and taking him to the Fortress of Solitude, to which they broke into. They also destabilised the orbit of the Justice League Satellite to try and tie the superheroes up so they could interfere in the next stage of their plan.Appearance  Superboy-Prime strongly resembles a young Clark Kent/Superman: often complete with the distinctive spit-curl on his forehead. However, there is a somewhat unhinged look in his eye and more often than not a smug grin or bitter scowl which looks out of place on the face of Superman. Originally he wore a Superman costume identical to the classic, blue suit/red cape design. Following his capture by the Green Lantern Corp, he burnt his Superman symbol into his chest with his heat vision. While working with the Sintestro Corp, Superboy-Prime wore a suit of armour with the Sinestro Corp's logo on his chest.Powers  Superboy-Prime has a broad range of powers brought about by his Kryptonian physiology: while exposed to the rays of a yellow sun, he is able to photosynthesise that energy and use it for a variety of exceptional gifts: Superboy-Prime's powers have grown as he has aged and been exposed to more and more sunlight; increasing far faster than the same process works in Superman Secundus. In theory, his powers could grow to Superman's level and beyond in time. This may include developing additional powers. Superboy-Prime's powers fade if he finds himself under the glare of red sunlight, including if simulated technologically - again, this process occurs much faster than in \"normal\" Kryptonians. He also finds his powers fading if exposed to Green Kryptonite, and the radiation from that rock is fatal if large doses are exposed over a prolonged period of time. In addition to the above weakness, Superboy-Prime's invulnerability does not protect him from magic. Spells and enchanted items bypass his normal hardiness, though the rest of his powers remain intact.Allies & Enemies Allies Enemies Shy Crazy Lolita Canary  Shy Crazy Lolita Canary (or Kureij\u012bshairor\u012btakanar\u012b) is a member of the Super Young Team.History  Since developing her unusual powers, Shy Crazy Lolita Canary has embraced the media attention and regularly courts the press' attention. She is known as a party girl, able to consume a surprising amount of alcohol despite her size. Her most recent attempt to cash in on her powers has seen her release a single.Appearance  Shy Crazy Lolita Canary appears as a human being approximately one foot tall with feathered wings. She is usually found wearing a Japanese Sailor Moon-esque schoolgirl outfit, with her blonde hair in pigtails.Powers  Shy Crazy Lolita Canary's unique appearance brings several advantages. She is capable of flight slightly faster than a normal human's foot speed and her slight frame allows her to easily dodge attacks. Despite her small size, Shy Crazy Lolita Canary has a shatteringly loud voice which sounds like many, many voices all mashed up together. This has been likened to the sound of every shopgirl in Tokyo bellowing \"SUMIMASEN!\" at the top of their voices for as long as they can.Allies and Enemies Allies Enemies  TBATakashi Megacorp  Takashi Megacorp is one of Japan's largest companies, based in Tokyo. It is currently headed by Solo Takashi, who uses its funds and scientific know-how to aid him in his supervillain career as Doc Otaku while hiding behind its corporate power to escape punishment. Takashi Megacorp are particularly known for computer software and consumer electronics.White Knight  White Knight is a racist supervillain, convinced that he has been possessed by \u201cthe spirit of America\u201d to \"clean the country of the filth of liberalism\". White Knight's distinctive Ku Klux Klan styled outfit makes his vile beliefs obvious. His attacks are almost always politically motivated, whether it's burning down mosques or attacking gay politicians.History Origin  Daniel Foreman loved and honored his family. They raised him right and taught him the truth that the government, the schools, and the liberal media refused to show. His family taught Daniel about the destiny of the white race and how the bleeding hearts wanted to convince everyone that all people are equal, even when that obviously wasn\u2019t true. Weren\u2019t the slums full of blacks and Hispanics? Why would they be there if they weren\u2019t as stupid as his father said? Wasn\u2019t AIDS killing the queers? Why would they be dying if not because they were so hopelessly perverted? The Jews controlled the banks and influenced the media, making it look like Hitler was the villain when trying to exterminate the mongrel races was about the only thing he did right. Dan grew up hating everyone who wasn\u2019t like him. He particularly learned to hate the supers, most of whom were dupes of the Zionist-run liberal government. Worse yet, some were even from the mongrel races and probably thought their powers made them better than decent white folk. Where were the real heroes to show people the truth? Where was the true hero of the white race? Dan wondered that all throughout his childhood, but the hero he hoped for didn\u2019t appear. As an adult, Dan ended up working as a security guard for a department store until his boss fired him when Dan rousted and threatened a black patron. Dan proceeded to go out and get drunk, ignorant of what was going on around him. It was clear to him that his old employer was just like everywhere else\u2014run by the mongrel races and with no place for a real man. That\u2019s when the stranger approached Dan and offered him his card. He had an offer, one Dan didn\u2019t believe, so why refuse? He said Daniel Foreman could become the true hero of the white race, if he really wanted it. Dan isn\u2019t sure what happened, only that he found his way home and passed out. He woke up to find his bedroom in flames! He panicked for a moment, but realized the fire didn\u2019t hurt him or the new clothes he was wearing. In fact, the flames made him feel purer and stronger than ever. He realized the vision he had was real. He had the power and then he knew. The purifying fire of God had touched him, and made him into the hero the world needed. He was the chosen one who would purify the Earth with fire\u2014the White Knight.Personality  White Knight is a twisted and sociopathic personality who considers everyone his inferior, particularly anyone who isn\u2019t white, male, heterosexual, and doesn\u2019t fit his extremely narrow view of a \u201cgood\u201d Protestant Christian. He\u2019s a classic bully\u2014overbearing and threatening towards thoseweaker than him, but outwardly subservient to those more powerful while secretly plotting revenge against them too. Dan dropped out of high school \u201csince they weren\u2019t teaching me anything I needed to know,\u201d but considers himself very intelligent although he\u2019s woefully ignorant or misinformed on many issues. He\u2019s a complete fanatic about his cause, and considers all efforts to sway him from it trickery and deception. White Knight\u2019s tactics are plain and simple: blast through anything that gets in his way. If it doesn\u2019t fall, blast it again until it does. He does have some cunning in battle and he\u2019s willing to fight dirty in order to win. That includes threatening members of the \u201cmongrel races\u201d that his opponents are so fond of protecting. For example, he\u2019ll gladly collapse an apartment building to give heroes a distraction while he escapes or prepares another attack.Appearance  Out of costume, White Knight has an archetypal blonde hair, blue eyed \"Aryan Male\" look. He is rarely seen out of costume, however, because when battling he is dressed in a Ku Klux Klan outfit with a white hood and black jackboots. After a battle with Zachary Zatara, Daniel was transformed into a short, black male. This transformation persisted several months later but was eventually removed.Powers  The magic that infuses White Knight grants him control over fire and heat. He has a halo of fire that burns around him, and he can focus this energy to shoot searing flame bolts. He is also gifted with enhanced strength, stamina and the ability to fly.Allies and Enemies Allies  TBCEnemies Justice League Beyond Vol. 2 Issue 008  Maxine and Ginny have a barbecue at their home for the League members. Everyone is in costume but Dream provides the illusion of a giant marquee to provide some privacy from the neighbours. It's busy with only a few absentees, Steel Shiva had urgent business in Japan and Das Ritter Von Nacht stayed on monitor duty, and people are having a good time. The Flusher has a problem with the strictly vegetarian fare. An attempt to teleport in something meatier is interrupted by Krypto who wants some as well. An emergency message comes down from the Satellite, a hostage situation had developed at Professor Quantum's base on The Moon. Superman Secundus mentions that a fellow reporter from the Daily Planet was there doing an interview. After a sunny day and many beers only a few League members are ready to respond to the call. Living Statue would like to help but XXX \u2013 ship name 1 has not been upgraded yet to take his large frame and extra mass. In the end it's down to Superman Secundus, Animal Woman, The Flusher, and Zachary Zatara. Animal Woman pilots the ship to the Moon where Zach delights in confusing the robot sent to greet them. Inside the base are many rooms filled with strange equipment and experiments. In one the Japanese villain Sexy Ruby Joker Girl holds the reporter, Lucas Messam, on a catwalk near a vat of swirling blue-grey goo. She is demanding Nth Metal from Professor Quantum who is held by some goons inexpertly dressed as clowns. Now that the Justice League is here that's not going to happen. The Flusher uses a portal and taps into the tank of goo. He hoses down the goons with the unknown fluid which starts eating away at whatever it touches. Their guns dribble to the floor and they start throwing off their dissolving clothes. Joker Girl is unperturbed and uses a joke flower on her jacket to squirt Lucas in the face with a clear liquid. He jerks backwards, hit the handrail, and flips over falling into the vat below. His scream is cut short. Superman tries to fish him out using an improvised hook without success. Zach uses his magic to transform the fluid into harmless spring water. While the team is distracted Joker Girl throws out a bag full of marbles to trip them up and makes an escape towards the hanger and her shuttle. Animal Woman chases and grabs at her braided green hair but ends up holding a wig and nothing else. In the lab Professor Quantum is confused by a small amount of goo left in the water. Apparently the tank had been filled with unprogrammed experimental nanites and was cleared by Zach's spell. However what remains is different, the nanites contain a large inactive program he has not seen before. The team is not keen to experiment with this but the professor activates the program anyway. The goo boils up into a cloud then swirls, condenses, and reforms into an intact reporter. While the team are shocked Lucas just wonders what happened to Joker Girl. The League members decided to return to the Satellite to investigate this further. While a brief physical suggests that Lucas is normal a more detailed examination reveals the truth. Superman's microscopic vision can discern the billions of tiny robots that now make up Lucas's body. Saturn Girl tries to use her mind powers to gently break the news that he had died and is now just a simulation of his previous self. However mental powers don't seem to work on nanites. Eventually they show him the video of his struggle over the vat. Lucas remains surprisingly calm, saying that he feels fine. He is briefly assign to guest quarters to rest until Zach decides to take him to the training room to see what he can do. When Animal Woman finds out she's angry at this breach of protocol. Meanwhile Zach is shaken when, after a particular hard blow from one of the training robots, he see Lucas dissolve into fog before reforming unharmed. The Flusher helps Animal Woman contact the Super Young Team to arrange a meeting and help deal with Sexy Ruby Joker Girl. Lucas asks to come along to cover the story. They discover that Japan is much more superhero-friendly with fans at the airport and crowding the central square where they meet Most Excellent Superbat. He introduces his friends to the League, \"He shoots energy, she can summon hard water, he has super speed, she shouts super-loud and I'm so rich I can do anything.\" Animal Woman thinks it'll be hard to do anything with so many fans around. The Flusher impresses Superbat with the suggestion of crowd-sourcing their search for the villain. A short Twitterati post with the offer of tickets to Lolita Canary's latest concert produces the location of a recent car-jacking. They head off in the Wonder Wagon which turns out to be not just a car but a flying car.Batman (Bruce Wayne)  This article is about the Batman of 1985. For other uses, see the disambiguation page. TBCHistory  TBCAppearance  TBCPowers  TBCRelationships Allies  TBCEnemies  TBCAquagirl  Aquagirl is the third in line to the throne of Atlantis. Daughter of Aquaman, she is famous as a princess and ambassador of Altantis; a socialite and infamous party girl; and a reserve member of the Justice League InternationalHistory  Daughter of Aquaman, king of all the ocean, and second in line to the throne of the kingdom of Atlantis, Marina has had something of a sheltered upbringing. While the surface was recovering from the ravages of World War III, deep underwater her land was mostly immune to the battle and she had no want for anything. As with most Atlanteans, she was wary of the surface dwellers and gave them little thought during her childhood. As she reached her adolescent years, though, Marina found herself without much of a purpose: her elder brother Garth would inherit the throne, and she desired something more than waving at crowds to pass her days. As with all teenagers, she pushed her family's limits and dabbled in things almost purposefully to annoy her father... but unlike most families, hers had a history of superheroism, and nothing would grate on her father more than fighting on the surface as he had once done. Marina has managed to convince her father to give her the role as ambassador to the United States of America, giving her a coastal abode that is both above and below surface - as well as access to her own private submarine and a squad to crew it. Because of Atlantis' isolationist policy, though, she has little to do formally - instead, it puts her right on the surface to fight crime for the thrill of it.Appearance  Marina has an air of breeding about her; her features making her royal lineage clear. She has platinum blonde hair and a slight tinge to her skin that marks her as obviously not a human. When serving with the League, Marina prefers a traditional superhero costume formed out of a green diving suit. She also has access to Atlantean armour to protect her in particularly dangerous combat situations.Powers  Marina is not as well-trained as her father ever was, but her Atlantean physique does have it's advantages - she is much stronger than a human of her size would be, can communicate with sea creatures (even commanding them to do her bidding) and her amphibious form lets her breathe underwater and swim as fast a a speedboat. Marina's foreign physiology is also her biggest weakness, though - she cannot survive indefinitely above land and must return to the ocean regularly lest she become seriously sick - prolonged absence would kill her. She is also a highly public figure, with the very opposite of a secret identity, but with the perks and influence of a woman of power in a nation that covers three fifths of the world's surface.Relationships Allies Enemies Animal Woman  Animal Woman is an American superhero with the ability to channel the powers of animals.History Pre-Superpowers  Maxine Baker's father, Buddy Baker, was a superhuman who operated under the title of Animal Man. He worked alongside the Justice League, championed animal rights and even had what he called a \"religious experience\" in which he claimed to have contact with higher powers. Maxine's father was active for several decades until his powers mysteriously vanished in the early 21st century (see \"The Last Days of Animal Man\" by Gerry Conway).The Secret Origin Of Animal Woman  When Buddy died as an old man, Maxine was at his death bed. Seemingly hallucinating and thinking of his youthful superheroic exploits, he pointed over the shoulder of Maxine and said, \"Can't you see, Maxine? This isn't my ending they're watching... it's your beginning.\" Following this, Maxine began having odd dreams in which she saw beings like those her father had called \"Yellow Aliens\": the beings who had given him his powers in the first place. As these dreams continued her powers became more and more pronounced until she was at least the equal of her father.Superheroic Career  At first she struggled to fit the demands of her alter-ego into her personal and social life, and initially restricted her crime fighting to the San Diego area. In the present day, however, she has achieved a better work/home balance and has joined the reformed Justice League International.Appearance  Animal Woman is a well built woman of 48. Her costume is similar to that of her father's, consisting of a loose-fitting orange jumpsuit with large stylised blue A on the front, blue boots and gloves, blue leather jacket with lots of pockets, and blue goggles. She wears her long blonde hair tied back in a high ponytail.Powers  Animal Woman has the power to tap into the Morphogenetic Field of whatever planet she is on in order to gain the powers of any living animal. While channelling the life force of her chosen animal she is subject to all its strengths and weaknesses. She can only channel one animal at a time, but can switch between animals freely if she chooses. Powers Animal Woman has so far used include strength of the gorilla, flight of the eagle, scent of the bloodhound, reproduction of the amoeba, charge of the rhino, musk of the hyena, resilience of the cockroach, constriction of the snake and speed of the cheetah.Relationships Allies  Animal Woman has previously worked with Metamorpho and Dolphin. Animal Woman's brother, Cliff Baker, is a lawyer who is always on hand to help with legal issues.Enemies  Animal Woman has no recurring enemies at present.Personality  Animal Woman is a cheerful and friendly individual, and is always trying to help others - especially those new to the Justice League. Like her father Buddy, she strongly believes that she has an obligation to use her powers for good and is passionate about the causes she believes in.Personal Life  Animal Woman\u2019s Civil Partner Ginny Germanotta is by far and away the most important person in her life, and she treasures the time they get to spend at home together. Although they often argue about the amount of time they have to spend apart, they have been deeply in love since they were teenagers and always manage to patch things up. Animal Woman has worked on behalf of various animal charities in the past, including PETA, and is known for her outspoken beliefs on animal rights. She is a strict vegetarian. Although her identity is mostly secret, those in her immediate social circle know of her heroic exploits, as do her employers and colleagues at the University.Most Excellent Superbat  Most Excellent Superbat (or Saiy\u016bsh\u016b S\u016bp\u0101batto) is a member of the Super Young Team.History  Most Excellent Superbat is the founder and leader of the Super Young Team and has used his wealth to help cultivate their contacts and get the media exposure required to make them a Japanese mega-brand.Appearance  Most Excellent Superbat's outfit takes inspiration from both Superman and Batman. His blue helmet, gloves and cape are a nod to the latter: the red outfit with yellow patterns a sign of the former. (The yellow patterns appear random at first but, on closer inspection, are the \"negative space\" shapes from Superman's crest.) Even more so than the other members of the Super Young Team, who are all pretty and young-looking, Most Excellent Superbat is stunning in a Bish\u014dnen way. He regularly tops any poll amongst Japan's youth for the sexist superhero, with girls swooning over a man where the only part of his body they can see uncovered they can see is his perfect cheekbones.Powers  Much like the Batman from whom he takes the latter half of his name, Superbat has no powers. (Though he has commented that his superpower is, \"I'm so rich I can do anything.\") He appears to use an array of gadgets, one of which can generate an energy-based exoskeleton, he also appears to have some training in the martial arts. His secret island base is called the \"Most Serene Sanctuary\" and contains a supercomputer he calls a \"unified data field\" which is only accessible when he meditated himself into a calm theta rhythm state Most Excellent Superbat owns the Wonder Wagon, the Super Young Team's vehicle.Allies and Enemies Allies Enemies Big Atomic Lantern Boy  Big Atomic Lantern Boy (or Biggu Genshi Rantanb\u014di) is a member of the Super Young Team.History  A fan of the Green Lantern Corp since he was a child Big Atomic Lantern Boy was given a harness by Most Excellent Superbat which allowed him to join the Super Young Team as their Green Lantern equivalent.Appearance  Big Atomic Lantern Boy is a big man, usually found wearing a yellow trenchcoat with Green Lantern symbols on either side. His hair is shaved with a single cowlick, dyed green. Big Atomic Lantern Boy's harness has a green porthole in the middle which permanently shows a green-coloured X-ray image of his chest.Powers  Big Atomic Lantern Boy's harness is the source of his powers. He can project energy blasts, utilise a scanning array that feeds into Most Excellent Super Bat's handheld computer and also has a hologram projection array for video conferencingAllies and Enemies Allies Enemies  TBAStub Power Woman  Power Woman is a female Kryptonian superhero. Her abilities include incredible super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, flight and heat-visionHistory  QQQAppearance  Power Woman appears as a middle-aged blonde woman with a powerful physique, as though she was a female body-builder. Some have likened her appearance to that of a \"human wrecking ball\", unlike other superheroes whose super-strength is not always reflected in their muscleature. Power Woman wears a white outfit with a circle cut out in the middle of her chest. She wears a red cape attached to her neck by a golden cord.Powers  Power Woman has a broad range of powers brought about by her Kryptonian physiology: while exposed to the rays of a yellow sun, she is able to photosynthesise that energy and use it for a variety of exceptional gifts: Power Woman's powers fade if she finds herself under the glare of red sunlight, including if simulated technologically. She can also find her powers fading if exposed to Green Kryptonite, and the radiation from that rock is fatal if large doses are exposed over a prolonged period of time. In addition to the above weakness, Power Woman's invulnerability does not protect her from magic. Spells and enchanted items bypass her normal hardiness, though the rest of her powers remain intact.Allies & Enemies Allies Enemies  TBA", "Robloxnrpgbeyond Wiki": "Robloxnrpgbeyond Wiki ", "Valanceandbeyond Wiki": "Valanceandbeyond Wiki ", "AR$ Big Brother Wiki": "AR$ Big Brother Wiki ", "Leah's Big Brother Wiki": "Leah's Big Brother Wiki ", "Gwelliano's Big Brother Wiki": "Gwelliano's Big Brother Wiki ", "AJC Broadcast Sims Big Brother Wiki": "AJC Broadcast Sims Big Brother Wiki ", "Tyler's Season One Of Big Brother Wiki": "Tyler's Season One Of Big Brother Wiki ", "JTs Big Brother Wiki": "JTs Big Brother Wiki ", "Kalex's Discord Big Brother Wiki": "Kalex's Discord Big Brother Wiki ", "\ud83c\udf54Burger Big Brother\ud83c\udf54 Wiki": "\ud83c\udf54Burger Big Brother\ud83c\udf54 Wiki ", "Hayden's Sims Big Brother Wiki": "Hayden's Sims Big Brother Wiki ", "Endurance Big Brother Wiki": "Endurance Big Brother Wiki ", "NLT Big Brother Wiki": "NLT Big Brother Wiki ", "Yag's Big Brother Wiki": "Yag's Big Brother Wiki ", "Sim Big Brother Wiki": "Sim Big Brother Wiki ", "Pauls discord big brother Wiki": "Pauls discord big brother Wiki ", "Pauls Big Brother Wiki": "Pauls Big Brother Wiki ", "Lucas Cavalieri big brother Wiki": "Lucas Cavalieri big brother Wiki ", "VC's Big Brother Wiki": "VC's Big Brother Wiki ", "Margaux's Big Brother Wiki": "Margaux's Big Brother Wiki ", "Dream Lake~Big Brother Wiki": "Dream Lake~Big Brother Wiki ", "Bloxburg Big Brother Wiki": "Bloxburg Big Brother Wiki ", "Venerable Big Brother Wiki": "Venerable Big Brother Wiki ", "Hay Day Wiki": "Hay Day Wiki ", "Wiki Hay Day": "Wiki Hay Day ", "Hay Day 2 Wiki": "Hay Day 2 Wiki ", "Daily Dirt Wiki": "Daily Dirt Wiki ", "Monaco: Whats Yours Is Mine Wiki": "Monaco: Whats Yours Is Mine Wiki ", "Spore Fan Fiction Wiki": "Spore Fan Fiction Wiki Spore Fan Fiction Wiki Community Projects  We currently have one major community project, The Galactic Senate Special Operations Corp.

The Allied Senate meets for the first time on the T3 Bingfish Homeworld of Ekstangel. They broadcast the Declaration of Galactic Freedom over all channels to whomever may listen. Makir Elehur of Ekstangel, the former Emporer of Ekstangel is elected Prime Minister of the Confederacy.Day 43 Great Horned Dragon Empire  \u00a0 (Pre-Grox)The Great Horned Dragon Empire is the second most powerful empire known by them, following the Grox. Spanning over 150 systems large and in 5 different parts of the Galaxy, their empire is the dominant authority, leaving no enemies standing except the Grox. The society is over 2 million years old, starting count at the dawn of the earliest known tribal civilizations. The warrior society is allied to many other nations including: the Flitt Empire, the Minor Empire, the Ferniki Empire, and many more. This galactic view map is from the era before the Grox Wars, just after the start of the first genocide, the empire is divided into 8 Sectors, which are then divided into clusters. By the time the Grox were destroyed, the empire had expanded across much of the center of the galaxy, and held over 400 star systems.Culture and Society Government  The government of the massive empire is a Republic Federation. Due to the massive number of systems, and even more so the distance between clusters of colonies, a central government is incredibly hard to maintain. Individual systems posses their own government and laws. The official governmental system is set up by King Kahhn in his written Kahhn Articles. This form of government is even kept in the eight age by the Galactic Imperial Alliance; the only difference is that religion plays a much larger role and unbelievers are never in positions of high authority. Those in seats of power still answer to the one God, and never refuse to listen to those who are held to be prophets or saints.Flags  The first flag that the empire uses is the GHD Imperial Federation flag (right). This flag was flown up until the end of the 5th age when the Grox were destroyed and the Galactic Federation was formed. During the reign of Tyranis, a new flag was flown but to date, no files describing the flag exist. The Flag of the Galactic Federation (left) was flown by the Galactic Federation up until their assimilation into the Alliance in the eight age. During the eight age, several other flags were flown by the many micro-nations that formed from the ruins of the Federation, and only those that remained in constant communication with the Galactic Federation flew this flag. The Alliance flag was flown by the Galactic Imperial Alliance since their formation. Some still fly the Galactic Federation Flag, but for the most part, the Galactic Imperial Alliance is the dominant power.Anatomy  The GHD (Great Horned Dragon) race calls themselves Dragons for short. They are a fairly tall species, averaging 7' in height, and weighing an average of 240 lbs. at moderate fitness levels. Naturally they posses up to 14 elongated horns, about 3' in length, down their backs, hence their official name. Normally however, these horns are kept trimmed down to a mere 2 or 3 inches. They have scales and are a variety of colors, the four most common colors are: green with red backs, blue with green backs, black with blue backs, and an ashy gray with red backs. They have wings that span on average 7'6\", but can easily go as low as 4' and as large as 12'. Their species wingspan has been on a constant decline since sometime late in global civilization, mainly due to the fact that naturally, they are unnecessary. In tribal ages, fossils show wingspans were up to 20'. Their tails average 6' in length. They have four fingered, one thumbed claws, usually no more than 2' in length. They have 10' snouts filled with 80 razor sharp partially retractable teeth, the incisors of which can grow up to 2 inches in length. They have typical lizard tongues. They stand on two three clawed feet, in an upright humanoid stance. They have cat-like eyes, and several frills which vary in length depending on gender, genetics, and continue to grow until around the age of 80. They appear almost like hair, due to their volume and thickness, except for their color and texture. Their species is one of very very few known cold-blooded, reptilian-attributed, mammals. Their legs are very strong, and structured like that of a t-rex, except more upright. They have complete control over their tails. They are capable of pronouncing over a million sounds, which makes them some of the galaxies most profound polyglots. Most of their race is medium to high fitness level, very little fat, as they are carnivores. Although they can stand other foods, they have absolutely no taste for them. A typical dragon diet consists of about 3000 calories, which typically can get burned between meals, and 25 grams of protein (normally measured in milligrams) per meal, at four meals every regular earth day. They sleep only 4 hours per every 24 hours, and when they do, their bodies remain fully active. Their elbows are double jointed, allowing for insane hand to hand combat. They can live on average up to 280 Nierdroan years. On average a dragon's kick can exert enough force to break reinforced steel. And their scales protect them from most unintentional cuts. Their bones are made of an iron-quartz composite material. There are several different scale colors for dragons. The most common is predominantly green with red parts. Different color shemes are also associated with slightly varying chromosones and some dragons are inherently stronger than others. The weakest muscle density due to genetics is associated with predominantly black scales and some blue parts, while some of the strongest are predominantly black or red with red or black parts. The absolute strongest, and rarest, is to have predominantly red scales with blue parts. The strength difference between them is very small in most cases.Social Classes  As far as the GHD Imperial Federation goes, the social classes are as follows: War Heroes Military Officials Other Officials Weapon Engineers (Design weapons and war vehicles and ships) Religious and Scientific Leaders Historically Wealthy Merchants Production Workers Historically Disgraced (Ancestry known for some kind of disgrace) Disgraced Outcasts This social structure gradually changes as the ages grow closer and closer to the final extermination of the Grox. When the Galactic Federation is formed, all different races apart of the Federation have their own social classes, but over time, as the Galactic Civil War becomes reality, War Heroes become the most respected. In the eighth age, when the Galactic Imperial Alliance forms, a significant trend in social structure is seen, and it goes as follows: Prophets Saints, Martyrs, and others who are made legendary for fighting for God Paladins, and Knights fighting on behalf of the church; separated from soldiers because Paladins and Knights are individually sanctified for combat, and are otherwise freelancers Soldiers who give their lives for the well being of the empire and the church Priests, and preachers who spread the word of God All followers of God, foreign or not Unbelievers, though those who still support the Alliance are more highly respected Blasphemers, Heretics, and those who actively speak against GodGreat Horned Dragon Imperial Federation, the Galactic Federation, and the Galactic Imperial Alliance Military Ranks  At the top is the Supreme Commander and Grand Admiral of the Armed Forces (Grand Admiral for short). The Grand Admiral's icon is customized. Beyond what is listed, there is also a single royal army and royal armada, with ranks up to Admiral 1st Class and General, that serve the descendants of the royal family, and by extension, important political figureheads. They're icons are the same, but all gold colored. Badge images can be found  here.Grand Admiral's Personnel  Minor Admiral- Decides where all forces will be placed about the empire (in co-ordinance with other minor admirals), automatically in charge wherever present, with the exception of the Grand Admiral, and an Arch-General. Icon: Gold Dragon Wings Surrounding Silver Shield, 6 Gold Stars Circling Top Half, 1 Gold Star Inscribed in Shield, 6 Gold Claws at Bottom Elite Lieutenant- Second in Command on the Grand Admiral's warship. Icon: Gold Dragon Wings, Silver Outlined, 6 Gold Claws, Silver Outlined Elite Captain- In charge of different parts of the Grand Admiral's Warship. Icon: Gold Dragon Wings, Silver Outlined Elite Sergeant- Head of a group of Marines/Elite Personnel/Elite Privateers on the Grand Admiral's warship. Icon: Silver Dragon Wings, Gold Outlined Marine- Marines serve in either spec. ops as ordered by Arch-General, Minor Admiral, or Grand Admiral. They are also the specialized soldiers on the Grand Admiral's warship. Icon: 6 Gold Claws, Silver Outlined Elite Personnel- Engineers, Physicians, and other specialists that serve on the Grand Admiral's warship. Icon: 4 Silver Claws, Gold Outlined Elite Privateers- Primary soldiers on board the Grand Admiral's warship. Icon: 2 Silver Claws, Gold OutlinedThe Armada  6-Star Admiral- Head of an entire sector's armada in defensive terms, and in offensive terms will control all offensive forces attacking a particular sector, if the battlefront is that widespread; they are responsible for giving assault admirals areas of the battlefront that each is capable of fighting. There are normally between 1 and 5 Grand Master Engineer's in every sector that advise the sector's admiral about engineering issues. 5-Star Admiral- In charge of 2-3 clusters' armadas in defensive terms, and in offensive terms commands up to 10 armadas. 4-Star Admiral- Head of a whole cluster's armada in defensive terms, or 3 armadas in offensive terms. 3-Star Admiral- Can be made to control up to 5 systems' armadas as directed by a superior in defensive terms, and in entirely offensive terms will head off about 3-7 brigades, or and armada. 2-Star Admiral- Head of a system's armada in terms of defense, and in entirely offensive situations will head off 3-5 battalions, or a brigade. Admiral 1st Class- Head of a single planet's armada in terms of defense, and in entirely offensive situations will command between 8 and 10 divisions, or a battalion. A planet will usually have between 1 and 5 executive chiefs of engineers; it is their responsibility to keep the planet's admiral up to date on the status of each divisions combat readiness. Unlike master engineer's, they have the executive authority to pull specific divisions out of combat for repairs or to send them away in retreat if a majority of their ships are deemed unsuitable for combat. Admiral 2nd Class- In charge of 4-5 fleets or a division, between 8-10 divisions per planetary armada. Each division usually has a master engineer who is responsible for informing the admiral of which ships are combat ready, which ships need repair, and while they have no executive power, they advise the admiral when a retreat or surrender should be considered. Fleet Commander- Head of 3 ships or a fleet, the ship that the fleet commander is on will not have a captain in charge. In cases where fighters go into combat on their own (that is, without any larger ships), then they will be led by a brigadier assault commando. Captain- Head of a single ship and all engineers, regulars, and other crew-members on-board. Pilots often have a squadron master in a ship that is in charge of all pilots on-board, if none are present, the captain is in charge. Lieutenant 1st Class- Head of a unit in assaults and general ship defense, multiple units depending on ship sizes. The average ship will have 1 or 2 lieutenants in charge of all engineers/non-combatant crew-members. Pilots are excluded in this rank. Lieutenant- Head of a squadron of troops in assaults and general ship defense, 3 squadrons per unit. The average ship will have a lieutenant ranked engineer or crew-member per weapon/major utility (such as engines)/ship deck. The lieutenant equivalent of a pilot is a assault commando; assault commandos head 3 squadrons (usually 2 fighter squadrons and 1 bomber, sometimes different). Sergeant- Head of 4 Regulars in assaults and general ship defense, 2 Sergeants per squadron. Engineers, and regular crew-members do not answer to a sergeant, they go straight to the lieutenant rank. The sergeant equivalent of a pilot is a squadron leader; squadron leaders command between 3 and 9 fighters/bombers depending on the type of fighter/bomber. Regular/Pilot/Engineer- Basic armada soldier, crew-member, pilot, or engineer. (Crew-members includes: gunners, weapons officers, medical personnel, ship and dock workers, science officers, religious officers, and supplies staff.)Planetary Forces  Arch General- ArchGenerals are in charge of an entire sector's planetary forces. 6-Star General- In charge of a cluster's planetary forces. 5-Star General- In charge of a systems's planetary forces.Planetary Naval Forces  Planetary naval forces follow the same ranking system as the galactic armada up to a fleet commander.Planetary Ground Forces  4-Star General- In charge of an entire planet's non-armada forces. 3-Star General- Commands 1/8-1/3 of a planets armies. 2-Star General- Commands armies on an entire continent. General- Leader of a full sized army, 3-4 sub-armies. Major- Leader of an sub-army, up to 12 battalions. Colonel- Head of multiple battalions, usually 3. High Commander- Leader of a battalion. Commander- Head of a division, 3 Divisions per battalion. Captain- Head of the unit, up to 10 units per division. Lieutenant 1st Class- In charge of a company, usually 5-6 company per unit. Lieutenant- Head of a squadron, 3 squadrons per company. Sergeant- Head of 3-6 soldiers, or a squadron. Private 1st Class- Basic soldier, outranks privates. Rank usually earned as a sign of small authority but is not put in charge of any set amount of units. Engineers, Medics, and other non-combat personnel also outrank privates. Private- Basic soldierReligion  There are 2 main religions in the pre-eighth age empire. Kanoviasm and BosesiKanoviasm  Kanoviasm is much like Buddhism, it is a religion that emphasizes spiritual peace. They believe in the god Runsgard, who is an 8 winged legless dragon that is said to stand guard at the center of the celestial pool, and give those worthy of spirit access to the White plains, which is a metaphor to a state of inner peace.Bosesi  Bosesi is a form of animism. Followers believe in elemental spirits that control the forces of nature. They believe that the universe began when Rahmura, the spirit of life, and Chromota, the spirit of Chaos clashed spilling from them the 6 dimensions of existance. They also believe that as Rahmura's spirit emminates throughout time, Chromota will eventually take over, and destroy all sentient thought, blinking the universe out of existence. They believe in reincarnation in a form unlike anything we know of today. They believe that at the moment you die, an instantaneous thought will blink you into another whole existence in another part of the 6 dimensional plane. It's part of the belief that the closer your soul is to Rahmura, the more memory you will retain from your previous lives. Another principle of this faith is strong morals. It is believed that a demon spirit known as Seitvili attempts to lead people into the path of corruption, and eventually imprisons their souls in a dimension from which they cannot ever escape.The One God  In the eight age, a new religion had arisen. With no central name, it's followers were simply known as the followers of the one God. The belief is that one God alone is responsible for creation and all workings of the universe. The belief values unity, compassion, worship, and discipline. Forgiveness is a high value in some sects of the practice. The Galactic Imperial Alliance is, for the most part, a theocracy under this religion.Arts, Music, and Entertainment Architecture  Architecture changes with almost every age. In the first age, wooden structures were still widely used, and vastly expensive and entirely for artistic purposes. Near the end of the first age, and into the second age, there was a transition into finely crafted marble and granite structures that didn't use mortar; these stones were crafted with recently developed laser technology, and were made to fit together perfectly. In this way, stone structures created in the second age outlasted every other planetary structure in history; some structures even outlasted the Galactic Civil War on planets that were less affected by combat. In the coming ages, expansion was going faster than before in each successive age with the exception of Tyranis's rule, and during the Galactic Civil War. Stone structures like before took a very long time to construct and were therefore very costly. In the times of the empire's rapid expansion, permanent stone structures were all but abandoned for pre-constructed metal structures. These were simplified buildings that were pre-made and collapsed in factories for transportation; after arriving it would take less than 24 (Earth) hours to build back up. The advantages were that colonies could be built and ready for civilian population to immigrate within about a week's time. The disadvantages were that they were generally undefended in war-prone areas of the galaxy, and weapons and warships took much longer to build up than these space age cookie-cutter houses. As technology advanced more, core matter was discovered, which provided for impossibly huge amounts of energy. This energy boom allowed for quick production of weapons, shields, and terraforming materials. A huge boom in colonization occurred, and structures were quickly being built out of whatever resources a particular planet had. The best example of sudden shifts in architectural artistry is on the planet Salva, in the Spaca system. In its first colonization, Salva was generally composed of the quickly produced makeshift buildings. Within a few years, it became a hardcore military colony, and tough, durable military strongholds were built. The amount of troops stored there was far greater than the anticipated population, and so for some time, a majority of the military population lived in large tents and wooden structures. After the first complete destruction of the planet at the hands of the Grox, Grand Admiral Salva's flagship, The Behemoth, crashed into the last standing city. When the planet underwent reconstruction, the remnants of the massive warship were built into, and the entire city became a tomb and museum for the warship. After the last complete destruction of the cities, the last bits of that memorial city were completely destroyed. New cities were planted around, and unlike the past, where the Grox battlefront was literally a system or two away, Salva was now far more secure. It became a center-point for further expansion into former Grox systems. The structures being built were owned by war heroes and extremely wealthy high ranking officers. Marble and granite buildings made a comeback here, and soon, these types of structures became a luxury around the galaxy. In mid space, a new type of structure was just beginning to come into play. Beginning with the supermassive Arckasan drive yards. No structure like this had ever been seen before; it was a huge ring constructed around Arckas by the military as a mass production facility. Still only one of the few places with an assembly line for dreadnoughts and even mega-dreadnoughts, the drive yards have always been the number one manufacturing point of all military weapons and vehicles. If that alone wasn't impressive enough, Arckas is the largest planet in the galaxy; in fact, Arckas is a unique phenomena in that it is actually larger than many stars, including it's own. The planet is monstrous, and with it's super-size comes a super-sized amount of resources. After the end of the Grox, many planets began constructing these similar rings that became the most fascinating place to live. Not only that, but they were built around wildlife sanctuaries to house wildlife planet workers, and many nature-loving civilians.Famous Planets  A complete list of systems and planets can be found at List of Great Horned Dragon Systems and PlanetsMilitary  Lists and details of Great Horned Dragon Imperial Federation, Galactic Federation, and Galactic Imperial Alliance warships, weapons, and vehicles can be found at GHD Warships, Weapons, and VehiclesHistory  A detailed history of the Galactic Federation, and the Galactic Imperial Alliance can be found at GHD HistoryTimeMaster Hi there!

I'll get one now.  01:18, 3 July 2009 (UTC) This is the important code. . . {| align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid #E0E0E0; background-color:orange; color:#000; margin:0.5em auto;\" |- | | style=\"font-size:90%;\" | As you can see, there is some good default stuff, you can change the border:1px solid #E0E0E0 to #ffffff for white or #000000 for black, have fun testing colors. You can also change background-color:orange; color:#000 to other things, but probably leave everything else. But #000 is good for the color:#000. Then write your text out and end with a |} And then, for example, {| align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid #000000; background-color:yellow; color:#000; margin:0.5em auto;\" |- | | style=\"font-size:90%;\" | '''This is the way to make a cool template.'''

And does he have any reason to not let us add a link?--Spyzombie45 20:03, 3 July 2009 (UTC)Thanks  Thanks Plus You Can Give Me Any New Ideas. Thanks.--Toa Mata Nui 17:05, 4 July 2009 (UTC)Does not compute?  Why cant the hunre empire have a colony that cluster? And by the way does vote I'm the support mean you support?--Spyzombie45 20:27, 10 July 2009 (UTC) Well really I really made up them,i only made the models,I haven't ever played with them.--Spyzombie45 22:42, 10 July 2009 (UTC)User of the month?  How many votes does a person need to get USer of the month, cause Combo ninja has 3 support and none else.--Spyzombie45 01:50, 11 July 2009 (UTC)Super Happy  Well I got a new spore and I have an online spore account(not bragging sorry that you cant have one) and can we make a page so we can share account names? Also can we change the Article of the week?--Spyzombie45 21:52, 19 July 2009 (UTC) Spyzombie45 lets out a gasp.Spelling  I got a feeling that I misspelled that scouting page--Spyzombie45 22:29, 19 July 2009 (UTC) I don't know what you're talking about, sorry.  22:31, 19 July 2009 (UTC)The Great Spice Crisis  I think The Great Spice Crisis is losing its prime want to delete it\u00a0? Cause I think I got a better idea.--Spyzombie45 22:40, 24 July 2009 (UTC) No, I think it's Ok. If you still want to keep making new ones, fine.  02:41, 25 July 2009 (UTC)Cyber Nations  By the way I am doing that Cyber Nations thing it is fun.--Spyzombie45 03:31, 25 July 2009 (UTC) I've been playing since April 24. I'm Cascadia.  12:40, 25 July 2009 (UTC)Sorry  I didnt mean to do that--Spyzombie45 21:21, 25 July 2009 (UTC)Really Sorry  I just meant to make still have the Hunre crap in it --Spyzombie45 21:23, 25 July 2009 (UTC) But this is at the time of the galactic war. How about the Hunre empire splits in two and the one that isn't the new Hunre empire is destroyed. Sounds good?  21:23, 25 July 2009 (UTC) Fair--Spyzombie45 21:24, 25 July 2009 (UTC)Karnasaur Fleet issue  I understand that your an admin and all that, but last time I checked, your not a moderator on Galactic Empires, so you cant tell me what to do with my fleet. Run it by Spyzombie, if he doesn't want it, tell me, and I'll get rid of it and switch to the \"standard/advanced\" thing. If you already asked, then I'm sorry for the bother. I'm not trying to be annoying, but I just like to stick close to the facts (fanon facts, I guess you could call them) unless I positivly can't. I hope we can resolve this issue quickly and kindly. --Nra 'Vadumee 21:22, 26 July 2009 (UTC)Talk?  What did you want to talk about?--Spyzombie45 02:42, 28 July 2009 (UTC) Because they threatened to blow up one of our colonies.--Spyzombie45 00:21, 29 July 2009 (UTC)1st Hunre-Karnasuar War  Maybe if you want you can make an article about the 1st Karnasaur War, just a thought.--Spyzombie45 00:29, 29 July 2009 (UTC) ok--Spyzombie45 01:31, 29 July 2009 (UTC)Help  Hey buddy, I am starting a new wiki on another game(will still be admin here and work)and I was wondering if you could help me format it right, even if you dont know about the topic I could sure use some help formating it.http://hlf.wikia.com/wiki/Half_Life_Fanon_Wiki so please consider it.--Spyzombie45 18:37, 3 August 2009 (UTC) NVM I am deleting it--Spyzombie45 18:47, 3 August 2009 (UTC)Lol  \"a far away place far away \" Lol a far way place far away--Spyzombie45 23:49, 3 August 2009 (UTC)Smart  Man, that was clever, I didnt think you would firgure out that, that was spode.--Spyzombie45 17:04, 4 August 2009 (UTC)Peace Council  If you want me to talk instead of that reply you can erase it.--Spyzombie45 17:27, 4 August 2009 (UTC)Galactic Empires  I must admit I didnt think it would end this way, I personally think we need to anyazle this and post a report of what went wrong(brief not too many details of course), and I find it very funny on how this happened, I say it was Nra's fault because he threatened my empire so a war happened ,then another one happened, very child-like I say, also the Hunre Empire short sidedness helped it along as well.--Spyzombie45 18:27, 4 August 2009 (UTC)OMG  Lol this whole project fell apart(Galactic Empires), want to do another one I got an idea for. Its will be called GALACTIC SENATE. Maybe we can vote on bills and stuff, it is just a thought, but really the only sane empire? LOL\u00a0:}--Spyzombie45 19:23, 4 August 2009 (UTC) SHIT you did use it. Why is the Hunre Empire such a bitch?  19:56, 4 August 2009 (UTC)HA HA HA  Lol the Hunre Empire was a bitch, do you mind if I take over the grox and uses them as sort of an moderatoring empire?--Spyzombie45 20:12, 4 August 2009 (UTC) Too much god play then. XD Also Galactic Senate is a good idea.  20:15, 4 August 2009 (UTC)Spore Wiki is paraniod  Really why cant we have an link there, I think they are just scared we would take all thier users lol, also I really dont want to start over so I guess I can control the pirate and nature events to add to make it seem real, also we need to clean it up by moving the past stuff some where else like in a file storage thing for research and maybe later we can use for like an scavenger hunt lol.--Spyzombie45 20:18, 4 August 2009 (UTC) So, can I command the nature and pirate attacks, and want me to work on the storage thing or a joint effort?--Spyzombie45 20:23, 4 August 2009 (UTC) Why the\u00a0? at the end of you can work on the storage thing. But anyway pirate attacks and nautre are like Well I asked if you wanted moderator and you said no. Well I am taking Nra off the moderator list because he missed quite alot.--Spyzombie45 20:32, 4 August 2009 (UTC)Bad Idea  Was that a smart move to move it to there?--Spyzombie45 20:39, 4 August 2009 (UTC)Spore Wiki  We really need to get an link on spore wiki we have so few members that are active, if you like I will talk to ose for you.--Spyzombie45 21:33, 4 August 2009 (UTC)Ose...  OMG ose is on here, it is an mircale--Spyzombie45 00:36, 5 August 2009 (UTC) Yeah. Also I cooking for a few minutes, brb. Tapioca pudding first try!  00:41, 5 August 2009 (UTC)Plan?  1. What are all the edits like mocan what ever css thing? 2. Do you have an plan for the export and import? And also good work getting him to get an account here, that will help us.--Spyzombie45 00:46, 5 August 2009 (UTC)Galactic Empires  Time, I really think Galactic Empires lost its prime I think we should shut it down for another project, because A.ME you and Nra are really the only full time posters, and B. Me and Nra would like this to happen. Please think about, but regradless I am making the next project.--Spyzombie45 19:53, 5 August 2009 (UTC) Retrieved from \"http://sporefanfic.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Nra_%27Vadumee\"The Aftermath Problem  Time, I noticed your little edit to the Aftermath. In case you didn't, I notified Spyzombie on this. I understand you have a right to edit it, but you essentially rewrote it! I understand if this was an accident, but if it wasn't, and I believe it wasn't, then I beleive you might need to be put on probation for the Aftermath or whatever you'd call it. Please explain your self ASAP. --Nra 'Vadumee 23:30, 5 August 2009 (UTC)AfterMath  Time, really? Come on every time we write something you rewrite it lol, I was changing it so they werent alive, but they were ghosts, and also we (me and Nra) were working on it, I really dont this that was an fair delete.--Spyzombie45 23:44, 5 August 2009 (UTC)Stargates do not suck  I just read your little comment on GE. Stargates do not suck! They are the awesomest devices I have ever experinced and the Tau'ri would be lucky if they were real.And The Stargate franchise is awesome.SG-1's the best, Atlantis needs work, and I can't wait to see Universe. In fact, I just got an idea for a communtiy project... --Nra 'Vadumee 23:58, 5 August 2009 (UTC)...  Timemaster, did you now ghosts can be seen as a living being? I do. I've dabbled in the paranormal. It wasn't the actual Karnasaur Emperor, it was him appearing as a ghost who looked real. And the fleet wasn't there. Ghosts can interact with the living quite easily. Plus, I at first planned on making the Karnasaurs acsend. Would that be better? Them living on a higher plane of existense with the Ancients(and the Hunres, technically)? Huh? Would it? --Nra 'Vadumee 00:41, 6 August 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 00:56, 6 August 2009 (UTC)Re:Request  Ok you can be an moderator where again? But really I think atleast The Great Spice Crisis and maybe galacticc empires might need to be scraped because the spice crisis is fairly inactive and also I think galactic empires had lost its prime.--Spyzombie45 15:23, 11 August 2009 (UTC)Ose's Idea  Ok I did some reseach on the avater wiki and found out that the Avater Admins had less powers and werent involed in the lest bit with the normal wiki, I know he stated we wouldnt go into the other wiki but just to let you know what I found. Also I am assuming that we arent to be respected on the normal wiki or the fanon cause we are just Fanon Admins. Also the REAL admins will have probarly the authority over us and can promote fanon admins that maybe we dont think deserve it. But in the end it is maybe an good idea because we would get more users. So I am happy to go be an admin with you there, and be with you 100% of the way. But just heed this and you wont hear any more about it from me Google Ranking vs home feel. But in the end it is your decesion and I will again go with you as admin there and again be 100% with you all the way. Just saying this stuff to let you know the facts(not stating you dont know).Spyzombie45 He didnt leave the senate he just walked out the building for an min, because he was about to tell an secert and thought for him to shut up and leave so not to tell it. Also I some what agree, and also before any thing happens can you make me an temporay page for all the coding I need, like userboxs with pics, image formating, box like create, and anything else you think I need, cause I want to be able to do coding.--Spyzombie45 16:53, 19 August 2009 (UTC) Ok thanks, so are we going to merge or not or are you still thinking about it?--Spyzombie45 >_> <_< -__- No I don't really want to.  17:19, 19 August 2009 (UTC) Ok then. But we have so little users, you got an plan for that?--Put Spy to the Zombie to the 45 YAH! Sorry I was messing around with my sig.\u00a0;] I don't think it matters.  22:54, 19 August 2009 (UTC)Serious Question  Time, this is a serious question that I'm also going to ask Spyzombie. Do you think it would be OK if I added a reproductive system portion to my Karnasaur page? I promise to be completely porfessional about it, and its not going to go into detail about thier reproduction, just stuff like...well, I think you'll understand that its similar to ours. Feel free to say no, but don't go overboard. A simple no is all I need. I won't protest. --Nra 'Vadumee 18:33, 24 August 2009 (UTC)Karnasaur Physiology  Time, Karnasaurs aren't carbon based, they're nitrogen based. That is possible.New idea  Hey, I've had an idea for a new project, seeing that the Senate Hall has sort of stalled. Basically, it's Galactic Empires in the Tribal stage! The dynamics as GE should be more or less the same - colonising new planets would be gaining new members, ships etc could be domesticated animals - but because it is in the tribe stage there is no way we can have UE-style powergaming weapons that cause major trouble. What do you think? --Fegaxeyl 10:38, 27 August 2009 (UTC)Yes  Yes I am. Timmyray1221 Talk 13:59, 28 August 2009 (UTC)Clarifaction  While I will let you say the Heglareans are more advanced then I thought, I will draw the line at sub-space and smarter then the Karnasaurs. No one out smarts or is more advanced than the Karnasaurs. Alive, that is. And sub-space is strictly a Karnasaur thing, will you give me that? The Heglareans can be advanced, but not that advanced. I just got an idea: The Heglareans have most of thier tech advancemaent in med, travel, etc., while the Hunres are advanced technologicaly military wise. Put the two together, advance them alot, and you get Karnasaur tech. This way, you're still technologically advanced, Spy is technologically advanced, and I am, too, but being the most technologically advanced species in the galaxy is just the Karnasaur's thing. So, tech and sub-space, thats all I'm asking for. --Nra 'Vadumee 17:59, September 10, 2009 (UTC) Sorry Nra, that's just the way the Heglareans are. It isn't very amusing or fun to have your race all advanced while I get left behind in dust (same with Hunre). Heglareans simply are more advanced in non-military technology. Also when did sub-space become strictly Karnasaur, I thought it was an different, compressed dimension that anyone with the proper technology can enter. I'm willing to let Karnasaurs be the only ones with access to it though. But in exchange I'd like to have something that the Heglareans can do but not Karnasaurs. Also, I don't understand why Karnasaurs absolutely have to have the highest amount of technologic advancement, because Heglareans actually are that advanced. Also you're right about the Heglareans having most advancement in the non-military fields of science (e.g. medicine, psychology, travel, economy, history, mechanics, etc.), while Karnasaurs are nearly as good or better than Heglareans/Hunre in either non-mil tech or military tech respectively. Also I am not going to tolerate Karnasaurs being more advanced than Heglareans and Hunre combined, also, I didn't say Heglareans were actually smarter than the Karnasaurs, I thought I said something more like Heglareans are equal or a little bit better in the non-military fields of science when compared to the Karnasaurs. Why does it have to be the Karnasaur's thing??  01:51, September 12, 2009 (UTC) Ok I think this is fair, and also man we are very inactive.--Spyzombie45 19:31, September 11, 2009 (UTC) I agree. My main computer can't connect, and that is really throwing me off. I think we should try to work on Spore Fan Fic when we get a chance. Maybe we should try to make a page where people can \"patent\" thier stuff, so we don't have to deal with stolen ideas, because I, for one, get ticked off when my ideas are stolen. I don't know what happens down at Central Wikia, but I'm worried they might shut us down. Also, sorry for adding my message in a new place, didn't see this one. --Nra 'Vadumee 22:26, September 19, 2009 (UTC)Galactic Empires restart  Hey, The wiki's activity is effectively nil, and my idea of GE in Tribe stage didn't go very far, so how about a restart of GE, only set in the universe where the UE didn't go off? That way we'd be able to resume our previous activity and fit it in with the Senate Hall etc. What do you think? --Fegaxeyl 20:01, September 11, 2009 (UTC)Re: Re: Clarifacation  Sorry, didn't mean to get on your nerves...again. But, I will let the Heglareans be close to the Karnasaurs on non-mil tech. Its just that, I when I came up with the Karnasaurs, I wanted them to be this awesomely ( and by that, I mean awesomely) advanced civilization, and a major force in the Galaxy. How about this: Karnasaurs get Ilos and subspace, Heglareans get superb medical and archiving tech. So, while the Heglareans have non-mil tech straight up, Karnasaurs have amazing tech in everything, and still have yet to learn it all. Now, I mean a few decades, mayber centuries, before they learn everything. As long as the Karnasaurs are highly advanced in general, no matter how closely behind someone else is, I'm happy (and as long as you don't steal my tech, like wormholes, subspace, If I came up with it, please don't take it.). If this still doesn't fly with you, I'm open for more negotiation. --Nra 'Vadumee 22:18, September 19, 2009 (UTC)Tech Patent page  Hey, I'm starting a tech patent page, so that people don't loose thier ideas for technology. Don't forget to drop in and patent Heglarean tech. If anyone else is reading this, make sure you patent your ideas before someone else does. --Nra 'Vadumee 20:37, September 21, 2009 (UTC)Patent Issue  As overseer of the patent page, I have the right to tell you that since I put down Atlantis as the first ship to touch down on another galaxy since the Ancients, and that the Karnasaurs are the first Intergalactic Empire since the Ancients, before you said that you've been to galaxies for 30 years, that statement is considered null. If anyone else wants to prove or disprove this, check the history on it. Please don't make a big deal out of this, Time. Its a simple legal issue,and part of the reason I started the patent page was to make sure people (like you and me) don't argue over whose idea this was, or who did this or that, etc. Take it to someone else if you feel like argueing, because, as overseer and founder of the TPP, I have the authority to null your statements. --Nra 'Vadumee 20:02, September 25, 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 00:48, September 28, 2009 (UTC)Hey  Sorry for me being inactive, but school is taking an toll, I will still try to fufill my admin duties but I wont be as active, also please put in some Hunre Patents.--Spyzombie45 02:15, September 27, 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 00:54, September 28, 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 20:55, September 29, 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 21:43, September 29, 2009 (UTC) This is kind of annoying now. You two are launching - or on the brink of launching - a massive edit war. Nra, for (suitably powerful expletive)'s sake, get a grip. You can't have technological hegemony over the universe. You have to make some compromises if you want to stay respected. And frankly, you are behaving incredibly immaturely to keep your claws on the 'uber-high-tech' status. \"I'm also an expert with physics, especially astrophysics.\" \"And you can't prove anything, because you don't have any legal proof, like, oh say, a patent. LOL. I'm also an expert at law.\" I think that's sufficient evidence, don't you? And TimeMaster, I am siding with you on this issue. This has turned into a sickening demonstration of trying to apply law to a totally nonrelated situation. This is a fan fiction wiki, for god's sake. TimeMaster, you have my support in this debate. Nra, unless you want my opinion of you to plummet, then I would advise that you try to compromise and act like a rational mature editor, not firing off random things about being an \"expert\" at law and physics. If you want to prove that, then at least try and act like an expert, rather than infantile stabs followed by barely-disguised gloating. And don't bring in crazy patent stuff. This is supposed to be a website where we can blow off some steam and have some fun creating stories about our favourite game, not get bogged down in arguments over issues that rapidly degrade into childish squabbles. Your last statement is the perfect example of this. Nra - Shut up and share this stuff. Okay? --Fegaxeyl 19:20, September 30, 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 19:37, September 30, 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 23:30, September 30, 2009 (UTC) Sigh, man this getting to be super annoying, Time, Nra, both of you are fine, creative users, and your ideas will collide, but for the sake of this wiki which know has an 3-4 person active user base, we are in need of everyone to stick together, also you guys are bickering over things that dont even matter, so please you two kiss and make up. User:Spyzombie45GE2: AotC  Just so I know, Are we allowed building empires, or are we just setting up? --Nra 'Vadumee 17:38, October 23, 2009 (UTC) Still setting up currently. You guys are welcome to help put all the pages up. --Fegaxeyl 18:15, October 23, 2009 (UTC)Wiki-Twins!  I have found a Wiki-Twin! Hello, fellow wiki-administrator! I have sent you a message on behalf of the Spore Fanon Wiki at http://realsporefanon.wikia.com/wiki/\u00a0! I must assure you that although our wikis are similar, they are not the same. My wiki organizes specific content in categorical lists, whereas your wiki organizes many specific content! I hope to develop a positive relationship with your wiki to bring forth a new era of Fanatical Knowledge!Wow.  I have been gone for months, but you still havent past my edits. Well, down to the point, consider me Inactive for now. Sorry about this.-Your FriendCopying  On behalf of the Spore Fanon Wiki, this wiki's Wiki-Twin, I would like to request the copying of all pages from my wiki into this one. Some pages, though, are already under titles in this wiki. In regard to this fact, I would like the copies to be under the title \"Spore Fanon Wiki: (Page name).\"Question about pictures  For some reason, when I try to move a picture in my articles, my computer locks up. Any thing I can do about this? Krayfish 00:59, January 8, 2010 (UTC) When you move a picture? Um, this hasn't ever happened to me. Do you mean you have trouble moving the place of the pictures in your articles? I would report a problem using Special:Contact.  01:04, January 8, 2010 (UTC) I just reported the problem at Special:Contact. It happens when I just try to moving the picture around in the articles. I've been able to move it right after I insert the image but not when I come back to edit it later. Krayfish 01:21, January 8, 2010 (UTC) More info: I found a way to get around it. I went into codeview to move the pictures. Though it's inconvenient it'll have to do. Krayfish 16:32, January 8, 2010 (UTC) You can set to codeview (I don't care for the new editor) in Special:Preferences as default, and then switch to the rich text when you want to.  02:12, January 9, 2010 (UTC)What happened to my pictures?!  All of the sudden in each of my articles (all of them relating to the Dhragolon, see my User page for a link to each of them), all of my pictures were replaced with the white box with a red X. What happened with them? Do I need to reupload them or is there something else I can do? 72.196.236.236 01:32, January 14, 2010 (UTC) Krayfish 01:34, January 14, 2010 (UTC) (forgot to login) You need to re upload them, this has been happening a lot due to the Special:Upload updates.  01:33, January 14, 2010 (UTC) Ok, I'll go ahead and do that when I have the time.Krayfish 01:34, January 14, 2010 (UTC)what's your activity  it seems like, even though you're the admin, you aren't actually... active, so could you please inform me on what kind you do allow on the headline page, since my so called leveling, which was mostly adding, wasn't acceptable I don't allow blatant advertising in a big header in all caps on the main page (sure you can put a little notice in the \"Site News\" section), and I certainly would depise an offwiki forum just for GE2.  11:44, February 3, 2010 (UTC) Ok, I see what you mean now. The proboards was something I made and was going to work on with imcatface to be the host of GE2 because proboards is better than wiki for fanfic game type stuff. Wiki is more for official info. and story based content. It's just easier to figure out who's saying what on a forum, and the organization is better to tell whether or not it even relates to anything you're doing. I don't know what happened to him, but since I haven't heard from him in a long time, I don't think the site's going to work out. Are you still in to the fanfic gaming? Yes, but I don't want to have a forum for it.  20:36, February 3, 2010 (UTC)Can you send friend request on this?  I want to send one to my friend but I don't know how, help? --Mewditto 13:11, February 11, 2010 (UTC) I'm not sure what you mean, can you clarify? What is a friend request?  21:57, February 11, 2010 (UTC)Where is everyone?  I haven't seen anyone make edits in ages. What happens if the wiki is left stagnant like this? Will all the pages get deleted or something after a certain period of time? Krayfish 21:30, March 22, 2010 (UTC) No, everything will remain as it is.  21:53, March 22, 2010 (UTC)Check-In  Hey Time, It's Spyzombie, just checking in, long time no talk, I hope you remeber me. If there is any help needed, let me know. With Regards, Spyzombie Hi Spyzombie.  13:27, April 7, 2010 (UTC)Revive  Hey Time, I finally have found the time to be Super-Duper Active on here. I think we really need a revive. I see you are an Sysop over at Spore Wiki, isnt it possible to get those Fanon Junkies to post thier Fanon here? I really hope we can find a way to bring this baby back. With Deepest Regrads, Spyzombie45 21:35, April 28, 2010 (UTC) Sounds good.  21:36, April 28, 2010 (UTC) You guys are reviving the wiki? Thanks. We really need to. Though I'm trying to come up with further ideas for Fan Fiction. Maybe I should finish my uber-massive story.Krayfish 21:40, April 28, 2010 (UTC)Ad free  Hi! Would you like this wiki to be ad-free? I'm looking for wikis to be part of a new program which would remove all ads from the wiki for $19.95/month. If you are interested, please be visit here to sign up. Let me know if you have any questions! - sannse  21:03, June 3, 2010 (UTC) No, because I don't have the money to pay.  23:29, June 3, 2010 (UTC)GE2  Since it seems that someone is trying to revive this, can we start up GE2? Cheat 03:53, June 5, 2010 (UTC) Sure.  23:58, June 4, 2010 (UTC) Got it. Kicking it off. Cheat 03:53, June 5, 2010 (UTC)  Oh also, I've started on a new galactic map. It needs to be cleaned up a little, since I only have access to Paint.net (Note, not MS Paint) Yeah. Maybe you should ask the leader of the AMP to make it, he was the one who made it originally.  14:52, June 5, 2010 (UTC) Ok, I'll ask him. Cheat 16:03, June 5, 2010 (UTC)Re: The Hunre Revolt  I would be delighted.--Spyzombie45 22:10, July 15, 2010 (UTC)Hey  Hello, TimeMaster. Since Krayfish and I are the only ones that seem to do much of anything here anymore, could I have the rights to some of the deeper functions on the wiki? PS: Have you seen Krayfish and I's stories? (The Meeting, The Reunion, The Siege) SupcommMonroee 06:01, October 24, 2010 (UTC) Let me check your edits first, then I will if I think you deserve it.  11:21, October 24, 2010 (UTC) You're on your way, but I want to see you editing a bunch more fanfic before I promote you. If you need anything from me in the meantime, I'm here.  11:26, October 24, 2010 (UTC) I forgot to mention that I am also User:SupcomMonroe. SupcommMonroee 18:47, October 24, 2010 (UTC) Hey Guys, Spyzombie here, I have been lurking, but havent been making edits much, but good work on keeping active Supcomm. Spy Hey, TimeMaster? Since you are a million to the hundredth power better at wikis than me, could you make a simple battle template? With fields like commanders, belligerents, forces, casualites, locations, etc? If you can't I'm perfectly fine with that. 'twould be nice though. SupcommMonroee 04:47, November 16, 2010 (UTC) Sure. Sorry to bother you and ask another favor of you, but could you delete the pages Eteno Link Page and The Eteno Hostage Crisis? The first one is part of my sweep completely professionalizing my pages. The second one relates to the fact that I can no longer look at it without gagging on my keyboard. I was an atrocious writer back then. SupcommMonroee 02:18, November 17, 2010 (UTC) Please? I cannot bear to see those pages. SupcommMonroee 22:47, November 17, 2010 (UTC) I like the Eteno Hostage Crisis too much too delete (really, it's a good story) it, but I've already deleted the Eteno Link Page for you.  01:41, November 18, 2010 (UTC) Personally, the Eteno Hostage Crisis is the work of the devil. I am not unhappy that you like it, just surprised. Well, if you get a sudden burst of mercy, feel free to delete the blasted thing. Regardless, thank you for your compliment. Whenever I read the stories Kray and I write and Uninvited Guests, I feel ashamed of the Eteno Hostage Crisis. SupcommMonroee 02:54, November 18, 2010 (UTC)Empire of the Week  Hey Time. Since we have been lacking an ANYTHING of the week for a while now, I was wondering if I could get the Eteno featured this week. If I can't, I understand. If I can, awesome. SupcommMonroee 19:02, November 23, 2010 (UTC) I'm gonna second that motion. In fact, I'm going to move that since no-one else has requested to be featured and that's pretty much the ONLY requirement at the moment. I also move that we start finding and seeking for something to fill these spots once a week or once a month by a majority vote of everyone who actually still gives a damn about this site. Panthean 20:35, November 23, 2010 (UTC) Also, TM, I noticed Monroee asked to be considered for a position of higher power on the site, I would like to submit myself for consideration as well. Panthean 20:37, November 23, 2010 (UTC) I most definetley agree with both Panthean and Monroee. I agree the Eteno should be featured this week as well. We really should be getting a lot more featured empires, planets and warships. Heck, we should even have featured story.Krayfish 22:27, November 24, 2010 (UTC) You guys can update that whenever you want. I'll promote you right now, actually.  13:51, November 25, 2010 (UTC) Thank you. SupcommMonroee 19:33, November 25, 2010 (UTC) Thank You Panthean 02:45, November 26, 2010 (UTC)Planet of the Week  Hey, I was wondering if I can put up Ucharpli for planet of the week? Also, I know it may be too much to ask but may I be considered for more administrative priveleges. If not, then that's totally fine.Krayfish 23:47, November 26, 2010 (UTC) Of course. What do you mean by \"more administrative privileges?\"  17:27, November 28, 2010 (UTC) Thanks. It's just that I hadn't realized you had already made me sysop at the time I wrote that message.Krayfish 23:14, November 28, 2010 (UTC)Spyzombie  Is Spyzombie45 dead? I haven't seen him for a while. SupcommMonroee 19:58, November 28, 2010 (UTC) No, he's just busy. He pops on every once in a while.  22:11, November 28, 2010 (UTC)Senate Hall  Hey Time, I was wondering if the Eteno could join the Senate Hall. I was also wondering if the project could get going again. It seems as though Etah's Mission isn't going to be finished anytime soon, so that is why I asked. SupcommMonroee 18:56, December 5, 2010 (UTC) Of course. You don't have to ask.  21:13, December 6, 2010 (UTC) Well then, I'm gonna go ahead and start a new day in the senate. Reverse it as you see fit, I'm not a moderator. SupcommMonroee 23:39, December 6, 2010 (UTC)Getting the Senate Hall Active  Hey, do you think you could get into the senate hall again? I am trying to get it going again. SupcommMonroee 03:10, December 9, 2010 (UTC)A Question  This is a stupid question, but how do the infoboxes work? I'm trying to make an article on The Great War, but an infobox would make it much more professional. I was thinking of using a location or item box, but I am cloooliss. Oh, and also, is there a way for Sysops to view the view count on the wiki and specific pages? SupcommMonroee 04:35, December 15, 2010 (UTC) Copy another infobox and change it all up.  00:01, December 16, 2010 (UTC) Thanks SupcommMonroee 01:19, December 16, 2010 (UTC) Not working, sorry. SupcommMonroee 01:47, December 16, 2010 (UTC)350 Pages!  Wow! 350 pages! It feels like just last week that I accidentally came across a little, struggling wiki. Its great to see this great wiki concept growing and thriving. Also, I added an idea to the Fanfic Game Idea forum. 9At least I think that's what it is called.) SupcommMonroee 03:33, December 16, 2010 (UTC)Merry Christmas  Merry Christmas! (Or Hannukah) Time! SupcommMonroee 21:09, December 27, 2010 (UTC)Would you...  Be interested in doing that RPG like game with me and whoever else joins up? SupcommMonroee 22:23, December 28, 2010 (UTC) No thanks, I'm busy, but I have read the idea and it looks pretty cool.  17:53, December 29, 2010 (UTC) I forgot to mention that a friend of mine is probably joining up and I expect his stuff to be about as detailed as my stuff. SupcommMonroee 22:35, December 29, 2010 (UTC) That's good.  18:03, December 30, 2010 (UTC)Moderator  Could you please give me moderator rights for the Senate Hall? We can't start any new sessions because no moderators are around. SupcommMonroee 04:58, January 11, 2011 (UTC) Yep. You are an administrator, by the way, so in the future you don't have to ask.  21:29, January 11, 2011 (UTC)Mission  Could you pick out a mission for the GSSOC for Kray and I? SupcommMonroee 17:57, January 16, 2011 (UTC) Mission 1.  21:58, January 16, 2011 (UTC) Thanks SupcommMonroee 03:29, January 17, 2011 (UTC)Reworking Archetypes  Hey, Time. I was thinking about overhauling the archetypes, and I wanted to ask for your approval first. My first idea is to remove several of the categories. For example, the Judge archetype. Who makes an entire empire based on one career? Another example is the Democrat archetype. I really don't think politics need to be involved in this wiki unless somebody wants to have a long, drawn-out argument with me over the US' government. My second idea is to add more comprehensive archetypes and archetype articles. Tell me what you think. SupcommMonroee 04:35, January 26, 2011 (UTC) This is okay, but DO NOT delete any.  00:59, February 9, 2011 (UTC) Ok. SupcommMonroee 03:12, February 9, 2011 (UTC)New User  The new editor I hinted at earlier is here. SupcommMonroee 05:03, February 1, 2011 (UTC)Are you....  Gonna propose a mission or participate in one with your GSSOC character? SupcommMonroee 18:37, February 20, 2011 (UTC) Maybe.  21:40, February 20, 2011 (UTC)The Wiki  Hello, TimeMaster. It's been a while. Now, I know you do some stuff over at SporeWiki, but you don't seem to roam here at all anymore. After several days of consideration, I have decided that I would request you transfer ownership of the wiki to another user here who desires the responsibility. If nobody else who is active right now wants to, I will accept it. Of course, this is only if you grant my request. Thank you. SupcommMonroee 07:16, October 30, 2011 (UTC) Uh, you three already have admin rank.  12:56, October 30, 2011 (UTC) I think he means making him a bureaucrat.Krayfish 13:03, October 30, 2011 (UTC) Just contact me. I may even become active in the future.  13:05, October 30, 2011 (UTC) Sounds good.Krayfish 13:08, October 30, 2011 (UTC) Got it. SupcommMonroee 19:34, October 30, 2011 (UTC)You are Invited  To check out the Spore Fan Fiction Wiki in its new and imporved form! A great new slew of fiction has been created, and the new core users here wish for you to see how the site has changed so much from its humble roots! Please also check out http://sporefanfic.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:SupcommMonroee/Meetup SupcommMonroee 02:25, February 11, 2012 (UTC) Hello. Since this wiki is nearly abandoned, i contacted Krayfish about making me an Admin. Since you are the only one left who can give me admin responsability, I was wondering if I could be given Admin rights. Please respond back -User:TeamUnitedNerds Do the other admins agree? If so, I have no problem with doing so.  23:04, March 15, 2012 (UTC) Honestly, I won't be on this wiki too much anymore. I might write some stuff with TUN, though. I think TUN's still too inexperienced with how the wiki works to be an admin. I have nothing against him, but he's new and a tad impatient. SupcommMonroee 23:25, March 15, 2012 (UTC) I won't have much of a problem either with him becoming an admin. I'll probably stick around for a little bit and check in every once in a while to see if things are running smoothly.Krayfish 00:13, March 16, 2012 (UTC)Greetings from the Omniverse Nexus  Hi TimeMaster! No idea if you will ever see this, but do you remember me? I'm Krayfish - I joined this wiki in December 2009 to create the Dhragolon. A lot of stuff has happened since then so I wanted to try to reach out to you to let you know what we've been up to. Since the last time we were here, SupcommMonroee and I went on to found something called the Omniverse Nexus which basically turned out to be the spiritual successor to the Omniverse: GC Wiki we started back in 2012. We took most of our old stuff like the Dhragolon and Eteno and repurposed it into a brand new universe. We've also brought on board a ton of older creations like the Karnasaurs, Hunre and Heglareans. I just thought I'd drop by and say hi. The stuff that you and the others did in Spore Fan Fic Wiki was truly remarkable. Krayfish (talk) 21:34, March 24, 2018 (UTC) I don't remember you in specific, but hi. Thanks! What you're doing sounds cool. I don't know how you maintain interest for so long, though.\u00a0:P  22:49, March 24, 2018 (UTC) Lol I sometimes wonder how we've stuck around for so long too. We've even got our own Discord now which is pretty active. If you're interested, here's the link to it: https://discord.gg/G7Abr3 Krayfish (talk) 00:12, March 25, 2018 (UTC)GHD Warships, Weapons, and Vehicles Weapons/Tech. The First Age (Tech.) MG-99/AR-0/P-100  The Heavy Machinegun used in the beginning of the space age was the HMG-99. The HMG-99 could fire 10, 45 calibur rounds per second. The AR-0 was the rifle of choice for most infantry, and could fire a shot every half a second, and had magazines that could fit up to 35 rounds. The P-100 was the standard issue side-arm of all officers in the first age.Solid Rocket Fuel  The original fuel source for all space ferring vessels was solid rocket fuel, which would be considered antique in modern times. Solid rocket fuel could provide a maximum acceleration of 35 meters per second squared (about 3 G's). While terribly inefficient, it wasn't replaced until the invention of Ion Propulsion Engines in the second age.LC-1  The first laser cannon was powered by electricity and fired a sustained beam laser that would quickly heat objects up past the melting point of iron. While it was useful in its own ways, it was never considered a primary armament.Standard Space-to-Space Missiles  Space bound missiles were considered the primary armaments of first age warships. Unlike machineguns which had generally sloppy aim, and lasers which weren't necessarily effective, missiles could home onto a target and deal a substaincial amount of damage in a large explosion. Space bound missiles were fairly easy and cheap to construct because of the fact that there is not air resistance in space, so their fuel cost has always been minimal. Space-to-Space missiles come in many different sizes usually organized into 3 categories: small, medium, and large; they also carry a bigger boom with bigger sizes, and in space, fuel costs do not increase with size. Throughout the ages, nothing ever out-dates or replaces missiles, though plasma weapons come close for a short time.Standard Space-to-Surface Missiles  Space to surface missiles have always been crucial in planetary assaults. No matter how powerful other weapons became, one could always just make a bigger, more powerful missile, and for that reason, they have always been used, and probably always will be.Nuclear Reactor  Nuclear reactors are expensive, bulky, but very waste concious power sources, at least until Ion Propulsion comes along. While the weight and cost kept these things from being put into mass produced space ships that could hardly fit them, they eventually made ships large enough, and reactors small enough, to make it work out. Before Nuclear Reactors could effectively replace solid rocket fuel, they would quickly be overtaken by ion propulsion.The Second Age (Tech.) Burst Fire Lasers  Previously, lasers were limited to heating things up by concentrating a beam of polarized light energy. This was pretty much completely useless for the most part. Burst Fire Lasers work differently: they charge up a projector with a large amount of energy, and then release that energy in a single, short burst.HLC's  Heavy Laser Cannons were designed after a competing weapon manufacture developed burst fire laser technology. Unlike the old weaker laser cannons, Heavy Lasers brought traditional laser beams into mainstream warfare. An HLC charges a huge amount of energy, and then lets it shoot fourth through a magnifying barrel and deal rediculous amounts of damage to a target by heating it up to about 10K degrees farenheit. Unlike burst-fire lasers, their aim could be corrected mid-fire, so there wasn't any wasted energy going out into space every time some-one missed. HLC's probably would have brought their manufacturers out of the black, but they were so large that putting them on a ship smaller than a dreadnought was a waste of space.LR-1  The first laser rifle was introduced sometime in the end of the second age, around the same as the construction of Goliath Class warships. They were battery powered, and fired in single shot bursts at a rate of a single burst every quarter of a second. Their bursts were powerful enough to blast through 2 inches of solid steel. The first battery clips could power up to 200 bursts of fire. It had about a 70-80% accuracy rating, depending on who was using it.LP-1  Shortly after the manufacutring of the first laser rifle, the GHD empire developed a smaller version of the weapon. The laser pistol fired at the same rate as its rifle cousin, and its battery could sustain up to 40 bursts of fire. Its bursts could punch through about 1 and a half inches of steel. It had an accuracy rating of about 60-75%.IR-1  Right at the end on the second age, directly before Tyranis's reign, the GHD empire developed their first ion rifle. As opposed to a laser weapon, an ion based weapon is significantly weaker against material based armor, but worked well against energy based shields, and neutron armor. While few infantry units were equiped with such heavy shielding, the IR-1 proved useful in the hands of demolition infantry, and had the side affect at siphoning electircal energy from whatever it hit; ultimately, these weapons worked well against robotic infantry units. The IR-1 was battery powered and fired in single shot bursts, but it could fire at a rate of a single burst every sixth of a second. An ion burst could bust through about a half inch of steel. The more advanced battery clips could charge up to about 300 ion bursts. It had a 60-80% accuracy rating, and a somewhat strong recoil.Ion Propulsion Engines  After years of screwing around with widely inneficcient fuel sources, scientists finally came out with Ion Propulsion. Ion Propulsion was powered by continuously reacting different ionized particles and using those reactions to expell pure energy and release no byproducts. Unlike previous engines, Ion propulsion could produce enough thrust to make intersteller trade possible, connecting the empire to the galactic market for the first time. Much faster than solid rocket fuel, Ion engines could accelerate a ship at nearly 100 meters per second.Breaking the Light Barrier  Near the dawn of the second age, a need arose for ships to travel much faster, in order to cover vast distances across the galaxy. That need would not be fully addressed until the creation of ion propulsion systems. The problem is; however, that once you travel faster than light itself, you literally cannot see where you're going. While ion propulsion engines did have the capability of moving ships at the speed of light, and potentially beyond, no computer navigation system could possibly navigate through space without running into something and effectively turning the ship and its crew into jelly. The problem solving skills of a convention of engineers cannot possibly be overestimated though, and a convention of engineers is all it took to solve this problem. In something as simple as an engineer's fair on Nierdro, a few engineers started discussing the problem of light speed barriers; at the time it was believed that the only way to avoid collisions would be to have a computer that has a somplete map of the space between its two points of travel and a preplanned route to take. So that's exactly what they did, they designed a computer system that would take a series of about 100 snapshots of the path ahead in extreemely high pixel rating and simply pre-plan its path pased on that. Once the possibility of deep space light-speed collisions was taken care of, ships began to shoot away from place to place at the speed of light, and because of relativity, they never had to worry about other ships traveling at light speed. It was now possible for large fleets of ships to arrive in the defense and assault of other fleets at different systems around the galaxy; but even still, the galaxy is a very big place. Even with light speed, it could take years to travel across the longer distances.Neutron Armor  Before Neutron Armor, warships were only armored with thick steel plating, but with most modern weapons able to easily penetrate thick steel, a demand arose for a new, better armoring. Engineers invented neutron armor, which is many times stronger than steel, and, rather than being a physical material, was charged up and built up by a constant energy supply. The neutron base of the material would expand, and strengthen itself the more energy was put into it. The unfortunate aspect of it was that it required a constant power source, and if any of its energy was drained, the neutron fragments tended to flake off the exterior of the ship from which the pieces were harnessed would eventually fall away and become useless metal scraps.Energy Shields  Right after Neutron Armor was developped, scientists developed energy shields. Energy shields were powered by electricity, and created a large bubble of protection around a ship. Energy shields would activate selectively, and only when they were hit with enough energy to activate, usually heat or light based energy. Bullets, missiles, and other physical objects normally would not activate the shields, but the shields did work excellently against plasma and laser weapons. Ion weapons, however, had the effect of draining energy from the shield, lowering the strength of the shield more quickly than other weapons.Plasma Chambers  One of the most unique weapons ever conieved has always been the plasma weapon. At first, it was thought that these weapons would completely replace missiles, but ultimately did not. What the plasma chamber does is use a fusion reaction to project a huge stellare arc of plasma out of a cavity in the ship. Normally, you wouldn't be able to aim such a force, but by using extremely powerful magnetic projectors, engineers and top scientists figured out how to program computers that could correctly project magnetic fields towards an enemy ship. The end result is that for a few seconds, you could have a superhot jet of blazing plasma dance on your enemy's ship. The downside of these weapons is that it takes a very long time to charge up, and if your enemy decides to project magnets at your ship, you would end up attacking yourself. The plasma jets cannot go through energy shields, and are widely innefective against them, but once an enemy's shields are down, plasma weapons can do a significant amount of damage in a relatively short amount of time.The Third Age (Tech.) LR-10  The second laser rifle to be produced an widely used in combat by the GHD empire was the LR-10. The LR-10 was about 10 pounds heavier than its predecessor. It fired in 3 shot burst. The LR-1, and came with larger battery packs that could sustain up to 180 bursts of laser fire. It fired more shots in less bursts per second than the LR-1, at a rate of a single burst every third of second. A single shot from an LR-10 could punch through 3.5 inches of solid steel, at an accuracy rating of 75-85%.PR-30  The first few handheld proton cannons and rifles were considered rediculously inefficient. The PR-30 put an end to the bad reputation of the weapon genre, and managed to create a useful handheld seige weapon. The PR-30 was ammunition based, and though it could only hold 4 rounds at a time, the damage that these proton charges had was very effective. A proton charge could break through about 10.5 inches of solid steel and leave a hole with a diameter as large as 15 inches. It still had a very unfortunate accuracy rating of only 40-60%, and a recoil that would have been too strong for untrained soldiers to even remain on their feet. It's weight was no help either, coming in at about 50 lbs. heavier than the LR-1.Rapid Fire Laser Batteries (Pictured: Quad RFL)  One of the huge pinnacles of the third age was the production of rapid fire lasers. The technology was first mass produced in this age, and has been used ever since. Rapid fire lasers work different than burst fire lasers in that a burst fire laser uses electrical energy to charge and release a short laser blast, whereas rapid fire lasers can be modified to run off of live ammunition as well. A rapid fire laser continuously charges laser blasts as it fires, the downside of which is that an electrically powered RFL can overheat rather quickly, and limited by the amount of fire it can perform before malfunctioning. As time goes on, engineers and scientists develop better, more heat resistant materials, as well as differently structured barrels which disperse heat better. The first batteries were made with only two barrels, but they eventually exapnded to four barrels. While some ship-based RFL's have used live ammunition, using live ammunition for a large ship-sized RFL is both space and price innefficient, even though they can fire continuously without overheating. Unlike the small arms laser blasts, a shot from one of these weapons could easily blow through 20 inches of steel and leave behind a 6 inch diameter; it goes without saying that without neutron armor and energy shields, space vessels are very easy to tear apart. Most ship sized energy shields however will withstand tens of thousands of laser shots, even hundreds of thousands on very large ships with more powerful shields. Nuetron armor is usually about 10-20 inches thick, and can be up to 8 times as tough as steel. In order to do much more than scratch warships, you need more than lasers.Proton Cannon  Probably the most valuable weapons on any warship are its proton cannons. Lasers, Ion Cannons, Plasma Weapons, Missiles, and Machineguns will eventually surface enough damage to take out enemy ships; but the primary problem with them is that they can't very easily get through energy shields and neutron armor. Proton charges have the strangest ability to completely ignore energy shields. In addition, their TNT force is so powerful that some of the strongest proton cannons have been known to shatter 10 inches of solid steel beneath neutron armor. Measured in testing facilities, the average damage a proton cannon can dish out is to blast through 30 inches of steel and leave a 25 inch diameter hole, though realistically, you would very rarely need to do away with that much steel plating, only the largest and strongest warships have ever had steel hulls so thick. Proton cannons have a slow firing rate at one shot every 30 seconds; they can only hold one round at a time, and must otherwise be manually loaded. The proton charge projectile itself is slower than all other weapons on the battlefield, making it also highly innacurate except at very close range.Electron Fragmentation  One of the scariest weapons ever concieved, electron fragmentation weapons worked by concetrating protons in an atom and firing it out unleashing a chain reaction that forced atams to burst into their subatomic particles in the blink of an eye. Within seconds, small objects would be completely dismantled into subatomic particles, flying aimlessly through space. At first the size of things they could make such a weapon work against was limited, but over time they were able to destroy whole planets, and then even stars. In flashes, some of the largest ships could be taken out. Thankfully, electron fragmentation doesn't work on neutron armor, and is normally packed into a missile which can be shot to pieces by a laser blast or two. Electron fragmentation cannons are very large, very expensive, and are often detectable by a simple scan of a ship.Hyperspace Drive  For a long period of time, starships have relied on travelling the vast distances of space through traditional means such as ion propulsion and kinetic propulsion before that. Even with ion propulsion, the trips in space from one system to the next would take many days; which, relatively speaking is quite efficient, but the longer trips across the galaxy could take many years. Hyperspace put an end to that, and provided a new method of propulsion. The theory is that by using certain properties of wormhole travel, a space bound vessel could enter hyperspace and travel outside of the bounds of time and space. Time would nearly come to a halt for all things outside of hyperspaced vessels, allowing ships to arrive seemingly instantly. There is still a percieved time on such ships however, and that percieved time is still very lengthy, but it is not as long as with real time travel.The Intergalactic Gateway  The very first of any Titan technology discovered by the GHD Empire was a monstrous gateway. Baffling scientists, the ring shaped object was seemingly made out of stone. It was the first piece of evidence backing up a theory revolving around relics of the past, pointing towards the existence of a highly advanced race that disapeared long ago. For many years, the Giant Stone Ring, as it was simply called, was a wonder of space. Because of its construction, it was very evident that the ring did not form naturally, which begged the question of why in universe a civilization capable of achieving space travel, and crafting such a device would leave such a vast, seemingly useless piece of architecture lying in the middle of nowhere. Less than a year after the defeat of Tyranis, a group of archealogists reported that they had succesfully entered a section of the ring, and to their amazement, had discovered a vastly supperior system, powered by core matter reactors that worked differently than any that the Empire had ever produced. Believing that it was possible the ring was some kind of weapon, the nation raced to what was apparently in fact a spaceship nearly 20 times as large as the Excalibur. After further research into the technology by the scientists of the Empire, the theories of these ancient aliens was confirmed. While the ring itself held no significant technologies other than its power source, and its function, a spark flung into the hearts of explorers, scientists, engineers, and military leaders throughout the galaxy. A frantic search began to find more technologies left behind by this powerful race; some hoped to find weapons of war, to win the civil war that had just broken out; and others hoped to find the remnants of this long lost civilization, for answers to the origin of all life in the universe; still, more people hoped to find technologies that could bring a peaceful end to the war, through economic or even perhaps religious means. At first, the thoughts were still considered radical, as there was no evidence pointing towards any remnants of this ancient race anywhere in the known universe... at least, not until the Gateway turned on. Without any known casue, the massive ring's purpose was suddenly made known, as the inside of it, in a bright explosion of light, became a wormhole capable of transporting spaceships of just about any size to another galaxy. The target destination never seemed to change, and the device never turned off once activated. The wormhole was opened for good. Once the ring was activated, a permanent space structure was installed into it, claiming it for the Empire. After traveling through the wormhole, all kinds of experts began to search this new galaxy for evidence of the same ancient empire. Even though they had the gateway, it would be ages before they found even a shred of Titan technology beyond it.The Fourth Age (Tech.) Core Matter Energy Source  Core matter was discovered near the end of the 3rd age near the Kelebus system. For centuries, ships had seemingly disappeared after passing through one particular spot just outside of the star system. Finally, a science ship was commissioned to go out and see what the cause of it all was. As they got close to the epicenter of the disappearanes, they sent out a distress signal saying that their power was being drained at an alarming rate. In less than a single Nierdroan day, two science ships and a Golitah class warship went out to see what the cry for help was all about. They discovered the ship drifting through space with absolutely no power. They rescued the crew onboard, who shared with them their remarkable discoveries. At the epicenter of the disappearances was a moderately sized sphere of a substance never seen or heard of before. They unimiganitive bunch collectively began calling it the matter at the core of the anomoly, and it eventually became known as core matter. What they found was that the matter, if it even was in fact matter, acted somewhat like a black hole, except instead of having a massive center and sucking everything in because of an awesome gravitational pull, it pulled in energy itself. The energy fluctuated around the core matter sphere and at any given moment, a portion of the sphere would either be emmiting energy or pulling it back. It caused a massive system around the actual core matter to display a wondrous spectacle of bright light circling and fluctuating around the center. By the time the fourth age began, scientists had begun to master it. Though it could not be harvested or even moved, they managed to produce it synthetically. It would be stored in specialized reactors and could be charged simply by being brought near a massive source of energy, such as a star or a nebula. The fluctuations and circulations of the energy were made to echo through an entire energy grid. By using multiple core reactors, the energy they contained would travel in a continuous cycle between the reactors, never leaving a single portion of any power grid without excess energy to consume. Using synthetic core matter, engineers and scientists managed to master the art of energy conservation, and every ounce of energy that was used and converted into unusable energy was immediately puleld back to the core matter and recylced. This granted the empire the technology that had the potential to end hunger everywhere and provide truly unlimited power to all. The amount of energy that could be used in a synthetic core grid was dependent on the initial charge of the material; so an appropriate amount of reactors would still be needed in order to provide such an environment; in essence, one core matter is not enough for anything larger than a vehicle the size of a semi truck. While synthetic core matter reactors are perfect for use in space bound vehicles, any vehicles within a planet must, by nature, expel energy to move; so energy cannot be totally conserved in a vehicle on a planet, but all the same, the core matter can simply pull new energy from elsewhere, and will still last an incredibly long time.Hyperspace Warp Drive  Along with the production of the first core matter reactors, hyperspace warp drive came along. Even in the case of hyperspace engines, travelling across the vast distances in space took a long time. Hyperspace warp drives finally ended the lengthy travel times; with this technology, one could travel from one end of the galaxy to the other without any time passing. The warp drive allows the ship to move outside of the bounds of time and space. There is still a percieved time for passengers on a warping ship however, and aging can occur; but because the ship still travels along hyperspace, the lengthiest of trips are still only percieved to take a few days.The Fifth Age (Tech.) The Dragon Song Nova Burst Device  The Dragon Song weapon is the most powerful in the GHD arsenal. It targets a large celestial mass, and causes a system wide chain reaction that destroys everything and sucks it into a proto-star which very quickly evolves and becomes a whole sun system full of fully terraformed planets. The whole process takes a miraculous 7 days to complete, after which, the accelerated rate of evolution dies down. Read the whole story in the article Dragon.The Sixth Age (Tech.) LR-56  For a whole 2 ages (with the exception of the Dragon Song), the LR-10 was unsurpassed for efficiency, and was the only weapon produced. At the dawn of the first GGO, highly advanced military research facilities on Jestico, Athus, and Arckas began to develop newer, more powerful weapons for the war against the Grox. It wasn't until the fifth age however, that infantry began to become widely used on this battlefront. To match the demand for supperior firepower at an effective cost, engineers on Arckas developed the LR-56. The newest laser rifle was not battery powered like its predecessors, but used small cell-sized energy capsules as ammunition. A regular sized clip could fire off 240 high powered laser blasts. The LR-56 was the first widely used rapid fire laser rifle, which, as opposed to firing in short multi-shot bursts, had a continuous fire rating of 8 shots per second. Each shot was strong enough to blast through about 4.5 inches of steel and had a high accuracy rating ranging from 80-95%. The LR-56 also co-produced huge dual drum magazines which added only 5 lbs. to the weapon and increased the clip size to 2560 shots. The weight of the weapon itself was just as much as an LR-1.Diamond Matter Explosives  Diamond structured matter is a rare occurrence with most elements; it is also one of the strongest atomic structures, and diamond carbon alone has been known to break through solid steel. As there came a need for more and more powerful explosions packed into missiles, and alternative to expensive electron fragmentation missiles was missiles packed with diamond potential matter. Sheets of carbon, silicon, and other elements capable of being structured into diamonds would be packed between thin sheets of copper, gold, silver, and other rapidly heating metals and minerals inside of a missile. The outermost shell of the missile would be composed of adamntium plating segmented into shrapnel pieces made to be pushed out after enough expansion. The inner core of the missile would be packed with condensed hydrogen cylinders and the very center would contain a mixture of phosphorus and napalm. Small pockets of oxygen would be allowed in the device, to activate the phosphorous. When an ignition would be triggered, the center of the rocket would expand and heat up so quickly and so rapidly, that it would press and heat the diamond capable elements enough to force them to become diamond structured. The continuing expansion would then quickly break apart the tear away adamantium plating and hundreds of diamonds would burst forth in all directions, flying faster than can be seen, and destroying most everything in their path. The diamond particles have been noted to drive straight through neutron armor and steel alike, leaving many small holes for which the vacuum of space to terrorize whoever may be under the armoring. The force of the impact could also potentially shatter steel plating, but is not quite as effective against neutron armor. Still, with the exception of atomic missiles, and electron fragmentation missiles, DME Missiles are the most powerful available to the empire.The Seventh Age (Tech.) LR-3200  Right at the end of the Grox, engineers on Arckas developed a rifle to surpass even the LR-56 to match the constantly increase demand for supperior firepower on the planetary battlefront. They developed the LR-3200, calling it such because the new microcell ammunition allowed for the dual drum magazines to fit 3200 rounds of laser fire each. In addition, they managed to make the strength of the lasers slightly stronger by changing the way the ammunition travelled and reaction in the different chambers of the weapon. A single shot from an LR-3200 could blow a 6 inch dimater hole into 7 inches of steel. The high strength of the laser helped greatly to combat against newer stronger neutron armor, and against armed vehicles that were now being armed with energy shields. The firing rate and accuracy rating of the weapon is roughly the same as of its most recent predecessor.Warships The First Age (Warships) Federation Cruiser  The first warship constructed by the empire was the Federation Cruiser. The ship which could now be outmatched by modern transport vessels, was used in Kahhn's only interstellar war. It was a gunship class ship that possessed 2 weak rotary laser cannons, 4 rotary heavy machine guns, 4 space-to-space missiles, 2 solid-rocket fuel propulsion engines, and 9\" of steel plating. Even in it's time, it was considered weak, and even obsolete by surrounding empires. Kahhn's military expertise led the empire to victory with these small warships. Scale: Roughly the size of a middle class home.Federation Battle-Cruisers  The battlecruisers were specifically built to be bigger and more powerful than the original cruiser. They were over 3 times the size, and possessed 5 times the firepower. It was a gunship class ship that possessed 6 weak rotary laser cannons, 10 rotary heavy machine-guns, 12 space-to-space missiles, 4 space-to-surface missiles, 2 solid rocket fuel propulsion engines, and a 12\" steel hull. Scale: Roughly three times the size of a Federation Cruiser.Attack Cruiser  The Federation Attack Cruisers were large fully armed ships. They supported a two fleets of fighters, and were outfitted with the first turbo laser batteries. These ships began their use in the first war against the Grox, by Grand Admiral Tyra Jestico. This was the first warship considered to be up to par with allied empires.The Attack Cruiser was a frigate class warship carrying 4 weak rotary laser cannons, 10 rotary heavy machine guns, 24 space-to-space missiles, 6 space-to-surface missiles, 4 solid rocket fuel propulsion engines, 1 nuclear reactor engine, and a 12\" steel hull. Scale: Roughly twice the size of a WWII Battleship.The Second Age (Warships) Ogre Class Gunship  The Ogre Class Gunship replaced the federation battle-cruiser and has been used throughout history. Ogres have 12 weak rotary pulse laser cannons, 10 rotary machine-guns, 2 solid rocket fuel propulsion engines, a 12\" steel hull, and neutron armor. Scale: Roughly the same size as a Federation Battle-Cruiser.Tyrant Class Destroyer  Tyrants were destroyers that carried tons of missiles, although they were used as late as the Grox wars, Tyrants were quickly considered obsolete. They had 10 rotary burst-fire laser cannons, up to 260 missiles, 2 ion propulsion engines, possessed 12\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly the size of 10 story hotel.Defender Frigate  The Defender Class Frigate was made to replace the older federation attack cruiser, they had 10 rotary burst-fire laser cannons, up to 20 missiles, 2 ion propulsion engines, possessed 12\" steel hulls, neutr on armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly 1.5 times the size of a Federation Attack Cruiser.Monster Supply Ship  Prior to the construction of Monster supply ships, most space ferring vessels had the capability to land smoothly on the surface of the planet. But as ships became larger and more space oriented, a demand went up for carrier cruisers that could hundreds of tons of cargo, infantry, or planetary vehicles to the surface. Monsters were the first of these carriers, and often times did not make a hyperspace jump to a planert until it was cleared of enemy space forces, and because of this, they were rarely seen on a space battlefield. They were generally strong in defenses, and did have some weapons, but normally their primary defense would be any fighters within its cargo, considering these massive transports could carry in upwards of 100 squadrons at a time, depending on the size of the cargo ship. Monster supply ships have four large hangers for fighters and smaller vehicles, and four massive hangers in which sea-based battle-ships and other larger planetary weapons were stored and flied out once inside of a planet's atmosphere. Monsters can land on a planet's surface, which gave it the ability to quickly become broken down and restructured into a military base or colony. The deck of these ships are large and flat with hundreds of huge mechanical clamps that simply clamped onto large containers for transport.Goliath I Heavy Cruisers  The Goliath I class warships were considered huge. They were constructed by the Leroy empire in return for assistance in local interstellar wars. The Goliath I Heavy Cruisers house up to 10 fleets of fighters (at 4/squadron), state of the art plasma energy shields and heavy laser cannons. It's missile armaments were also high tech, new plasma based ammo-less missiles were put on board. The Goliaths were battleships that held 100 rotary burst-fire laser batteries, 42 rotary ion cannons, 20 plasma weapon chambers, 10 rotary heavy laser cannons, 8 ion propulsion engines, 12\" steel plated hull, neutron armor, and an energy shield. Scale: Roughly the size of a small city block (overhead)The Behemoth  The Behemoth was a one of kind \"Super-Dreadnought\" class ship, designed to be the flagship of the new fleet of Goliath I Class warships constructed by the Leroy Empire. It housed 250 fighter squadrons(at 4/squadron), and enough weapons to fight off an entire armada of battleships. Unfortunately it met its end quickly when it was forced to fight off the largest army ever assembled in one battle, it was destroyed at the hands of the Grox, on planet Salva. Its ruins became the memorial site and grave of Grand Admiral Salva, who commanded the ship at the time. The behemoth was a mega-dreadnought nearly the size of Manhattan, it possessed 5,250 rotary burst-fire laser batteries, 3,500 rotary ion cannons, 450 plasma weapon chambers, 275 fixed heavy laser cannons, 32 ion propulsion engines, 25\" steel plated hull, neutron armor, and an energy shield. Scale: Roughly the size of the Manhattan district, New York City (overhead).The Third Age (Warships) Overlord Heavy Battleships  The Overlord class was developed by Grand Admiral Tyranis in the use of the military coupe of the empire. Once the empire fell, he diverted all recourses to the construction of this highly advanced and incredibly large warship. The remnants of this massive army have been used throughout history. They were used primarily as support and defensive vessels however, due to the production of the Jericho Class right at the end of Tyranis's military control. Overlords were Heavy Battleships, they held 90 rotary rapid-fire laser batteries, 40 rotary proton cannons, 12 fixed Heavy Laser Cannons, 4 small electron fragmentation cannons, supported 15 fighter squadrons (4 fighters/squadron), was powered by 10 ion engines, possessed a 15\" steel hull, neutron armor, and an energy shield. Scale: Roughly twice the size off a Goliath.The Fourth Age (Warships) Jericho Class  The Jericho Class was developed after a long period of technological mixes between the many allied empires occupying The Great Horned Dragon Empire. It was the first ship to significantly narrow the gap of technological might between them and the Grox. It was used widely in war and defense but it was primarily an experimental craft, along with the Jericho II Class, that paved the way for the production of what became known as the first warship to wage a true war against the Grox. Jericho ships were heavy battleships, they held 80 rapid fire laser batteries, 30 rotary proton cannons, 20 plasma weapon chambers, 16 fixed heavy laser cannons, 4 small electron frag cannons, and supported up to 10 fighter squadrons (4 fighters/squadron). The Jerichos were powered by 2 state of the art core matter reactors, possessed 15\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly the size of an Overlord.Jericho III Class  The ship was put into mass production for use against the Grox in the first Grox Genocide Operation. It was the first ship in mass production more powerful than the typical Grox flagship. It was used in the extermination of nearly 100 Grox colonies. Jericho III's were super-heavy-battleships carrying 104 rotary rapid fire laser batteries, 46 rotary proton cannons, 30 plasma weapon chambers, 20 fixed heavy laser cannons, 4 small electron frag cannons, and supported up to 14 fighter squadrons (4 fighters/squadron). They were powered by 3 core matter reactors, had 15\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly 1.25 times the size of the Jericho I.J-35 Striker  The J-35 was a fighter designed for use in the genocide, prior to the production of this fighter, all flagships were filled with fighter crafts purchased from other empires. This fighter had 4 stationary rapid fire lasers, 2 proton cannons, and flew in groups of between 4 and 6 fighters. They were powered by 4 small ion propulsion engines, held 10\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shield. Scale: Roughly twice the size of a modern fighter jet.Jericho IV Class  The Pinnacle of the technology of the time, the Jericho IV Class was capable of holding its own against 6 Grox Flagships at a time. It was the last ship in the Jericho series, and ended the first Grox Genocide. The Jericho V was in early stages of conceptualization, but unfortunately funding was severed when the Galactic Economy crashed. The Jericho IV's were super-heavy battleships holding 124 high powered rapid fire laser batteries, 52 rotary proton cannons, 48 plasma weapon chambers, 24 fixed heavy laser cannons, 6 small electron frag cannons, supported up to 20 fighter squadrons (4fighters/squadron), were powered by 4 core matter reactors, had 15\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly 1.25 times the size of a Jericho III.Arckasan Military Drive Yards (and other Drive Yards)  All throughout the 4th age, during the war against the Grox, the Federation had been constructing more ships than ever before, and those ships were becoming bigger and stronger, and taking longer and longer to construct. Considering that the construction of most large vessels had to be done in space, the construction of a Jericho IV Class warship could take up to a year to complete on any given planet, though multiple warships could be constructed at once. With smaller vessels and planetary forces, factories had master the mass production processes that allowed for fighters to come off of a production line in less than 10 hours. Engineers of the federation gathered together to begin the contruction of a new kind of space shipyard; the drive yards. The concept was to essentially take an assembly line and scale it up to size, and wrap it around a planet. When the economic council and the Grand Admiral approved of their design, they were commission to begin construction on 5 Drive Yards throughout the galaxy, including one supermassive version around the planet Arckas. The other 4 Drive Yards were completed in about 8 years on Nierdro (about 16 years on Earth) and the Arckasan Drive Yards weren't finished until the end of the age. Once finished, the Arckasan Drive Yards became the single largest construct to ever be built; for their defenses, they had rapid fire laser batteries number in the billions, along with millions of other weapons. At any given point in time, the hangers could house about 5 million squadrons of fighters, which is beyond proposterous, and many times more than what would resonably be stored. The Arckasan Drive Yards are considered the greatest architectural wonder in the known universe. The Arckasan Drive Yards can construct over 10,000 dreadnoughts at a time, and finish them in less than a single Arckasan day (about 25 Earth days). The other 4 Drive Yards were built around Nierdro, Jestico, Salva, and Abyson (located in the Magrus system). Over the years, more Drive Yards were constructed around Athus, and some other key economic and military planets, as well as highly populated ones. Scale: Unfathomable (Arckasan)/Planetoid (Others)The Fifth Age (Warships) Shadow Class  The Shadow Class was the first and only cruiser class warship ever constructed by the Great Horned Dragon Empire, they were made to act as supply ships and to act as subordinate ships to the Sovereign and Jericho series warships. The Shadow Class is most noted for its high acceleration, making it quite useful as a transport vessel in planetary invasions. Shadow Class warships are cruisers and possess 12 rotary high-powered rapid fire lasers, 8 rotary proton cannons, were powered by a single core matter reactor, had 15\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Rougly 1.5 times the size of a Defender Frigate.Sovereign A Class  The Sovereign A Class headed off the second Grox Genocide Operation after the Galactic Economy was rebuilt. During the economic downturn, the Grox had destroyed some military colonies deeper than Salva and Jestico. The Grox were making their way towards Jestico. The first Sovereign warship was finished just in time for the assault, and along with older Jericho warships, defended against the last Battle of Jestico. After it proved a worthy investment, it was put into mass production, and began the massive war against the Grox. Sovereign A's were Dreadnoughts, they had 300 rotary high powered rapid fire laser batteries, 110 rotary proton cannons, 80 plasma weapon chambers, 35 fixed heavy laser cannons, 6 small electron frag cannons, 2 medium electron frag cannons, supported 32 fighter squadrons (4 fighters/squadron), were powered by 8 core matter reactors, had 15\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly twice the size of a Jericho IV, or two city blocks.S-22 Reaper  The S-22 Reaper Fighter was the second great fighter produced by the Great Horned Dragon Empire and was mass produced by the end of the Grox. It was twice as fast and 3 times more powerful than its predecessor, the J-35 Striker. Reaper fighters had 8 fixed high powered rapid fire lasers, 6 proton cannons, 2 small electron frag missiles, and flew in groups of 4-8 fighters. They were powered by 8 small ion engines, had 10\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly the same size as a J-35 Striker.Sovereign B Class  The next ship in the Sovereign series was widely used in special operations against the Grox. It was a powerful warship made it go deep within Grox Territory and and start picking off enemy colonies from within. Until it was replaced by the Sovereign C class, it was seldom used in battles on the warfront, and was rarely used in defense. Sovereign B's were dreadnoughts, they had 400 rotary high powered rapid fire laser batteries, 180 rotary proton cannons, 110 plasma weapon chambers, 44 fixed heavy laser cannons, 12 small electron frag cannons, 4 medium electron frag cannons, supported up to 40 fighter squadrons (4 fighters/squadron), were powered by 10 core matter reactors, held 15\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: roughly 1.25 times the size of a Sovereign A.Sovereign C Class  This ship was designed to move in groups of 3 or 4 and go within Grox territory to fulfill the job previously done by the sovereign B Class. It was not ever used on the warfront against the Grox, once the Grox called upon their few allies to assist in the war effort, it was shifted to be used in several wars against Grox allies and enthusiasts. Sovereign C's were dreadnoughts, 550 rotary high powered rapid fire laser batteries, 310 rotary proton cannons, 205 plasma weapon chambers, 80 fixed heavy laser cannons, 16 small electron frag cannons, 6 medium electron frag cannons, supported up to 32 fighter squadrons (4 fighters/squadron), were powered by 15 core matter reactors, possessed 15\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly twice the size of a Sovereign A.Ultimatum Class  This ship was put into mass production meant to finally end the Grox. Once the warfront moved beyond the former Grox homeworld, the Grox sent out for all allies they had made across the galaxy to come and defend them. When that happened, the war effort was divided. Many old ships had to be moved across the galaxy for wars elsewhere. The Ultimatum class was first deployed into combat when the forces on the front of battle were to divided to continue the assault. Although not quite as big, the Ultimatum class warships were nearly 3/4 the size of the Behemoth Super-Dreadnought, and over 500 were produced. In one legendary battle, one Ultimatum Class warship, \"Vini Vidi Vicci\" commanded by Grand Admiral Jason Jestico, destroyed over 500 Grox flagships, conquering 12 star systems, and never returning for repair. Ultimatums were heavy dreadnoughts, had around 4,750 rotary super-high-powered rapid fire laser batteries, 3,000 rotary proton cannons, 380 plasma weapon chambers, 146 fixed heavy laser cannons, 22 small electron frag cannons, 10 medium electron frag cannons, supported up to 220 fighter squadrons (4 fighters/squadron), were powered by 15 core matter reactors, had 18\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: 3/4 the size of the Behemoth.The U-150 Dominator  The U-150 Dominator was the last fighter produced to fight the Grox. It wasn't mass-produced until after their destruction however. This ship is no faster than the S-22 Striker, but possessed nearly 5 times its firepower. These fighters had 10 fixed super-high powered rapid fire laser batteries, 6 fixed proton cannons, 4 small electron frag missiles, 2 medium electron frag missiles, worked in groups of 2-4 fighters, were powered by a downsized core matter reactor, had 12\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: About 3 times the size of a modern fighter jet.U-3 Silencer  The U-3 was a stealth mission fighter. Although it possesses very little firepower, the U-3 is the most advanced single-pilot ship from this era. It is also the vehicle of choice for the allied forces best spies. It's slim stealth design also makes it visually stealthy as well as being concealed by radar, sonar, and other computerized detection systems. It has the fastest acceleration of all ships. It possesses only 2 fixed super-high-powered rapid fire laser cannons, 8 space-space missiles, 2 space-to-surface missiles, 1 medium electron frag missile, is powered by 2 exposed core matter reactors, has a 6\" steel hull, neutron armor, no energy shields, and being a stealth mission fighter, usually works alone. It is also the fastest ship in any planet's atmosphere. It also has a specialized nano-skin that alters its color and pattern for camouflage. Compared to a U-150 Dominator, the Dominator can last way longer, and dish out alot more damage in combat, but head to head, a Dominator may never hit, or even see a Silencer coming. Scale: About twice the size of a modern fighter jet.The Sixth Age (Warships) Excalibur  After the complete destruction of the Grox, the hunt was on. Ships searched out the galaxy for former Grox allies, and destroyed them. During that time, it was decided that the Great Horned Dragon Empire, and all of its allies should seek to unite the galaxy under one rule in order to establish peace in their time. The allies formed a supreme council and all adopted the Kahhn Articles. The altered it slightly to include a war council, that would watch over the actions of the Grand Admiral's actions, and decide if any measures were unreasonable. Once this was established, the expansion began, and a new warship, 10 times the size of the Behemoth (about the size of a moon planet in spore), was constructed as the flagship of the newly formed Galactic Federation. The ship was named the Excalibur. The Excalibur is a mega-dreadnought. It has about 52,500 rotary super-high powered rapid fire laser batteries, 32,000 rotary proton cannons, 1,500 plasma weapon chambers, 330 heavy laser cannons, 76 small electron frag cannons, 20 medium electron frag cannons, 2 large electron frag cannons, a Dragon song Nova Burst weapon, supports an astounding 2,550 fighter squadrons, is powered by 44 core matter reactor, has a 30\" steel hull, neutron armor, and energy shields. Some time later, in the 7th age, Grand Admiral Tyrannis revamped the Excallibur design with stronger shields, armor, and weapons, calling it the Excalibur Mach II. About 500 were constructed and used as major flagships under Tyrannis in the Galactic Civil War.Seventh Age (Warships) Galleas Class Supply Ships  For a very long time, the need for cargo transport and military transport did not drastically change, and could be fulfilled by Monster class supply ships. But after the war with the Grox, trade increased many times over, and there came a need for much larger supply ships. The Galleas class had 26 massive hangers that could hold 2 sea ferring battleships each. In addition, they possessed 16 smaller hangers for fighters and shuttles. The Galleas could ultimately carry about 40 times as much as the Monster's could. Galleas's could also, like the Monster class, land on the surface of a planet, and be modified into a colony. Though they were designed for trade, and most of the hangers were at first filled with sea based cruise liners and other luxury vehicles, when the Galactic Civil War came around, they were revamped for war, and made to carry in whole fleets of naval forces, and entire armies for planetary invasions.Valiant Class  The Valiant Class was a dreadnought made to replace the Sovereign A Class, It is a member of the Sovereign series and also has the class name of Sovereign D. The Valiant Class has 675 Rotary Super-High-Powered Rapid Fire Laser Batteries, 365 Rotary Proton Cannons, 250 Plasma Weapon Chambers, 35 Fixed Heavy Laser Cannons, 12 Small Electron Frag Cannons, 4 Medium Electron Frag Cannons, is powered by 16 Core-Matter Reactors, possesses 18\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. They supported up to 50 fighter squadrons. Scale: Roughly 1.5 times the size of a Sovereign C.Salva Class  The Salva Class warships are Heavy Dreadnoughts built right before the beginning of the Galactic Civil War. They were named after Grand Admiral Savla and the planet Salva. These massive warships held 800 Rotary Super-High-Powered Rapid-Fire Laser Batteries. 460 Rotary Proton Cannons, 315 Plasma Weapon Chambers, 80 Fixed Heavy Laser Cannons, 26 Small Electron Frag Cannons, 14 Medium Electron Frag Cannons, 1 Large Electron Frag Cannon, supported up to 64 fighter squadrons, powered by 16 Core Matter Reactors, have 22\" steel hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. Scale: Roughly 1.25 times the size of a Valiant Class, about one half the size of the Manhattan district, New York City.Jestico Class  The Jestico Class warships are by definition Mega-Dreadnoughts. They were named after all Grand Admiral Jesticos, and the planet Jestico. They began their construction under Grand Admiral Kaleb Jestico during the Galactic Civil War, only about 6,000 were ever produced. They are slightly smaller than the Behemoth in terms of overhead surface area. The Jestico Class warships possess 5,150 Rotary Super-High-Powered Rapid-Fire Laser Batteries, 2,975 Rotary Proton Cannons, 425 Plasma Weapon Chambers, 26 Small Electron Frag Cannons, 14 Medium Electron Frag Cannons, 2 Large Electron Frag Cannons, 32 Core Matter Reactors, supported up to 240 fighter squadrons, and have 26\" Steel Hulls, neutron armor, and energy shields. They also hold the Dragon Song Nova Burst deivce. Scale: Roughly the size of the Manhattan district, New York City. The new flagship \"Retribution\" commanded by first Grand Admiral Kaleb Jestico, then by Grand Admiral Fafnir, and finally came into the hands of Grand Admiral Zackariah. It Possessed 6,000 Rotary Super-High-Powered Rapid-Fire Laser Batteries, 3,500 Rotary Proton Cannons, 510 Plasma Weapon Chambers, 30 small electron frag cannons, 18 Medium Electron Frag Cannons, 4 Large Electron Frag Cannons, is powered by 40 Core Matter Reactors, support up to 300 Fighter Squadrons, and has a 30\" Steel Hull, Neutron Armor, and Energy Shields. It possesses a Dragon Song Nova Burst weapon. Another noteworthy flagship is \"The Black Emerald,\" captained by Admiral Cinder. More Information can befound here: The Black EmeraldTitanic Age (GSSOC Only) X-801, \"Arck;\" X-802, \"Maverick;\" and X-803/804, \"Nightmare,\" and \"Dreamscape\"  After unearthing the city of Arckadium, along with various other Titan cities throughout the galaxy, the GHD Empire Military branches in the Milky Way designed and built a total of 4 frigate sized warships using advanced Titan tech. The ships were beyond the capabilities of mass production, however the advanced weapons, armoring, and shields made them far more formiddable than fleets of much larger ships such as the Jestico Class Mega Dreadnaughts. Each ship is uniquely designed to the specification of the most decorated and qualified of admirals in the GHD Military, made specifically to be used by them as their new flagships. The base of the design is relatively similar in each ship; but the specifications are changed vastly. They are all armored with starforged steel plating, 8 inches thick. They have nanotechnology throughout the ship that serves the purpose of reairs, and a nanoskin on top of the armor that is capable of camoflauging the vessel. They each have nuetron armoring as well, powered by Titanic core matter reactors that nearly double the armor's normal effectiveness. The ships are equiped with extremely powerful Aurora Cannons, and the Maverick even has two Aurora Chain Cannons. Nightmare is equiped with two Stellar Plasma Arc genorators, and Dreamscape is equiped with a vastly powerful Thermoplasmatic Shield Manipulator. The other three ships possess standard GHD Energy Shields. In addition to Titan technology, the ships are each armed with 2 Mass Propulsion Guns, a noteworthy arsenal of Diamond Matter Explossive Missiles, and some Proton and Ion Cannons. While \"Arck\" only supports about 2 squadrons of fighters, Maverick, and Dreamscape support up to 12 squadrons, and Nightmare supports up to 16. X-801 \"Arck\" - Admiral (6 Stars) Ferrehtulu X-802 \"Maverick\" - Admiral (6 Stars) Aradriem X-803 \"Nightmare\" - Admiral (6 Stars) Wroetho'ae X-804 \"Dreamscape\" - Admiral (6 Stars) CinderPlanetary War Vehicles 1st Age B1C Heavy Tank  Invasive forces were seldom used in the first age, but when they were, the vehicle of choice for ground support was the B1C Heavy Tank. The B1C is armored with an 8\" Steel Hull, and has 8 Surface to Surface Missile Launchers. It's primary armament is a small laser cannon.Bobcat IFV  The Bobcat Infantry Fighting Vehicle was a small, 2 person armored vehicle with a single armament: a dual rotary heavy machine-gun. It was armored in a relatively thin 5\" Steel body.Troop Shuttle  The Infantry transport shuttle is fighter sized craft with 2 missile launchers, 8\" steel hull, and lots of cargo space. This early craft could only be used within a planets atmosphere, as it's proulsion is proppeller based.2nd Age Hunter Seeker  The Hunter Seeker assault craft is a sea based unit made for use on planets with little to no land masses. They are made to dive under water, and are armed with 8 sea-sea missile launchers. They possess a 8\" Steel Hull.B2B Light Tank  The B2B Light Tank was designed to be lighter, and faster than the B1C. It possesses the same armaments, and only a 5\" steel hull.3rd Age B2D Heavy Tank  The B2D Heavy Tank is more of an artillery unit than a tank. It possesses a dual weak laser cannons, and two rapid-fire lasers. It's hull is 12\" thick steel.Mandalore Class Battle-Cruiser  This sea going vessel has a 15\" thick steel hull, and neutron armor. It is armed with 2 rotary dual rapid-fire lasers, 2 sea to land missile launchers, and a rotary triple heavy laser cannon. It also has a landing pad for fighter sized craft.GHD Mechanized Infantry  The GHD Mechanized Infantry unit is a completely robotic unit controlled remotely. They are about twice the size of a dragon and are composed of 4\" steel plating, glider wings, jet propulsion, and 2 dual rapid-fire lasers, and 4 small missiles. The mechanized infantry was designed to completely take live infantry off the battle-field, but it ended up being too expensive, and taking too long to construct, vs training regular infantry. They still are assigned to missions of high-risk to regular infantry, and act as great fire suppressors. Originally Tyranis wanted a cybernetic infantry, but soldiers weren't willing to become so similar to the Grox.4th Age B2E Dual Artillery  The B2E Dual Artillery is an artillery/tank combo. It possesses 2 Rotary heavy laser cannons, and 11 surface to surface missile launchers. It has a 12\" steel hull.Kedalbe Class Battle-Ship  The Kedalbe Class Battle-Ship is the last sea going vessel ever designed. It is the size of a space going Battle-Cruiser. It has a 18\" thick steel hull, and neutron armor. It is armed with 2 sea to land missile launchers, and 3 rotary triple heavy laser cannons.5th age  No new planetary vehicles were produced in this era. All recourses were put into the production of space faring vessels.6th Age Arckasan Heavy Tank  The Arckasan Heavy tank was the first tank to be given neutron armor. Prior, tanks were not given neutron armor because it was too expensive to put more armor on such a small unit, that was already armored with a steel hull. The tank also has a 10\" steel hull, a rotary high-powered rapid-fire laser blaster, 2 super-high-powered rapid-fire laser blasters, and a single rotary heavy laser cannon.Metal Dragon Hounds  More commonly known as \"the hounds of hell\" these mechanized units were finally able to realize the dream of taking live infantry off the battle-front. They are to date the most advanced display of military science known. These hounds are designed to act stealthily and use melee attacks against opponents. They also are designed to rip enemy vehicles and buildings to shreds, using the recourses to create smaller copies of themselves. These copies follow their creator until they have collected enough scraps to fully develop. They posses a nano-skin technology that regenerates using chemical compounds in the ground, water, and sunlight, just like a plant. their metal parts can be repaired automatically, the same way they create clones. Although many scientists are experimenting with the same technology to attempt to reproduce self-sustaining life-forms, with the ability to evolve over time, have had several failures, they have proven to be the most successful attempt to create artificial intelligence, and even dive into artificial personality. Some theorists believe that they could potentially evolve themselves, but it would take millions of years to actually examine any significant evolutionary change, just as in real life.7th Age Trebuchet Artillery  The Trebuchet Artillery was designed right before the Galactic Civil War, it has a 10\" steel hull, and neutron armor. It is armed with 2 small electron frag cannons, 3 dual rotary weak laser cannons.Terror Dual Tank  The Terror Dual Tank is massive. It has a rotary dual electron frag cannon, that can switch into a dual heavy laser cannon. It possesses a rotary dual weak laser cannons, with a fixed high-powered rapid-fire laser cannon. It has a 10\" steel hull, neutron armor, and is the first planetary unit to hold an energy shield. Prior, the energy shield generator was too large.Locust First Assault Transport Craft  The Locust is the first troop transport craft developed since the first age. It is a gunship sized space vessel that can fold up it's wings and flight gear to become a ground based heavy artillery vehicle. A locust can also carry two Terror Dual Tanks, making it even more effective as a transport. A small group of Locusts can fly to a planets surface undetected, and launch a small-scale assault or invasion. They are armored in a 15\" steel hull, neutron armor, and possess an energy shield. The have 2 multi all-purpose missile launchers, and a single small electron frag cannon. They have 2 additional super-high-powered rapid-fire laser cannons. In addition to two heavy tanks, they can carry 20 infantry soldiers each. They can also instead carry a heavy artillery and 20 infantry units. They can also dive underwater. To the Left is an image of a locust with wings fully extended, either for landing, or take off. To the right is a locust folded up for space flight. Another thing the locusts can do is act like fighters, and be stored inside capital ships. They take up the space of a whole fighter squadron, but due to the locusts slow rate of acceleration, it speeds up space travel to store them within a large, faster ship. The locust was designed by Nocturnian engineers for the assault in the Retth Cluster during the Galactic Civil war. Nocutrnians, which are much smaller than Dragons, can fit 2 time the amount of infantry as Dragons can.Spode Archives  The Spode Archives is an amazingly enormous building on the Larrax's former Homeworld. It is known over the galaxy for its beautiful architecture, reminiscent of the Larrax, and holds a very large record of historic species and histories from many places over the galaxy. It is considered one of the largest museums in the galaxy. A nickname for the Spode Archives is the Spodepedia, after the museum Sporepedia.List of Exhibits Archetype Exhibits Civilization Exhibits Historical Exhibits Dhragolon  The Dhragolon are an ancient race existing for thousands of years.\u00a0 They used to be a major power in the Milky Way galaxy but have since been nearly decimated. Survivors have migrated to the Andromeda galaxy. They were formerly one of the strongest races in the galaxy, with a massive\u00a0kingdom covering a major portion of the Perseus arm and spawning from their homeworld Ucharpli.\u00a0 Although their population was not even one trillion, they still can maintain control over their portion of the Perseus arm.\u00a0 However, one cannot say they are the most technologically advanced empire as the Dhragolon tend to use more primitive styles of combat. Instead, the Dhragolon evolved to be one of the most humble and wisest races of the galaxy.  It is commonly believed that the\u00a0Dhragolon promise they will destroy all but one chosen race whom they have judged to be pure,\u00a0which keeps\u00a0all others in fear.\u00a0 This gives the Dhragolon the nickname of \"Angels of Death\".\u00a0 Other races are unsure if they are the chosen one or not, and some desperately try to expand to slow down their possible destruction while some even worship the Dhragolon or adopt their religion to please them. The Dhragolon have evolved over time to make an effort to destroy anyone who becomes tainted. A race becomes tainted when a major Commandment of Kray is violated such as destroying planets or threatening others.\u00a0 (See below for the list of commandments.) Once a race is tainted, the Dhragolon cannot stop attacking unless the race becomes untainted somehow which is incredibly rare. It is believed that the Dhragolon behave this way due to a long-standing psychological impact on the entire race. Upon first entering space, they encountered many dangerous empires which did practices considered unacceptable to them. While the Dhragolon attempted to tolerate these empires, they would not do the same back to them. Because of this, the Dhragolon evolved believing that such evil empires must be eradicated from the galaxy in order to bring peace. As a direct side effect, they are slow to trust other empires. They still remain cautious even of their own allies being prepared to fight back if they turn against them.Appearance  The Dhragolon are tall blue-scaled reptilian humanoids with even darker blue hair on their heads. They have eyes in the front of their heads allowing for depth perception; eye color often varies between blue, purple, orange and red. However, the Dhragolon are not known for having great eyesight as most Dhragolon have difficulty perceiving colors such as red, orange or yellow. To make up for this, their hearing is incredible. Their pointed ears are capable of detecting a pin drop from two miles away. Lastly, they also have a row of small, studded teeth; Dhragolon mostly eat meat but are capable of consuming plants as well. Dhragolon have three fingers along with one opposable thumb on each hand as well as four toes. Each finger contains claws as hard as steel. Dhragolon also bear retractable wings. Usually, the wings can compact so deep into their backs that it is almost as if they were not there. However, some Dhragolon with larger wings can actually use them to fly although most can only glide or hover short distances. Dhragolon are quite tall mostly because of the low gravity of Ucharpli. Adult males usually weigh 200lbs at a height of 7 feet. The unusual height-weight ratio allows them to move with great dexterity and glide for longer periods of time than other similar dragon species. Their reaction time can be as fast as 0.05 seconds. The drawback is the light-weight allows them to easily be knocked back on higher gravity planets by most species, even an average human. To compensate, it is common practice for warriors to wear heavy, metal armor to increase their weight.\u00a0 A Dhragolon's brain is also very sophisticated, most having high IQs compared to other races.\u00a0 This results in their speech being very eloquent and proper, and they find simpler languages to be amusing. Most Dhragolon prefer to speak languages originating from Ucharpli as most of the time, they cannot pronounce some unique sounds in other alien's vocabulary. However, this does not stop them for learning them fairly quickly as their enhanced cognitive thinking allows them to detect patterns within seconds.Biology  The Dhragolon descended from the Brevis venator (or Dracosaur), which was a flightless, quadrupedal dragon that hunted in packs.\u00a0 However, the Dhargolon eventually developed smaller teeth allowing them to eat a greater variety of food. Unlike many carbon-based species, the Dhragolon are dextro-amino acid based; they cannot eat the food of levo-amino acid based species which is that of most including humans. The closest\u00a0cousin of the Dhragolon (which is now extinct) is the Procerus rimor, a nomadic erect dragon similar to the modern Dhragolon. Because the Dhragolon evolved with excellent agility and fitness, they naturally have long life spans, the average being 500 Earth years.\u00a0 Their reptilian build also makes them age much more slowly. The ratio of human to Dhragolon lifespan is 9/52.\u00a0 Because Dhragolon spend more time as children, they are able to learn at an extraordinary rate during the first few decades of their life and is also a direct cause of a young Dhragolon population. Unfortunately, Dhragolon are incapable of reproducing until age 104 which is also mental maturity. This is because they mature very slowly. For unknown reasons, the chances of a male Dhragolon are higher than females, the former being 60%. Likewise, females are well respected and very few ever join the Peace Keeper caste. Dhragolon are most adept to desert climates. Although they are cold-blooded, their scales act as solar panels which can absorb light from nearly any source. Effectively, a Dhragolon can simply warm up by standing out in the sun for a few minutes. This heats up their bodies to almost match those of warm-blooded creatures, and even speeds up their metabolism to those of mammals. Even when the sun is not out, their scales still retain heat which allows them to survive in subzero climates. This has allowed them to thrive on the continent of Aggateya, which is located at the southern pole on Ucharpli. Contrary to humans, the Dhragolon\u00a0did not develop technology as quickly but instead developed their philosophy much faster. Consequently, since the Dhragolon departed the Malick Cluster, their technology has largely remained unchanged for a few thousand years.\u00a0 Thus, the Dhragolon are known to be among the wisest races of the galaxy. A Dhragolon needs about 6 hours of sleep every day.\u00a0 Dhragolon are normally nocturnal however as their vision is more adept to darkness. Their vision is similar to canines and felines in that they have difficulty distinguishing bright colors, but can see at night almost as clearly during the day. The majority of Dhragolon are psychic to a small degree and develop telepathic abilities, though there are always a few that are born without them. They often use Telepathic Amplifiers to keep focused and better locate someone in the galaxy. Along with that, 95% of the Dhragolon population have an INTJ personality, which is often the reason behind their ability to think clearly and reason more than other races. 4% are ISTJs, while the remaining 1% make up small amounts of the other Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personalities.Taxonomy  Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Reptilia Order: Squamata Family: Dracodae Genus: Procerus Species: Procerus optimus The Dhragolon belong to the Dracodae family, which is the family that is classified as intelligent dragons. Procerus is a genus for bipedal dragons, and optimus describes them as noble. Thus, their species name roughly means \"tall nobles.\"Government  Main Article: Dhragolon Federal Monarchy Dhragolon government is theocratic - it is highly based on the practices of Neo-Renyanism. The government also incorporates a monarchy as a single king or queen will be in power descending from a single family. In order to attain such title, the candidate must complete an arduous test that only the most intelligent and strongest Dhragolon can pass to ensure that only the worthy will rule. Such a test involves a 1,000 question exam, a 20 mile agility course and more. However, the monarch is not without counsellors - one from each caste. This is to help ensure that everyone in the empire is equally represented and to make sure the monarch does not become corrupt. Also, different countries of Ucharpli which still stand today are allowed to practice their own form of government. In the past, the government was quite oppressive until the Yallvus Revolution when Rustiagon Dralla overthrew Altus Banya and rewrote the Dhragolon Constitution. Even though Dralla had introduced many democratic elements, the Dhragolon Federal Monarchy is still not a true democracy.Society and Culture Caste System  Unlike many caste systems, all castes are equal in status even the royals.\u00a0 A Dhragolon is placed in a caste often by their heritage and physical and mental abilities.\u00a0\u00a0A Dhragolon can also choose to change their caste if they believe they have the abilities of another.\u00a0 (This was not possible before Year 0.) One member of each caste also serves as a representative in the Council of Ucharpli. W'karra (Workers)  This caste is often called the working class, but it is not an accurate enough term to describe them. They consist of the mainstream population who perform many skilled and unskilled labor jobs which vary from mining spice to cooking. Altasza (Artisans) This caste makes a variety of different objects, but most are holy objects made for Kray. They create the entertainment for the rest of the Dhragolon. Paxursza (Peace Keepers) The caste that\u00a0helps defend the kingdom. This mostly consists of the members of the Kray's Will for the Dhragolon. Many Peace Keepers were former Workers who were drafted. Dormeckithia (Philosophers) They write the holy texts and methods to live one's life. They are the thinkers of the Dhragolon and consists of priests. Rustiagar (Royals) They manage the kingdom and consists of the Royal Family as well as any ambassadors. Dormesithia (Scientists) They study the universe and develop new technologies.Duel Tournaments  Smaller scale conflicts between nations would be settled through enormous duel tournaments were held taking place over several years. (Of course, larger conflicts may result in full-scale wars.) Technologically, not much has changed when it comes to ground battles as the sword and armor technique is still used today. Of course, the armor's materials have been improved. The nations in conflict would battle it out without anyone getting killed (which was against the Commandments). Mock wars were held within arenas made of stone. If someone were to die, even by accident, the one who suffered the loss automatically won the conflict as it was the ultimate penalty. Sometimes, this may even fuel furthur disputes and the duel tournament may turn into a war. The rules for the Duel Tournaments are documented in a pamphlet known as \"Manual for Duelling\". The author is unknown but it dates back to as early as the time when Altus Xurtag ruled. After Yallvus conquered Ucharpli, duel tournaments became obsolete as conflicts were now geared towards more violent alien races who had no intention of participating in duelling. Today, duel tournmanents are primarily for entertainment purposes to honor Dhragolon culture.Entertainment  Many consider Dhragolon entertainment to be primitive compared to other races. This is because they have not evolved much entertainment-wise. Competitive Dueling- This originated after serious duel tournaments became obsolete which was approximately around the time the Dhragolon entered space. Airball- Some Dhragolon with developed wings have their own sport which is similar to soccer, but takes place in the air. Dhragolon that do not fly sometimes participate while wearing jetpacks. Some variants include orbs that automatically move. Challenge Puzzles- The Dhragolon, being a wise race, developed their own ways to challenge their minds with a wooden puzzle that bears a resemblance to both a Rubik's Cube and a slider puzzle. Footracing- The most common entertainment is where Dhragolon compete to see who is the fastest runner.Art and Music  The Dhragolon are renowned musicians having composed some of the best songs in the galaxy. The Dhragolon had simple, wooden instruments consisting of what resembles flutes, drums and tambourines. The music style was similar to that of Native Americans. However, since the late Altus era, music has evolved to sound more orchestral. In some concerts, the audience closes their eyes to become \"one with the music\" entering a calm, soothing mental state. Visual art is quite different from most other races. All paintings or drawings are monochrome with a blue hue. This is most likely because Dhragolon cannot see brighter colors. The Dhragolon are also great writers with a rather unique style. The usual format for Dhragolon stories includes allusions to legends of Ucharpli with a moral to abide by. Most of Ucharpli typically writes in a folklore dialect. However, fiction is very rare as Dhragolon prefer to either base their stories on the truth or retell a previous tale from a unique point of view. (Example: A modern retelling of The Lair of the Garmatox or a story based on the adventures of a real explorer, but often with different names.)Religion  Many religions exist among the Dhragolon, but the most popular is Jamzezism which\u00a0involves the belief in a single\u00a0God known as \"Kray\", which also translates to Wilrite, Sporr, or Macksis in other Dhragolon languages. Although originally conceived during the Second Era in modern-day Yallvus, many variations of the religion have diverged among the Dhragolon. Such variations differ in Kray's views of the Dhragolon people.Creation Myth  Some believe that Kray created the first Dhragolon, told them their destiny and left the universe to run on its own while others thought that Kray controlled every action of the universe and planned everything out from the start. In the Neo-Renyanist version, (the most dominant one and most scientifically compatible) it is generally accepted that Kray did not actually create the Dhragolon themselves, but instead in the form of a dragon perched atop Ucharpli's tallest mountain and let out a roar of wisdom, granting intelligence and free will to the Dhragolon. It is also widely believed that Kray flew to other worlds to grant the same intelligence to other races.  In Jamzezism, it is believed that there also exists a demon named Uszaroth (pronounced Oo-sah-roth).\u00a0 This demon is said to once have been a servant of Kray, but was banished due to his differing ideologies.\u00a0 Uszaroth believed that the Dhragolon should not follow any rules and live lives of anarchy. Thus, around the time Jamzeze first spread the word of Kray, Uszaroth had plans of his own and created the religion of Uszarothian.Ideologies  Jamzezism teaches that balance in the universe must be maintained through peace. If the balance is upset, it is the duty of a Dhragolon to restore such peace whether it be aggressively or not. It is highly debated whether evil should exist or not. Some variations claim that all evil should be wiped out, while others believe that it exists as a counterbalance to good. Jamzezists respect other religions as they still believe that Kray is being worshipped in another form.\u00a0 However, the worship of false idols is not tolerated as well as\u00a0religions\u00a0and philosophies\u00a0that violate the major Commandments of Kray.\u00a0 Even the Uszarothian religion is allowed, because it is believed that a balance between order and chaos must be maintained, although Uszarothians are few in number. Shortly after Dralla's expeditions, Renya Aknar, a descendant of Renya Tarkith, founded the branch of Jamzezism which he called Neo-Renyanism.\u00a0 The philosophy asserted that the Dhragolon should be more aggressive in suppressing evil. The religion is also what officially made the Dhragolon the holy knight archetype which by coincidence was at the beginnning of the Space Age. Many times throughout history, the Dhragolon encountered empires of pure evil, and declared them tainted for violating their Commandments. When a race is declared tainted, the Order and Balance Branch performs a short ritual where the judge recites a sentence condemning the specific race to be tainted. Saying these words lays a curse upon that entire race; other aliens will get a feeling of fear and unrest when they look at the tainted race. This is why many races fear the Grox, especially after the Dhragolon declared them tainted. Some also debate the exact existence of the \"pure\" race, or Khazakion. Some believe it is the only other race in the galaxy besides the Dhragolon that will survive a massive crusade against evil. More modern beliefs regard the Khazakion as the concept of a pure, innocent people. Today, the term Khazakion has evolved to become the Dhragolon word for a strong ally with good intentions. For example, the Karnasaur Meritocratic Federation and the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate would be referred to as among the Khazakion.After Life  When a Dhragolon dies, their soul is released from the body. They will not be able to move on until their last wish is fulfilled or until the damage done by any sins they have committed during life have been undone. Upon fulfillment of their last wish, they live an eternal life in Kray's Realm. In its raw form, the world is merely a blue sky with clouds, but it takes the shape of a paradise to the Dhragolon's desire. It consists of their happiest and most glorius memories. If a soul remains in the mortal world for too long, it starts to become tormented reliving the worst moments of their lives over and over again. The Dhragolon make sure that any soldiers that die will do so honorably to prevent this terrible fate. Also, in Jamzezism, there is believed to be a parallel dimension known as the Infernal Nether, a firey world where sinners live forever as tormented souls. Only the truly evil will ever go here. The moon, Athen, is said to be part of the dimension somehow. Subsequently, the opposite realm known as Kray's Realm is said to be the location where souls rest in peace. It is a paradise which takes the form of an individual's desire.Prophets  A list of important figures in Jamzezist history. Currently incomplete. Jamzeze - A middle aged Dhragolon traveller who met an old man lost in what is now Kray's Sculpting Field. He is credited as the founder of the religion itself. Renya Tarkith - A high priest from the early Third Era who directly served Altus Malick, suggesting the concept of bringing order to the Dhragolon to achieve peace. Renya Aknar - A high priest who originally served Altus Banya, but was spared during the Yallvus Revolution and served Rustiagon Dralla. After Dralla's discoveries of evil empires, Renya had an epiphany regarding the Dhragolon's destiny bringing about the most dominant Jamzezism variation.Jamzezism Variations Unrelated Religions Commandments of Kray  The Dhragolon abide by some laws which were formed both from their religion and their government which are as follows.\u00a0 These commandments also serve as the constitution for the Dhragolon. Major Commandments \"No Dhragolon shall ever worship false gods.\" (This only applies to false idols.) \"No Dhragolon shall ever kill one another without good cause.\" \"No Dhragolon shall ever lie without good cause.\" \"All Dhragolon must respect the spirit of fighting from another race until that race violates the Commandments.\" \"No Dhragolon shall ever destroy innocent life in the process of destroying evil.\" (Innocent life refers to nonsentient species.) \"No world shall ever be destroyed before its natural apocalypse.\" (In other words, don't destroy planets.) \"No Dhragolon may threaten another without good cause.\" \"No Dhragolon may slander about one another.\" \"All Dhragolon must respect the rulings of the monarch provided he is not corrupted.\" \"If another alien race violates a major commandment, they shall be declared tainted.\" \u00a0(The race is only delcared tainted if the entire race violates the commandments rather than just one individual as the Dhragolon understand that even the purest of races have imperfections.) The Newest Commandment: \"The Grox are no longer valiant warriors after destroying the verdant world of Morta; the Grox\u00a0are the cause of all evil in the galaxy and must be destroyed along with all other tainted races.\" Morality Commandments \"All Dhragolon must respect the other castes and his own.\" \"A Dhragolon may move to another caste provided he has good reason.\" \"If a Dhragolon criticizes another, he or she must criticize contructively.\" \"All Dhragolon must treat one another as they want to be treated.\"Language  Main Article: Yallvus Talk The majority of Dhragolon speak a language which they call Yallvus Talk.\u00a0 Its alphabet consists of the majority of sounds the Dhragolon mouth can make which totals up to approximately 40 different letters. A Dhragolon can make difficult sounds such as flicking the tongue off the roof of the mouth with ease, though some dialects have difficulty with long vowels. However, they can more easily make elongated consonant sounds such as \"k\" or \"b\" than humans can. Naturally, Dhragolon speak eloquently and with proper language similar to how Vulcans speak.\u00a0 Some common ways to refer to another besides their name is by Brother or Sister for peers.\u00a0 Young One is often used if an older\u00a0Dhragolon is talking with a child or someone significantly\u00a0less matured\u00a0than them, and Mister or Misteress is used when conversing with someone much older or matured.\u00a0 The Dhragolon find it awkward how other species talk in simple ways, and some even find it amusing. Hence, a common Dhragolon phrase often considered rude is, \"I find your simple language amusing.\"Writing  The letters of the Yallvusian alphabet are based on one of the first Dhragolon phoenetic alphabets consisting of claw markings in stone tablets, which is often a pattern of lines and dots. Prior to the development of this system, the Dhragolon used glyphs as a form of writing, but many soon realized that it would be impractical with the countless objects in the world. The only Dhragolon civilization to have retained glyphs are the Malinians. Although their written words are much shorter, there are more than 80000 different characters, but many are seldom used today.Military  Main article: Kray's Will for the Dhragolon The \"Kray's Will for the Dhragolon\" (also known as the KWD) consists of all peacekeepers and is often regarded as amongst the most powerful military forces in the galaxy. However, despite their power, the Dhragolon use weapons that many other species consider archaic. For example, the Warrior Division uses swords; heavier troopers may use swords equipped with energy enhancements. Dhragolon have very little need of projectile weaponry on the ground because of their excellent agility and running abilities. However, the Starsailors use modern laser weaponry for their ships as it is more practical when it comes to dealing with other races.Divisions  The KWD consists of two divisions: the warriors and the starsailors known in Yallvus Talk as Churszath and Alda'Kapura respectively. These are analagous to what many races refer to as the Army and the Marines. Warriors handle many ground battles while Starsailors often are on board space cruisers.Ranks  The ranking system for both divisions is as follows, which is very different from many other species. By proving themselves in battle, a peacekeeper may gain a rank. Apprentice Intermediate Experienced Master/Captain (for Warriors and Starsailors respectively) Grandmaster/Grandcaptain (for Warriors and Starsailors respectively) Grandmasters and Grandcaptains are very rare as it takes almost as much skill to become one as it does to become the king. Masters and Captains are much more common and often lead squadrons. The most well known Captain is Captain Brekar Urtag as he led the squadron alongside the Eteno fleet in destroying the Galaxy Buster's outer structures.Economy  \"Whilst it's necessary for the government to regulate the economy when it goes into turmoil, we Dhragolon prefer to do our own thing. After all, we are a free people.\" -President of T'szira Spice Co. During the Second and Third Eras of the Dhragolon, gems and gold coins were used for currency. Shortly after the beginning of the Fourth Era, however, they soon became discontinued as currency and became a traded good after learning that gems were not as common on other planets. The Sporebuck became the new currency as not only was it more conventional, but more easily transferred as data between distant colonies and other empires. Gold Coin - 1 Sapphire - 10 Emerald - 20 Ruby - 50 Diamond - 100Spice  The Dhragolon are known by other races to be a major purple spice trader.\u00a0 The majority of Dhragolon colonies are indeed purple spice colonies. T'szira Spice Co. is the largest spice company created by the Dhragolon. Owned by the worker caste T'szira family, the company has outposts on nearly every colony. It was originally founded in 160 4E and is still recognized as the one of the galaxy's most successful trading companies even after 7,000 years.Oil  The Dhragolon use a lot petroleum in their gem and spice mining. Areas on Ucharpli like the Frozen Wasteland as well as The Great Sculpting Field were rich oil reserves in the past. Most of their oil comes from other planets such as Jaran. During the Third Era, the Yallvusian Union took advantage of oil wars that took place between other nations, which helped the YU conquer the world.Technological Advances  \"Whilst we do enjoy the ingenuity of other races, we much prefer to use our technology. The only way for us Dhragolon to learn anything is to figure it out ourselves.\" -Rustiagon Dralla after meeting the Imp race The Dhragolon tend to not rely on technology as most other races preferring to only use what is necessary. This is also to keep to their old ways. Most of the time, they refuse to use other aliens' technology and would prefer to figure things out for themselves. Since the Dhragolon were among the first races to enter space within the past few thousand years, the Dhragolon used to be one of the most technologically advanced empires in the galaxy but have since been dwarfed by the rise of other empires such as the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate and The Karnasaur Empire. Still, the Dhragolon remain advanced philisophically and are not without their share of unique technology.Dragon Cruiser  The Dragon Cruiser is a small fighter-class starship about the size of an apartment which only the current king can pilot.\u00a0 Usually, the king is aboard alone because by tradition the king is the \"watcher of the kingdom\".\u00a0 The ship is equipped with a variety of weapons in order for the king to defend himself from enemy attacks.\u00a0 These weapons include autoturrets, mega proton missiles, mega bombs, and a mega laser.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike most spaceships of its class, the Dragon Cruiser is equipped with both a Lightspeed Electron Drive and a Warp Drive allowing it to travel across the whole empire within a few days.\u00a0 Usually, only trading ships and carriers only possess both engines.\u00a0 However, instead of directly flying to a colony to contact it, it is more practical to use Telepathic Amplifiers to communicate as it is much faster.\u00a0 The Dragon Cruiser is\u00a0also equipped with normal\u00a0jet engines for simple\u00a0non-interplanetary travel.Defenses  Of course, to prevent or stop enemy invasions, the Dhragolon have a wide variety of defenses which are up to the peace keeper caste to control and maintain. The Dhragolon often have Uber Turrets in their colonies which are capable of swarming enemy ships and gunning them down.\u00a0 From the ground, it looks like a swarm of flies engulfing a warship. There are also many Dragon Dreadnoughts equipped with only an Electron Engine as they must stay close to the colony to defend it.\u00a0 Most dreadnoughts are about a quarter-mile long, allowing them to have heavy weapons. Dragon Dreadnoughts are quite similar in design to the Dragon Cruiser but have a much bulkier appearance. Every colony also has anti-vehicle turrets to help stop close approaches only allowing a ground invasion on foot.Engines for Space Travel  The Dhragolon developed the Lightspeed Electron Engine (often called the Interplanetary Drive) which allows simple lightspeed travel.\u00a0 It is used when traveling between planets as it is too risky to use warp drive inside a star system.\u00a0 The Electron Engine contains a variety of elements, often many halogens and noble gases which have a high valence electron count.\u00a0 When the engine is activated, the elements inside implode via nuclear fission which breaks the atoms apart.\u00a0 The electrons are then thrusted outward all in the same direction from the implosion.\u00a0 Because electrons travel at nearly the speed of light, the combined force of all of them traveling in the same direction thrusts the ship forward at nearly lightspeed.\u00a0 This leaves a trail of electrons behind.\u00a0 In order to return to normal speed, the engines simply turn the other direction to slow down.\u00a0 However, this process is done slowly to avoid any injuries onboard the ship. Most ships which are intended for interstellar travel have a warp drive, which was originally developed by the Omni, an ancient space-faring race,\u00a0and a\u00a0ship with warp drive was discovered on Pelietta by the Dhragolon.\u00a0 It is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light due to the theory of relativity, but a way to get around this is to actually bend space itself. This is exactly what the warp drive does.\u00a0 When in use, space in front of the ship is contracted while space behind it is expanded, thus propelling it through vast distances across the galaxy.\u00a0 However, the warp drive is too dangerous to use while inside a solar system as theoretically, the ship could accidentely appear inside a celestial body such as a planet or a star. Later on, the Dhragolon eventually reverse engineer the warp drive to create the Slipspace drive, sometimes called the Slingshot drive. The Slipspace drive contracts space in all directions which greatly shortens travel time even more so than the standard warp drive. The ship simply has to move to the desired location in contracted space to get to its destination. The drawback however is that it is somewhat inaccurate and can be off from only a few kilometers to a few parsecs. Overtime, the Dhragolon attempt to eliminate this imprecision, but this form of travel is still in the works.Telepathic Amplifiers  In order to communicate across vast distances across the galaxy, the Dhragolon use Telepathic Amplifiers which are orbs the size of bowling balls.\u00a0 When the mind is completely focused, the user of the Amplifier can contact Ucharpli or any colony telepathically.\u00a0 \u00a0For meetings\u00a0with council, holograms\u00a0are used to render images of the brain in order to more easily communicate.\u00a0 However, the Amplifiers were designed to only work with Dhragolon minds so that other empires cannot use them to their advantage if one is stolen.\u00a0 As a result the Council of Colonists does not have to directly meet on Ucharpli, saving travel time.Universal Translator  Many races have one, but each have their own version.\u00a0 A Dhragolon translator is used in conjunction with a holographic screen.\u00a0 If a language is not recognized in the central database, the translator will attempt to decipher it after the speakers says a few words.\u00a0 Once the language is deciphered or the language is already set, the speaker's words appear in Yallvus Talk on the holographic screen after, thus giving the Dhragolon subtitles to read. Some other versions of the translator which are still being developed actually alter the sound waves emitted from the speaker's mouth.\u00a0 However, some find it awkward how lip movements do not match, and often times the new translated voice will sound bizarre and unfitting to the speaker.\u00a0 The translated voice could turn out to be very high-pitched and squeaky.\u00a0 However, the subtitle translators are much preferred to avoid any awkward scenarios.The Altus Dynasty  \"Dhragolon are individualistic, but by working and living together, we prosper.\" -Altus Malick  The Altus Dynasty was the first dynasty of Yallvus.\u00a0 The Altusians were excellent and jumpstarting the Dhragolon into civilization but slowly became more corrupt over time. This dynasty ended, when Ahdim's son, Banya, was killed at the age of\u00a0234 when he was defeated in the Yallvus Civil War.List of Known Altus Leaders  Malick The\u00a0first king in Dhragolon history. Xurtag The first king to merge the nation of Yallvus with another. Yanya The\u00a0first queen in Dhragolon history. Turgan Discovered ancient ruins in the Ocean of Thought.

Ahdim took very long trying to study for the exams. Ahdim The king who conquered the whole world Banya The last of the Altus Dynasty. He is infamously known as the \"Oppressor King\".The Rustiagon Dynasty  \"The king is your guide. Kray is your leader.\" -Rustiagon Dralla In 0 4E, the first Dragon Cruiser was constructed, which was a vessel that could only be piloted by a king.\u00a0 The righteous Rustiagon family rose to power and King Rustiagon Dralla became the ship's first pilot after King Altus Banya was killed.\u00a0 The Rustiagon family well represented the race staying true to all of their philosophies.\u00a0 One major incident of corruption is Rarsan who was going to become a king, but went into blind rage after the Council did not accept him. The current king is King Rustiagon Karrel who is currently working to destroy the Grox.List of Known Rustiagon leaders  Dralla The first king in space as well as the oldest\u00a0to become king.\u00a0 He formed the Dhragolon Council in order to make sure the king's rule is balanced.

Her fate is unknown.Brief History  The Dhragolon divide their calendars into eras by major, society changing events. Eras don't necessarily begin on Enya 1. They start as soon as the cultural event takes place.First Era - The Tribal Era  According to the Book of Kray, the era begins during the time when the world was inhabited only by beasts. Kray, the Titan of Wisdom, perched himself atop Ucharpli's tallest mountain in the form of a dragon. He let out a roar of wisdom heard by all the creatures of the world, subsequently bringing the Dhragolon into existence. The First Era has no definite beginning and is regarded as the time before the Great Flood. During this time, the Dhragolon had begun forming their own villages though no writing system was prominent - a major reason why so little is known of this era.Second Era - Rise of Religion  After the Great Flood, the Dhragolon begun regarding the disaster as an act from a divine being (or beings) leading to the rise of many religions all over Ucharpli. Jamzeze, a philosopher and thinker, brought about the concept of Kray and Uszaroth after divine inspiration during a journey in the desert. Meanwhile, Uszaroth himself descended in the form of a red-scaled Dhragolon and spread his own beliefs where individuals should do whatever they please and cause mischief. This lead to war where between the Jamzezists and Uszarothians, though Uszaroth himself left after the war came to a stalemate. Even though he still has influence, Jamzezism emerged as the dominant religion. Another war would soon follow taking place in the continent of Aggateya. A Dhragolon clan known as the Dark Warriors discovered how to use negative emotions as a means of combat. This allowed them to become stronger as it gave them newfound abilities such as becoming close to immortal as well as faster reaction times - essentially becoming demi-gods. The Malinians viewed such powers as unholy and quickly engaged in a conflict known as the Crusades against Darkness. The war was long and bloody, but the Dark Warriors were eventually destroyed from existence. Shortly after, the Malinians made every effort to burn all the documentation on the Dark Warriors' ritual practices. However, some of these documentations survived to the early Fourth Era and were discovered by the Altusian Brotherhood which would eventually result in the resurfacing of the practices of the Dark Warriors.Third Era - Altus Era  During this time, some villages began to prosper and flourish, but none as much as Yallvus which was founded around Jamzeze's teachings. Altus Malick began by ruling as a benevolent dictator and used Jamzezism as a basis of law. Eventually, the Yallvusian Union conquered the entire world over the course of 10,000 years, but began to fall apart after the populace began to disapprove of Altus Banya, the last Altus King, and his methods. This lead to a bloody civil war known as the Yallvus Revolution.Fourth Era - Rustiagon Era  This era began when Rustiagon Dralla took the throne and attempted to add some democratic aspects to the government. Roughly, the beginning of this era marks the first time the Dhragolon entered space. Several generation after, mass genocides began throughout the entire Perseus Arm committed by the Dhragolon which was done because of other empires' evil intentions. This age begins when King Dralla rose to power. He realized that the Dhragolon did not enjoy their current living conditions and worked to create a democracy, a process that would take over a 100 years. Still, this did not stop Dralla from boarding the Dragon Cruiser and exploring space. When he discovered that another alien race was annihilated by a powerful entity, which they would later discover to be the Grox, the Dhragolon finally understood what exactly hostility and evil was. After Gelda discovered even more nearby hostile empires, from this point onward, the Dhragolon adopted the religion of Neo-Renyanism.\u00a0 They learned that many races had evil intentions and vowed to expand the empire and prevent evil from ever arising again.\u00a0 Also, by the time\u00a0Yogan expanded the empire to the edge of the Groxlands, many races already hailed the Dhragolon as gods because of their ability to destroy small empires in a matter of minutes. Another war had started up towards the end of the Grox Wars. The DFM had joined the Galactic Senate which was taking on another enemy - the Kklxin. The Kklxin were an extragalactic race seeking to gain a place in the galaxy, but were aggressive and powerful. Upon the defeat of Altus Infra, the Omni timeline had split. One diverged into the Omniverse GC Wiki while the other still continued into the Spore Fan Fic Wiki. In the Spore Fan Fic Wiki, the Dhragolon became locked in a civil war with both themselves and the Galactic Senate following up on the chaos caused by Infra himself. While the long, bloody war ended early enough for the Titan Vernietigen not to be released (which would have caused the universe to be destroyed), the entire Galactic Senate had collapsed. The fate of the other empires are unknown, but the surviving Dhragolon embarked on a voyage to the Andromeda Galaxy to start anew.Fifth Era - The Voyage  This era has been relatively uneventful. It will take millions of years before the Dhragolon finally reach the Andromeda Galaxy.Prophecies The Dark Prophecy  The following was written by Atrox Posterus after the Great Flood. \"Thousands of years beyond, the following will arrange themselves perfectly: the Nether, the bringer of light, the mortal realm, the thunderous realm, the mossy realm and the ringed realm. When that occurs, a noble, favorable king will have left his throne to the heir who bears cleaved reception. Brothers and sisters will fight with each other and with the beings of the stars. Chaos beyond the mortal realm will erupt leaving all realms to be devastated by Kray's Wrath.\" The first statement is most likely referring to a syzgy. The next one in the Muelia system is set to occur on December 22, 2312. In Dhragolon culture, this is often referred to as the Galactic Apocalypse or the Dhragolon Civil War. Many Dhragolon were frightened when the Yallvus Revolution broke out; many believed it to be the end of the world, but there was no syzygy at the time so the prophecy has yet to be fulfilled.\ufeffAllies  The Dhragolon are very hesitant to form allies as they are slow to trust others. They are always wary of large empires and any potential threats they pose, and most of the time, they refuse to interact. This is partly because of their psychological reaction to encountering such dangerous foes upon entering space. In the Dhragolon database, short description logs briefly summarize their standpoint on the race.Eteno  Description Log Entry: An ambitious race with a strong will. The Eteno are indeed useful allies in the ongoing wars against malevolent beings such as the Kklxin and the Grox. They have proven themselves to be more than competent and trustworthy when it comes to arranging battles. However, they seem like the type that wishes to annex all empires in the galaxy. We Dhragolon only serve Kray, not some mortal beings, so we shall remain cautious.   The Eteno are an ally in the Yanya cluster is mostly owned by the Eteno, but the Dhragolon have a single research outpost on the planet Yanya. Shortly after the Dhragolon first encountered them, the Eteno suddenly grew technologically becoming among the most powerful races in the galaxy. The Eteno are among the Dhragolon's most valued allies though they were at war for a short time during the Aldaris Incident. Generally, the Dhragolon view them as a powerful ally, but are reluctant to accept their technology and their forms of practice. For example, their military training styles are direct opposites of each other. The Dhragolon view it as unnecessarily harsh, but are tolerant of their ways. There is an ongoing conspiracy claiming that the Eteno plan to annex the Dhragolon into their empire. However, the Council of Ucharpli adamantely claims that the Eteno are still a useful ally in their endeavours.Karnasaur Empire  Description Log Entry: An intriguing race much like our own. There's something about them that seems troubling. They are reputably the most technological advanced empire in the galaxy, and are rather proud about it. We should be grateful they are on our side, but still. It seems their race has been through a great deal of turmoil. It is best to remain cautious of them, since if they turn against us, we may be in for a long, terrible war.GHD  Description Log Entry: An extragalactic race coming from a powerful, long standing empire. While we've only gotten a glimpse of them, we should not underestimate them. There's word of a powerful mastermind causing turmoil amongst their race. However, the rest of them seem competent - though we can't be sure as they've only recently arrived.Delson Empire  Description Log Entry: A newly discovered race very few in number. They've proven to be competent and the Senate has even allowed them to become a part of GSSOC. However, they seem to be stronger than some of the Majites of Feurcy, so they should not be underestimated.Lesser Allies  The Dhragolon allies in this cluster (Malick Cluster) are actually the only other sentient races in this cluster after several genocides. A variety of hostile empires were completely wiped out while these empires remain, none of which are nearly as powerful as the Dhragolon themselves. Imp- This was the first empire the Dhragolon ever contacted. They are of the Warrior Archetype, but surprisingly got along well. The Imps are known for their advanced weaponry which the Dhragolon often purchase. Ll'mahn- This empire developed philisophically first just like the Dhragolon. They are of the Shaman Archetype; the Ll'mahn emphasize spiritual and inner peace. They are known to be able to sell colonization materials at the cheapest prices. Sarkakion- A race of hive-minded insects controlled by a Queen. They are very friendly and are willing to provide assistance during war. They have completely integrated into Dhragolon society Pharlenian- an amphibious race resembling humanoid frogs who have are oriented around the flows of nature. They are the Ecologist ArchetypeSubmitted Territories  The list is far too long, but throughout the entire Perseus Arm, many smaller civilizations witnessed the destruction of other empires at the hands of the Dhragolon. The Dhragolon exercise control on the regions via colonies, but do not control the empires within. Instead, these empires submitted to the Dhragolon in fear of being destroyed, some even worshipped them. The Dhragolon generally do not like being hailed as gods, but do not forbid it as the submitted empires have good intentions.Behind the Scenes  The concept of the Dhragolon dates back to early 2009 and has heavily evolved since then. The Dhragolon are mostly inspired by medieval Europe during the Crusades and the Renaissance with bits of Chinese and Japanese culture mixed in. For the Dhragolon's ancient past, Biblical history was used for inspiration. User:Krayfish's goal was to make the Dhragolon a completely different culture than what humans would probably form if they were to form an empire in space. Although their society is based heavily on their religion, logical aspects were incorporated as well in order for the Dhragolon to realistically become much more advanced philisophically. Even today, the concept of the Dhragolon has been evolving. With every new Dhragolon story written, more is added which may have a significant impact on the Dhragolon as a whole. When the race was first conceived, they were a near-perfect society of purity and goodness. However, overtime, User:Krayfish realized what he originally envisioned could never realistically happen which resulted in a complete revamp in early 2011 including their biological appearance. Eventually, the Dhragolon along with a few other empires became so developed that it bore little resemblance to a Spore Fan Fiction. A great migration to another wiki, the Omniverse GC Wiki, was underwent. This migration was written as a timeline split involving an alterante reality where the Dhragolon left to the Andromeda Galaxy to make way for new empires. All Dhragolon articles have been left here for archive purposes and anyone may freely use their contents in their own fiction. However, please do not edit the actual articles without permission.Trivia Eteno Military Titles  Eteno Imperial Armed Forces Defense Forces of the Empire Fist of the Empire Eteno Military Imperial Military Imperial Armed Forces Colonial Armed Forces Colonial Defense Forces Protectors of the DominionsDuties  Imperial Army - Protect and defend national interests (civilians, property, infrastructure, etc.) on solid ground, and deter any potential aggression by a foreign power.

High Admirals command the largest fleets and direct the most critical campaigns.List of Vehicles/Ships/Field Guns Navy/Air Force  (The Imperial Naval Registry tracks all mentioned ships, and regularly stocks valid, unused ship names.) Instead of using different models of engines for every single ship, the Eteno Imperial Navy fits standardized engines on their ships, depending on the amount of power each ship needs, the type of ship, and the energy each ship can devote to engine systems. This, among a great many other things, allows for quick and streamlined construction of ships. The Imperial Army Air Corps and the Imperial Marine Corps Air Wing utilize all Navy/Air Force craft below the class of Corvette. Petrol = Petroleum PH = Photon GV = Graviton M = Magnetic C1 = Class 1 C2 = Class 2 C3 = Class 3 C4 = Class 4 C5 = Class 5 C6 = Class 6 C7 = Class 7 C8 = Class 8 C9 = Class 9 C10 = Class 10 C0 = Class Omega Note: All ships carry soldiers, and ships that are Heavy Gunboats or larger carry transports, armour, and specialized soldiers for invasions and boardings. Also, every ship except for Fighters, Gunships, and Bombers carry more ordnance than listed. Weaponry listed is simply the stuff that stand out.Trainers  Petrol-TF-7 'Slugger' - At a glance, one would think that the TF-7 is a relic of ancient aviation, doomed to rot away in a museum. This would be a very much flawed assumption. Built to train prospective Imperial Armed Forces aviators the basics of flying, this plane is as basic as one can get. One propeller at the nose of the aircraft powered by an internal combustion engine can have this plane going over 600 miles per hour. 'Slugger' is the first stop for anyone going through EIT military aviation training. Crew of 1-2 M-THC Mk. 7 - If one wants to learn how to fly helicopters, the THC Mk. 7 is the aircraft they will be spending much of their time in. With a design style similar to that of the HV-17, the THC can be used to train both regular helo pilots and tiltrotor pilots. A fully-stripped cargo bay can sometimes be seen filled with metal blocks, used to simulate cargo or passenger weight. Crew of 1-2 PH-TB-66 'Agrad' - Essentially an RSNLB without the capacity to deliver nuclear weapons or withstand ferocious punishment. Regardless, it does the job of acquainting pilots with heavy bombers quite well. Crew of 2-3 PH-TTC-3 'Wizard' - Even if the best pilots are selected to fly fast fighters, the amount of skill required to fly a cargo aircraft is in no way small. That's why pilots sent down the cargo aircraft pipeline are hooked up with the 'Wizard'. Designed to have constant problems fixable by pilots, anyone training in this will get their fair share of experience with maintaining a cargo aircraft, on top of the regular flight skills one gains with trainer model aircraft. Crew of 2 M-TCFS-14D 'Tom' - If one is intent on becoming a Marine pilot, the TCFS-14 is the aircraft of choice for learning the trade. Built specifically to train pilots in both dogfighting and surface carrier landing, this 'Luca' near-copy was the first step for many now-famous Marine pilots. Crew of 1-2 M-TSC-18 'Cat' - Serving to train pilots in the ways of ground attack, the TSC-18 has been with the Imperial Armed Forces for several hundred years, retaining the bulky fuselage and stubby wings, as well as the terrifyingly powerful engines. Crew of 1-2 M-TFHA-15S - As the forefront dogfighting and space carrier landing trainer for Armed Forces pilots, cadets will become very acquainted with the TFHA-15's signature forward-swept wings adorned with coloured stripes, signifying that the pilot has not completed flight school. Under the wings can be mounted practice or live munitions, and just in front of the nose are dual laser guns. This is the closest a pilot in training will get to a live combat aircraft. Crew of 1 PH-EST-51W-LV - Aside from the lack of any actual weapons, the EST-51 is extremely similar to the Imperial Armed Forces' primary attack jet, the Eagle. A lighter airframe makes for easier dogfight training, at the cost of making the actual Eagle slightly more difficult to adjust to for pilots in training. Crew of 1-2Bombers  PH-Kula Mk. 14 \u2013 One of few Eteno strike craft with a straight wing design, it carries multiple small torpedo/rocket launchers under its wings and one automatic laser turret in the tail to fend off enemy fighters. Crew of 2 GV-Ferda Mk. 3 \u2013 The Ferda is a lighter combat bomber, with four rapid-fire lasers mounted around the cockpit. This strafing/dogfighting capacity paired with the devastating missiles that are this bomber's trademark makes for a deadly machine rightfully feared by the Eteno's enemies. Crew of 1 M-Mateja Dive Bomber - The whine of the Mateja's dive sirens alone is enough to send the most organised military unit scattering for cover. Mounted under the Mateja's delta design wings are ten high-explosive 600 pound bombs capable of scattering anti-infantry pellets on detonation. Matejas normally strike in large formations made up of five or six twenty-one craft vee formations. One after the other, the vees dive at a near-ninety degree angle, drop their bombs, and pull away immediately, after which the formation breaks and the bombers rush back to their base. As they are unarmed barring their bombs, these dive bomber formations require many escort fighters. Crew of 1 PH-Ruzschetsko Nier Strategic Level Bomber - The RNSLB, or 'Rinselb' as some pilots call it, is the Imperial Armed Forces' main ground bomber for long campaings or large battles. The RNSLB carries almost three hundred bombs, each with the power of fifteen tonnes of TNT. Crew of 8 M-Hansche B-202 - One knows to run for cover when formations of B-202's stretching several miles across appear on the horizon, surrounded by fighters. This aircraft has the capacity to drop nearly thirty high-explosive bombs or a hundred parafrag bombs accurately and quickly, before coming around for another run. Once the bomb bay is empty, the B-202 is maneuverable enough to strafe enemy positions with cannons mounted under the wings and cockpit, and rocket pods adjacent to the jet engine on each rear-swept wing. Three gunners, in the tail, nose, and belly, can also lash out at ground targets or pursuing aircraft. Crew of 6 M-Hansche B-211 Liberator Express - Dedicated light support bomber. Up to 5,000 lbs of ordnance can be stuffed into the tight bomb bay of the B-211, to be dropped at low level onto hostile forces dangerously close to Eteno troops. This ordnance can range from parafrag to incendiary, or high-explosive to bunker-busting. After making its bombing run, the B-211 can come around for another run, ripping targets to shreds with four 6.2-forga machine guns (two on either side of the cockpit, one under each wing). Crew of 3 M-Constellation Mk. II Naval Patrol Bomber - Sturdy aircraft capable of launching from Marine carriers as well as short airfields. A frontal cockpit section houses a pilot and co-pilot, as well as a sensor operator. His or her sensors can detect a vessel dozens of miles underwater or hundreds of miles away on the surface. From the large cargo bay covering much of the rear fuselage, the Constellation can drop torpedoes or depth charges. Crew of 4Fighters  GV-Defender Mk. 17 \u2013 A very effective fighter with a slanted-down forward-swept wing design. It can carry up to eight forward-facing guns of many , and almost always carries a payload of anti-ship missiles. Crew of 2 or 1 M-Valkyrie Mk. 2 \u2013 Similar to the defender, except the Valkyrie has much stronger engines, but no missiles. Crew of 2 PH-Tesson Mk. 1 \u2013 The Tesson is a relatively new strike craft design. It carries target painting equipment and ECM banks. It has two forward-facing cannon mounts and has a design similar to the Valkyrie. Crew of 3 M-Vida Mk. 4 'Luca' - While it is unknown where exactly the nickname Luca came from, it is known that it was given out of pure fondness. Unlike most other craft in service with modern galactic militaries, it is incapable of hovering or vertical takeoff, and thus requires an airfield or catapult to be of any use at all. With the lack of rotating engine mounts that are installed for hovering and de-accelerating, the Luca must use two rotating rockets on both sides of the cockpit to slow down in combat, and be recovered by starships (the Luca slows down to the point where it can be caught by an arrestor hook in a hangar). This fighter makes up for these weaknesses with a high weight limit, and can carry up to thirty anti-air and/or anti-ground missiles under its two forward-swept wings and fuselage. In addition, the Luca can shred to pieces any target it chooses with four rapid-fire lasers embedded in the nose, just in front of the cockpit. Crew of 1 PH-D-10 - The D-10 is completely identical to the Defender fighter, except for one major difference. The D-10 is an unamnned, unarmed decoy programmed to move as if it were piloted. D-10s are used in training drills and mock attacks. It has found increasing use with the Imperial Army during surprise attacks on Kklxin forces. These drones make the Kklxin defenders (or attackers) unable to accurately predict Eteno strategies. Crew of 0 M-Vida Mk. 6 V/STOL 'Laku' - Younger cousin of the well-received Luca, the Laku was designed as a V/STOL strike craft for the Imperial Marine Corps, but has recently found use with the Imperial Army. It is built off of the Luca's design, but with a thinner cockpit section, no brake rockets, and low aspect-ratio wings compared to it's cousin. The Luca's original engines are replaced with larger, stronger, rotating engines, granting the Laku the ability to take off and land vertically. Under the two short wings are fifteen anti-air/ground missiles and a 100-rocket pod each. Under the fuselage are thirty small bombs, ten anti-ground rockets, and six anti-air missiles. Crew of 1Gunships  PH-C-10 \u2013 The bane of all those who find themselves facing a determined air assault, the C-10 hosts a giant cargo bay, that can carry up to 800 men in stacked pods on the walls as well has an entire Battalion's worth of armour. It can also carry enough supplies to keep these men fighting for at least two or three months. In flight, it can actually open the huge cargo bay door and paradrop men, armour, and supplies. Bombs have also been known to be dropped. It has four huge jet engines on the bottom edges of the craft. In its wings, it carries eight Defender fighters for close air support. The cockpit is very spacious, with up to twenty people working at a time. It has a galley, medical center, and everything else that a large starship might have. A true wonder of engineering. Crew of 62 M-Decabel Gunship - The Decabel is a VTOL jet helicopter with two large jets mounted where the tail and main fuselage connect, supplementing six rotors just above and behind the cockpit. It has a pilot and a gunner, and can carry ten men in a small cargo bay behind the cockpit. The helicopter has two stubby wings on which four rocket launchers are mounted as well as heavy beam cannons. Below the nose is a dual laser mount. Crew of 2 M-Eagle Assault Jet - The Eagle is a hybrid between a transport plane and a heavy gunship. It utilizes a backwards-swept wing design and boasts four jet engines mounted underneath them. On the wings are many assorted cannons, missiles, and lasers. It can carry two vehicles as well as several hundred tonnes of cargo of cargo and a full Platoon of soldiers. Crew of 7 M-UH-16G Superbell - A heavily modified UH-1N Twin Huey, the Superbell sports a lighter airframe and more powerful engines, as well as potent weaponry. While it would seem that over a hundred years of ambiguity in a clogged archive of known aircraft designs would relegate this ancient design to a bleak future, the exact opposite happened. Discovered by a high-ranking Imperial Armed Forces special operator on accident while searching for a possible design for a good insertion aircraft, the design was given an opportunity to prove its effectiveness once again. Modified heavily in terms of armament, armour, and power supply, the UH-1N became the UH-16G Superbell. Many special forces officers took a liking to the new helicopter, and secured a thousand units to be built for the use of all Imperial Armed Forces special forces units. Eight passengers can be carried, two of which can man a pair of door-mounted AT guns. The pilot and co-pilot have control over a set of dual rocket pods, as well as a rapid-fire laser for clearing landing zones. Most models are fitted with experimental rotor silencing addons. Crew of 2 M-HV-17 - This helicopter is a VSTOL craft capable of flying like a standard fixed-wing aircraft or a helicopter. It has two rotors that can change position from plane to helicopter. It is mainly used as a transport or utility helicopter, and thus posesses very little armament. It has two laser chainguns under the cockpit that are controlled by a computer, and nothing more. There are several specialized variants of the craft, along with the standard version.Transports  Petrol-MC-2 Maritime Cargo Carrier - While the most grueling deployments aboard ships are generally in space, this does not mean that the Marine surface fleet does not endure bad conditions and long deployments. For the transport of personnel, supplies, and mail to and from Marine surface fleets, the MC-1 was adapted from the civilian MC-23 cargo seaplane. The MC-1 suffered flaws such as vulnerable fuel tanks, thin armour, and difficulty landing on carrier decks. Thus, the MC-2 was created as an improved version. With a rugged airframe based off of the human C-2 Greyhound and E-2 Hawkeye, and state-of-the-art armour plating, the MC-2 can survive a great deal of punishment. Thirty seats sit packed together in the cargo bay, capable of being removed to make room for large cargo, of which the aircraft is capable of carring almost a hundred tonnes. Currently the only petroleum-powered non-trainer aircraft in the Imperial Armed Forces, the MC-2 is a rare piece of machinery, and one that will eventually have to be phased out with the eventual (albeit far away) depletion of easily-harvestable crude oil. Even so, the MC-2 is, and shall be for a long while, a vital component of any surface fleet. Crew or 2 M-Mi-26 Sylwester - On the outside, the Sylwester looks like a standard human Mi-26. Of course, like any design adapted by the Eteno, the eventual derivative is vastly improved. While the Sylwester retains the same airframe and role of the original helicopter, its weight has been significantly reduced and its power substantially improved. This allows it to carry several times more weight than the original Mi-26, and absorb greater amounts of punishment. The Sylwester is rarely deployed to the frontline without escort, as almost all models are unarmed. Out of combat, the Sylwester is an average hauler. In combat, it carries large cargoes of soldiers and supplies, and can evacuate up to sixty stretchers or eighty walking wounded. A small number of models have door guns just behind the cockpit, capable of bringing down only infantry or light vehicles. Crew of 3-5Other  PH-AAT-M-16: The Atmospheric Assault Transport Model 16 is an intermediary staging point for troops in orbit around a planet and troops already planetside. It serves as a giant flying military base, and carries twenty helicopters as well as fifty fighters. It has two extendable landing pads/cargo bays, from which troops and aircraft can deploy. The AAT-M-16 also houses a full regiment of soldiers as well as almost a hundred assorted vehicles in its cavernous holds. With the capacity to go from planet to planet under its own steam, the AAT-M-16 is a versatile and useful asset to the Imperial Armed Forces. Crew of 146 M-Dagrad C-77 Fox - The Imperial Armed Forces are built for second and third generation warfare, and perform admirably in both. However, with fourth generation warfare becoming more and more common in the modern galaxy, new elements must be integrated into the EIT's military to deal with insurgent and rebel threats. One of these elements is the Dagrad C-77 Fox, a COIN aircraft. This aircraft does one job, and does it effectively. With a basic tube of a fuselage attached to a high-power propeller engine, the Fox is both light and quick. Under its long, wide wings are dual rocket pods capable of firing smoke flares, or incendiary and armour-piercing rockets, dual 22mm cannons, four pellet bomb dispensers, light beam cannons, and flare launchers. Even with all of this armament, the Fox is next to worthless when matched against anything other than ground targets. With light armour and sub-par turning ability, it is basically a sitting, explosive duck in a dogfight. When deployed effectively, the Fox is more than a match for any light-to-medium fortified ground targets. The sight of this aircraft normally elicits a sigh of relief from exhausted ground troops hunting resistance fighters. Crew of 2 M-Overwatcher-9 Tactical Command Plane - The Overwatcher-9 is the latest model of command plane used by the Eteno Imperial Armed Forces. It contains radio and radar banks similar to the HV-17R, but with more function. An Oberwatcher can connect hundreds of thousands of disorganized troops and re-organize them in a very short time, thanks to a support AI that can give individual orders to almost ten thousand soldiers in a milisecond. This plane is not purely for organizing and strategizing, it can also contribute to an offensive by jamming or intercepting enemy communication with an enormous area of effect. Crew of 53 PH-TC-200 'Lifesaver' - The vast cargo bay of the C-200 is not found in this particular model of aircraft. Instead, a single massive battery occupies the space formerly reserved for cargo, vehicles, and personnel. The rear door is also absent, with only six extending metal power cables residing in the rear of the plane. During particularly long missions, pilots who are low on juice in their craft's batteries can link up with the TC-200 and fully recharge in under a minute. A small handful of petroleum-carrying versions exist for basic aircraft trainers and the MC-2 Maritime Cargo Carrier. Crew of 3Light Corvettes (LC)  M-Elda \u2013 A small, cylindrical ship bristling with Anti-Fighter (AF) guns. It also boasts two heavy torpedo launchers. Crew of 116 Leading Ship - ENS Gallagher C1-Stari \u2013 A somewhat haphazard design, the Stari is, basically, a command bridge flanked by two prongs covered in AF guns and missile launchers. Crew of 105 Leading Ship - ENS BradkulenHeavy Corvettes (HC)  C1-Wisthedden \u2013 A small support craft, it boasts Anti-Missile (AM) batteries, target painting equipment, and a small hangar for refueling and rearming strike craft. Crew of 174 Leading Ship - ENS Kaloyanchev C2-Slalluda \u2013 Usually paired with Wisthedden Corvettes, it carries almost 40 AF guns and 10 EMP and Ion cannons. Crew of 235 Leading Ship - ENS NedelchovLight Gunboats (LG)  C2-Kaliga \u2013 A frontline combat ship, it has a forward-facing heavy Proton Gun under the bridge, along with numerous AF and AM batteries. Also carries 10 strike craft. Crew of 263 Leading Ship - ENS Malisk C2-Neist \u2013 Similar to the Kaliga, except it has no hangar and carries very advanced sensor equipment. Crew of 243 Leading Ship - ENS George WashingtonHeavy Gunboats (HG)  C3-Battle \u2013 A very effective frontline ship with two heavy Proton Guns on each side of the bridge along with 70 AF guns. Carries 18 strike craft. Crew of 325 Leading Ship - ENS Zdravko C2-Hons \u2013 A useful support ship, it carries special technology that can feed energy to another friendly ship's shields. Carries a decent amount of AF and Anti Ship (AS) guns for defense. Crew of 308 Leading Ship - ENS IonescuLight Frigates (LF)  C3-Nebb \u2013 A long cylindrical ship with command centers and facilities on either end of the main cylinder. Over a hundred AF Ion, and AS guns are lined along the cylinder. Crew of 365 Leading Ship - ENS Klemens C3-Jan \u2013 A medium sized ship with four heavy Proton Guns at the front. Also carries numerous defense guns. Crew of 371 Leading Ship - ENS LokiHeavy Frigates (HF)  C3-Kliloppen \u2013 A surprisingly effective frontline ship. Carries 20 EMP guns, 200 AF and AS guns, and 40 Ion cannons. Carries 20 strike craft. Crew of 405 Leading Ship - ENS Kliloppen C4-Bastion \u2013 The fastest combat support craft in the Imperial Navy. Carries dozens of shield leechers and repair drone banks. Usually kept directly behind the frontline, repairing and regenerating the ships soaking up most of the enemy fire. Crew of 483 Leading Ship - ENS Carl VinsonLight Destroyers (LD)  C4-Fastha \u2013 A powerful forward assault ship. Carries 6 heavy Proton Guns, as well as over 200 AS, AF, Ion, and EMP guns. Also carries two shield leechers. Crew of 529 Leading Ship - ENS Makemilun C4-Lish \u2013 A very unorthodox ship design. It has a large command center with crew quarters and the like, with four prongs coming out of it. Four heavy Proton Guns and over 300 AF and AS guns adorn the prongs. Crew of 562 Leading Ship - ENS Lish C4-Vierd \u2013 A very tunnel-visioned ship. It carries 500 AF guns. It serves as the fleet fighter screen. Crew of 525 Leading Ship - ENS FustheigeHeavy Destroyers (DD)  C4-Slavko \u2013 The Slavko usually travels in a pack or with a fleet, and is more-or-less a convoy raider. It carries two shield leechers, 10 Proton Guns, and 200 AF and AS guns. Crew of 623 Leading Ship - ENS Keplat C5-Delci \u2013 The Delci serves as a sort of cheap combat carrier. It boasts two hangars, with 40 strike craft, along with 250 AS, AF, and Ion guns. Crew of 610 Leading Ship - ENS Siegfried C4-Guidance \u2013 The Guidance utilizes a unique weapon called the Enlightenment Cannon, capable of cutting a path of great detruction through the enemy. It also carries 400 AS, AF, and EMP guns. Crew of 783 Leading Ship - ENS Wyrzyk C4-Nashville - One of the most recent ship designs put in service by the Imperial Navy, the Nashville destroyer is built to fill the role of a general patrol and combat ship. A Nashville can operate at ranges much greater than many other Navy ships, and take out any targets it encounters with railguns, beam weapons, missiles, torpedoes, eighty strike craft, and laser cannons. This class of ship is used primarily for exploration, system patrol, rapid response, and convoy escort. Crew of 1,017 Leading Ship - ENS TennesseeLight Cruisers (CL)  C5-Guardian \u2013 The Guardian is primarily a missile ship. It does carry 100 AS and AF guns for defense, but for main armament, it has 20 long-range AS and bombardment missile banks. The Guardian is extremely effective when kept directly behind the battle line to provide support. Crew of 693 Leading Ship - ENS John F. Kennedy C5-Bures \u2013 The Bures has one purpose and one purpose only. That purpose is destruction. It carries a whopping 580 AS and AF guns. Crew of 947 Leading Ship - ENS Miloslaw Agrod C6-Hostor \u2013 The Hostor is a very unremarkable ship between how common it is and its relatively standard armament. It does carry a larger-than-normal amount of Ion weaponry though. Crew of 834 Leading Ship - ENS DagfinnHeavy Cruisers (CC)  C6-Zivkovic \u2013 The very first ship designed by Imperial hands. It has been improved thousands of times over the years, but the standard structure and armament has remained the same. It carries 600 AS and AF guns, and carries ten heavy proton guns. Crew of 1,024 Leading Ship - ENS Zivkovic C6-Omaha \u2013 The Omaha is effectively a torpedo ship. It sports nearly eighty torpedo launchers and a hundred missile launch tubes. A further two to three hundred defense guns are meant mainly for self-defense, and not as offensive weapons. Crew of 1,204 Leading Ship - ENS Mitica C6-Kovac \u2013 The Kovac was built to provide the fleet with the many types of support that smaller ships simply could not provide. It can lay and disarm mines, remotely disable ship computers, restock armaments of larger ships, and construct small orbital structures to help secure an area. Crew of 1,647 Leading Ship - ENS Bjorn Schussler C7-Democracy \u2013 The Democracy is a powerful front line ship. It has seventeen heavy beam weapons, over sixty railguns, and roughly 800 smaller AF/AS guns. Crew of 2,381 Leading Ship - ENS Boesch C7-Monore - Monore-class missile cruisers are powerful combat support elements, hanging to the rear of the front line, bombarding enemy ships with fusillades of missiles. Sixteen large missile banks attached to the sides of the rectangular hull each fire dozens of missiles at once, and these banks can rotate ninety degrees vertically. An additional forty smaller missile tubes are present at the aft and bow. Several dozen defense guns protect the ship from strike craft who manage to evade the devastating weapons of the rest of the fleet. Crew of 1,721 Leading Ship - ENS Ivanov MonoreLight Battleships (BBL)  C7-Hecklaungen \u2013 The smallest battleship in the fleet. It carries 150 Ion and EMP guns, along with 900 AS and AF guns. It also carries 15 heavy Proton Guns. Carries 54 strike craft. Crew of 2,763 Leading Ship - ENS Valeri Geisler C8-Freedom \u2013 The Freedom is simply an anti-capital ship work of engineering. It carries 40 Beam Cannons, 120 Ion Guns, and 1,200 AS guns. Carries 60 strike craft. Crew of 2,803 Leading Ship - ENS ChurchillHeavy Battleships (BBH)  C8-Zugla \u2013 The Zugla was the first true stealth ship of the Imperial Navy. It carries 40 heavy Proton Guns, as well as over 1,600 other guns. Carries 120 strike craft. Crew of 3,764 Leading Ship - ENS Zugla C8-Praetorian \u2013 The Praetorian is the symbol of Imperial invincibility. It carries two gigantic missile banks for decimating planetary or ship targets. It also boasts 100 heavy Proton Guns, and 5,600 AS and AF guns. It is also one of the only ships to utilize the Crusher system. Carries 150 strike craft. Crew of 16,003 Leading Ship - ENS Protector C9-Kingdom \u2013 The Kingdom Battleship usually serves as an escort to Carriers. It carries a very decent 200 torpedo tubes as well as 1,600 other guns. It also boasts the most advanced sensor and radar technology. Carries 120 strike craft. Crew of 5,428 Leading Ship - ENS Afanasy GervasSuper Battleships (SBB)  C9-Rhodus \u2013 The Rhodus is an extremely powerful ship, with over 400 heavy Proton Guns. It also carries 8,000 other guns. Carries 200 strike craft. Crew of 20,584 Leading Ship - ENS Stanislaw C9-Bosko \u2013 The Bosko was designed to counter dreadnoughts. It has over 300 Anti-Ship Beams (ASB) and 12,000 AS and AF guns. Carries 250 strike craft. Crew of 24,032 Leading Ship - ENS Bosko C10-Teclavic \u2013 The Teclavic is the cornerstone of target elimination. It carries over 20 heavy missile banks, as well as hundreds of torpedo and missile launchers. Carries 200 strike craft. Crew of 30,385 Leading Ship - ENS Francis Scott KeyLight Carriers (CVE)  C7-Delmenhorst \u2013 The Delmenhorst was the very first true Carrier in the Imperial Navy. It boasts 200 AF guns, but its true power lies in its strike craft compliment. Carries 400 strike craft. Crew of 6,236 Leading Ship - ENS Delmenhorst C8-Ebeleben \u2013 The Ebeleben is the newest addition to the Imperial Navy. It is different from most carriers because it has four heavy Proton Guns. Carries 450 strike craft. Crew of 5,166 Leading Ship - ENS Ebeleben C8-Arnstadt \u2013 The Arnstadt is unusual in the fact that it carries only two squadrons of fighters. It mainly carries support ships, target painting fighters, and a few squadrons of bombers. Carries 320 strike craft. Crew of 3,256 Leading Ship - ENS Tiller Creek C7-Dalp \u2013 The Dalp is a very small Carrier, but can be built in large numbers. It has similar armament to an Ebeleben. Carries 250 strike craft. Crew of 5,137 Leading Ship - ENS RaiderHeavy Carriers (CV)  C8-Flourish \u2013 The Flourish has numerous missile and torpedo bays along with its usual strike craft compliment. It carries a whopping 600 AF guns. Carries 600 strike craft. Crew of 8,125 Leading Ship - ENS Naess C8-Geb \u2013 The Geb utilizes a very unique fighter launch system. It has three hangars, all of them nestled deep inside the ship. Six long launch tubes are connected to these hangars, and are used to launch craft. The strike craft is moved into the tube by robotic machinery and launched out the tube. A utility hangar on the bottom of the ship is used to take in ships that have been launched, and position them back into the main hangar, for re-arming or for actual landing. Carries 850 strike craft. Crew of 12,303 Leading Ship - ENS Augustin Moritz C9-Malkov \u2013 Malkov Heavy Carriers are most unusual. It has hangars on the sides of itself, but is also bristling with heavy weaponry. It has armament similar to an Bures Light Cruiser. Carries 700 strike craft. Crew of 11,361 Leading Ship - ENS Ortwin C10-Schmer \u2013 The Schmer has no armament at all. This is exchanged for massive hangar bays. Carries 1,200 strike craft. Crew of 9,247 Leading Ship - ENS PennsylvaniaSuper Carriers (CVS)  C9-Poln \u2013 The Poln is an incredibly massive ship. It, like the Schmer, has no armament. It makes up for that fact in insanely thick armour and huge hangar bays. Carries 2,000 strike craft. Crew of 11,252 Leading Ship - ENS Ignacy Wetzel C10-Bismarck \u2013 The Bismarck is undoubtedly the fastest carrier in the fleet. It also boasts a large battery of AS guns, but no AF guns. Carries 1,800 strike craft. Crew of 18,236 Leading Ship - ENS Winogrodzki C10-Kolga \u2013 Kolga Carriers have a relatively small strike craft contingent, but massive amounts of weaponry and armour. Carries 1,700 strike craft. Crew of 17,622 Leading Ship - ENS Kolga C10-Miroslav \u2013 The Miroslav is the largest Carrier ever made in the Eteno's galactic arm. It carries 20 heavy Proton Guns, 1,200 AS/AF guns and a huge strike craft bay. Carries 6,120 strike craft. Crew of 18,525 Leading Ship - ENS ThorbjornDreadnoughts (DBB)  C0-Eclipse \u2013 The Eclipse-class is both terrifying and majestic, in equal amounts. Only five are in existence. With no strict design, Eclipse-class ships can vary wildly in armament, crew, strike craft capacity, and to an extent, shape. It is set in stone, however, that Eclipse-class ships carry at least 11,000 strike craft. Crews are often 1.5 million or more in size, with the capacity to decimate even the largest of fleets. Even if the deployment of an Eclipse is an act of desperation, one can be sure that the tide will turn in the blink of an eye when one enters the field. Leading Ship - ENS Eclipse C0-Luitgard - Designed with leading the entire Imperial Navy clear in mind, the Luitgard is a one-of-a-kind ship, stretching nearly twenty five miles across. Fitted with dozens of layers of some of the most advanced shielding money can and can't buy over ultrathick layered alloy armour, the Luitgard can withstand the greatest of pummelings. In retaliation, the Luitgard can utilize its millions of small guns, thousands of railguns, missile launchers, torpedo launchers, beam weapons, and over 25,000 strike craft. While not tasked with transporting or supplying large armies, the Luitgard nontheless is home to over 600,000 elite naval infantry. As with all Eclipse-class, the Luitgard never retreated from battle, nor lost a battle. Crew of 7.5 million Leading Ship - ENS LuitgardOther  C0-Olympus Station (O) Leading Ship - ENS Utkin C8-Hepheastus Naval Ram (HNR) - The HNR is a huge, lightly armed and heavily armoured starship tasked with plowing through just about anything with its immensely thick hull. Crew of 383 Leading Ship - ENS Athena C6-Rayko-2 Fleet Oiler (FO) - Regardless of the fact that traditional fleet oiling is long gone, the Rayko-2 retains the title. Made up of a bridge and crew quarters at the front of a gargantuan battery section. Oilers meet up with fleets on long deployments to recharge the batteries of all ships, even those with reactors capable of producing a net income amount of power. Crew of 37 Leading Ship - ENS Winfried C7-Sergej (SS) - Without the Sergej, fleets and armies would be unable to deploy for long periods of time. A Sergej has enough space for the food, ordnance, and gear to maintain millions of men and women for several months. Crew of 162 Leading Ship - ENS Regenbogen C0-Costel Naval Yacht (NY) - When an official isn't getting from system A to system B in a battleship, they're in a Costel Naval Yacht, travelling in style. Commissioned in 745 ATGW as an alternate transport option for the Supreme Commander. After the Supreme Commander at the time expressed her fondness of the ship, the Vice Commander was given one. Within a decade, many major government and military officials were riding in these yachts. Built as a luxury ship with bite, the CNY blends gourmet kitchens, swimming pools, gyms, luxury bedrooms, and posh game rooms with thick armour plating, battleship-level armament, and the capacity to serve as a working fleet flagship. A fleet of regular combat ships forming a protective screen around a CNY is normally the first thing that a nation's ruler sees after a diplomat is sent to establish formal relations. This convoy plants a powerful impression in the minds of those the Eteno meet. Leading ship - ENS Kresimir C0-Fronz Survey Vessel (SV) - Since the early days of expansion, the efficient charting of star systems, planets, and anomalies has been a crucial part of ensuring safety of Eteno citizens and military vessels. Fronz-class survey vessels are long, tubular ships packed with all the necessary sensors and computers required for the exploration of new territory and dangerous stellar anomalies. Long-range engines ensure the Fronz can carry out its duties a significant distance from friendly territory. Crew of 21 Leading ship - ENS Lsory Islands C6-Sertnev Tactical Minesweeper (MS) - Based off the design of the Jan-class frigate, Sertnev minesweepers perform the vital role of disarming hostile mines through a variety of methods, ranging from releasing electromagnetic pulses, reprogramming them, or simply blowing them up with one of six heavy railguns. These railguns, along with fifteen fighters stored in a small hangar at the front of the ship, are the only defense the Sertnev has against hostile vessels. Crew of 82 Leading ship - ENS Cape Vayl C5-Ilioyna Tactical Minelayer (ML) - A direct couterpart to the Sertnev Tactical Minesweeper, the Ilioyna lays down mines for blockades, checkpoints, area denial, and direct battle support. From a rear deployment bay, the Ilioyna can release clusters of small or large mines, or let out the deadly weapons one at a time for greater accuracy. The Ilioyna carries all types of mines, ranging from EMP to explosive, corrosive acid-spewing to nanobot-deploying. As with all minelayers, the Ilioyna can recover its own unspent ordnance. Crew of 57 Leading ship - ENS Getsen C9-Shezna Research Cruiser (RC) - Stocked with all of the necessary laboratory and storage compartments one can normally find on a large research station, the Shezna can park itself around objects of interest, or chase them down with powerful engines. A small handful of defense guns are meant to fend off pirates or hostile scouts, and ten fighters and three bombers are carried in a hangar with seven smaller survey vessels. Crew of 145 Leading ship - ENS Eire C7-Symon Bombardment Cruiser (BC) - When a target on the surface of a planet must be annihilated in the shortest amount of time, the Symon is what gets the job done. Built off the design of the Praetorian-class battleship, the Symon is roughly half the size, and instead of possessing a beak-like feature at the bow, a series of eight heavy beam cannons jut out from the hull, directly under the bridge. These weapons can fire over thirty shots per minute each, and cause serious damage to anything they hit, or for that matter, anything remotely close to what they hit. While mostly relying on a handful of AF guns to ward of strike craft, the Symon can turn its main guns against other capital ships if in a critical situation. Crew of 203 Leading ship - ENS Reynder C9-Gehnez Naval Tender (T) - Many ships have enough self-repair capacity to patch up any minor damage done during battle. Many ships are also more than capable of fixing up their strike craft in short order. Of course, almost all combat ships lack the capacity to repair critical damage to their systems and hull, or the capacity to bring a strike craft coming apart at the seams back to working order. Gehnez tenders are great rectangular vessels with room for all manner of craft in its truly cavernous repair bays. From lowly fighters to proud cruisers, these tenders will bring them back to full strength deep within the confines of their thick hull. For larger ships, such as dreadnoughts, carriers, and battleships, exterior modules and cranes supported by spacesuit-clad crewmen can provide all necessary repairs. Normally surrounded by a screen of light combat vessels, the Gehnez is not designed for fighting. Only a hundred or so AF guns and fifteen AS guns are present to fend off attackers in the most dire of situations. Crew of 1,731 Leading ship - ENS Admiral WillIiam HalseyMarines/Army/National Guard Walkers  PE-1000 \u2013 The PE-1000 is the premiere combat walker of the Imperial Armed Forces, having been in production since 844 ATGW. Standing over thirty metres tall, it dwarves many of its' predecessors. In the walker's wrists are extendable blades for taking out close targets, as well as slower-firing plasma guns. However, the most peculiar and awe-inspiring feature of this walker is how the pilot interfaces with the machine. He/she is encased in a metal pod housed deep inside the thick armour, and connected with the walker's AI through an extensive network of Nerve Interconnection Wire Systems. This allows the pilot to take direct control of the walker with his/her mind, further enhancing the power of the monstrosity. Crew of 1 Midge \u2013 The Midge is an old design made new. It is a tripod-mounted robot that can be manned by up to three soldiers. It carries four heavy machine guns that can tear up light vehicles, infantry, and aircraft. Most rapid infantry advances during battle follow closely behind packs of Midges. Crew of 0-3 Saberthooth \u2013 The Sabertooth is a giant of epic proportions. It stands over 100 meters tall, and has four thick legs to move it around. It has four heavy Proton Guns, and over 30 automatic Anti-Vehicle/Anti-Infantry Beam launchers. It also boasts 7 AA plasma guns. It has a rectangular design, with two smaller rectangular missile bays on its sides. Lastly, the Sabertooth can carry up to 250 men in its underbelly, with ropes extending from the bottom to release them. Crew of 25 Hunter \u2013 The Hunter is a very simple and basic walker compared to its cousins in the Imperial Military. It has a basic bipedal design, and stands 4 meters tall. It has two rapid-fire plasma guns and two rocket-pods. Crew of 1 Suppressor \u2013 This walker has two tall legs with a cockpit between four Vincent-Lee heavy miniguns. Crew of 1 Pachka 18 \u2013 The Pachka is a terrifying machine to behold. It stands seven metres tall with a basic bipedal structure. On the arms are titanium-reinforced chainsaws, machine guns, and flamethrowers. Crew of 1 Megalith Giga-Walker \u2013 The Megalith is a wonder of engineering. It stands 150 meters tall, with enough weapons to vaporize a city in minutes. It carries 200 heavy machine guns, 50 heavy Anti-Vehicle/Anti-Infantry Beams, and 3 massive missile banks. For the game-ending weapon that makes it so deadly, it has a huge laser that can disassemble an entire armour Brigade on the molecular level in one hit. These are normally permanently positioned on core Eteno worlds. Crew of 59APCs/Cars/Trucks  Tolstov APC \u2013 The Tolstov is a long and slanted design. It is actually made of nine armor panels welded together. Of course, there are many more parts to the APC, but that is generally the extent of the design of the hull. The slanted edges help deflect incoming fire. It has a back door and a ramp in the front, between the driver and co-driver. It has a hatch on top for soldiers to fire out of as well. It is able to traverse water, even entire oceans if the need arises. On the exterior, the vehicle looks somewhat like a cross between the real-world BTR-80 and TPz Fuchs (Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and Bundeswehr respectively). The Tolstov can carry up to 17 men, sometimes up to twenty-three, albeit uncomfortably. Crew of 2 Imriska RV-88 Communications Truck - While Overwatcher planes ensure communications capabilities are extended to all units from the air, the Imriska facilitates communications on the ground. A flatbed truck similar to the Tjasa-3, Imriskas mount a single sturdy radar dish surrounded by miniature radio towers on their beds, reinforced against small-arms fire and EMP weapons. Imriskas are deployed close to the front line, where pre-made camoflauge tarps shield the vehicle from aerial observers. Crew of 5 Tjasa-3 Rocket Delivery Platform - T3RDPs are heavy trucks with a rocket launcher mounted on their bed. The launcher is packed with rocket tubes, who in turn fire Amsel-3 rockets in dense barrages at enemy positions. Crew of 4 Lightning ICV - A versatile Infantry Combat Vehicle with many different variants, but a standard rectangular chassis with sloped armour and advanced sensor suites residing in the ten-seat passenger compartment in the back. The rear of the chassis is slightly wider than the front, with a reinforced metal door for crew and passengers. The entire chassis rests three to four feet off the ground, depending on the model. All weapons are on top of the hull, unless directly stated otherwise. Molka FAV \u2013 The Molka is a quick four-wheeled car. It has one machine gun for a passenger. Molkas are normally used for scouting and raiding. Crew of 5 Kriz-C Cargo Truck - Large, square hover truck that transports cargo and soldiers in all sorts of different situations. Crew of 1Tanks  Conqueror MBT \u2013 The Conqueror tank is an effective vehicle used frequently by the ground forces. It has eight tread sections, four on each side, to ensure maximum terrain negotiation in any environment, as well as to mercilessly crush smaller vehicles. These tread sections are spread evenly across the ten-metre vehicle. It has two barrels, which fire devastating plasma rounds or regular tank shells. Crew of 4 Emperor HBT - With a permeating desire to field a more intimidating and destructive tank, the Council of Generals called upon the manufacturers of the Conqueror to create a newer, more destructive tank. What they came up with was the Emperor. Built on the same type chassis as its lighter cousin, it is four metres longer than the Conqueror, but with the same amount of tread sections. Mounted on the turret are three barrels capable of firing plasma rounds almost twice as strong as those fired by the Conqueror, as well as 180mm HE shells, which can be modified to let loose thousands of small anti-infantry pellets on explosion. Also on the turret is a laser riot gun mounted to the left of the middle barrel for taking out infantry 360 degrees around the tank, and a 20mm AA cannon on top. Mounted on the front of the vehicle are two coaxial laser riot guns which together are capable of pacifying targets 180 degrees in front of them, and 20 degrees above and below. Crew of 6 Omnipotent SHBT - This is the vehicle that can send even the biggest HBT running for its life. Measuring the whole of forty metres, the Omnipotent is quite deserving of its name. Lumbering along on eight tread sections, the Omnipotent can lay waste to the battlefield with eighteen independent turrets spread out evenly along the sides of the chassis, each with two 230mm round-firing barrels. Dual flamethrowers at the front of the chassis, HMG's scattered between each heavy turret, three massive 900mm guns sitting between the flamethrowers, and six light artillry guns resting on the top of the chassis surrounding quad SAM launchers make up the rest of the imposing tank's armament. This monster vehicle sports armour capable of shrugging off the punishment that would demolish entire tank formations. Normally found surrounded by Emperor and Conqueror tanks, any charge led by an Omnipotent is very likely to succeed. Crew of 57 HRV-2 Kaviga - Technically the second-largest tank in service with the Imperial Armed Forces, the Kaviga fills the role of a heavy recovery vehicle. Not suited for riding into battle on its four tread sections, Kaviga's stay behind the front line, picking up heavily damaged and destroyed vehicles with a large crane mounted on a frontal turret and taking them back to a base on its' long, wide vehicle bed large enough for anything but a Halford Command Truck or Omnipotent SHBT. Crew of 3 Npres-Class Artillery Truck \u2013 The Npres truck is an eight wheeled truck with a long bed, which carries a permanently-attached long-range artillery gun. It is very versatile. Four men sit in the cab of the vehicle, while the rest of the crew rides on the bed or on the sideboard. Crew of 7 T-1 Tank Drone - Outdated tank that is now used as cannon fodder and for training drills. Crew of 0Seacraft  TAAATV Hovercraft \u2013 TAAATV stands for Tactical Amphibious Assault Armoured Transport Vehicle. A polished, rectangular hull is reinforced with reflective alloy panels. It can carry two Platoons of infantry, six armoured vehicles, and a decent amount of other supplies all at once. It has four machine guns that can be manned by passengers or crew. Crew of 5 ER-4 Vilmos-Class GEV - A design alien to both the Eteno's allies and enemies, the Vilmos is a combat seacraft capable of attaining flight with twelve heavy tubojets and a set of forty-metre long inverse-delta wings. While having twelve long-range missile launchers hidden in the fuselage's dorsal surface and twelve GMG's mounted on the wings is impressive, the Vilmos' true strength lies in the cargo capacity of 1,120 Eteno soldiers and their vehicles in addition to mass amounts of cargo. In amphibious assaults, the Vilmos can provide fire support and disembark assault forces on the beach or in shallow water with ease. Crew of 21 Lubos-Class Patrol Boat - Clocking in at twenty-eight metres long, the Lubos fills the role of a speedy, versatile patrol craft. A three-arde gun is placed at the bow, and can hit both surface targets and air targets with ease. Dual torpedo launchers are also mounted on either side of the wheelhouse. For rear defense and additional AA defense, two machine guns are mounted on the aft. Crew of 5 Tallensrad-Class Amphibious Assault Ship \u2013 The Tallensrad sits a fair distance away from the shore, pounding it with three double-barreled Gauss cannons. It has a large well deck with two dozen small motorboats for transporting men, supplies, officers, and small vehicles to and from shore. It has six helipads. Crew of 129 Leading Ship - ENMS Virmad Dionisie Vladuva-Class Landing Ship - Large carrier ship with a wide, flat deck. Below the deck and to the rear is a hangar in which vehicles and aircraft are stored, and to the front is a well deck for hovercraft. Personnel quarters and storage rooms are at the center of the ship. Aircraft capacity of twenty, vehicle capacity of fifty, personnel capacity of 5,600. Crew of 118 Leading Ship - ENMS Lyosha Sirgraud-Class Missile Destroyer - No matter where the target is, the Sirgruads will ensure their timely destruction. In front of the bridge section at the middle of the ship are two turrets with three barrels each, all capable of firing high-explosive ammunition to armour-piercing ammunition. Behind the bridge section is a battery of AA missile launchers, and a series of 200 small missile tubes. From these tubes, Sirgrauds can rain down accurate and destructive barrages on almost any target. Crew of 192 Leading Ship - ENMS Niklasson Nazariy-Class Heavy Cruiser - Serving as a multirole combat vessel, the Nazariy is armed with five heavy deck guns, six AA gun batteries, two AA missile batteries, and eighty guided missile tubes. The Nazariy is also capable of launching nuclear-tipped missiles at enemy positions. Crew of 372 Leading Ship - ENMS Manfred Rikhard-Class Battleship - Unparalleled anti-surface capability packed into a single ship, the Rikhard carries a whopping sixteen heavy gun batteries, twenty AA gun batteries, sixteen AA missile batteries, fifty guided missile tubes, and thirty medium gun batteries. Crew of 726 Leading Ship - ENMS Pranciskus Prolsevich Industries Model Ten Patrol Boat - Quick, medium-sized attack boat with two 0.8 Feldegram guns along with four mounted machine guns for use in attacking other ships, aircraft, or beach defenses. This boat also has an additional third deck under the living quarters for diver troops. It is a flooding compartment with space for six. The submerged door opens, allowing diver teams or swimmers to disembark without coming under threat of enemy fire when most vulnerable. The compartment automatically expels water. Crew of 15 Iron Island MOB - The Iron Island is a Mobile Offshore Base that is at least five miles long in any direction. It contains five Oxygen-based power plants and two nuclear plants for power, and several robotic scrapers under the hull to collect any usable materials as the island passes by. The ships has huge dormitory facilities and even two training centers along with six four-mile airfields fit with hangar structures. It also boasts factories and docks for roll-on/roll-of cargo. For the sustenance of staff, hydroponic farms are nested deep inside the hull. It also serves well as a vast moving battleship, with thousands of small guns, and dozens of huge cannons with ranges of up to 362 miles. It can ensure dominance in sea, land, and air. Crew of 92,581 Leading Ship - ENMS JukkaTransports  C-51 Heavy Cargo Jet - This special jet requires specially-made six-mile airfields for it to safely take off and land. It has six enormous jet engines that collectively weigh 200 tonnes. It is capable of carrying up to an entire Brigade of soldiers and their vehicles, or 500,000 tonnes of cargo. The rear door covers the area of an entire Headball field. Crew of 69 C-200 Cargo Jet - The C-200 is a scaled-down version of the C-5. It can carry only fifty vehicles, a Battalion of soldiers, and 16,000 tonnes of cargo. C-200s require much shorter airfields than C-5s. Cre of 17 GD-10 Troop Barge -The GD-10 carries strictly infantry. It has over a thousand ten-man pods which have all the needed facilities for long-distance travel. Men on long and short journeys live in these. It also has a commons area for the entire ship, along with the ones in the pods. Crew of 12 T-300 Hypertransport \u2013 The T-300 is a massive all-use transport that could even pass as a temporary base. It has six main sections. The main bay on the center hull, four large pods that are connected by passageways to the hull that also have ramps to unload once on the surface of a planet or moon, and a top section that carries 300 helicopters, massive stores of supplies, and a command center. All sections except for the top have a direct ramp exit. T-300s can carry over 300,000 men, and 20,000 vehicles. It also can clear landing zones with over 60 missile launchers. Crew of 946 Nord VIP Shuttle \u2013 The Nord is a true luxury ship. It has incredibly comfortable facilities, and a downsized gourmet restaurant as the ship galley. It can carry only 6 VIPs comfortably, though. Only the highest-ranking members of the military and foreign dignitaries get rides in a Nord. Crew of 13 Klugen Shuttle \u2013 The Klugen is a re-done civilian design. It is somewhat comfortable, and can carry up to 40 men. It is designed to ferry people between ships, bases, planets, moons, asteroids, and space stations. Crew of 7 OV-3 Construction Drone \u2013 The OV-3 is a robot controlled ship with large stores of resources, nanite construction bots, and laser-point construction mounts. Crew of 0 Homfulten Vehicle Barge \u2013 The Homfulten is a strictly vehicle carrier. It has huge stackable racks that carry fighters, helicopters, and vehicles. Crew of 38 Royal Manufacturing Model 16 Special Transport - Housing dozens upon dozens of modifiable cargo bays inside a blocky hull, the RMM16ST allows the mass transport of seaships, vehicles, aircraft, and small starships. Crew of 82Field Guns  Note: All Eteno field guns are breech-loaders. ATG/66 1.6stv - Towed field gun with a rifled barrel that exclusively fires AP rounds. Larger-than-normal shields on either side of the gun ensure the protection of the gun crew. Devastating and accurate 1.6 Starvogram rounds can tear through armour easily. On many occasions, a line of these guns has broken a determined tank advance without any support. Crew of 2 AP/TG 1.4stv - A towed gun like its' cousin the ATG/66, the AP/TG is capable of taking on both infantry and armour. A rifled barrel fires both anti-infantry HE shells, and powerful AP round that detonate automatically shortly after impact, even if the shell would bounce off. Crew of 2 Vaduva-AP 1stv - Infamous amongst the many enemies of the empire, Vaduva-AP guns are built purely for the devastation of infantry. Out of a smoothbore barrel is blasted a large, blunt shell which explodes in mid-air at a set range. Dozens of smaller pellets spread out in the blast area, and detonate, while thousands of even tinier pellets rip through body armour. Crew of 3 Vaduva-AB 2stv - Firing some of the largest artillery shells of any military in the galaxy, the Vaduva-Area Bombardment howitser lobs HE rounds up to and over a hundred miles away, and is truly a force to be reckoned with when fired in groups. Even the most well-fortified position is no match for a sustained bombardment from this weapon. Crew of 3Other  Halford Command Truck - The Halford is a huge five-sectioned truck that can serve as a command center or the center of one before or during an invasion before a regular base can be set up, which usually takes a day or so. The first section has the cab, living quarters, and armory. The second section contains radar, sensors, and satellite links. The third section is the planning room, with strategic computers, battlefield radars, and radio links to battlefield officers. The fourth section contains a mess hall. The last section is mainly storage space along with construction equipment. Crew of 26 Stefan-Bohuslav Ripper-9 - Standard motorcycle used by cavalry scouts and cavalry police. Can be fitted with a sidecar with a machine gun, or a shotgun to the right and under the handlebars.Weapons, Gear, and Technology  (Note: This section will be perpetually incomplete). Anti-Fighter gun: Using a rapid-fire laser, this gun can tear apart fighters and bombers that stray too close to it, and even damage close by capital ships. Current model is AFM285. Anti-Ship guns: Utilizing a slow-firing but powerful plasma ordinance, it can rip apart shields and armor. Shield-Leecher: The Shield-Leecher uses a beam of Eta Hadron particles to suck the energy from another ship's shields into its own. This has many uses. Standard-Issue Winter Gear - It is diffcult to survive in exceedingly cold environments in standard uniform. Therefore, winter gear is necessary. Standard-issue cold gear includes a self-heating helmet, as well as a thick, bulletproof jacket. On top is an optional white trenchcoat. Pants are thick and baggy, as well as connected to the kit's boots, which are lined with a heat-retaining material. Standard-Issue Non-Combat Kit - Kit that is issued to soldiers for the purpose of living somewhat-comfortably when not at an established military base. The entire kit is carried on the back, and is quite heavy. It consists of a heavily-compacted tent, with room for two. Three compressed blankets, six months worth of ration cubes, batteries, a compactable solar panel, and a tube of nanobots make up the rest of the pack. Spacetrooper Suit - The Spacetrooper's suit is like the PE-1000. The pilot links with the AI, but does not risk takeover due to the smaller size of the Spacetrooper suit. It is about four meters tall, and has numerous weapons. It has a flamethrower in the right wrist, a fission cutter, and a rocket launcher on both shoulders. Spacetroopers also carry large, specially-made plasma guns. They are used for heavy assaults and ship boardings. They are extremely armoured. Helgurmyen Incendiary Grenade: This is the only fire grenade utilized officially by the Eteno. It uses electricity to set fire to a contained explosive liquid. Krummel Attack Drone Model L: Krummel drones are small, forty pound tracked remote-control robots that have a twin laser chaingun mounted above the chassis. The technology of this drone allows soldiers to send out squads of armored and deadly robots from safely within an aircraft, truck, or a hiding spot. Buzzard Drone - The Buzzard is similar to the Krummel, but serves as a scout instead. It is a small flying drone with two protected rotors. It contains both a real time and a photo camera for scouting and recon. Finally, it can be used for a suicide attack. It contains ten pounds of high explosives. Magnetic Reactor - A reactor that produces non-storable energy through a self-sustaining process. A small charge is used by a motor to spin a large magnet inside a vacuum-chamber, which is surrounded by a tube in which electrons are ushered into. The spinning magnet sends the electrons around and around, generating heat, and a unique type of non-storable energy. Magnetic reactors are normally used while more power-hungry warp engines are being used, as well as during combat. MG404 Stationary Weapon - When someone needs a position held, or a position taken out, they call in an MG404 team. It is a machine gun so large it requires two people to carry it and its ammunition cases, but when set up, requires only one person to operate. Whoever is not operating the weapon normally helps feed ammunition. The thousand round per minute barrages of armour-piercing rounds let out by the MG404 are assured to mow down anything and everything. Zejliko ATR - This long-barreled anti-tank rifle can easily penetrate tank and vehicle armour with specially-designed nanite-releasing AP rounds. Tank-hunting teams normally have at least one of these rifles to supplement standard rocket and laser AT weapons. M14R-ATR - A must-have for any infantry unit, this anti-armour rocket launcher proves its worth time and time again in the field. Capable of firing charged plasma shots and HEAT rockets, it is truly a weapon to behold in combat. Kopitar Combat Diving Suit - Painstakingly designed over seven years, the KCDS is the only diving suit used by the Eteno Imperial Marine Corps' diver units. Lighter than most diving suits in the galaxy, the KCDS still manages to provide maximum utility to the wearer, and ensure a steady supply of oxygen taken directly from the water, if possible. If what the diver is swimming in is not water, made possible by the astoundingly well-crafted dual protection layers, four small oxygen tanks can be attached to the back of the suit, providing up to twenty-four hours of oxygen. DW-702 Combat Harpoon - With a design based off of traditional hunting weapons used by the carnivorous seal-hunting colonists of the water world of Kysely, the DW-702 propels its harpoon with great velocity up to twenty metres, where it can be retracted by chain back into the weapon. Because of the DW-702, Kklxin underwater forces have learned to fear Eteno combat divers. Plasma Gun - Any sort of Plasma gun, cannon, launcher, or machine gun utilizes generally the same process of turning the unstable Plasma it creates into a reliable weapon. Superheated Plasma is funneled through a refraction chamber, and then fired through an insulated barrel. The end result is a glob of superheated Plasma hitting the shields or hull of a ship. M-13 Infantry Mortar - Hand-carried from position to position, sometimes only ten metres away from the thickest fighting, M-13s suppress enemy positions and annihilate enemy infantry and light armour, making the advance of friendly troops much easier. HM-13 Field Mortar - Almost never moved after a battle is started, the HM-13 lobs anti-armour and HE shells up to sixty miles. When working in conjunction with howitsers and artillery trucks, a crushing artillery fusillade can end a battle, or at least ensure victory. M20CR - Proving that semi-automatic rifles do indeed still have a place in modern warfare, the Model 20 Combat Rifle can quickly and accurately take down any infantry target with ease. With a design similar to that of the German Gewehr 43 or the American M14 and a magazine capable of holding twenty explosive or armour-piercing rounds, it's appearance and effects are more than memorable. Nerriv Dual-Barrel Air-Superiority Gun - A standard AA gun that fires small \"parcels\" of energy at passing aircraft. Highly destructive when the guns are in large groups, as they normally are. Nerriv Tri-Barrel AAA Gun - This AAAG fires high-explosive shells in the air with three rotating barrels, all self-loaded. The shells are small and easy to produce, meaning that it is not a burden to supply large groups of these guns for long campaigns. GL14 - Standard double-action, revolver magazine weapon that can fire twelve high-explosive or anti-armour grenades in under five seconds. Used exclusively as a support weapon, and one is not advised to use it indoors. Wusta Close Combat Corporation \"Sir Shockey\" Stun Baton - A weapon used extensively used by MPs to subdue unruly civilians or soldiers without fatality. Bughlo EMPW19 - Bughlo Electromagnetic Pulse Weapon Model 19 is a strange looking EMP device. It is a capsule filled with wires and batteries. Activation is a simple of matter pressing the button on the top, driving it into the ground, and getting at least ten metres away before the thirty-second timer goes off. Helgurmyen EL-Lance - HELL lances are long, pointed melee weapons with a nasty electric charge above and below the handle situated at the middle of the lance. Ad campaigns for the HELL lance for militaries friendly to the EIT use the catchphrase: \"Touched by HELL.\"  JL-17 Assault Rifle: A sturdy gun with a large clip of forty rounds. Its bullets are Iron with a Tungsten core, which provides fantastic stopping power and an acceptable amount of damage when taking on light vehicles. Damjan SMG-7 - Medium-sized, powerful, and light, the SMG-7 is the perfect close-combat weapon for Eteno infantry. With a fifty-round magazine, it can even serve to lay down a good amount of suppressive fire. Accuracy is the final touch added to this weapon, allowing users to work alongside riflemen as near-equals. X-Series 3H Full-Automatic Chaingun - Fitted on helicopters, aircraft, vehicles, and given to infantry every now and then, the 3H Full-Automatic Chaingun sees use almost everywhere. Capable of easily firing over fifteen-hundred high-explosive rounds per minute, nobody wants to be on the receiving end of a determined Eteno force with this up its sleeve. Nanoswarm - Robotics has always been the strong suit of the EIT, and it shows in their creation known as the Nanoswarm. It is an immensely huge family of different nanobots. While the microscopic machines have pitifully small batteries, they fulfill their purposes with effectiveness. Some of their uses include aiding in the collection of scrap material after battles, surveying for mineral deposits, tapping into secure computer networks, curing diseases and repairing bodily damage, deconstructing hostile material (be it biological or mechanical), and perhaps most importantly, small scale construction. Androids: Androids are self-aware robotic soldiers that fight alongside regular troops on the battlefield. They do not require food, but often indulge themselves for the warm feeling inside after a good meal. They are completely identical to organic Eteno, except for the insides of the Androids. Where organs and blood would be, there are gears, wires, electrodes, and motor oil. One cannot tell the difference between an Android off the street and a regular Eteno, except for dissecting them and directly asking the Android what he is. Androids are completely comfortable with being machines, and even seem to think they have it better than organics as they do not require food, sleep, or decent housing, although all three are provided for them. Androids have been used repeatedly for running all-night sentry duty. Androids are not allowed to hold ranks above Field Marshall, though.  Domal-Z Sidearm - This sidearm is used extensively by the armed forces due to its reliability, power, and light weight. Unfortunately, most standard holsters have no room for the scope, which must be removed if one wishes to use the Domal-Z as a quick-draw firearm. Verta Heavy Rifle - The Verta is a very powerful weapon, but difficult to lug around. While used exclusively for fighting light vehicles and infantry, it fires explosive rounds that rival small artillery shells in size. Because of the size of the rounds, it is a breech-loading weapon. M100 - The M series of sniper rifles from Tarson Munitions has always been renown for its stopping power and accuracy, The M100 is no exception. Combining multiple refraction chambers, the laser round is faster and more powerful than any sniper rifle from any munitions company. SD600 Vasher - Vasher rifles have never been known for range or stopping power, but their sturdiness and accuracy more than make up for it. With a design somewhat reminiscent of an M16, it fires standard armour-piercing rounds quickly and accurately. Cases of the SD600 jamming are extremely rare. 40/40 B Series: The B series of sidearms has been used by mercenaries and soldiers alike. The 40/40 uses a unique double-handle deign which makes it look like a sub-machine gun. This design allows for maximum accuracy and steadiness when firing multiple shots. U9 Light Machine Gun: The U9 is used heavily by the Imperial Military. It can use clips of fifty, 100, or 200 shots and is very accurate in bursts. Amsel-3 Rocket - Densely packed with explosives and rocket fuel, a barrage of Amsel-3s is anything but good. However, one can anticipate an incoming barrrage with the aid of the tell-tale whistle and thick smoke trails. Heavens Gate: Heavens gate uses similar technology to the Crusher. Eight Heavens Gates are on the tumbling planet of Magra. A Heavens Gate can set its power levels before firing, to destroying a city to an interstellar fleet. The beam fired is a rotating Unstable Deso Particle beam that is supercharged with wandering Protons. The beam can travel any distance due to the Unstable Deso Particles being able to coagulate in-flight. The beam can easily break through small obstacles like asteroids and solidified nebulae, so getting to the target is not a problem. When the beam hits the target, pretty much everything is disintegrated. Vincent-Lee Minigun - The VLM is an extremely effective and large gun used by soldiers, vehicles, and helicopters. It can fire off 12,000 rounds per minute firing regular bullets or explosive bullets for large vehicles and buildings. It can also be disassembled for storage. It is currently the only weapon in modern military use to be designed by a human. R16 Riot Shield - Although used mainly by the Imperial Police, soldiers can opt to carry these large shields. They can effectively stop anything that isn't a disruptor weapon or a tank shell. This is also assuming the force of the shots do not knock the user over, such as in the case of a helicopter chaingun. PGM1 BaNC Gear - Offering biological, nuclear, and chemical protection all at once, this light (but rather stiff) full-body suit can fit under body armour, and repell a glacing shot if need be. Standard issue amongst those who work in hazardous environments, or are forced to take on an enemy with biological, nuclear, or chemical weaponry available. JX-9 Flashbang \u2013 This grenade emits extreme noise and light, which is effective at disabling enemy troops for a good length of time. Bughlo Frag Grenade \u2013 This grenade can damage vehicles as well as infantry. It explodes normally, and spreads copper shards every which way. GH100 \u2013 The GH100 is a non-lethal grenade. It releases a super-cold vapor that flash-freezes anything within a few meters. This allows the frozen vehicles or soldiers to be captured, or shattered, as the freezing process makes them extremely brittle. C1 - The C1 is a grenade that uses a unique shock wave system. On detonation, the grenade releases a supersonic vibration through the ground that disorients anything within a few feet. Vashin-Blue Sniper Rifle - This is a very old and primitive design, but is popular among snipers for its rustic charm and simple setup. TM14 Flame Cannon - The TM14 is the Flametrooper and Lavatrooper's unique weapon. It fires a steady stream of blazing hot fire. It can fire for a straight 60 seconds before it needs to regenerate. It utilizes an unorthodox system of regenerating its tank. It extracts and compacts Oxygen from the air. This process takes several minutes, though.  VM-102 \u2013 This rifle is the latest installment in the series of weapons from Vancermosche Weapons. It is in no way unique, and is prized for that fact. It is cheap, sturdy, and powerful. When used with other infantry rifles, an effective portfolio of standard infantry weaponry is created. Enlightenment Cannon \u2013 This weapon is found only on Guidance Heavy Destroyers. It is a massive beam that vaporizes anything in its path. J19 Firesuit \u2013 This suit is used by Flametroopers and Lavatroopers. It can withstand over 17,000 degrees Fahrenheit and provides the wearer with bionic legs. It is extremely advanced with two built in flamethrowers. NetLink \u2013 The NetLink is a unique piece of equipment. Almost all soldiers carry these. A NetLink is a set of computer lenses. Soldiers can look at infrared and heat vision for night operations. It also provides a 3D map of the battlefield and the soldier's location. Not only that, it displays unit positions, the views of other soldier's NetLinks, and the vital signs of the soldier. This is a must-have for all Eteno infantrymen. Battlefield Combat Vest \u2013 This vest is used by literally every non-special forces soldier in the military, with exception to some sailors. It can withstand quite a punch, and has all the pockets and gadgets needed to fight on the battlefield. The inner lining also has traces of antibiotics to prevent infections in wounds that get through the vest. Battlefield Helmet \u2013 Worn by every soldier except for some special ops, these helmets provide good protection and denote rank and unit role, as well as blood type and serial number on the inside. Valkyrie Suit \u2013 Standing at an imposing twelve metres tall, the Valkyrie is truly a sight to behold for any soldier, friend or foe of the Imperial Armed Forces. Mounted above wide metal shoulder plates is the head module, where most of the Eteno pilot is meant to reside. Serving as a thick, powerful suit of infantry armour, it affords not only unparalleled protection and offensive capability (through wrist-mounted missiles and a beam rifle), but great mobility through jets implanted in the suit's boots and extendable wings. Grumman Broadsword \u2013 Manufactured by Grumman Close Combat Corporation, this sword is very hard, but not brittle. It is the sword of choice for Imperial soldiers. It is a massive sword, almost as big as a Eteno, and very effective. Nova 3 Anti-Armor Weapon \u2013 The N3AAW is a powerful energy weapon. It fires plasma bolts that tear apart pretty much anything. Stone-Ager Rocket \u2013 This is the weapon of choice for soldiers that want to leave a mark in the form of fire and scrap metal. It creates a very small nuclear blast that can destroy literally anything. Vindicator-13 Strategic Nuclear Weapon \u2013 This weapon is the pinnacle of tactical nuclear technology. Capable of hitting targets with astounding accuracy, ensuring that the hundred megaton explosion can do its' job properly. PNW-15 - A one megaton nuclear device that can be placed in a missile, shell, or rocket. Normally used for precision strikes on enemy positions, or short-term area denial. Luca fighters can normally be found firing PNW-15 missiles into enemy bunkers before or during an assault, to lessen collateral damage and to ensure the total annihilation of the bunker. Gerrut Sabre \u2013 The Gerrut Sabre is a purely ceremonial weapon named after the master of swordsmanship, Lance General Arnold Gerrut. They are carried by almost all Officers in non-combat situations, and by every soldier at events, formal parties, parades, and demonstrations. Scholka 2.39 \u2013 This is the only bolt-action rifle officially in use by the Imperial Military. Like the Gerrut Sabre, it is purely ceremonial, yet carried strictly in parades and demonstrations. Lermann Brothers Weaponry Division Heavy Proton Gun \u2013 A radical deviation from manufacturing board games, Lermann Brothers opened up a separate section in the company dedicated to manufacturing weapons. Their first and so far only product is the Heavy Proton Gun. It is very powerful and requires relatively little power to operate, well within the limits of small fusion reactors. It utilizes a system that actually destroys the bonds between molecules and alloys using Protons in an explosive manner. This gives an onlooker the idea that it is a simple laser cannon, but that could not be further from the truth. SKAR 41 \u2013 SKAR stands for Specialized Kinetic Assault Rifle. It has a very sturdy and easy-to-hold frame. It has a 45 round clip and fires titanium-coated ammunition. It is a widely used assault weapon. F50 Carbine \u2013 This is one of the only laser weapons used by infantry. It is a short, bullpup weapon with a design similar to the SKAR 41, but thinner, and without the handrail. J19 Beam Rifle \u2013 This weapon utilizes a long barrel for maximum accuracy during firefights. It is manufactured by the same company that makes Flametrooper suits. Bersson 10 Defense Gun \u2013 Bersson 10s are mounted on all ships in the Imperial Navy. It has a very powerful tracking system and rate of fire, allowing for maximum damage in the shortest amount of time to fighters and larger ships. Berkut Rapidfire Plasma Gun \u2013 This fine weapon from Berkut Industries has incredible power and rate of fire. GroberFutzen Heavy Missile Bank \u2013 As the name suggests, this missile bank fires GroberFutzen Missiles. The missile banks are extremely large and carry over a thousand missiles. The missiles pack very small nuclear warheads mixed with an EMP charge to bring down shields. Liberator Beam Cannon \u2013 This weapon slices through ship shields and armor using supercharged Photons. Rakkan Mega-Beam Cannon \u2013 This weapon is the pinnacle of beam technology. It is only mounted on Eclipses. They can kill fleets and kill space stations equally well. Banshee Anti-Asteroid Cannon \u2013 This cannon was built to destroy asteroids. It annihilates the targeted projectile several AU away from the planet or moon it is on. It has saved billions of lives in the history of its use. Crusher \u2013 These extremely powerful weapons are used on ships and by infantry alike. It literally manipulates gravity to crush anything it targets. Getting killed by this weapon is the polar opposite of painless. Incredible pressure reduces the ship, soldier, vehicle, building, etc. into a single point, which collapses in on itself and creates a short lived, extremely small black hole which swallows up the target. Some special forces teams utilize a similar system to warp across great distances.Personnel  A draft is currently in place that requires all men to enlist for four years in the Imperial Armed Forces within a month of turning eighteen. Currently, the Imperial Armed Forces field roughly 200 trillion personnel.Recruitment and Training  \"The tip of your barrel shall be held exactly five unigrams from the bridge of your nose! Then you shall move your rifle to the standard firi- SHITHEAD, TURN YOUR EYES FORWARD! DID I GIVE YOU AN ORDER TO STARE AT LIEUTENANT STOJAN? NO! GIVE ME TWENTY THEN RETURN TO FORMATION, AND DO NOT LET YOUR EYES WANDER AGAIN!\" - Gunnery Sergeant Dumitru Vukoja in the autobiography of Ivanov Monore, who went on to lead the 102nd Armour Brigade of the 909th Heavy Infantry Division as a Colonel, and became Supreme Commander in the steps of his adopted father. Renowned throughout the galaxy for unyielding harshness towards cadets of all branches, races, and backgrounds, Eteno Imperial Armed Forces training turns young men and women, many just out of Advances, into deadly weapons, gears in a devastating war machine. Most are enlisted personnel, while others train to become officers or earn the right to train as an officer through exemplary service to the fatherland.Recruitment and Drafting  During times of military emergency, the EIT government reserves the right to enact a draft of men from the ages of eighteen to thirty, and maintain a draft list of eligible men. Currently, the draft is currently in effect so as to require all men to enlist or enter officer school within thirty days of turning eighteen. A small percentage of individuals on the draft list are considered for officer school based on their grades and physical prowess. At age seventeen, all men with incurable mental or physical illness are removed from the draft list. Female (and male during times of peace) volunteers can directly apply for officer school, and can be flunked out of BCT or officer training at any point (This is common for females as physical fitness requirements are the same for both genders). Regardless of whether they are entering officer school in the future or enlisting directly, men and women are sent to Basic Combat Training Camp (BCTC), where for nine weeks, they are thoroughly trained, drilled, and worked up to and beyond their physical limits. Draftees, unlike volunteers, are unable to flunk out of BCTC, and must continually go through BCTC until they pass. After BCTC, enlisted men move on to Advanced Combat Training School (ACTS), where men choose their preferred military occupation and enter training for the job they are assigned (hopefully the one that they requested). Those who are both eligible and choose to go to a Combat/Non-Combat Officer School (C/NCOS) where they choose their preferred military occupation and for four years are further trained physically and academically for their assigned craft (hopefully the one that they requested). The only deviation from this system is for pilot cadets, who partake in six months of academic, physical, and flight training. Pilot and officer cadets can be flunked down to ACTS for another position.BCTC  The first stop for all cadets Basic Combat Training Camps exist on most populated Eteno worlds. It is here that all members of the Imperial Armed Forces receive their most important training. In only nine weeks, civilians are molded into fighting men and women. Note that physical conditioning and discipline training is present at all stages of training. Week 1 - Reception - Cadets are assigned quarters, instructors, gear, and clothing. Constant drilling and discipline training is punctuated only by harsh physical conditioning. Those deemed eligible for officer training receive harsher treatment from drill sergeants. Week 2 - CQB Training - Cadets, now more disciplined and knowledgable regarding military matters, are trained in melee combat. The standard Armed Forces Close Combat Method is taught to cadets, which encompasses fist fighting, knife fighting, fighting with a sword or blunt object, and fighting with a bayonet. Greater discipline is also enforced. Week 3 - CQB Training 2 - Continuation of Armed Forces Close Combat Method training. Physical conditioning reaches new heights. Cadets practice what they've learned on each other for the first time. Week 4 - Firearms - Cadets are taught proper usage, maintenance, and discipline of all manner of infantry weapons, including rifles, carbines, pistols, anti-tank weapons, mortars, machine guns, and lasers. Week 5 - Live Fire - Live fire training of all weapons listed above. Week 6 - Combat Tactics - Infantry combat skills and tactics are taught to cadets. Both day and night scenarios are run through. Week 7 - Combat Tactics 2 - Advanced infantry combat skills and tactics are taught to cadets. Week 8 - Special Warfare - Cadets are trained in rappelling, ship raids, hostage situations, and all other sorts of special situations and scenarios. Week 9 - The Underworld - Aptly named, this is when training is the worst. Physical conditioning and discipline training reach their peak, and cadets are pushed to the limit. A vast majority of cadets perform well enough through these nine weeks to be graduated, and officially called members of the Imperial Armed Forces. Their next stop is ACTS or C/NCOS.ACTS and C/NCOS  To train men and women for the many different occupations that can be held in the armed forces, multiple school systems have been established. At these schools, cadets are converted into useful military personnel. Each school system operates a number of individual schools and academies. If a school system trains cadets across more than one branch, it operates schools for each branch individually (for example, Jonathan Keplat Imperial Army Academy is part of the Imperial Officers Academy school system).Imperial Army and Marines Rifle Academy  The largest ACTS in the Imperial Armed Forces school system, IAMRA produces endless legions of infantry for the great Eteno war machine. From snipers to flametroopers, swordsmen to paratroopers, cadets acquire intense training over the course of five weeks in all aspects of their job, and advanced infantry skills. IAMRA is stereotypically the harshest ACTS, with the stereotypical tough-guy 'Sergeant Stanislaw' becoming an object of mockery. Ironically, IAMRA's biggest rival, IAFSC, is generally the toughest ACTS on cadets. As one would expect, training for marine cadets is tougher than training for army cadets. Imperial Armed Forces School of Cavalry Encompassing all manner of armoured cavalry warfare, courses at the IAFSC make hardened tankers, scouts, and guard cuirassiers out of the men and women inducted into the ranks of the school's many students. Cadets at the IAFSC first learn the ins and outs of their future occupation in the classroom, before moving to the training fields to become intimately acquainted with the workings of armour and support vehicles, and for some, more organic mounts.Imperial Armed Forces Weapon and Ordnance Repair School  Arguably the least physically-taxing ACTS, cadets at IAFWORS are highly-trained in the construction, repair, and operation of all infantry and vehicle weapons, and their ammunition. For those incapable of entering the IES, whether because of their low academic performance or sub-standard physical capacity, IAFWORS can be a good stepping stone to becoming an engineer. Those with over four years of good performance in an IAFWOR-related job can apply to the IES.Imperial Engineers School  Condensing potentially six to eight years of higher learning into four months, IES trains the mechanics, engineers, and future scientists that make up the scaffolding of one of the largest armed forced in the galaxy. While physical conditioning is an important aspect to military repair and engineering, intense classroom study and field training make up most of the IES curriculum. Only some of the smartest enter IES, and only the smartest of the smartest graduate. This ensures that regular troops, pilots, and sailors can focus on their own job and not have to worry about their equipment, vehicles, ships, and structures.Imperial Marines Diver School  One of the smaller schools, IMDS is not exactly the school that all cadets dream of attending. That doesn't make IMDS any less important or tough, though. One can only attend IMDS after graduating from marine IAMRA. It is at this school that in the course of only eight weeks, cadets are thoroughly instructed in all facets of the Marine Diver Forces. Without graduates of IMDS, sea operations and amphibious attacks would be significantly costlier.Armed Forces Administration and Technical Academy  Sterotypically the easiest school to graduate from, AFATA is far from easy to complete. In ten weeks, cadets partake in constant computer, logistics, management, and other administrative classes, with very little free time or rest. Without these graduates, a military model of efficiency would shortly break down.Imperial Officers Academy  IOA, over four years, provides well-trained officers with college-level education and military dedication and discipline to all branches of the Imperial Armed Forces. Combining traditional academic classes, field training, physical conditioning, and drilling to create some of the best officers in the galaxy.Air Officer Academy  Air Officer Academies, while not at all inferred by their name, train pilots for all branches except the Imperial Air Force. Like most other flight schools across the galaxy, cadets endure several weeks of classroom study combined with training flight simulators before getting in the cockpit of an actual air or space craft of the Eteno Imperial Armed Forces. However, when cadets finally do get in the pilot's seat, they will train all day, and sometimes, all night for well over eight hundred hours total. While flight training is exceptionally long, individual schools in the AOA school system all train and produce battle-ready pilots in a deliberate pattern, ensuring that there is always a steady stream of fliers ready to replace whatever losses are suffered.Imperial Support School  Imperial Army and Marines Vehicle SchoolArmed Forces Lifesaver Academy  Arguably some of the most valuable members of the military are produced in the AFLA, those who selflessly risk their lives to save those of their comrades. Rescue divers, combat medics, and all other medical occupations are gained through tutelage and graduation at AFLA. Months of grueling physical conditioning and medical study ensures that graduates are more than capable of both killing and healing. It takes only two months to produce a medic, but doctors require a year of training. Doctor training can only be received if a medic has had at least three years of service, and a highly commendable service record. They can then apply for AFLA doctor training, and if accepted, receive a year of training equivalent to three years of modern medical school. Imperial Air Force Flying Academy Most Eteno children fantasize about flying for the armed forces at least once in their life, and half of them fantasize about flying for the IAF. Much like the AOA, rigorous classroom study is paired with constant simulator training, which is penultimate to actual flight training. As IAF pilots need not too great instruction on the workings of starship-based aviation (for obvious reasons), training only takes five months, with classroom study taking place in only two. Several review classes are, of course, present in the last three months of training, but flight practice is the undeniable focus. The IAF enjoys a fearsome reputation amongst the EIT's many enemies, and rightly so, for the pilots that leave the IAFFA are some of the most dangerous in the galaxy. Imperial Air Force School of Ground Staff IAFSGS exists for the jobs that take you halfway in the Imperial Air Force. No flying is taught, but instead technical information regarding the IAF's equipment, support vehicles, aircraft, ordnance, and electronics, as well as the skills to utilize them in the field. IAFSGS produces fit and knowledgable ground staff capable of performing all necessary actions required to get an aircraft in the air in pristine condition. Classroom study plays a lesser role in instruction, as IAFSGS focuses more on hands-on training. This means that cadets leave with greater understanding of their actual job, in regards to carrying out all of the actions required to complete it. Much of the war glory may go to pilots, but those same pilots never let their egos prevent them from recognizing the invaluable services IAF ground staff provide.Armed Forces School of Psychological Operation  The newest school system to be formed for the armed forces, the AFSPO can create a cunning, cold, and calculating psychological warfare specialist out of anyone. Through both hands-on experience and intense desk learning, AFSPO graduates incur crippling demoralization amongst the ranks of the enemy.Imperial Navy School of Espionage  Despite its name suggesting otherwise, the INSE does not train intelligence specialists exclusively for the Imperial Navy. The INSE was formed when the only military branch in possession of a formal intelligence unit was the navy, and thus, was named as a naval espionage school. Currently, the INSE rigorously trains cadets in all forms of espionage and intelligence gathering/analyzing, while developing them mentally and physically to deal with any and all threats and challenges they may encounter while on missions, analyzing information, or commanding missions.Occupations Non-Branch  Note: Non-branch personnel can be members of any branch, or simply attached to the Imperial Armed Forces as a whole.Navy/Home Guard Army/Marines/National Guard Air Force Uniforms  On all dress uniforms, rank and branch is written out on each sleeve. On dress and combat uniforms, name and rank is written out on a patch over the left breast. Medals, badges, ribbons, and pins are arrayed directly underneath the name and rank patch. The Imperial Armed Forces have four main camoflauge schemes, with additional miscellaneous schemes used for more specific enviornments (such as winter and jungle). Also note that all pilots wear dark green jumpsuits with flight helmets.Navy/Home Guard  Officers receive aviator glasses to distinguish themselves easily from enlisted.Army/National Guard  Officers receive grey armbands to help distinguish themselves from enlisted.Marines  Officers receive grey armbands to help distinguish themselves from enlisted.Air Force  Officers receive gold wing pins to help distinguish themselves from enlisted.Military Police  No explicit clothing item has been established to help identify officers.Division of Troops  Unit Name/# Of men/Led by soldier of rank. (These are unit group breakdowns and do not directly apply to battlegroup titles) Note that any unit can be deployed away from its parent unit (such as two companies being deployed separate from the rest of their division, or a squadron being deployed to partake in a small-scale support mission), but the unit always maintains contact with the parent unit's lead officer(s).Army/Marines/National Guard  Squad 7 Sergeant Platoon 56 Lieutenant Battalion 560 Captain Regiment 5,600 Commander Company 39,200 Major Brigade 156,800 Colonel Division 313,600 Lance General Army 1,568,000 Brigadier General Quadrant Army 15,680,000 Lieutenant General Corps 940,800,000 High General Army Group 2,822,400,000 High GeneralNavy/Home Guard (Aviation)  Unit Name/Fraction of/Unit/Led by pilot of rank.

Army Choir - Army choir. Navy Choir - Imperial Navy choir. National Guard Choir - National guard choir. Home Guard Choir - Home Guard choir. Air Force Choir - Air Force choir. Armed Forces Marching Band - Highly-trained marching band for high-profile celebrations or events. 1st Honor Guard Division - Specially trained guards for dignitaries and diplomats. 13th Military Presentation Unit - Highly-trained in military show sports. Guard Cuirassiers - Elite Furala riders armed with sabres. Spearheaded the assault on Maline Tsodus II's Revolutionary Guard. Broke through six lines of fortified infantry units.Special Forces Units  Special forces units have historically been deployed regularly by the EIT for an incredibly wide variety of missions, and those deployed by the nation are some of the toughest ever seen. Black Eyes \u2013 The Black Eyes are highly-trained frontline soldiers, with special training in almost all battlefield aspects. They also serve as special operatives for field commanders who have the utmost pleasure of commanding these deadly men. Tolstoy's Squadron - An unorthodox fleet of nothing but battleships, Rear Admiral I Vladimir Tolstoy was ordered to assemble a 'universal' task force capable of moving quickly from place to place repelling Kklxin attacks on the front line. Tolstoy gathered thirty-seven battleships with at least one from each ship class. This fleet was a perfect mix, as it has enough point defense and strike craft to ward off snub fighters, and more than enough firepower to bring down larger ships in short order. It is a common saying that Tolstoy's Squadron is always on assignment, and to an extent, this is true. Naval Piracy Rapid Reaction Force - The NPRRF is an elite anti-piracy unit tasked with protecting high-value Eteno convoys, and hunting lone or grouped pirate ships all across the galaxy. The NPRRF is the only Eteno force which the Galactic Senate has granted unrestricted passage rights through the territory of minor member nations. The NPRRF is made up of ships and crews with extensive combat experience, and special psychological and combat training focused on preserving civilian life and property, and disabling enemy ships as quickly as possible. Also part of the force are elite naval commandos, veteran naval sailors and soldiers from other branches given year-long specialty classes focusing on ship boarding, combat, and seizure. The NPRRF normally disables pirate ships and civilian ships taken hostage, before sending commandos to capture or execute pirates, seize pirate data and property, and liberate civilian ships. The Iron Pauldron \u2013 The Iron Pauldron is an all-purpose unit of elite infantry. Each member is skilled in at least seven martial arts, and has perfect eyesight and gun accuracy records. They are identified by their Iron pauldrons on their vest. They are extremely effective front line infantry, and even one can do immeasurable damage. They inspire morale and strength inside even the most beleaguered of units. The Black Vests \u2013 The Black Vests, true to their name, are identified by their pitch black vests. They are the elite guards of senior officers. Although the most senior of officers only are assigned one guard, it has been said that it is much better than a whole platoon of Marines. Special Intelligence Service - The SIS consists of the most veteran spies in service with the armed forces. The SIS gathers some of the most heavily-guarded information, be it research data or battle plans. The SIS is famed for having only lost six agents in the line of duty since it's founding in 931 ATGW. Black Squadron - A forty-one craft squadron of Defender-class fighter pilots hand-picked by some of the best admirals in the empire for their skill and experience. The unit is transferred constantly from carrier to carrier, normally being in the thickest fighting all the time. Black Squadron has only lost two fighters in combat. The current Black Squadron leader is Colonel Stasya Zolnerowich, a pilot with over 600 kills to her name. Force 18 - Force 18 may be the most secretive organization in the known galaxy. It is made up of the best commandos the force can get on its' payroll, including commandos from other militaries. Members of 'The Force' conduct unbelievable acts of sabotage on enemies of the empire, occasionally during times of peace. To help keep it as low-profile as possible, the Imperial Armed Forces have created five other forces, mostly of just veteran ground troops. This has confused groups like the Kklxin into believing Force 18 is just another unit of experienced troops. However, this could not be further from the truth. Omdak - Serving as the primary protection unit for the Supreme and Vice Commanders, Omdak has its roots nearly a hundred years prior to the Great War. Originally mere amalgamations of veteran mercenary units, Omdak squads were assigned to the protection of law officials. However, as larger and more powerful nations started to form, countries formed their own Omdak teams made up of well-trained professional soldiers. After the Eteno race unified into the EIT, one great Omdak unit was formed to protect the new leaders of the nation. The modern Omdak is made up of veteran Imperial Army and Marine Corps soldiers, as well as many special forces veterans. These personnel protect the Supreme and Vice Commanders, as well as their vehicles, ships, and aircraft in a myriad of ways. For example, if the Supreme Commander rides in a hovertruck from a meeting to a starport, Omdak will be escorting him in armoured vehicles, ranging from mere cars to military personnel carriers, or covering him from all manner of places on foot. Omdak is also not restricted to covering him directly, and sends personnel out in force to secure the entire city. Wherever the Supreme and Vice Commanders go, Omdak follows, many thousands strong, whether to the frontline or an exotic, foreign capital. Zvezda - When absolutely nobody else will do, Zvezda will. With one of the toughest selection processes ever seen, Zvezda is the pinnacle of exclusive professionalism. Recruits are handpicked from other special forces units, and thrust into twelve weeks of unbelievably harsh physical trial. While many come close to dying, these people are removed from the trials before they pass, however close that moment may be. After the physical trials, during which 99% of applicants are eliminated, a year of advanced tactical training begins. Five-man teams are formed, and these teams train, work, and live together for all of their time in training, and if they survive, will serve together in the field with no exception. Each person is responsible for the whole group, and if one man fails, the whole group does. Only eighty Zvezda teams currently exist. These eighty teams conduct top-secret operations of all kinds, from training foreign insurgent forces to assassinating rival leaders, rescuing hostages related to the Supreme Commander and stealing experimental ships from under the noses of enemy nations. RUA - See article.Unit Naming  Example: 9,386th Light Infantry Guard Division 1st field: Number: The number of the unit in order of creation relative to other identical units. 2nd field: Type: The role/type of the majority of the unit's members. I.E. Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, Medium Armor etc. 3rd field (Optional): Guard: The guard status signifies that the unit is made up of soldiers handpicked for their skill. 4th field: Division: The final field tells what division the unit is. I.E. Platoon, Regiment, Division, Battalion etc. While in English writing style a unit name would be akin to the example, Luuschtuntski style states that the following is the proper way to write the name of a unit: 9,386.

Not only as a show of force as discipline, but as a way of establishing unity, solidarity, and lack of individuality. Listed below are the official marches and paces of the Imperial Armed Forces. Note that any march can be performed at any pace. Guard Pace - 30 beats/min Regular Pace - 40 beats/min Slow Pace - 55 beats/min Head Pace - 70 beats/min Quick Pace - 90 beats/min Fast Pace - 120 beats/min Standard Pace - 140 beats/minTotal/Strategic Nuclear Weapons Stockpiles  The Eteno Imperial Armed Forces currently claim to possess roughly 14 million nuclear weapons. The Imperial Navy has authority over 30% of these weapons, the Imperial Army has authority over 50%, and the Marine Corps is responsible for managing the last 20%. The different types of nuclear weapons possessed are listed below, along with how many there are as a percentage of the stockpile. Fusion Weapons (H-Bomb) - 70% Fission Weapons (A-Bombs) - 30% These stockpiles are stored at five-hundred confidential locations across the empire. These installations are believed to have enormous layers of security, as well as safe emergency neutralization protocols. Only six Eteno in the galaxy know the locations of all facilities at any one time. These men are the four chief nuclear directors appointed by the Council of Generals, as well as the Supreme Commander and his/her Vice Commander. The Supreme Commander and Vice Commander can authorize a full-scale nuclear attack if both agree to do so, and if one is dead or incapacitated, the other can authorize a strike. In the absence of both national leaders, all remaining nuclear directors must agree to launch a nuclear strike. If all six primary-authority individuals are no-factor during a crisis, the decentralized KONRAD Strategic Nuclear Computer System takes control, and makes decisions based on all data available to it.Launch Orders  Choosing to launch a nuclear strike is a big decision, and requires both secrecy and efficiency, as well as full command functionality regardless of the state of individuals that are a part of high command. The KONRAD system was brought online in 982 ATGW as more interstellar powers presented themselves on the galactic stage. KONRAD automatically is put on full alert the moment contact is lost with any of the six men with knowledge of all five-hundred stockpile/launch sites. It is also put on alert when an extra-planetary nuclear launch is detected anywhere within the SIS' Galactic Intelligence Web.Supreme Command/Vice Commander  When these two men enter office, their first task is to both compose a letter that will be sent to the five-hundred stockpile/launch sites in the empire. These letters (with the Supreme Commander's letter taking precedence) outline the actions to be taken in the event that the empire is threatened in a possibly species-ending war. Each set of letters is declassified only if both national leaders have been elected for the maximum number of terms, and are both out of any political office. While orders almsot always vary, they generally instruct the site commanders to use their own judgement, launch all weapons in retaliation, withhold all weapons, fire some weapons, or wait for orders from the ten major 'Buzz' stations.Nuclear Directors  In times of crisis where both national leaders are incapable of leading or are dead/incapacitated/captured, all available nuclear directors can meet at a pre-determined location and discuss the use of nuclear weapons. If all directors agree on one plan, it is immediately put into action.Buzz Stations  Buzz stations are short-wave radio stations scattered across the empire. Listeners will find that they only transmit buzzing noises, coupled with the occasional beep or hum. Rarely, a set of names shall be transmitted by a robotic voice. What the public does not know is that each station is broadcasting a perpetual all-clear code, signifying that there is no nuclear threat, and no unusual activity. If one station goes silent or changes their transmission every minute for ten minutes, military command is alerted. If more than one goes silent, KONRAD is brought on partial alert, and if one of the ten primary stations goes silent, KONRAD is put on full alert and military leaders are transmitted contingency plans in case of nuclear war. If more than one primary station goes silent, nuclear weapons are readied in launchers and targets are selected in the territory of all possible perpetrators. In the case that all stations go silent, primary or secondary, evacuations occur in all urban centres in the empire, and nuclear weapons are launched into space to begin FTL drive preparation. In the history of the empire, only one primary station has ever gone silent, which was during the Aldaris Incident where a Dhragolon fleet accidentally destroyed a station during a life-fire test in an occupied Groxlands system. This astounding coincidence almost caused the launch of hundreds of weapons at Dhragolon worlds.Wars and Notable Battles Participated In  The Eteno Imperial Armed Forces have participated in quite a number of wars since the founding of the empire in 2 ATGW.

Original Version: All space travel that may pass through any part of the galaxy within 10 parsecs of any Grox Colony is to be rescheduled to go outside of the Grox territory for safety reasons. Any spaceship found to be near Grox territory will be fined. Permission can be asked of the High Court for an exception. Final Version: All civilian space travel that may pass through any part of the galaxy within 10 parsecs of any Grox Colony is to be rescheduled to go outside of the Grox territory for safety reasons. Any spaceship not designed for military purposes found to be near Grox territory will be fined. Permission can be asked of the High Court for an exception. Military space travel is allowed to go within 10 parsecs of a Grox colony for any purpose.Votes  Yea Nay AbstainFeed Back  (from Senator Etah) I am forced to say no to this. My people have been trying to break through the Grox's defenses since time immemorial. Ever since the first Karnasaur ship left Karnas thousands of years ago, we found their shell thin, breakable, but we decided to wait. Since then, we have been at unending war, and now, Ejer Uy wishes to make our eternal combat illegal? No. (from Senator Ejer Uy) Sorry, Senator maybe just all civilian travel (being banned) will suit your needs perhaps? (From Senator Etah) I will allow those circumstances. The Bill is passed under the following conditions: All civilian travel to the Near Core zone is banned; Military travel is permitted. Session is declared over.Day 2  The Chair recognizes Senator Etah on his concerns and idea for bureaucracy. Bureaucracy in the Senate \"Fellow senators, heed my word. Bureaucracy has poisoned our Senate! Many of you fear these bureaucrats, as either they will destroy you and have others turn a blind eye, or have purchased your allegiance. Listen to me! I will save you from these nom'res (Karnasaur insult)! Speak as you would speak, not as those who you fear would! The Karnasaurs would be more then happy to protect you from these overlords, these, these evil haters of democracy! Give us the permission to! Give your vote to us, so that we will be allowed to save you from those who would overthrow this great Republic we have built. Vote Now, my brothers and sisters! Give birth to a new age of freedom and true democracy!\"Votes  Yea Nea AbstainFeedback  (from Senator Ejer Uy) How exactly senator is there an Bureaucracy, there is no 1 or 2 people leading this(well there me and you but that is not the point) Senate, also we do not have sub-levels or the sort, please explain to me how this is not an democracy. (from Senator Etah) It's simple--Storyline. The Senate has formerly been suffering from bureaucracy I fear there may be more, according to the Senate storyline. This is purely cosmetic. Karnasaur Scandle The Chair recognizes Senator Etah on a recent news bulletin (see talk page). \"I AM OUTRAGED BY THIS PROPAGANDA! I DEMAND THAT THIS REPORTER BE ARRESTED UNDER CHAPTER 3, ARTICLE 4, PARAGRAPH 7, VERSE 7: 'All untrue propaganda aimed at a senator in the hopes of removing influence from them due to disrespect is to be arrested.'. But, it is up to the Senate to decide.Votes  Yea Nay AbstainFeed Back  (from Senator Ejer) Leave the poor media alone, if you didnt want people reporting on you, you should get an restraining order. (from Senator Etah) \"Ah, but putting a restraining order on one piece of poperazi scum would bring the attention of more poperazi scum, and the tabloids. Then, I would have to make more restraining orders, meaning more poperazi, and more attention from the tabloids. The cycle will repeat itself till I shut out the entire galactic media! And my private life was violated by that reporter! I hardly ever get to see my wife, let alone have a heart beat alone with her. Its either the media, or the kids, or the Senate. And no, I'm not going to resign. My empire is depending on me to be thier voice. If I finally get a chance to be romantic again, I don't want some Spode d***ed reporter telling the entire galaxy, and making me look like some sex-craver!\" \"The Chair declares the Karnasaur Senator to be going out of order. Stand down, Senator. Thats you first warning.\" \"...I will comply.\" \"The Chair brings foward the reporter.\" (from Senator Ejer) \"As you can see this reporter is your average person, he is only doing his job, and I do not think Senator Etah has any right to use that sort of tone and those sort of words around here, now I think the senator owes this man an apology and we should contiune on with the real things that matter.\" Session is declared overDay 3  The Chair recognizes Senator Etah on his Privacy Protection Act. Bill 2: Privacy Protection Act I will apologize to the reporter, however, I do not wish for this sort of thing to happen ever again. I propose a Privacy Protection Act, one that will assure every senator's privacy is not to be invaded by the media. If this act is not passed, I assure you, YOU will be next. Original Version: Reporters are only allowed to film and watch the senate overall do its job and approve and decline bills. Senators are not to be questioned and reporters can be requested to leave by a senator in case that senator wishes to have privacy for up to an hour. This can be extended by a majority vote.Votes  Yea Nea AbstainFeedback  (from Senator Ejer) \"Is that a threat senator? Because it seems like you are impiling that you will make this happen?\" (from Senator Etah) \"Senator Ejer, how would it be possible for me to control the galactic media? Besides, GNN has gone rogue hundreds of times. They always look to the poperazi for thier reports, instead of their actual reporters. They almost always rely on juicy propaganda. Wait a second... can we please send that reporter in, one last time?\" \"The Chair will comply.\" (Reporter is brought in) \"The Chair would know why you asked?\" \"I told 'yas, I din't do notin'!\" \"...Oh, yes you did! You were a terroist against the Karnasaur Empire, sanctioned as a propaganda unit! I busted you and your cronies after you 6th transmission during my days as IDOWI (Imperial Department of Off-World Investagation), Anti-Terroism Unit! Senators, listen to me! There was a break-out at the Cana Prison Colony, but only one broke out: A person in the Terroist Containment Block. This man: Brak Oloma.\" The Bill is Passed. Session is declared overTrial of Brak Oloma  \"The Defendent, Brak Oloma, is charged with 6 cases off-world terrorism in the form of propaganda, one case of invasive propaganda, and one case of refusing punishment.\" \"Quite the list. How do you plead?\" \"...I'm going to come clean. I know that this will make things better. I plead guilty.\" \"My, thats something you don't see every day. For honesty, as with all who plead guilty, I'm dropping the charges of refusal of punishment. Senators, It's up to you to decide suited punishment.\"Suggestions  (from Senator Ejer) Our empire does not give second chances, we vote for firing squad or slow hanging. (from Senator Etah) The Karnasaurs beleive that less advanced species who use technology that is not thiers to harrass more advanced species do not deserve to join the Ancients. I move for his immediate placement in a stasis pod. Karnasaurs have the ability to simulate dreaming, we can throw nightmare after nightmare at him and he won't ever be able to wake up. It's a fate worse then death, used only against those who have earned it.Verdict  The Chair decedices that the use of the stasis pod is torture which breaks the Intergalactic Genvana Convention, so the prisoner will be given toxics that will not allow him to wake up, and will be thrown in a jail cell. \"No please don't do it I beg you!\" \"Guards take him away!\" \"I will have my revenge just you...\" The door shuts. (As they walk down the hall, the Karnasaur and Hunre senators speak to one another (Talk page))Day 4  The Chair recognizes Senator Yatug Gat, on his Spice Selling Act: Bill 3: Presented by Senator Yatug Gat of the Heglarean Empire. \"Hello. Today, I would like to introduce a new bill. It considers spice.\" Original Version: All spice that is mined is to be shipped immediately to a nearby Spice Storage station, this can be almost anything, from a bank to a spice storage building to a cellar owned by the government of the empire that mined it. It will then be sorted out to prevent packaging mistakes, and then shipped out to a selling station where they will be bought. To help against smuggling and piracy each spice transport, or spice freighter will be accompanied by one single fighter.Votes  Yea Nay AbstainFeedback  (From Senator Ejer) Though there are some good points in here like fighter escorts, I still say this bill needs to be rewritten, because the sorting of spice will cause huge delays in spice-dependent regions. Also some might not even like an fighter with them for the fear of being cited as an military target. So I am not saying yes or no, and wish to let the bill be revised. (From Senator Yatug) Yes, but if we do not use the fighter escorts we will not be able to help against piracy and smuggling. Also, we know of a machine that can sort a ton of mixed spice in under and hour. Because those are the basic points I would like to have in it, I cannot rewrite it. If you have an ideas, you should try to rewrite it yourself, Ejer. (From Senator Raf) Ejer, a single fighter cannot do much damage if they possibly do damage at all. (From Senator Yatug) Another one of my points of the good sides of this. (From Senator Etah') Sorry for my recent abscence, I was attending some business with my partners from the Office of Special Training and Reconaissence concerning the escape of Brak Oloma and his aids (*snicker*). As for the bill, why go through with such a complex process? Even if sorting with this Heglarean Sorting device takes less then an hour, I know other races rely on out of empire shipping compinies for cheaper transport, kind of like those, uh, what was it... something that starts with an m, no, it was h, uh... well, they're a Stage 4 (Civ Stage) species, and one nation relies on the other for cheap products (poor fools, they'll be bought out in no time...). Anyway, paying for the shipping to the storage, the escort, the sorting, the shipping to the delivery station, and then the actual delivery will skyrocket the price for a single spice unit. Empires would rather harvest their own spice and go through the high prices there then deal with time delays and high prices. And that would drain corperations of thier spice mining and shipping investments, dealing a large blow to galactic economy. Would you really want to go through with all those bankruptcy claims, all those requests for economic startup cash, and don't get me started on stock market crashes. (From Senator Yatug) \"It is not complex though. To prevent piracy, terrorism, theft and spice misplacement. Harvested spice is sent to a near by sorting station, which at the same time, is sending out spice, would make little difference. The second point is the escort, which governments do. The sorting machines use very little fuel and rarely need to be maintained. Spice costs would at Maximum raise a single sporebuck, for the safety sorting of spice.\" (From Senator Ejer) I agree with Senator Etah, I am now changing my vote to nay. (From Senator Yatug) I comply, this bill has been rejected. Thank you for your time in discussing this. The Billed is not Passed.Day 5  The Chair recognizes Senator Etah, on his concern for the breakout of Brak Olama. The Chair will comply with his request to keep this from the Galactic Media. \"Thank you. Senators, as I stated yesterday, I am a Spectre. I've had experince in the past with some of the galaxies worst criminals, most powerful organizations, and deadliest plots and conspricies. Two days ago, Brak Oloma was freed from his punishment by a pair of Karnasaurs. I will tell you now: these Karnasaurs are not dangerous. The Spectres will not get involved, as the Karnasaur DOWS (Department of Off-World Security) has juristiction over these criminals. Thank you.\" (During his speech, the Senator looks unnerved and sounds suspiciously robotic. His wings also twitch.)Responses  (From Senator Ejer) What? What is an Spec- whatever? And how are these Karnasaurs not dangerous? They assualted 2 of our guards. We have as much jurdisition over these felonys as you do. Th-. (the Senator stops and leaves the senate building) (From Senator Etah) I apologize for not explaining. Spectres are agents of the Office of Special Training and Reconassaince, pretty much the elite out-of-empire security force. Though technically senatorial, the Karnasaurs have the majority of the Spectres, and so its more or less a galactic Karnasaur Peace Corps. I am one of them. As for these Karnasaurs, I cannot disclose information on them, other then the fact that the Spectres aren't getting involved . They are no more then mere criminals that the DOWS agents will handle (wings twitch again). And I assure you, despite the attacks on the guards,they aren't dangerous (wings twitch). (Senator Yatug looks at Senator Etah in a confused look) (From Senator Ejer) (Walks back in) Sorry I had to take an breather. But I heard it on the outside tv. How do you know they arent dangerous? In fact if they arent, why are your wings twitching so much? (From Senator Yatug) If you can not disclose any more information, was there a point of bringing it up Etah? (From Senator Etah) Yes. Yes there was, but I cannot disclose that information. Now, I suggest you both drop the subject for your own good. And no I'm not threating you. I'm protecting you. The Spectres are above the law. They can do as they please and not have to deal with the consequences. And I have no control over who they think asks do many inconvienant questions. But as I said, the Spectres aren't going to deal with this (wings twitch). (There seems to be a pattern for this strange twitching...) (From Senator Yatug) \"Very well, Etah. Is there any other vital information you would like us to know? Per the privacy protection act, you can ask senators to leave while you tell us if you wish to have more privacy. Like could you please tell us how Spectres are protecting us as we speak?\" (From Senator Etah) \"I never said the Spectres were protecting you. I said I was trying to protect you. I'm not allowed to give you specifics,but they will allow this: Lets just say, I'm the loose thread keeping a 2 ton block from falling.\" (When the Senator finishes speaking, Yatug and Ejer notice a small written note next to them. They both say: \"If you want to know more,meet me on the Karnasaur consular vessel, the Voice of the Ancients. You now have clearence. This note will self-destruct in...just kidding.\")Day 6  The chair recongizes Senator Ejer. \" My fellow senators, this is an grave time for us, we have already had an breach of secuirty, and this is unacceptable.\" \" You as well I am sick, and tired, of this outrage.\" (his voice begins to rise) \" We must not, NEVER let this senate fall.\" \" The fate of the Galaxy depends on us.\" \" So I ask today, Senator Etah to come out with his so called secerts, and tell us-\" (A gunshot rangs out) (Senator Ejer falls off the podium) (Medics rush in to assist) (The senator is taken away) (A few more shots are fired) (The gunshots cease, and guards fill room) (From Senator Yatug) \"Not good. The terrorist group has taken down Ejer. But he is right, we must not panic we must never let this senate fall.\" (From Senator Etah) \"I told you to stay away!\" Guard: Sorry sir, the Spectres couldn't let him go on. This is like on Virmire, remember? We had to choose,and we chose to kill him. Etah: How dare you! (He pulls a pistol out and kills the Spectre guard. He shoots many more.) Etah:I swear upon the heart of the Ancients, upon the foundation of the Karnasaurs, and upon the entirety of the Senate, I will not let the Senate fall. And so I tell you everything. The Hasheons haven't made thier move yet. I know where they are, I know what they plan to do, and I know how to stop them. And with my \"rouge\" status as a Spectre, I will stop them! I, and I alone, shall travel to the Hasheon's home, and I alone shall stop them all. (Runs out of building) (See Etah's Mission for details on his mission) (Senators break out of building and teleport away to their ships to leave. Yatug follows Etah)Day 7  (Senator Ejer returns home) (see talk page) (Senatorial activity is suspended until the Hasheon threat is diminished)Day 12  (Senatorial activity continues) The chair recognizes Senator Otto von Gunther to bring up his introductory bill to the senate. \"Hello, fellow senators. My bill brings up the subject of war.\" Original: No war waged by any empire can be officially branded illegal, and all empires save the Grox will be able to wage war as they please. Final: Only wars with no reason, and wars for fun or massacre are considered illegal, and all other types of war and conflict are not prohibited except by wartime restrictions already laid out by the Genvana Convention. Bill passed with 2/3rds vote (Including minor empires.)Votes  Yea Nea AbstainFeedback  (From Senator Ejer Uy) We Hunres believe that some wars are to be considered illegal, as some are unprovoked, and some are for the fun of war, which cannot be tolerated. Innocent people do not have to die for no reason. We propose that an edit be made to this bill stating that only wars that start for logical reasons are to be considered \"legal\". (From Senator Otto von Gunther) I agree to edit the bill, but only under two conditions. The first being a definite description of a \"legal\" war. The second being allowing wars started for the purpose of liberation and territorial expansion. (From Muryiam Legatu) I am somewhat unfamiliar with how politics work in this region of space, but according to our own laws, we have two main classes of war. The first kind is most likely the \"legal\" war you are referring to: territorial disputes. The second kind of war is more serious. We only officially declare the second kind on empires that violate our Commandments. In secular terms, we declare it if the opponent breaks one of our major laws. Perhaps a war may be considered illegal if the empire breaks one of the major laws of this region, and any surrounding empires will declare war as a police action. (From Senator Otto von Gunther) That sounds like a good base to work off of, Mr. Legatu. My main point is that any moves based on expanding territory would not be restricted. The bill is passed. Session is delcared overDay 13  Due to no proposals for the day by the other senators, Otto von Gunther has now brought up the repealing of a bill. \"Fellow senators, I wish to repeal the Privacy Protection Act. While the people have every right to protect their privacy, we senators have willingly volunteered to be senators and take any and all responsabilities that come with it, as well as inconveniences. Second, the restriction of reporters and the further restriction that can be granted temporarily by this bill can be abused easily for malicious purposes. Say there is a vote on a controversial bill, and all but the senators oppose it. Under this bill, the senators could secretly vote and then just cast the blame on their colleagues, enabling the senators to pretty much bypass their literal empires of constituents. If you wonder why I bring this up, it is because I serve my people, not the other way around.\" Original: The Privacy Protection Act is to be repealed.Votes  Yea NayFeedback  (from Muryiam Legatu) Your arguments are merely speculation of what could happen rather than on what has happened. As we Dhragolon are still new to this sector, I would like to see more documentation on how this act has been abused if it even has. Back home, there is a metaphor our people speak, \"Do not repair what is flawless\", or in simpler terms, \"Don't fix what isn't broken.\" (from Otto von Gunther) Your point has merit, Senator, but we Eteno also have a saying: The wise man strikes first. In these circumstances, this means that it is better to get rid of this legislation than take a chance. Despite the fact that this legislation has not been used for malicious purposes, the problem is that a senator could use it in that fashion. In our own history, one of our rulers was given an Unigram and she took a Rommel.The Great Spice Crisis  In the Galactic Year 940-4 the Spice market is a huge deal and this little story shows the fate of this galaxy. You can post any amount of days, in which the spice prices go up or down. Also remember to number your days. The Base cost is 100 Sporebucks. Note: No extreme days like 100 down. HAVE FUN.

(+16) (131)Species  Species are creatures that may or may not be Sapient (in Tribal Stage) or Sentient (after Third brain marker in the Creature stage).The Roargana Cluster  The Roargana Cluster is a group of stars surrounding Klydell and bordered by Black Holes and the Galaxy Arm Void. The Roargana Cluster is found in the same Galactic Arm as the Sol System. The Roargana Cluster has at least 19 Naturally Habitable Planets and countless Terraformed Planets. There are 106 Stars in the Roargana Cluster (Including one Proto-Planetary Star).Stellar Masses The Roartrana Sub-Cluster  The Roartrana Sub-Cluster is found near the Roargana Cluster and contains two naturally T3 planet with three Sapient Tribal lifeforms inhabiting them. Most of the Stars in this Sub-Cluster are named after a Roargan Captain.Bordering Black Holes  Black Holes pull in all matter around it, creating a void around the Black Hole. This effect seperates the Roargana Cluster from the rest of the Galaxy Arm.Sapient Races  Sapient species native to the Roargana Cluster:The Mrox Empire  The Mrox Empire was a Warlord Empire that existed millions of years ago. It expanded over five whole Galaxies. It was controlled by creatures known as the Mrox, that were driven to extinction by the Grox Empire.History  Originating from the planet Mauron in the Xurtogg Galaxy, The Mrox exterminated many races and conquered five galaxies, including their own. They eventually were defeated by the Grox Empire when the last Mrox Ruler, Percival Kanon, came to the Spore Galaxy in search of the Staff of Life. He sent the entire empire to attack the Grox forces, although surprisingly, the Grox managed to defeat the Mrox Fleet, destroying the entire Mrox species and Kanon himself; the event in which has now become known as The Mrox Empire's Last Stand. Before The Mrox came to power, their homeworld, Mauron, was a planet with green lands, blue skies and blue sea much like earth. but when the Mrox dominated the planet, they turned Mauron Bright red in colour, as a symbol of their dominanceThe Mrox are born  It all began one fateful day, when a gigantic meteorite struck the planet, landing deep into the dark blue ocean, where a bright red cell would emerge out of; this was the beginning of the Mrox.Mrox as Cells  The Mrox started out as the Mroo; which were cells with one flagella and one jaw and two eyes. They usually spent their lives feeding on scraps of meat floating around in the tide. But unfortunately, they made a great target for predator on account of their bright red bodies sticking out in the blue water. So, they needed to defend themselves. they began to grow two spikes; one on either side of their jaws, which they used to fend off predators.Mrox as Creatures  In time, Mroo became big enough to hit the beach,where they became the Mro. They appeared first as creatures with the cell Jaw, two red-iris eyes, and two horns on the top of their bodies that would later become their ears. It was during this time that Mauron was populated by epics mainly, which made survival for the Mro pretty difficult. But then, another Giant Meteorite struck the Planet, Killing the Epics, and allowing the Mro to multiply in numbers and cover the planet.The Mro separate into three different species  The Mro species became so large in numbers that they were everywhere; on mountains, in forests, and some in the sea; They were already forming mouths and heads. but soon, the Mro would become extinct and evolve into three other species; the Mer-Mrox, the Nrox, and The Mrox. The Mer-Mrox would go on to inhabiting the bottom of Mauron's ocean, while the Mrox and Nrox would inhabit the surface.Extinction speculation  While it is commonly stated that The Mrox were killed off by the Grox, there is speculation concerning whether or not this may be true. Also, modern day research by scientists have been done on Mrox spaceship rubble found on grox worlds are now bringing up concerns that the Mrox may not have been destroyed at all, and perhaps they just fled to another dimension through the use of a modified Hyper Coil.Other History  The Mrox Empire stopped the Hunre Empire from destroying the universe, by near-obliterating the world the U.E. was on.Taxonomy  Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Synapsida Order: Therapsida Family: Groxidae Genus: Naturalisae Species: Naturalisae cruelisFreedom of the Galaxy  Freedom of the Galaxy is a story about spore written by Windu223. It is currently under construction.Prologue  200 Million Years Ago \"Sir, Grox ships up ahead!\" The commander sat back in his chair, with thoughts of battle and justice racing through his mind. \"Activate ion turrets,\" he said simply. \"These are Grox sir, shouldn't we-\" The officer inquired. \"Are you questioning my orders?\" The officer stared at the commander, as if offended. \"We can't let them take Vursa!\" The commander rose from his chair. \"You're relieved, get off the bridge,\" he ordered the defiant officer. \"If you can't follow orders, than your off! GET OUT!\" The frightened shipman ran off the bridge. The Grox ships came into firing range after the quarell between the commander and officer. The ion turrets automatically opened fire on the four opposing spacecrafts. The fight has come, and we shall win, the commander thought. The Cascod race has always admired war, but they also admired doing what was right. All of the Cascods stared at their commander, anxiously waiting for orders. The Cascod commander had just noticed that the Grox ships were blown to peices. He looked at the viewscreen, his eyes being flooded with the war reflecting on his pupils. the buildings were burning, purple, orange, red, and green sparked across the air, causing destruction in it's path. \"Lock on!\" the Cascod shouted, pointing toward a vast Grox spaceship. He muttered the words, \"graviton missle\" to his weapons officer, and he nodded respectfully. The gray missle flew towards the ship, casuing a silent implosion as the ship fell apart. \"They're returning fire!\" Orange and white lights flew at the Cascodian Starship, and sparks bounced across the bridge like an excited Tamarian Hopper. The commander looked into the air from the metal floor. Vursa, our homeworld, is lost. The Grox now reign. He sighed, and his breath faded away.Chapter I  Raid Preporations 200 Million Years Later The Yeastmouth admiral walked down the long corridor, whistling as he went. \"Stop Lelzen,\" a voice said unexpectdedly. The yeastmouth president, Jeron ,stared at him with a cold glare. Lelzen felt that he would turn to ice at any moment. \"Are you ready for the attack on the Jigoku base? Are your men ready? Ships charged?\" he asked. Lelzen longed to tell him to shut his mouth, but he forced himself to keep the insult in his throat. If he did, Jeron would have his head off. He gave a curt nod and said, \"Affirmative, Mr. President.\" Jeron eyed him with interest. \"I hope you have them turned into space dust, Lelzen.\" Lelzen ignored the president's words and headed towards the docking bay, ready to command from his chair. The flagship's ramp opened, and yeastmouth guards greeted him with a friendly tone. The captain's chair is especially comftorable this mission, Lelzen thought. The yeastmouth spaceship rose into the air, with children and officers staring at the grand spacecraft taking off into outer space. The sun of Vitos was as bright as ever, smiling upon Lelzen and the crew, wishing them great luck. \"Exit the system, and head towards coordinates 56774,\" Lelzen ordered. The yeastmouth at the helm said \"Aye\" and the ship took off out of the system. Words popped up in red, bold letters, and subsequently, a female voice informed, \"Incoming transmission form the Jigoku Empire.\" Lelzen rolled his eyes. \"Open it up...\" he sighed impatiently. It wasn't hard to predict what the Jigokus would say. If Lelzen had to bet his life on it, he would believe that the hostile empire would fling threats and insults at the yeastmouths. The communications officers answered the message, and a bold, armored Jigoku appeared on the viewscreen.Chapter II  Territorial Empire \"Weak, feeble, pathetic yeastmouths, why are you in our sector?\" The Jigoku captian harshly questioned. Would the patrol report us to their King?, Lelzen asked himself. \"If this is an attack, Yeast-suckers, the king will have you blown into space dust!\" The Jigoku threatened. Lelzen nodded towards his weapons officer, Asiden, and purple pulses burst out of the Yeastmouth spaceship. \"GRAGHH!\" the Jigoku captain bellowed. \"Admiral Lelzen, their communications is down, hull is cripppled, and weapons heavily damaged. \"Show pity,\" Lelzen said simply. It was against the Galactic Code to kill of a helpless spaceship, even if it was the enemy. All of the crew looked at Lelzen, confused. The Yeastmouths and the Jigokus were always bitter enemies. \"Do you want to be set on trial in the grand council?\" Lelzen asked cooly. Lelzen's crew did not respond in words, but spun their heads around and kept working. \"Admiral, Jigoku planet up ahead, Yivid.\" Lelzen nodded, and said, \"call the rest of the fleet, prepare for attack.\" The communications officer became energetic instantly and started to mash the buttons and speak. The fleet began to circle the planet, destorying the Jigoku ship in orbit. \"Enter,\" Lelzen ordered sternly.Chapter III  Protection of Secret The Jigoku turrets opened fire automatically and all of the ships shot their blazing weapons. \"Lock on!\" ordered Lelzen, pointing towrards a Jigoku frigate. A proton missle fired quickly, just as Lelzen wanted. The opposing ship fled, but another quick blast of weapons destroyed it. The science officer looked at Lelzen as if he found something interesting on the surface. The officer bellowed when a yellow laser directly shook the hull. \"WHAT IS IT?\" asked Lelzen with panic in his voice. \"Admiral! we j-just located Jigoku l-lab!\" Lelzen was puzzled at the importance of the subject. \"So?\" he inquired. As a Jigoku fighter fell to peices, the science officer responded. \"It's not any type of lab Lelzen, I found interesting readings down there.\" It's the heat of battle, he thought. Why risk our lives just to investigate a base? The labratory turret positions opened fire with orange lasers. \"GRAGH!\" the science officer exclaimed, \"Medium damage on portside!\" \"Drop a bomb,\" Lelzen suggested to his weapons officer. He nodded to the yeastmouth admiral, and a fire-consumed bomb dropped onto the Jigoku structure. It's damaged, Lelzen thought. Good enough for a life-form to get in without being bothered with security devices. \"Should I send a landing party?\" he asked the science officer. \"Well, Admiral, we'll have to clean out some Jigoku ships to make it safe enough.\" \"Very well,\" Lelzen replied. Explosions, vaporizing, and imploding ocurred around. \"It's ready, sir.\"Chapter IV  The Long Lost Being \"Asiden, Falrer, Kamino, and Janho, you're coming with me,\" Lelzen said. \"Remen, you'll take Asiden's place temporarily.\" The four yeastmouths sprinted towards the transporter room, with the ship tumbling around at moments. The quad-team stepped onto the platform, and they turned into purple particles. It was an odd feeling at first, being seperated into atoms, but most of the crew are used to it. Everything turned black. Lelzen let out a loud gasp, sucking in fresh air. He felt grass upon his feet, and battle roaring around him. The crippled, metal labratory was standing in front of the landing party. \"Head in,\" Lelzen ordered simply. Armed Jigokus attempted a surprise attack, but the yeastmouths dodged, and Kamino grabbed one, pulling the warrior to the hard ground. Flashes of light erupted from the Yeastmouth weapons, causing the Jigoku's to become still. Hunks of metal fell as they ran toward the coordinates set out for them. A cubical compartment was up ahead. Lelzen was the first to go inside. A cage lay in the middle of the table. A green creature was sleeping inside it. A label in front of it said, \"Cascodia Mamaliren\".Chapter V  Rising Victory \"A..Cascod?\" he murmmured. He grabbed the cage, running out of the labratory. No, this isn't true, he thought. Cascods were a supposed mythological species that was destined to rule the galaxy. \"Admiral, what do you have?\" Asiden inquired. Lelzen shook his head and replied, \"I'll explain later.\" The four Yeastmouths saw wreckage when they escaped the labratory. The battle was won. Falrer hailed the flagship, and the Yeastmouths beamed aboard. \"Welcome Admiral!\" the transporter chief greeted joyfully. Lelzen said no words and headed towards his quarters. The bed was fixed, and a desk was empty, just where he would place the infant Cascod. Recklessly, he opened the cage with no caution. The Cascod was flying around the room with his eagle-like wings. Lelzen stared at the energetic Cascod, and collapsed on his bed. This was such a long day, he thought, almost saying it aloud.Chapter VI  Jeron's Control \"Lelzen! Wake up!\" The yeastmouth admiral stood up sleepily. \"Who- What?\" He asked. \"Lelzen, everyone's tryin' to interview you, get out there!\" Lelzen's eyes focused normally to see Asiden. 'Wh-Why does everyone wanna see me?!?\" He said. Asiden laughed, echoing across Lelzen's quarters. \"You found a Cascod!\" he exclaimed. \"Everyone wants to ask their questions!\" Lelzen eyed him curiously. \"How are you so energetic in the morning? Are you buying Cilantrium from pirates?\" Asiden shook his head, letting out a laugh, but fainter this time. Lelzen leaped from the bed and opened the door to see many Yeastmouths surrounding his quarters. \"Ugh..\" Lelzen muttered angrily. Just at that second, a female yeastmouth put a microphone up to him, and Lelzen went away, being chased by the crowd. \"Get away from the admiral, people\" a cold voice said. Jeron held his hand up to the crowd of curious aliens, and the energy died from their eyes. The crowd walked away, with a burning passion to question Lelzen. \"Lelzen,\" Jeron ordered, \"Come in my office.\" The adrmiral was about to put his hand up to question the order, but was interupted by a harsh \"Now Lelzen!\".Chapter VII  Civilizing Under Own Standards Lelzen rushed into the yeastmouth president's office, slightly trembling when he entered. \"Lelzen, I want to talk to you about that....thing,\" Jeron said akwardly. \"What thing?\" Lelzen inquired. It was a stupid question, he knew exactly what Jeron was talking about. \"What about the Cascod sir?\" he asked, still trembling from the president's harsh gaze. \"Everyone knows these things hold immense power, so I believe it should be quarintined.\" Lelzen shook his head, \"But what about the welfare of it?\" Jeron gazed at the floor, and then at Lelzen, \"It's an animal! Why should we care?\" Lelzen kept his eyes fixed on the president and said, \"What about yeastmouth pets? Aren't they given fair treatment?\" The yeastmouth admiral suddenly let out a faint gasp, regretting what he had said. He half expected Jeron to take a pistol out from his desk and shoot a blaze of killing at him. A scene rushed through his mind, before Jeron even had a reaction. A frustrated green creature in a captain's uniform was growling at a scared crewman. \"If you can't follow orders, than GET OUT!\" Lelzen gave a shocked jump backards, only to see Jeron screaming at the top of his lungs. Thank Spode the doors are soundproof, Lelzen thought. \"You dare question your authority?! I can't believe you were appointed as admiral!\" Lelzen's voice boomed. \"I'm sorry Jeron, I just wanted to voice my opinion about what's right for this species.\" Jeron's filter mouth rose into the air. \"Leave Lelzen! I will discuss this with my greater surperior officers!\" Anger bursted like lava from Lelzen, and it was his turn to boom his fury from his little filter mouth. \"Well all of your surperior officers appointed me admiral!\" Jeron bobbed his head towards the door angrily, and Lelzen dashed through the opened door.Chapter VIII  Imploration Lelzen spat at Jeron before he left, and walked down the corridor. Then he stopped dead in his tracks. Lelzen heard a muttering from Jeron's nearly closed door. It was a muffled conversation, but Lelzen tried to pinpoint the subject of it. \"Execute order 8369...\" What? Lelzen thought. There's no Order 8369! Curiosity grabbed Lelzen and urged him to hear closer. \"Mission Objective is quarters 5332,\" Jeron said. 5332! Lelzen's heart began to beat rapidly. That's my quarter's number! It was all clear now. Jeron was going to exterminate the Cascod! Lelzen sprinted down the corridor, accidently bumping into a few fellow Yeastmouths. Still running, Lelzen tripped a Gnosh that was heading toward the trade center. \"Sorry!\" he called at the annoyed alien. He paced down to his quarters, and in a flash, opened the door. Panting, he scooped up the Cascod with his hands. Lelzen heard a faint breathing; Four Yeastmouths were standing by the door. \"Put it down, Lelzen,\" one of them commanded. \"Put it down?\" Lelzen echoed. \"Why?\" The officer blinked, and then responded. \"I'm just following orders Lelzen,\" he said, more heavily this time. \"Put it down!\" Lelzen glanced at the phasers that the officers were pointing at him. Oh no! Lelzen cried in his mind. What do I do now?Chapter IX  Reasoning and Study \"Aren't you lower ranking than me?\" Lelzen questioned cooly. \"Yes, but we cane empower you with given permisson by Jeron,\" one of them said, holding up a dashboard with the Yeastmouth President's signature. \"I see, but I do have the right to be informed of your actions with the creature, right?\" the yeastmouth Admiral replied, \"Unless the man takes away that right, Man!\" \"Admiral, acting like a hippy does not help keep important property away from us, nor does it help promote your public image.\" \"Alright! Alright!\" Lelzen growled, \"Enough with all that! The only thing I want to know is what experiments you are doing with it, it's not that I don't trust you!\" \"You are correct, Lelzen, you are entitled to know all of the experiments,\" the main guard said. \"Scientists and engineers will run a DNA test and try to locate the heritage and taxonomy of the Cascod, and you can perform the operation too, if you like.\" Lelzen nodded., but said: \"I'll carry it to the lab.\"Eteno Empire  Name: Eteno Imperial Triumvirate Species: Etenus Hominidae Home World: Malisk II The Eteno Imperial Triumvirate officially formed itself after Malisk II was united by Jonathan Keplat and the Crown's Army. Their time in years is measured in ATGW. (After The Great War) In 1,009 ATGW, the EIT finally collapsed, and over the course of several years, fell victim to the Third Galactic War's unforgiving annihilation of the galaxy's great powers. Some Eteno survive in small, secluded settlements defended religiously by aging soldiers and their advanced weapons.Flag  The Imperial Flag holds several meanings. The blue represents the justice and solidarity, while the three crossing swords represent the strongest factions in The Great War, in which the Eteno were unified. It is rather simple, and the Eteno coat of arms is based off of it.Biology  See article Eteno (Species)History  Formed in AD 1030 (0 ATGW), the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate has existed for over a thousand years as an aggressively expansionistic military power. For much of their early history as a unified nation, Eteno picked their fights carefully to increase their influence during a period of rapid colonization. Playing the sidekick to several larger, older empires, the EIT enjoyed a minor role in their galactic arm's politics, only fighting on the side of their large allies to maintain appearances. During this time, the EIT exhausted all available territory for colonization, and initiated a massive covert buildup of military might. In 379 ATGW, the EIT seized what could be called a perfect opportunity. All of the nation's allies and foes declared the end of a long, painful war in which their militaries were exhausted, and the EIT had declined to participate in. It was then that the full might of the Eteno Imperial Armed Forces was brought to bear against almost all nations bordering the fatherland. In a mere five years, the size of Eteno territory nearly tripled, and the nation became an undisputed power in the galactic arm. This war, Operation Sparrow, cemented what was already a highly-militaristic culture. In a devastating campaign of conquest lasting hundreds of years, the EIT fought up and down their galactic arm, swallowing up hundreds of once-great nations, and incorporating them into their own culture of war. Sporting one of the most racially-diverse militaries ever seen (despite the great Eteno majority of 80%), the EIT achieved undisupted dominance over their galactic arm in under a thousand years. However, all good things must come to an end. Having ignored a devastating series of skirmishes at the chokepoint system leading to the galactic core known as Omega-18, Imperial Navy ships ventured through the system, directly into Grox territory. They were promptly annihilated, and the Grox launched a full-scale invasion of Eteno space. In a campaign of scorched earth on a scale never before seen in conjunction with the implementation of a system of military service by requirement, the Eteno managed to miraculously fight the Grox back to Omega-18, where they held the line until contact with the Dhragolon in 957 ATGW. Everything after that is considered modern history.Notable Supreme Commanders  Maline Tsodus - First Supreme Commander; one of the ten writers of the Imperial Constitution. Former Royal Marine. Josif Quag - Famous inventor; universally hailed as one of the main driving forces behind the EIT's aggressive program of armament prior to Operation Sparrow. Elrich von Eibeer - Former commercial pilot. Visited Earth in Uninvited Guests Dlanor Nagaer - Received several important military awards prior to becoming Supreme Commander. Maline II Tsodus - Descendent of Maline Tsodus. Went insane and attempted to create a dictatorship. Remi Doloun - Led a resistance force in Malisk City and defeated Maline II Tsodus' revolutionary guard. Maline III Tsodus - Restored the good name of the Tsodus family. Personally burned the Imperial portrait of her mother. Lunder Holmgritzer - Esteemed navy pilot. Vole Monore - Famous Supreme Commander that initiated diplomacy with the Dhragolon; helped destroy the Galaxy Buster. Henton Kadron - Former Rustungmortur Battalion NCO. Kiera Anne - Former High General in the Imperial Army. Present Supreme Commander is Ivanov Monore - Adopted son of Vole Monore.Military  \"They resist? Then we shall pave over them. Do they rise again? Do they enlist the aid of the galactic community? Then we shall pave over them again, and teach the rest of the galaxy a grave lesson about standing up to our army.\" - Command General Stavros Mihajlovic. See article Eteno Military While the Imperial Armed Forces are some of the best equipped and trained in the galaxy, operating such a war machine is expensive, and thus, the military dominates federal spending.Government Three Branches  The three branches of the Eteno government are Executive, the Supreme Commander and his/her cabinet and advisors, the Congress, the central decision-making apparatus, and the Operational, every citizen in the Empire.

No free Eteno shall be oppressed by another Eteno, or a foreign entity. The free people of the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate shall raise their heads in pride in the knowledge that their strength and unity will surpass all others in the galaxy. The Eteno Imperial Triumvirate is a name posessing ultimate meaning on the intentions of all free Eteno. The Eteno symbolizes the unity and strength as a single body the great species possesses. Imperial means that the Eteno will grow and prosper to eventually control the entire galaxy, regardless of all obstacles in the way. Triumvirate means that the Eteno shall rule themselves on account of three bodies. The People, the Legislators, and the Supreme Commander. I. Powers and Duties of the Legislative Branch The Legislative Branch shall be divided into two seperate groups, with equal number of members, conferring bi-monthly to discuss and enact law pertaining to the growing and evolving entity that is the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate.

No act of the legislative bodies shall impede or destroy the rights of free Eteno. The empire shall be divided into 400 equal congressional zones in which representatives are elected to serve in the Imperial Congress. II. Powers and Duties of the Supreme Commander The Supreme Commander acts as the elected leader of the Imperial Armed Forces and head decider when there are cases of utmost importance requiring immediate personal intervention. His or her only duties are to serve as a soldier, serve as an envoy to new and exotic races, and to make diligent and effective decisions based off of the will of the people. III.

Amendments Amendments shall be passed by two of three legislators minimum in both legislative groups. Amendments cannot intrude on the rights of the people. Amendments also cannot contain more than ten changes to existing laws, and cannot introduce over five major changes. V. Imperial Government Power The Imperial government reserves the right to utilize the Imperial Armed Forces, for all uses foreign and emergency domestic uses, such as natural disaster relief or defense of the empire against invaders. The Imperial government is also able to lower or increase tax rates to any rate below 25% percent, which is hereby deemed un-Imperial and despotic to the people of the empire. The Imperial government retains the final right to run public service organizations for inspecting products and services and fire, medical, and policing emergency services. VI. Governmental Levels The empire shall be split into a series of regions. Whenever territory is added to the empire, this area shall be measured, and the total area distributed amongst the divisions of the empire. Directly below the singular Empire shall be four Quadrants. Below that are sixteen Areas, then thirty-two Sectors. Of no predefined number shall exist the individual star systems, and within them the inhabited worlds. Each world shall tax the civilians independently alongside the federal government, and utilize this money as the planet sees fit after distributing three quarters of the funds to the cities of the planet. Every City shall elect representatives to a Planetary Assembly. Each Planet shall elect representatives to a Sector Assembly. Each Sector shall elect a representative to an Area Assembly. Each Area shall elect a representative to a Quadrant Assembly. These assemblies shall decide individual laws and ordinances for their divisions of the empire. The federal government shall grant funds to the representatives and their advisors of each division of the empire for infrastructure projects and government management. Amendments/Rights I. All citizens of the empire have the right to express themselves in any manner. II. All citizens of the empire are allowed to own weaponry up to and including military-grade automatic weaponry. III. All citizens of the empire have the right to efficient and speedy trial. IV. All citizens of the empire have the right to utilize all government services. V.

The government retains the right to call a draft of all males eighteen to thirty, but only in designated times of military emergency. XII. No free Eteno shall have his assets forcefully taken from him by the government, except in cases of great emergency, or when said Eteno is a criminal, or under heightened criminal suspicion. \ufeffRelations With Other Empires Dhragolon  \"The Dhragolon are our closest allies, and we sincerely hope that they will be for thousands of years. Along with that, our reasoning is that the galaxy doesn't exactly need species like the Kklxin and Grox around. I really just don't understand all those activists whining about innocent Grox just trying to live in peace. Peaceful Grox don't exist. I'll just say this: When there is a Dhragolon army out fighting somewhere in the galaxy, they can rest assured that the sons and daughters of the fatherland will be by their side all the way.\" - Command General Kostadin Kovachev on GNN. The Eteno's alliance with the Dhragolon is unique because at one point the two hyperpowers were at each other's throats. When the Eteno and Dhragolon initially met, they put in motion a basic military alliance to defeat the Grox. After smashing the Grox military and ransacking their empire, the Eteno and Dhragolon went their seperate ways for fifty years. After reuniting, the two empires discovered they had another common enemy. In an attempt to annihilate most of their military in a decisive battle, the enemy sabotaged a weapon capable of destroying a planet. A planet was destroyed, causing the Dhragolon to go to war with the Eteno. After the short war, the Dhragolon and Eteno rebuilt their alliance.\ufeff Now, the Eteno and Dhragolon ejoy a lucrative alliance that promotes trade, military co-ordination, and information sharing. One of the main reasons Eteno and Dhragolon get along so well is that they both thirst for the absolute annihilation of their common enemies. Despite being close allies, the Eteno government sees them as a threat to their desired hegemony over the galaxy in the future, and thus, plans are currently being drafted to increase Eteno influence at the direct cost of Dhragolon influence.Karnasaurs  \"I ask him for technology. He says no. I offer armies to help them wherever they are needed. He says no. I offer him the navy's best. He says no. I offer him the destruction of piracy in his empire, and the space around it. He says no. I offer him material and monetary wealth on a scale no one person has ever known. He says no. His tenacity is frustrating beyond belief. I like him already.\" - Supreme Commander Ivanov Monore on his meeting with Emperor Clar Kahn. Having only recently met the highly-advanced race of herbivores, public opinion regarding the Karnasaur Meritocratic Federation is still not fully formed. However, the Eteno government knows exactly how it views the KMF. They're loyal, strong, and irritatingly stubborn. On over a hundred occasions, Eteno diplomats have attempted to acquire parts of the Sauran technological cache. Immense sums of money, military assistance, robotics technology, raw materials, and basing rights have all been offered, but so far no offer has been accepted. While many in the Eteno government are annoyed by their technological reclusiveness and occasional arrogance, they are still accepted as valuable allies. Of course, they are still viewed as certain threats to Eteno galactic hegemony in the future.GHD  \"They stood up to a carrier task force. That doesn't happen. Who the hell do they think they are?\" - Fleet Commander Zakary Rolf to Sub-Lieutenant Sasho Miodrag. There is almost no consensus amongst any Eteno as to what the GHD are to the Eteno, besides a possible source of exotic and powerful technology.Delson  \"They offer us aid, sir, shall we accept?\" - Colonel Zlatko Knezevic to Vice Admiral I Szecby Tarasov. No consensus exists on the Delson, but are accepted as military allies for the time being.Dominions  \"Even our dominions are feared, king, will you maintain your smug attitude or shall I crush the navy you bought from me while I wait for my coffee?\" - High Admiral Gavrail Bjyoyadyjiev, to the now-dead Lisarian King Taranyo. The dominions are puppets, protectorates, small allied nations, and buffer states normally independent in name only. Occasionally they serve as fronts for EIT activity. Dominions, states, and puppets are allowed to form their own militaries and use them as they please, as long as their goals do not conflict with the goals of the EIT.Dominion of Kommenfrau  For a time, the Kingdom of Kommenfrau was a close ally of the EIT. On several occasions, soldiers of the Imperial Armed Forces fought and died to protect their line of succession. However, after the end of the last succession war, the Council of Generals found it unproductive to continually babysit them, and dispatched a force under High General Vladimir Puschenko to seize their capital planet. A once-proud nation was quickly converted into a dominion. This dominion consist of thirty systems in the central-West section of the empire.Dominion of Gleusthaven  One of the three dominions formed during Operation Neculai, the Dominion of Gleusthaven, along with Zdenko and Kleidgoppen, are buffer states along the border with the DFM. There is a larger-than-normal Eteno fleet present in their territory.Dominion of Zdenko  One of the three dominions formed during Operation Neculai, the Dominion of Zdenko, along with Gleusthaven and Kleidgoppen, are buffer states along the border with the DFM. There is a larger-than-normal Eteno fleet present in their territory.Dominion of Kleidgoppen  One of the three dominions formed during Operation Neculai, the Dominion of Kleidgoppen, along with Zdenko and Gleusthaven, are buffer states along the border with the DFM. There is a larger-than-normal Eteno fleet present in their territory.Dominion of Neirdfraullen  Neirdfraullen is a loose federation of 119 star systems located between Delson and Eteno space. The Neirdfraullen National Militia is the largest armed force of all the dominions, and purchases ships and vehicles fresh from Eteno factories, as opposed to being issued damaged or outdated models. Neirdfraullen is also afforded a much greater amount of political freedom than the other dominions, and is referred to as an 'experiment' by some Eteno leaders.Dominion of Clest  Five systems in the far Eastern Groxlands that fill the role of a 'watchtower empire' in more undeveloped regions of the galaxy. Several large Eteno fleets are stationed here, both to protect against alien incursion and to seize any valuable resources revealed in the unclaimed sections of the galaxy, where thousands of nations rule instead of a handful.Dominion of K'krada  K'krada was the first Groxlands colony established by the EIT, and the only colony founded with the intention of making it a dominion in the future. After the collapse of the Grox Empire, four systems were given to the K'kradans in addition to the system already under their control. The K'kradan Interstellar Defense Force was obligated to fight for the EIT under the terms of the system transfer agreement.Dominion of Selegorsk  A cluster of four systems on the border with the Groxlands, it was given to the remnants of the Lagir Republic out of respect for their valiant military that was expressly forbidden from retreating or surrendering when in battle with the EIT. This resulted in the death of over 90% of their armed forces.Kingdom of Larrada  A tiny coagulation of ten systems ruled by a puppet Eteno monarch that serves as a 'watchtower empire' on the KFM's Groxland border. A larger-than-normal Eteno fleet is present in this dominion, and their military is sold ships, vehicles, and ordnance at a discounted price.State of Omega-18  One of the less independent dominions, Omega-18 is a system on the EIT Groxlands border that served as a chokepoint during the first great war with the Grox. Workers from all over the galaxy were hired to construct and repair fortifications on the one habitable planet also named Omega-18 during most of the war. By the close of the conflict, Omega-18's population was only one tenth Eteno, with almost seventy different species making up the rest. Thus, Omega-18 was made a dominion, destined to become a grand melting pot of cultures greater than anything the galaxy had ever seen. It is now one of the richest trading centres in and around Eteno space.State of Thraulen  Forty systems granted to a former alliance of eight species who fought valiantly and cohesively against EIT aggression. Thraulen is a small but strong economic power that serves as a safe haven for displaced peoples (much like the rest of the EIT), and a veritable garden of exotic industries. With these industries, the main eight species hope to bring their empire back to a state of dominance.Fiela Republic  An independent, Eteno/Or'thala mixed colony seized by the Kklxin at the beginning of the Kklxin invasion of the Milky Way. Eventually, it was liberated by Dhragolon and Eteno troops during the Starku Fram Offensive in 1,002 ATGW. Underground political leaders from an influential resistance group requested independence to govern themselves, having abandoned whatever ties formerly existed between the colony and the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate. Under the condition that they become a dominion, the EIT agreed to grant Fiela the right to form their own government. The Fiela Republic National Army consists of sixteen Divisions on loan from the EIT, and two Divisions made up of former resistance members.Dominion of Yanya  One of the most politically contested systems in the empire, Yanya was originally a remote Dhragolon colony, unknown to the Eteno. After the Dhragolon finally met the Eteno, debate rose in EIT government circles regarding possible transfer of ownership for the system. After a series of close calls between trigger-happy Imperial Navy officers and KWD ships, Ivanov Monore made a formal offer to King Rustiagon Karrel to purchase the system. The terms were accepted. It has been decided in the Imperial Congress that the system will be a dominion, with DFM government input accepted. However, the strong IPF presence ensures that there is no confusion about the system's new ownership.Culture Regions  Making up the EIT are fifteen main cultural regions of varying size and population density. 1 - Northern Worlds - Previous industry and infrastructure ravaged by Kklxin invasion, the Northern Worlds now have a unique opportunity to re-invent themselves. If done right, the reconstructions could lead to this region being an economic and technological leader for the empire. Those from the Northern Worlds tend to speak with a Swedish, Danish, or Norwegian accent. 2 - Avgustin - One of the smaller regions, Avgustin has always been the home of ultradense manufacturing ventures, and crime lords. Shady casinos and sprawling factory complexes are made possible by the high population, with Avgustin boasting the second-highest average population per planet (PPP) of the fifteen regions. People from the Avgustin region normally speak with dense Slovenian, Croatian, or Bosnian accents. 3 - Velibor - A stepping stone leading from the heart of the EIT into the colonies of the Northern Worlds, Velibor is densely populated and home to a large military industrial base. Ships, vehicles, and arms produced in this region have only a short journey to the frontline in the Northern Worlds. Historically, Velibor has also been the home of experimental military and physics research. It is the home of both Grjdonsk (on which PBGU resides), and the infamous 'Vikentije' biological weapons lab. Individuals from this cultural region tend to speak with Serbian or Bulgarian accents. 4 - Barany - One of the richest cultural regions in the empire, Barany is a colourful collection of all sorts of industrial and monetary ventures. Lucrative energy-production operations have sprung up in hundreds upon hundreds of systems, made possible by a healthy orbital construction base. However, the true wealth of Barany lies in the resource-rich worlds and asteroid fields, in an area known as the Patrica Zone, which lies in the center of Barany. Here, entire star systems and multi-system asterioid super-belts are relentlessly harvested for all manner of materials, such as Gold, Iron, Magnesium, Silver, Nickel, Helium, Deuterium, Phosphorus, Copper, Zinc, and countless more. Most of these resources find themselves ferried all over the empire to feed an insatiable, powerful, industrial giant. If one is from Barany, odds are that their accent is Austrian, Hungarian, Romanian, or in some rare cases, Slovenian. 5 - Mikulas - Despite having a respectable manufacturing base, and a worthy amount of minerals, Mikulas is renowned for one thing only: food. During the early stages of Eteno colonisation, worlds in this cultural region were found to not only accept Maliskian crops, but allow them to grow almost twice as large as they would on Malisk II. In addition, the many moderately-advanced indigenous cultures inhabiting these worlds grew several species of nutritious mushrooms with an unusually rapid life-cycle. These factors combined to turn Mikulas into a veritable bread basket for the centre of the empire, and a haven for food industry. Those who visit other empires to sample exotic foods normally have only Mikulas in mind when visiting the EIT. The Mikulasian accent, spoken by almost all people who hail from this cultural region, is Slovakian. 6 - Schoorle - Small, relatively new, and a broken-off piece of another cultural region, Mikulas, Schoorle is rarely seen as an important place. However, if those detractors looked at detailed information on Schoorle, they would more than likely change their minds. Many important shipyards are located in this region, along with a significant amount of Dyson Spheres built by energy-production companies. This, and the operation of dozens of noteworthy R&D labs, form the foundation of Schoorle's economy, and thus, culture. Many Schoorlites are hardier, or slightly more skilled than people from other regions, having to make do without significant resources at their disposal. People from Schoorle speak in a Dutch accent. 7 - Hasenkamp - Home to the capital system of Sius, which lies on the border with , Hasenkamp is the cultural region with the highest average PPP. This region serves as the heart of the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate, the home of the strongest industry, largest corporations, most advanced research facilities, and most exotic resource extraction ventures. Those who live in Hasenkamp on average are the richest, and create larger families. Much of the military manufacturing that goes on in the EIT happens here, at the shipyards and manufacturing plants created hundreds of years ago, updated constantly to feed the ever-growing demand for material. People from Hasenkamp speak with a German accent. 8 - Vadim - Blessed with significant material resources, Marszalek became home to many colonists early on in the first great phases of Eteno growth. While relatively close to the capital, the population of Marszalek is considered culturally distant from their fellows in Hasenkamp. Refining and manufacturing are major sections of Marszalek's economy, along with a sound financial sector. Marszalekians speak with a Russian or Icelandic accent. 9 - Juoko - On the Southern border of Hasenkamp, Juoko is one of the core economic sectors of the EIT. Many expansive and highly profitable mega-corporations have their roots here. Supplementing this critical component of the region's economy is agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and metal recycling. Historically, the culture of Juoko has been highly urban, with a relatively small portion of the population residing outside of metropolitan areas. The dominant accent of Juoko's inhabitants is Finnish. 10 - Marszalek - While one may think that Marszalek would be one of the most secure regions of the EIT, it is actually one with a history of conflict and devastation. Originally fostering the largest chunk of Eteno heavy manufacturing, Marszalek was a natural first target for the Grox Hegemony during their first invasion of the EIT. Virtually-unopposed Grox fleets ravaged orbital and planetary manufacturing complexes, crippling Marszalek's economy. Reconstruction went relatively well, with the economy shifting towards light manufacturing, agriculture, and technological research in the meantime. All went well until the Eastern War, where three mid-sized empires occupying most of what is now the Lilya region launched a surprise attack on the EIT. Marszalek was one of their primary targets, targeting the then-rejuvenated heavy industry base. While the invaders were quickly defeated, the damage was done. As of 1,009 ATGW, Marszalek's heavy industry had not been repaired. However, the region's economy had successfully shifted away from that historical focus. Marszalekians tend to speak with Polish accents. 11 - Miervaldis - (Latvian) 12 - Azuolas - (Lithuanian) 13 - Svyatopolk - (Belarussian) 14 - Lilya - (Ukrainian) 15 - Juhan - (Estonian) EIT Grox Lands - From the ashes of devastated Grox industry rose a thriving Eteno-run manufacturing, mining, smelting, and power-generation region. After nearly three decades of reconstruction, the Grox Lands have contributed massively to the continual growth of the EIT in all areas. Terraforming operations have been commonplace in the region for over a hundred years, and thousands of worlds have been made fit for full-scale colonization. The Grox Lands produce almost everything one can imagine, but major products include MOX, Lead, Helium, Neon, Copper, Beryllium, Aluminum, Iron, Zinc, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Prometheum, Molybdenum, Lithium, Bromine, Chlorine, Argon, and Cobalt. The Grox Lands have one of the most rapidly-increasing populations of any region of the galaxy, despite the turmoil caused by the joint Eteno/Dhragolon Grox extermination programs. All manner of accents are spoken here.Sports  Being a naturally aggressive race, the Eteno tend to prefer highly physical games. Major games include Battle Ball, Headball, and Flag Run.Battle Ball  Battle Ball is a simple game in which two teams of twenty throw aluminum alloy balls at each other. When a player is either knocked down or hit in the head with a ball, they move to the sidelines to throw stray balls back into the rectangular arena. The team with the most players on the field after ten minutes wins, unless a team runs out of players first, in which case the other team wins. Battle Ball is the most popular holovised sport in the Eteno Empire.Headball  Headball is a game played on an evenly-divided circular field. There are two teams of ten. A helium-filled leather ball is thrown onto the field, and the two teams use their heads to hit the ball in the other team's goal. Goals are towers with targets on them. Targets with greater elevation are worth more points. The first team that gets to 100 points wins.Flag Run  Flag Run is a brutally simple game played by two teams of ten. One team has a flag carrier that is guarded by his nine other teammates. The flag carrier tries to get across the square field to a goal which is guarded by the other team. This is by far the most dangerous game played by Eteno. Players breaking bones is commonplace.Music  Eteno generally prefer short, repetitive beats in music, as well as rap and anything involving horns. For reasons unknown, music with over 120 BPM stimulate normally-restricted areas of the Eteno brain, most notably the areas responsible for language and reasoning. These kinds of music are played in language classes and government meetings. Instruments that the Eteno use are similar to ones found in the Earth regions of Ireland and Russia. Horns and stringed instruments are also popular for military parades and celebrations. The Veldweiebe is the most common instrument in the EIT. While quite similar to the Ukrainian Domra, the Veldwiebe has a thinner body, and shorter neck. Vieldwiebe players traditionally let their fingernails grow longer than normal in order to pluck the four metal strings, but it has become significantly more common to use a pick. The Veldwiebe is the most common instrument in military orchestras and choirs.Art  In exchange for their preservating aggressiveness, the Eteno are very weak in the area of art. Most paintings made by Eteno depict famous battles, cities, or things related to their religion, Maranskum.Literature  Strangely, despite being weak in the subject of art, Eteno are widely renown for their skills in writing. This is evident in the Eteno religious epic Kraus Shkulsha. The Eteno have produced millions galactic bestseller novels in almost every genre.Food  The Eteno love good food. They have perfected and pioneered a variety of delicious foods including but not limited to: Pasta, pizza, broiled meat, and milk-based delicacies. When Eteno conquer worlds, both soldiers and chefs flock to them for similar reasons. Improving regular food and troop rations. Constantly discovering new spices and seafoods, the Eteno have managed to create a mini-culinary empire. In fact, some of the Eteno's most productive spice mines are owned by restaurant chains. Because the posterboy for Eteno perfection is a fit, young individual, restaurants work tirelessly to appeal to the market for edible, strength-enhancing food. One of the true stereotypes regarding the Eteno is that they produce large amounts of strong alchoholic drink, and enjoy it immensely. It is an unofficial cultural rule that no vodka should have artificial ingredients.Measurement Systems  The Eteno unit system is known as the Standard Measurement System, and is based off of the Unigram (Twenty CM). After that is the Quintigram (Fifty CM), the Feldegram (100 CM), the Yotun (160 M), and finally, the Rommel (1,200 M). Shortly after this system was conceived, it became clear that smaller denominations were necessary. Thus, six more units were created. The Starvogram (Ten CM), the Klela (5 CM), the Arde (1 CM), the Forga (5 MM), the Yola (1 MM), and the smallest non-scientific denomination in the Standard Measurement System is the Derna (0.5 MM).Popular Media  With the coming of the holovision and advanced computers came a colorful variety of entertainment and gaming genres. First-person shooters and strategy games were wildly popular during the age of computer gaming, until the arrival of cheap and plentiful virtual reality simulators. However, shooter and strategy games are still extremely popular for virtual reality machines not only for entertainment, but military training. On the holovision, however, trends have come and gone like tides on a beach. The most constant genre of holovised entertainment, though, is undoubtedly wrestling, boxing, and Flag Run. The most popular non-violent genre is drama.Family Structure  Family is extremely important Eteno, and they see family as the basic unit of trust and co-operation. The Eteno also see their own nation and species as a giant family. Immediate family is the most basic family group to the Eteno, and the most important. Members of family are expected to help each other in their times of need. The next group is all blood-related family. Clans, as they are called, normally have hundreds, if not thousands, of members that keep in close contact. Although there are enormous amounts of clans across the Eteno's territory, some clans have become notable for their powerful members, or their ownership of industries. Notable clans include the Monores and the Tsodus', both politically active clans. There is also the Rothling clan, which owns the galaxy-spanning Rothling Heavy Industry Corporation. The company has a greater amount of saved money than many small empires' GDP. Another powerful clan is the Gunther clan. The Gunther clan has a few members that delve in politics, but it is mainly a military clan. Almost all members of the Gunther clan serve in, or have served in the Eteno Imperial Armed Forces. Members of clans usually look out for each other. The last and largest family group is the Eteno's nation. It is viewed as a unification of all Eteno and any immigrants of other species.Average Citizens' Lives  Whether Eteno or non-Eteno, all those living under the Imperial Banner are granted all freedoms afforded by the Imperial Constitution. Therefore, all those living in the empire have lives similar to this, in most cases. This section details life from birth to death. When an Eteno (or non-Eteno citizen) is born, he/she is welcomed into the clan with a large, elaborate celebration. The child is cared for as an infant up to the age of three. At this point, the child normally can speak crude Luuschtuntski (but ironically, cannot pronounce the name of the language). At four, Eteno children are taught full reading skills. At five, they are enrolled in locally-administered school, or one of many private schools. Richer families may have tutors teach their children along with the parent that stays home (normally the mother). Children, from the age of five to twelve, are taught at Basics schools (or by aforementioned tutors) about huge ranges of subjects. At the end of Basics, Eteno children are expected to be fully versed in many subjects. Expectations and pressure on students is much higher in the Eteno Imperial Triumvirate than many nations across the universe. After Basics, students are enrolled in Intermediates, where they learn all of the things necessary for Advances for two years. After leaving Intermediates at fourteen, students enroll in Advances for four years, until they become officially adults. In Advances, students are taught in every subject needed to be an intelligent, productive member of Eteno society. Eteno Advances students consistently perform quite above many other students in the universe. After Advances, Eteno men and women either continue on to higher education, or enlist in the Imperial Armed Forces. However, the reinstation of the draft now means that all Eteno men must join the military after Advances. Although the draft changes these Eteno's lives, higher education remains the same for those enrolling older, veterans of many battles and hardships. Eteno men and women apply to universities all over the empire with equal fervor, as almost all of them are famed for their high-quality. After being accepted, Eteno work and study tirelessly to get ahead of the competition and get the highest grades possible. While students' parents normally insist on paying expenses and tuition of their children, students will normally pay by joining the Armed Forces Reserve or getting part-time jobs. Male students that were inducted into the military almost always use their saved pay to cover expenses as to afford themselves greater freedom. After receiving their degrees, Eteno men and women enter the workforce or stay in school to earn greater degrees. Many possibilities are open to Imperial citizens, as in some areas there are labor shortages. An Eteno could join the military as an officer or enlist, or find a job in the private sector. With jobs, there are limitless opportunities in the empire. Normally Eteno marry and begin to have kids at around thirty-three. The average family has three-to-four kids and the mother usually stays home while the father works or earns money deployed as a soldier. Once the children are raised and graduate from their universities, parents normally go into retirement after about five years. Elderly Eteno still produce wealth for the empire through investment and loaning, in some cases. Either in their own homes or retirement homes, the elderly live out the rest of their lives in comfort.Trivia ComboNinja  I write some Spore Fan Fiction. I also Clean up the Wiki and make it better.External Links Pages Stellar Civilisations The Roargana Cluster The Alren Cluster Technology Other Missions Languages To Do (Links) The Galactic Senate Special Operations Corps  Moderators - User:SupcommMonroee, User:Krayfish, Users - User:Nra 'Vadumee, User:PantheanRoargan (Language)  Because of the difference in mouth structure between Roargan species, while able to understand each other, they have to speak in, relatively, different dialects.Language Description Phonology Grammar Verbs 1st Priority - Person  The person of the verb is determined by a set of three prefixes. Respectively \"-ke\", \"-ti\" and \"-gu\" for First, Second and Third Person.2nd Priority - Tense  The Tenses in Roargan are primarily the tense that most terrestrial languages have, though there are other moods which can be expressed through mostly unique methods. The present tense does not have a particles that follows the words and instead is the \"default\" tense. The other two tenses, Past and Future, are made by placing the particles \"tota\" and \"xino\", respectively, after the verb.3rd Priority - Negative  The negative of a verb (adding \"not\" to a verb) is formed by placing \"una\" at the start of the current verb-phrase. The Negative particle can also be used on Nouns and Pronouns to express the lack of the Noun or Pronoun.4th Priority - Mood  Roargan's moods consist of 7 different primary forms, 5 of these moods can not be overlapped with each other; Indicative, Imperative, Evidential, Interrogative and Subjunctive. The Indicative mood is not formed by placing any particle at the start of a verb, it is instead merely the \"default\" mood. The Imperative mood is formed by adding \"goza\" to the current start of the verb-phrase, it is expressed when issuing an order. Evidential and Interrogative moods are formed from the addition of the particles \"ruo\" and \"\u0292ati\" to the start of the current verb-phrase, they represent the moods expressed when making an inferred observation and asking a question, respectively. The Subjunctive mood is created by placing a variety of different particles in the sentence in different places, these express at what stance the speaker, or group of, is to the statement.5th Priority - Conditional  A conditional verb is formed by adding \"uko\u0263a\" to the start of the current verb-phrase. The Conditional mood is similar to saying \"would\", before the verb.6th Priority - Hypothetical  The Hypothetical mood is used when stating a hypothetical statement, it is expressed with the particle \"nara\" placed at the start of the current verb-phrase.Nouns Number  The numbers for the nouns are used by one of three particles after the noun. These particles are used for the dual (when there are pairs of the noun), trial (when there are three of the noun) and plural (when there are more than 3 of the nouns). Singular is the \"default\" number and does not require an additional particle. The particles for the other three number distinctions are \"ki\u0292o\", \"xuri\" and \"yira\", respectively for each, after the noun.Case  The case system in Roargan is an Ergative-Absolutive system. The Ergative case is used for the subject of a Transitive verb, it uses the particle \"xir\u01ce\" before the noun. The Absolutive case is used for the subject of an Intransitive verb and the object of a Transitive verb, it uses the particle \"yo\" before the noun. Genitive Case is for possession and are formed with the suffix \"y\u012b\". The Instrumental, Locative and Temporative are formed with particles that occur before the noun, they are, respectively \"x\u016b\", \"\u014bica\" and \"dani\". Reflexive Nouns can be formed by using multiple case markers on one Noun. Case markings can be used for Non-Personal Pronouns to express multiple meanings.Adjectives  The Adjectives agree with their Noun in case distinction but not in number. The suffixes for the cases are, for Ergative, \"\u0263\u0101\", Absolutive, \"yi\", Instrumental, \"x\u012b\", Locative, \"\u014b\u01ce\", Temporative, \"d\u016b\". The Case markers must match the same cases of the noun they describe. The Adjectives follow the Noun they modify and each Adjective must have the Case Suffixes.Modifiers  Modifiers can increase and decrease the intensity of an Adjective and also change Nouns and Verbs into Adjectives. The Affixes are attached to the Adjective that it applies to. The prefix \"\u012b\u0263a\" is used to define Capability in Roargan, it attaches to words that are currently verbs but are not used as verbs. The already existing particle \"una\" can be used as a prefix to express Opposite, it is attached to a word that is currently an Adjective. The suffix \"akoa\" Increases the Intensity of an Adjective, whereas the suffix \"ieki\" Decreases the Intensity of an Adjective, both affixes attach to words that are already Adjectives. The suffixes for Lack and Surfeit are \"igiu\" and \"\u01cero\", respectively, they both attach to Nouns that aren't already used in the primary sentence.Pronouns Person  The root of a pronoun is always the person. The three person definitions are \"dego\" (First Person), \"tuya\" (Second Person) and \"teco\" (Third Person). Pronouns take the place of Nouns and include the Pronoun section of the Table of Correlatives.Number Case Simple Sentences See Also Mouth Structures Krayfish  Hi, my name is Krayfish and I am a sysop on this wiki.

I havent been on here for quite awhile, but am going to help reboot this wiki. I am soon to release several new articles, featuring Species, Planets, etc. Chat me up on my Talk Page if need.Admin Stuff  Width makes it bigger or smaller Top=100 Bottom=200Roargan  Roargan is the 4th planet in the Klydell System. Roargan has a grade-3 Terrascore with currently 30 creatures and a Moon (Clyer) with a T0 atmosphere. Roargan as a planet has existed for currently 3.2 Billion Years while Klydell has existed for 3.3 Billion Years. Roargan has given rise to an unheard of 7 intelligent species, it is unknown if this was natural or if there was some other force at work. The Roaragan Technocracy is currently the most abundant species on Roargan and holds the most percentage of the population. There are 56 cities on Roargan with Roartra being the capitol city.Description  Roargan's crust contains relatively high amounts of sulfur causing the ground to appear yellow, the flora also appears yellow because of the relatively high concentration of sulfur in the plants. there are five continents, two of them at the poles and the other 3 near the equator, the ice caps sit on the two continents at the poles causing a large change in water level between the seasons.Tectonics  Roargan's Tectonic activity is relatively slow compared to other planets and also has less volcanoes. their are currently 4 distinct Tectonic Periods because of the slow tectonic activityBiome  The Biome of Roargan consists of Forests, Mountains, Grasslands, Mudflats, Beaches and Arctic areas. Forest areas are Relatively rare and are usually divided into 3 types of forests all consisting of a single colour. Lifeforms in the forests are common. Mountains are common at the equator and the south pole, Shagranas are common in the mountains. Grasslands are found near the equator and are large expanses of a single species of grass which provides food to many species. Mudflats are common on Roargan and are found on the coastline of all continents. Mudflats support large ecosystems revolving around mudbound flora. Beaches are uncommon on Roargan and do not support as large an ecosystem as other Environments. Arctic areas are the least populated environment on Roargan and only contain a few cold-adapted species. There are currently 30 different native species on roargan with\u00a0??? species extinct.Geological Periods  Main Article: Roargan Geological Periods There are 9 geological periods extending from the formation of Roargan to the present day.Clyer  Roargan's Moon, Clyer is Purple because of the dust that covers the surface. Clyer has a 0-grade Terrascore and doesn't support any life. Clyer is completely barren except for a Roaragan Colony, Clyen.Philosophy  Philosophy is the Archetype space faring creatures follow in the Space stage. This varies depending of past traits. There are ten found in game but there is also a large amount of \"forgotten\" archetypes that were forgotten after the other ten took them over (with the exception of Scholar and Dragon). Wanderer and Knight are on the verge of being forgotten, and when they are forgotten the Galaxy will be left with only 8 main archetypes. However, all of the ancient scrolls, tablets, stones, commandments and books of the archetypes are still in museums in the galaxy today. The following is a list of all known archetypes (meaning add your own). In total, there are 22 known archetypes.List Warlord  \"Warlords are very vicious and distrustful. They will go to any lengths to crush their enemies, such as using planet busters.\" Warlords are very distrustful at first (-50 Relationship) so players tend to rarely ally with them at all. Warlords have Communism as a government, and speak with a rather proud, but also somewhat evil voice, sounding in the Baritone or High Bass range. Warlords will not even care if an empire breaks the Galactic Code. If you are a Warlord yourself, you will have -20 relationship with others (except other Warlords and Warriors) because \"You are a Warlord.\"Warlord Unique Power  The Warlord acquires the System Incinerator unique ability. System Incinerator implodes all planets in a system, leaving only a star. It has a one hour cool down.Gaining The Warlord Archetype  To become a Warlord, you must have all red cards, and also not ally any creature (besides your own), tribe, or nation throughout you evolution.Through Mission  First you must ally with an empire following this philosophy with a strength factor of 4 or 5, then you may request to become 'like' them from the mission interface. After paying \u00a720,000,000, the mission given is to Completely destroy 20 empires. Upon completion return to claim your reward and you will change your philosophy and associated archetype, losing your old superpower and gaining the Warlord's System Incinerator power.Warlords's Philosophy  \"We, the Warlords Empire follow the Philosophy of War! We use lasers, bombs, and plenty of other things such as nukes to destroy our bitter foes, and you too will be destroyed! Our awesome weapons will destroy you and others! We have the fearful System Incinerator. We use this to treat any empires we dislike to a loss of a system.Voice  Warlords speak with a evil yet proud voice that sounds male. Their pitch is high in the Bass range, and some say it is Baritone.Galactic Adventures Campaign  The special adventure only given by Warlords is Victorious War. In Victorious War , the Captain must beam down onto a swamp planet to assault an enemy factory and destory it so they would have a disadvantage in a war.Spyzombie45  Hi there, leave a message for me if you want. Thanks for welcoming me, that price change was a reference to a series of adventures I'm going to make once I get GA. As reference for the Story: Traconian Military RanksCheat 03:03, 1 July 2009 (UTC)Re: Nice to see you!  Oh, ya. I've been busy for a long while, so I couldn't get on wikis much. Thanks for the nice greeting! -Windu223Galactic Empires  I am Nra 'Vadumee, \"Emperor of the Karnasaurs\". Anyway, thanks for not blowing me up. I will, of course, accept your negotiations, and I look forward to an alliance. Feel free to contact me, I check my messages regularly. And perhaps you could introduce the Karnasaurs to your allies, and may we stand firm in the face of any threat. --Nra 'Vadumee 02:34, 21 July 2009 (UTC)Proposal for Galactic Empires  As the only moderator, I wanted to run something by you for Galactic Empires. I was thinking that the talk page could be used as a place for people to talK more thoroughly or to explain something. For example, The Karnasaurs have multiple diffrent types of fighters and bombers. Basically, the talk page can be used for people to tell others how their military works, what this and that means, to more thoroughly negotiate, etc. If we should use only a generic type of gameplay, I understand, but more specific gameplay seems more fun. Please reply with your thoughts on it. --Nra 'Vadumee 17:32, 23 July 2009 (UTC)Re: War Article/ Peace Council  Sure, an article sounds like a good idea. By the way, do you want to make a Peace Council page for us to talk on? --Nra 'Vadumee 18:18, 29 July 2009 (UTC) I did make one but I deleted it--Spyzombie45 19:05, 29 July 2009 (UTC)RE: Good work  Spyzombie, Hmm... I'll give it a serious thought. However, I'm on holiday from Wednesday to Sunday, so I'll miss out quite a bit. Oh well, it'd only make for a bigger challenge!Post  Post at the Peace Council!!!!  17:19, 4 August 2009 (UTC) --Fegaxeyl 07:24, 3 August 2009 (UTC)WTF?!?  OK, I go on a vacation for 4 days, and you've destroyed my empire? What the h***, man! I thought you said you had to ask permission to destroy empires! You god-modding little cocherspaniel! I am ticked off, man! But alright then, If you want to play that way, then fine! --Nra 'Vadumee 18:15, 5 August 2009 (UTC) --Nra 'Vadumee 18:50, 5 August 2009 (UTC)In the Senate  Look at the Community Proposals page. --Nra 'Vadumee 19:13, 5 August 2009 (UTC)NPC Actions  Ah, what the heck? Why not. Sure, I'll be the NPCs, but I'm confused, isn't GE over? Or are we (you & me) just not playing any more? Either way, I'll still do it. --Nra 'Vadumee 19:44, 5 August 2009 (UTC)Ok  Ok, but if no one makes an entry for 5 days, I say you shut it down. --Nra 'Vadumee 19:48, 5 August 2009 (UTC)RE: In the Senate  Sure, create it, put some stuff in, and I'll change it around, then you can reply on my changes til we are where we want to be. Please don't start it till we're finished. --Nra 'Vadumee 21:18, 5 August 2009 (UTC)GE Possiblity  Hey, you want to make Galactic Empires and the Aftermath like a \"what could have been\" kind of thing? Alternate universe kind of thing. Because I don't want the Karnasaurs destroyed, and I don't think you want the Hunres destroyed. --Nra 'Vadumee 21:21, 5 August 2009 (UTC)The Aftermath Problem  Hey, did you see what TimeMaster did to The Aftermath? Did he ask you if he could delete it all and start all over? He didn't ask me. I know its his article, too, but I think we have a say in deleting and restarting. --Nra 'Vadumee 23:19, 5 August 2009 (UTC)Apology and Explaination  I'm sorry for throwing in Stargate, its just my favorite franchise and I didn't know it would cause so much commotion. Also, I'm not trying to make it seem like the Karnasaurs are real. Ghosts can actually kill the living and destroy the corporeal. The fleet isn't there anymore, it just seems like it. They show up on scanners, but no one can see them or feel them, just suffer the consequences of what would happen if they were there. They can't be destroyed, they can't be \"banished\", and they can't be stopped. All you can do is either stay away, or pray to Spode for salvation. I know this stuff, I watch \"A Haunting\", a show about ghosts and demons and spirits (oh my! lol) an them haunting the living. They've come preety close to killing them, and they've interacted with real objects before. Its all real, complete with interviews with the survivors. Anyway, I hope this clears things up. We cool? --Nra 'Vadumee 16:03, 6 August 2009 (UTC)The Senate  Sorry its so confusing, I'm used to complex games. Feel free to reedit it. I won't mind. --Nra 'Vadumee 00:46, 7 August 2009 (UTC)Request  Can I be moderator so I can edit stuff. Or maybe we should just kill the rank altogether.  01:35, 11 August 2009 (UTC)Edit to Karnasaur  Spyzombie, I just saw that edit to Karnasaur. I expect you haven't looked at GE in a while. I made it so that there wasn't a detonation in real life, but rather in an alternate reality. As in, what could have been. I don't know about you and the Hunres, but I don't want the Karnasaurs to be wiped out. Also, next time, please ask me before you edit my articles. Then again,I do need to get an ownership template on them. But please ask next time. I'm pretty sure yo made that edit, but if you didn't then I'm sorry for the false accusations. --Nra 'Vadumee 16:10, 20 August 2009 (UTC)New idea  Hey, I've had an idea for a new project, seeing that the Senate Hall has sort of stalled. Basically, it's Galactic Empires in the Tribal stage! The dynamics as GE should be more or less the same - colonising new planets would be gaining new members, ships etc could be domesticated animals - but because it is in the tribe stage there is no way we can have UE-style powergaming weapons that cause major trouble. What do you think? --Fegaxeyl 10:36, 27 August 2009 (UTC)The Senate Hall  Spy, I don't want this project wrapped up yet. I was thinking that Ejer could be a triple agent, and secretly plants a bomb in the Hasheon base and destroys it. Respond with comments. --Nra 'Vadumee 20:35, 28 August 2009 (UTC)Userboxes  What happened to the userboxes? Ekaj Renrut Message me Or else... 16:15, 29 August 2009 (UTC)Galactic Empires restart  Hey, The wiki's activity is effectively nil, and my idea of GE in Tribe stage didn't go very far, so how about a restart of GE, only set in the universe where the UE didn't go off? That way we'd be able to resume our previous activity and fit it in with the Senate Hall etc. What do you think? --Fegaxeyl 20:01, September 11, 2009 (UTC)Wiki-Twins!  I have found a Wiki-Twin!

And I have two heavily detailed adventures up titled Himuro Base and Spaceport (Do most Recent editions)Diplomatic Message  From: Eteno Empire To the Darun Empire! Sentient Empire, We seem to be relatively new, and to be blunt, diplomatically behind in the galactic theatre.

Fresh empires need to band together, do they not?The Hunre Revolt  Would you like to expand it with me?  00:45, July 15, 2010 (UTC)Featured Empire  I was wondering if I could get my Eteno Empire as the Empire of the week. The reason I have been a little bit silent is that nobody else seems to be consistently using Galactic Empires. Rest assured, I am still here67.183.73.242 18:49, August 1, 2010 (UTC)'Sup?  Hey, Spyzombie45. I have a few things to ask. The first is how can the Hunre have so many more vehicles than soldiers? Even if every single vehicle or spacecraft was automated, it would take many more mechanics than 17000 to manage that massive of a fleet. I don't mean to be rude or anything, just pointing that out. Second, do you think my Eteno could be the empire of the week this week? Seeing as how we haven't had one for several months and mine is constantly being updated, I was just thinking it would be nice to fill that empty hole. Thank you in advance. (Crap. This is the second time in a row I asked this question. Sorry) Regards, SupcommMonroee 04:55, November 16, 2010 (UTC)The Senate Hall  I just asked TimeMaster if the Senate Hall could get going again, and I was wondering if you would get into it if the project did get going.

Deniable Ops Sign up  Just go to my blog postRules:  Please try to be realistic, don't conflict with anyone's post, and have some fun. Same as beforeStory Prologue  August 2, 1964 Hon Nieu island, Gulf of Tonkin \"GRENADE!!!!\" yelled George Wilson, as he ducked for cover behind a rock. The grenade exploded, sending 2 SOG operatives flying the air. It had only been a few minutes, and Wilson's team was getting their asses kicked. Wilson held his CAR-15 hard, and fired over the rock in a short burst. The NVA were screaming out both orders and death shrieks. \"U.S.S. Maddox, this is George Wilson, we need suppresive fire on Hon Nieu now!!!!\" yelled Wilson over his radio. The Captain responded, \"Sorry, no can do, we've got three Torpedo Boats on our tails, and we're focusing fire on them.\" Wilson threw his radio on the ground, and yelled \"Christ!\". He took a peek around the rock, and could see the huge munitions dump, with gunfire flashs coming out of it. Wilson hit his back with the rock, trying to think of what to do. All he could come up with idea wise was him getting shot, but he had to take the chance. Wilson said a quick prayer, and bolted out from behind cover. Dirt flew up from behind him as the NVA tried to shoot at him. Wilson ducked for cover behind a concrete wall, and then exhaled. He had only gotten about 10 feet. New plan, thought Wilson, as he searched his mind for a better idea. Another SOG member came crashing behind the wall, looking around nervously. Wilson looked down at the soldiers weapon, and saw a M79 grenade launcher in his hands. \"Let me see that grenade launcher, soldier\". The SOG operator obiediently handed over the M79. Wilson took a deep breath, and leaned outside of cover. He then took aim at one of the NVA soldiers, and fired a grenade. The explosion took out 3 NVA soldiers, tearing them to pieces. He handed the M79 back, and said \"Thanks.\" The SOG operator was amazed by Wilson's great shot. \"Ok, we're going to move up to that truck up there.......\" Bullets tore through the SOG operator, which interupted Wilson. \"DIE, G.I.!!!\" yelled the NVA soldier, taking aim for the shot. Wilson quickly took out his combat knife, and threw it at the soldier. It went right between his eyes, and the soldier collapsed to the ground. Wilson walked over to the dead soldier, and took out his knife from the head. \"That's what you get for messing with me,\" said Wilson. He then saw where the NVA soldier had come from, a secret path in the jungle, and started running toward it. The gunfire was relentless on the other side of the treeline, so Wilson had to walk slowly. He didn't want to die here. When Wilson reached the otherside of the secret path, he found himself behind the muntions dump. Wilson smiled, it was time to kick some NVA ass. He saw three NVA soldiers running for the back door, and sprayed them with bullets. They all flopped to the ground like fishes. He ran to the backdoor, which was made out of wood. He shot the hinges with his CAR-15, and kicked in the door. Two NVA radio operators were stunned by Wilson's entrance, but the only thing they saw after that was darkness. Wilson kept moving along the hallways, aiming his rifle in case an unlucky NVA soldier ran out. He checked rooms as he passed by, but all were empty. Wilson reached the stairs, and started to walk up them. Each step made him feel closer to the gunfire. Wilson reached the stop of the stairs, and quickly silenced a NVA soldier. He went over to the soldier, and checked him for ammo.He found some 7.62 clips, but his CAR-15 couldn't take that kind of round. He went away from the body, and preceded to the MG post. He got to the door nearest to the MG post, and looked around it. There was a NVA soldier firing a mounted RPK, with another spotting targets and feeding ammo. He needed to take these motherfuckers out fast, so he picked out one of his gernades, pulled the pin, and gently rolled it toward the NVA gunners. He quickly took cover behind the wall, and felt the tiny vibration of the gernade's explosion. He then left the cover behind the wall, and was back in the sunlight. Wilson stepped in blood as he shot the remaining NVA soldiers on the balcony. There were only five of them to mop up, so it wasn't really hard. He then waved at the SOG members to signal the all clear, and they began to move up. Wilson heard someone on his radio say, \"This is the U.S.S. Ticonderoga, have you secured Hon Nieu?\" Wilson replied, \"Affirmative, we are about to set up the C4 charges, can you come pick us up?\" \"Roger that,\" said the radio operator \", we'll send in a Huey to get you out of there.\" Roger flicked off the radio, and sat on a crate. He looked at the beach they had landed on, and thought about how the 30 mins had turned to what felt like 2 hours on this island. The SOG team leader had just arrived on the Balcony, and was avoiding the mutalated NVA gunner's. \"Hot damn, I haven't seen this type of work like this since Korea\" said the SOG team leader, chuckling. Wilson laughed \", why do you think they sent me here?\" Undisclosed Limo in Washington D.C., 10:00 P.M., 1965 Wilson sat looking outside as the monuments passed by. The CIA Director sat in front of him, smoking a cigarette. \"I've been reading your reports Wilson,\" said the operative \", especially at Tonkin. All of them are excellent.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Wilson, now directly looking at the director. \"So what am I doing here, sir?\" asked Wilson. The director chuckled, \"Well now, don't you get down to buisness?\" The Director pulled out a folder, and handed it to Wilson. Wilson opened up the file, and it showed a picture of a Russian Scientist. \"Yuri Lutrova. One of the biggest Russian Scientists; and he's defecting.\" Wilson didn't even need anymore information \",where do I find him?\" The Director smiled, \"Let's just say he's behind a certain 'curtain',\"Chapter 1: Behind the Iron Curtain  March 1st, 1965, 9:45 A.M. West Gemany Wilson stepped out of the cargo jet, fully awake from his sleep. The sun was bright, and there was a brisk chill. F-4 Phantom's were taking off and landing on the runway, since Bonn Airforce Base was always active. A jeep pulled in front of him, and the soldier said \"Come with me, I'll take you to the barracks, where you'll meet the team members.\" Landon sat reading a report as a man entered the barracks, he took a sip of his whiskey spiked coffee and got up \"You must be the SOG guy, Agent Jack Landon, CIA. Nice to meet you.\" He shook the man's hand and said in his gruff voice. March 3rd, 1965, 1200 hours Jacinto AFB, South Vietnam Will Howlett watched all the men from the 67th Reapers walk into the hangar. He waited for Nick Anderson to come into sight. Howlett peered through his shades and recognised the face he saw. Howlett stood up and walked over to Anderson while grinning ear to ear. \"Hey, Anderson! You look like hammered shit!\" Will said while shaking Andersons hand. \"How was 'Nam? We got deployed last week at Mah Tue city. We took a beating though.\" Will coldly reported. His grin faded quickly. \"Well, the POW camp was destroyed before we got there. I still have no idea what happened.\" Nick replied. Will was disturbed by the news, there were reports of the VC bombarding their own POW camps so that the prisnors would not be rescued. Crazy basterds Will thought \"Well, lets talk about Rhen Tah. 28th Tigers, led by Lieutenant Chris Saturn, were captured and are being held there. Now only 12 men were captured and Saturn and his other men will accompany us. The 91st Snakes provided this intel.\" Will handed Nick a folder, inside was info on the POWs, the leader of the NVA Company at the area and on guard routines. \"The 52nd Hummingbirds will provide air support, the 74th Silverbacks will escort us there and the 40th Pheonixes will take out any hostiles on our way back.\" Will continued. \"Well\" Nick said, \"let's roll\". March 3rd, 1965, 2000 hours. West Berlin, near the Berlin Wall. Wilson watched the Soviet wall guards as they moved the searchlight. Jack Landon was kneeling near him, also watching the guards. \"I still can't believe that your both CIA and SOG, how the hell did you get that?\" wispered Landon. \"Shhhhhh,\" wispered Wilson. Wilson saw the searchlight turn the other direction, and saw that the guards were just talking. He quickly grabbed a long case they had with them, and opened it. Inside was a disassembled Crossbow, complete with a lon zipline. Quickly, Wilson began to assemble the crossbow together. It took him less than a minute to complete it. He then said to Landon, \"Once I shoot this, we've got to get over. The guys behind us will reel in the zipline, so we won't attract attention.\" Landon nodded, and began to get his stuff ready. When Landon was done, Wilson aimed the crossbow. He felt for the trigger, and pulled back on it. The Zipline began to fly, toward it's target of another building. Wilson felt the crossbow jolt a little forward; the zipline hit it's target. Wilson attached the wire to the holder, and attached himself to the zipline. He flew down from the roof, and over the Berlin Wall. \"Good, our mole left us some uniforms,\" said Wilson, pulling out a Soviet Army unifrom. Landon had also recieved a uniform, and they both began to change quickly. When they were finished putting on their clothes, they headed outside. \"Damn Wilson, I don't like being out here, especially with our own guns. They'll spot us in a minute.\" \"Not if you just keep quiet and let me do the talking,\" said Wilson \", come on, let's move.\" They silently ran through the streets of East Berlin, only slowing down when they were close to Soldiers or checkpoints. \"Are we almost near the target,\" asked Landon while running. Wilson talked without looking back, \"Yep. It's really close by. He's hiding in an apartment complex right now, and he's already got his car waiting.\" It took them a couple more blocks before they got to the complex, and both Wilson and Landon were greated with an unpleasant suprise. \"Shit,\" said Landon \",the Ruski's found him.\" There were three trucks in front of the rectangular apartment, with four guards posted in front. Near the roof, a small glimmer of light was shown from a window. \"Look's like we're going to have to find another way,\" said Wilson. \"Don't worry, I learned this when I went to sabotage a Berlin KGB meeting once, there's always a basement passage, always. They built 'em during WWII. We should move to the next building, and from there we can waltz right in from below ground.\" His new colleague Wilson nodded, and they strolled over to the next apartment building, grabbing 2 AK-47's along the way. When they got inside of the nextdoor apartment, they immediatly started heading for the basement. When they got down to the basement, Wilson spotted a tiny door. \"Well I'll be damned, you were right,\" exclaimed Wilson\" Landon smiled, and said \"Told you\". Wilson headed for the small steel door, and started to pull it open. They both squeezed through the small corridor, and eventually found themselves in the other apartment's basement. \"I'm taking point,\" said Wilson, holstering the AK-47 over the hidden CAR-15. Wilson and Landon began to walk upstairs, and Wilson opened the door. They started to head for the stairs that lead upward, when Wilson saw a soviet officer in front of him. The officer said in russian, \"Comrades, what are you doing in this hallway? We're supposed to be guarding the entrance.\" Wilson thought of something quickly, and then said in perfect russian \"Sir, we were tasked with checking each one of the rooms, to make sure there are no civilians in the area.\" Wilson hoped that what he said convinced the Officer; as the Officer looked up and down at Wilson. \"Alright,\" said the Officer \", but make sure you don't kill civilians. The commander will be on my ass if it's on my report,\" said the Officer. \"Oh, don't worry,\" said Wilson; smiling \", we won't.\" It took Wilson and Landon almost 5 minutes to get up to the tenth floor, where Yuri Lutrova was hiding. They silently began to close in on Yuri's apartment, 1301. \"Wilson,\" said Landon \", I think I hear something.\" Wilson stopped moving for a second, and adjusted his hearing. \"They're torturing him,\" said Wilson, throwing down his AK, and taking out his Silenced CAR-15. \"Landon, I hope you have something silenced, because we've got to get in there without attracting attention.\" Landon checked his equipment, \"Nothing.\" he then saw two decorative, midieval axes on the wall above him, Smiling, he said, \"Guess I'll just have to improvise.\" Wilson smiled. \"Okay\" Landon said,\"Three, two, one.\" as the two rammed the door open Wilson pumped an easy 10 rounds into one of the guards, and Landon swung his axe into the other's neck, causing his corpse to ram into a closet door, and knock the hinges right off. As he approached the beaten defector he said, \"Mr. Lutrova, we're here on behalf of the US government, I'm Agent Jack Landon, CIA SAD, and this is my good friend Mr. George Wilson, MACV.\" \"And CIA,\" said Wilson, untieing Lutrova. \"Thank you,\" said the Lutrova \", I thought I was going to die here\" \"Well, the fun's not over yet, Mr. Lotrova,\" said Landon. \"Wha wha what do you mean?\" said Lutrova, nervously. \"Landon, tie the ropes to the pole over there, that should get us to the car,\" said Wilson \", Mr. Lutrova, I'm going to need you to tie this rope to yourself; and Landon, sabotage the gas to this room, I want this place to look like an accident.\" Lutrova still did not understand what was going on, but tied the rope to himself anyway. \"I attached some C4, Wilson,\" said Landon, closing the sink doors. Wilson took Lutrova over to the window, and tied the rope to him. \"Wait a second, what is going on here!!!!\" yelled Lutrova. \"Are you attached, Landon?\" said Wilson. Landon nodded, tugging on his rope. \"Try not to scream, Mr. Lutrova,\" said Wilson, before jumping out of the window backwards. Knowing that he would try to scream, Wilson put his hand over Lutrova's mouth as they rappeled down. It was perfectly dark out, so it shadowed there movements. The 9th floor, then the 6th floor, and finally the 3rd floor passed as they rappeled down. Only when they were near the 2nd floor that Wilson said, \"Hit it.\" Landon hit the trigger, and the tenth floor exploded brilliantly. Alarms started to go off, and the voices of yelling Russians were heard. By then, Wilson, Landon, and Lutrova were already getting in the car.\" Your both crazy, do you know that?\" said Lutrova. \"No, Mr Lutrova,\" said Landon, smiling, \"we're just ecentric.\" With that saying, Wilson turned on the car, and they headed toward a secret compound were agents would help them back into West Berlin. \"You know something Wilson? You're a damn fine soldier, I don't usually like working with rookies, but you know what you're doing.\" Landon lit a cigar and smiled. \"Genlemen, please,\" said Lutrova \"we must hurry; I fear that the army might already be following us.\" Wilson turned his head his head, and said to Lutrova \"Don't worry, we're trained proffesionals....\" \"Holy Shit,\" yelled Landon \", road block!!!\" Wilson turned forward, and saw a group of Russian's firing at them. Wilson had forgot about how to be incognito. The car hit the concrete roadblock headon, launching it in the air. It crashed to the ground, and Wilson was dazed. Landon shot out the cracked windshield of the car as he tried to squwirm out of the damaged vehicle, he grabbed Wilson and said, \"Wilson, hey Wilson you alright! Come on get up!\" Wilson replied, \"I'm good, just a few scratches.\" \"OK, take this and put some fire on those Ruski's.\" Landon gave Wilson his rifle back, and began to pry the car door from it's hinges, as soon as it was loose he said, \"Lotruva, you have to come with me, it's not safe here!\" \"I can tell that!\" he said in reply. Landon grabbed the car door, crouched, and slowly began to move from the car in the street to an alley, where at least they would have cover. Wilson quicklly followed. When they reached the alley, Landon dropped the cardoor. \"Wilson, come on, we need to lose these guys.\" said Landon. They all began to run through the alley, when the Russians arrived at the entrance. \"Shit,\" said Landon \", new plan!!!\" Landon grabbed onto Lutrova, and smashed through a window. Wilson followed him in, and saw a scared family at a lunch stable. \"Entschuldigung,\" said Wilson, before following Landon out through the door. They began to run through the first floor hallway, with the russians on their tails. \"Shit Landon,\" said Wilson \", how the fuck are we going to get out of this mess?\" \"We're going to run across the border, that's the plan,\" said Landon. Wilson was shocked \", are you insane?\" \"\"Keep running then!\" Landon yelled, \"Out that window!\" he then rammed his way through the window, with Wilson and Lotruva not far behind. He landed in a dumpster outside, \"Hey, what the hell, why is there a Russian tape recorder marked 'classified' lying in a dumpster? Oh well, more secrets for me.\" \"Oh shut up!\" Lotruva yelled. He then heard at least a dozen Russians coming at them not only from the hall, but from the street as well. They were surrounded, \"Hey what's that?\" Wilson said as he heard Russian swearing and tires screeching. Just then a fire truck ran a Russian car off the road, and the driver yelled at them to get in, it was their mole and his other resistance fighters. \"Thank you, Jesus!!!\" shouted Wilson, laying in the back seat. \"I'll take you all to the tunnel, so that you can get back into West Berlin. All you have to promise me is that you will send us an extra case of Cigarretes.\" \"Mister,\" sighed Landon \", I'll send you a thousand cases if you step on it.\" When Landon and Wilson had just gotten out of the tunnel, they were meet by a CIA agent. \"Hello, gentlemen,\" said the agent. Landon and Wilson both looked at each other, knowing where this was going. \"What's the assignment,\" said Landon, obviously disappointed.\" The agent smiled \", we halted this operation, since we need you guys there.\" The agent handed Wilson a yellow folder, and Wilson opened it and started reading it, along with Landon. \"We need you to 67th Reapers as they assualt a POW camp, since the NVA as been strangely destroying their own POW camps.\"Chapter 3: Jungle Fever  March 4th, 1965, 0900 hours. Jacinto AFB, Vietnam, South Vietnam George Wilson stared outside of the Huey, with Landon listening to music beside him. The place was more active than ever, since the restart of the war in 64'. Huey's were flying in formation beside the heli, while F-4 Phantoms were taking off and landing. \"Alright, last stop, Jacinto!!!\" yelled the pilot. He must be smoking acid, thought Wilson, 'cause he's joking around a little too much. When the helicopter landed, Wilson opened the door, and both Wilson and Landon got out of the chopper. \"So, any theories as to why the NVA wants to destroy it's own camps.?\" Wilson asked, \"Could be to hide war crimes, but they usually don't care about that kind of shit, it's nothing to them. What I fear is that they're doing it to hide collaboration with the Soviets and their...projects.\" Landon said as he walked. \"Probably, but let's no make assumptions yet....\" said Wilson. \"Well,\" said Landon \", why the hell did we need that Russian scientist then?\" Wilson thought about it, and said , \" I don't really know, but I have a feeling we're going to find out soon enough. Now, let's head to the CO's office, he'll give us a briefing there.\" They began to walk over to the CO's office, which lied next to a communications station. Wilson and Landon walked into the CO's tent, the were greeted by a middle aged colonel who appeared to be part of SOG. \"Ah, Agent Landon, Agent Wilson. Glad you're here, I suppose you want the recon photos?\" he said, \"Absolutely.\" Landon replied, and the colonel walked over to a projector, \"Well, from a U2 sweep we can spot 2 POW camps in our area, each have been either burnt down or blown up in the last week.\" Landon continued, \"And we have to look for evidence of...\" \"Anything.\" The colonel interrupted him, \"But due to AA guns throughout the jungle you'll have to do a stealth insertion, water based.\" \"So your saying that we're going in before anyone else is going?\" asked Wilson. \"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying,\" said the Colonel. Wilson crept along the jungle through knee deep water, his gun at the ready, but suddenly he entered a much larger swamp, and was engulfed by the water, his struggling quickly alerted a Viet Cong sentry on the cliff above him, \"M\u1ef9! Die b\u1ea1n m\u1ea3nh n\u01b0\u1edbc ngo\u00e0i c\u1ee7a!\" He shouted, firing at wilson from the cliff, Wilson thinking, \"Damnit, when is Landon gonna get here!\", just then a shot rang out, and the VC fell into the swamp below him. Landon had shot him in the head, with his pistol. \"Thanks for the quick save, Landon\" said Wilson, swimming his way to the shore. \"No problem,\" said Landon, pulling him out of the water \", now let's go take out those AA guns.\" They slowly began to move through the jungle, heading for their targets. Wilson grabbed onto trees as he moved, to prevent himself from falling. Each step was quiet like a mouse. \"So, we plant this C4,\" said Landon \", and detonate after we gather some info?\" \"Yes, and then the army battalions can handle the rest,\" said Wilson. Nick smiled. He looked eagerly at the comm, and put it in his pocket. He turned around in the port of the Chinook, and looked at Finch, his CO. \"Now I don't do field ops much,\", Finch said, \"But I never miss a skydive, and your my second in command. I'll see you and Howlett on the ground. Good luck, Alpha.\", Finch said, sitting down. Nick pulled on his chute. \"See you groundside, sir.\" Then he pulled his balaclava over his mouth, to avoid anything unpleasant being thrown up from 'Nam, and started running towards the open bay, screaming as he jumped. As he took the form he was trained to take, he silenced himself, focusing on landing in the lake. He felt the wind whistling around his face, and he heard it too, picturing a small figure in the air. Himself. He was about to hit the chute drop, but he had to wait as far as he could to avoid being spotted. He also had to not crush himself on impact. He waited until he was well under the horizon of a mountain in the distance, and popped his chute, being reeled back, quickly. Freefalling was fun. Chuting was fun. It was the transition that sucked. He pulled upwards, smashing into the lake. Underwater, he couldn't see crap, and from what he had tasted on impact, he was swimming in liquid dogshit. He looked down, and pulled off his chute, quickly swimming up to the surface. Here he was.... Alone. In enemy territory. But where the hell was Will? Landon and Wilson came to a point in the brush where they could get a clear view of the AA guns, \"Okay, it looks like two ZPU's with a couple of shoulder fired SAM's, and a good deal of ammo. 8 personnel, small arms, wait here. I'l be back.\" Landon stealthily made his way around the clearing, and behind a hut, from there he came to a spot just out of view of the guards, but still within earshot, he placed a clip's worth of bullets in a pile and pulled the pin on a phosphorus grenade with a specially designed 2 minute fuse. It would stick out like a sore thumb in the night. As he got back to Wilson he said, \"I have a distraction set up, get some charges on those guns and crates, I'll look around in the hut for anything valuable.\" Just then the phosphorus grenade went off, set off the bullets, and gave the illusion of an attack, the guards rushed out of the clearing and into the jungle to investigate. Wilson quickly ran over to the guns and crates, and began placing C4 on them. He snickered, he knew this would show those commie bastards. Landon creeped inside the straw-and-bamboo hut at the edge of the clearing, he switched on his flashlight to see in the dark room, it was clear, but far from empty. There were at least a dozen folders and notepads strewn about the room, all in Russian. He quickly gathered them and went back to Wilson. Wilson was hiding behind a rock, watching for any sudden movements. At any moment, Charlie could come right behind him, and slit his throat. Wilson felt an hand touch is shoulder, and he quickly grabbed it. He threw the man onto the ground, and put his knife near his throat. It was Landon. \"Jesus Landon,\" said Wilson \", you almost got skinned.\" \"You're telling me.\" Landon said, \"And you almost got your balls blown off.\" He saw Wilson look down at Landon's gun, pointed at his crotch. The two chuckled and stood up, waiting for the VC to return. Wilson said, \"Hey, get your head down, they're back. Ok, 3...2...1...\" The VC walked past, chatting with each other as they went along. Wilson felt a nudge from Landon, \"Wilson, we need to blow those AA's, or else the battalions can't come to rescue the POW's.\" Wilson smiled, and flicked open a detonator. He pressed the glowing red button, and a large explosion rocked the earth. \"This is Colonel Meade, we have heard the signal; so you better find some good cover, 'cause we're a coming!!\" Rockets and gunfire began to tear the jungle apart, the army was there in full force, \"Come on, let's get out of here.\" Landon yelled, he then took off with Wilson into the trees, after running for a brief period of time a soldier emerged from a spider hole in the ground, Landon quickly shot him, causing his body to fall back in to the dimly lit hole, \"Get inside that tunnel!\" Landon yelled as explosions continued to rock the area, he jumped in and was shocked by the contents of the bunker. \"What the fuck is this?,\" asked Wilson. Wilson and Landon were left staring at a mammoth steel door with Russian writing on it, which seperated the dirt tunnel from the inner bunker. Landon then looked down at the dead soldier, and saw that he was not Viet Cong or NVA, but a Spetsnaz sargeant. \"Shit, guess this explains those documents.\" \"Documents?\" Wilson asked, \"Shack was littered with them. I brought them with me.\" Landon replied. \"Do ya have any C4 left?\" \"Here,\" said Wilson, throwing Landon a bag \", I've got about three more in there. Do you think it's enough?\" \"This should do it.\" Landon said. He took the C4 and molded it around the 4 inch thick door hinges, making sure he could get the most bang for his buck. He climbed up out of the hole and pressed the detonator, sending dirt and dust up out of the tunnel, he then crawled back in to investigate. \"Jesus H. Christ.....\" said Wilson, walking in through the blown door. The room was medium sized, and \"small\"\n missiles layed againist the walls. In the middile of the room were tables, which had chemicals and even more papers. \"Landon, check this out,\" said Wilson. \"Should've known, CIA's usually all over this shit.\" but they weren't this time, this was something new, devious. \"What do we have here?\" Landon said, \"Maps...blueprints...of what!? EMP bomb, US Capitol, Power grid. Dear God. Wilson we are in some deep shit.\" He began grabbing things, stuffing them in his ammo pouches and backpack, \"Grab what you can carry, we have to sneak this stuff back to base.\" As he checked the area he found another doorway, which led to a very appaling sight. A few men sat, chained to the wall in a small, unlit room, all of them were SOG, \"Soldier are you alright?\" Wilson asked, two were unconsious, but one responded, \"We're alive, but listen, the other POW camps are distractions, the Russians want to...\" \"We know, son.\" Landon told him. Wilson stood there, shocked by the half dead corpses. Suddenly, he felt a arm tighten around his neck. A pistol was pushed into his head. \"I will ask that none of you move, or else your friend's brains will be splatter againist the wall.\" Landon sighed, he put up his hands and dropped his CAR-15, he turned to see a masked Russian with a KGB patch on his shoulder, he told Landon, \"I see you still have gun, put it on the ground too.\" Landon slowly reached for his pistol, but at the last second went for the lucky shot, and disarmed the Russian with a single bullet. Wilson then quickly turned and tackled him. \"It looks like the odds have turned againist you, Ruski,\" said Wilson \", now tell me, where in the hell would you get something like an EMP?\" The Russian spit into the Wilson's face, which angered him greatly. \"Wrong answer.\" Wilson preceded to punch the Russian hard in the face. Each it brought blood spewing out. \"Where. the. hell. did. you. get. this!!!!!!!!!\" yelled Wilson. \"Germans!!\" yelled the Russian. Wilson was puzzled, \"What about the Germans?\" The russian first spat out blood and a tooth, and then spoke \",when the fascists were working on their nuclear program in the 1940's, they discovered that the some tests acctually shut down their watches and equipment. When we arrived in 1945, they were already trying to weaponize it. We took their work, and them, back with us.\" \"So you were at this lab in person?\" asked Wilson. \"Da,\" said the Russian \", they hid like scared mice when we entered the complex.\" Wilson asked another question \", then what the fuck are you trying to do to us!?!?\" Just before the russian could speak another word, a bullet penetrated his head. Wilson looked up, and saw another KGB agent run away. \"God dammit!!\" yelled Wilson, hitting the ground. Landon was finished untieing the SOG operatives \", Wilson, we have to leave!!!\" Through his disappointment, Wilson said \"Not before rescuing those other POW's.\" \"I thought you said the army would handle them!\" Landon replied. \"Well, judging by this EMP weapon here,\" said Wilson, pointing behind him \", I'm guessing that there is a lot more secrets up the enemy's sleeve. Now, unless you have have the correct intel, I'll change my mind\" \"Whatever.\" Landon grabbed one of the unconcious prisoners along with the papers and film scattered about the bunker, he then began to exit the bunker with Wilson, and the other POWs, the attack had quieted down, and they could now be outside without fear of friendly fire. They began running to the helicopter lights back at the clearing. Wilson watched the burned ground as they flew by in the Huey. The Army had laid all they had againist the VC, and burned a chunk of the forest with it. \"I still don't know why the hell we're doing this,\" said Landon. Wilson turned toward him \", think of those soldiers down there, and what kind of shit they had to go through. I think it's pretty necessary that we.....\" \"HOLY SHIT!!!!\" yelled the pilot \", INCOMING!!!\" A missile struck the tail of the huey, sending it into a death spin. Wilson grabbed ahold to something, and clinged onto it. The huey crashed into the ground, sending Wilson into darkness.Chapter 4: Imprisonment  Gulag 14, Siberian Coast, CCCP March 6th, 1965 Wilson stood up on a stone, tied to a rope from the ceiling. Around him, a group of russian interrogators were talking. He was still bleeding from the last hits he took, since they had hit him with a metal bar. He could understand them, and heard them talking about what to do next. \"We did almost everything to him, the car battery, the water boarding; and he still will not talk,\" said one interrogator. \"Don't worry, I think I have an idea,\" said another. Wilson heard footsteps come toward him, and the interrogator came out of the dark. The interrogator came up toward him, and grabbed the hair in the back of Wilson's head. \"You will tell us everything we want to know, american,\" said the Russian, showing his teeth like an ape. \"Try it,\" said Wilson \", I have all day.\" The Russian screamed something, and preceded to pound in Wilson's face. It was painfull, sure, but Wilson had worse. Then he heard another voice speak \"Stop.\" The interrogator immediatly stopped, turned around, and saluted. \"Yes sir!!\" said the interrogater in russian. Wilson could see that the speaker was smoking, since the cigarette's light burned brightly. The speaker came out of the darkness, and Wilson could see a fairly large, black haired russian standing in front of him. \"Allow me to introduce myself, I am Victor Fedorov, General Victor Fedorov. I worked on what you were trying to destroy in Vietnam.\" Victor paced back in forth in front of Wilson while looking at him. \"So, I would like to know what you have learned about my project,\" said Victor. \"I ain't telling you shit, Ruski,\" growled Wilson, spitting at him. Vicor took the cigarrete out of his mouth, and then pushed the end into Wilson's face. Wilson screamed in pain as the butte went into his cheek. Then Victor dropped his cigarette. He said to one of the interrogators \", take him to the rest of the Prisoners, he will speak of nothing.\" Wilson was thrown into an indoor prisoner's area. Wilson got up from the dirt, and looked around at all the Russians. They glared at him, since he was the only american here. \"Wilson!,\" yelled Landon. Well, the second american here, thought Wilson. Landon, his clothes tattered and covered in dirt and blood, slowly approached Wilson. \"Holy shit am I glad to see you!\" he said, the other prisoners looking on with an indifferent scowl. \"What the fuck did they do to you?\" he asked Wilson. \"What any Russian would do,\" said Wilson, snickering \", torture me.\" Wilson looked around the huge room for anyplace that they could escape from. He then walked over to Landon, and said \", you got a plan for getting out of here, 'cause this room is tight.\" \"Well,\" Landon said, \"We're well inside the arctic circle, so walking isn't an option. But, hehehe, this place is a arms production plant! With some planning, I don't think breaking out would be too hard, but we need transport. And that's where I'm stumped.\" Just then, Wilson saw a Hind formation fly past the window. \"I think I might have an idea, Landon,\" said Wilson. 2112 hours, March 6th, 1965 Wilson sat in his cell, waiting for the guard to pass by him. He suddenly heard footsteps coming toward him, and hid againist the wall. The Russian guard came past his cell, and thought he saw no one in it. He got near the cell, and Wilson grabbed him. Wilson rammed his head into the bars, and the guard collapsed into the ground. Wilson quickly grabbed the keys, and opened the door. Step one, done. He quickly grabbed the guard's AK, and began to run for Landon. He hoped that Landon knew where their guns were. 2119 hours, March 6th, 1965 Anderson cocked his neck, and placed the sniper on his sights. Two days ago, he had arrived at a Huey crash site on his recon mission, and Anderson and Finch had decided to launch a mission to rescue the operatives captured, very important. Anderson fired the first shot from the mountain, his suppressed M21 making a small hole in the Russian on the wall. He removed his Ghillie hood, leaving the rest on, and slid down the mountain. \"I'm moving in.\", he told Finch. \"Copy.\" 2221 hours, March 6th, 1965 \"Come on Landon, we have to move now,\" said Wilson, unlocking Landon's cell. \"Alright, I'm ready,\" said Landon \", follow me, I know where their keeping our guns. Wilson and Landon began to run through the hallway, when bullets began to come through the window. \"Duck!\" Landon yelled as he and Wilson hurried through the long, dark hallway. \"I'll head to the comms tower, open the cells and make sure no reinforcements come! I need you to get the armory open, it's 1 floor down, at the end of the hall! Get me something nice!\" Wilson and Landon rushed off to the seperate objectives as the prisoners cheered them on. Anderson climbed up the rough building, almost slipping once or twice, when he discovered a long abandoned room with a large hole in the outer wall, the inner door barricaded from the hallway. Anderson knew his objective, and he had to make himself known, so he pulled out Semtex, and stuck it to the door, detonating them. Alarms were raised. Anderson quickly peeled off his Ghillie suit, keeping his Balaclava on, and putting on his cap. He brought out an MP5N, and shot a guard at the door. He walked out into the hallway, and shot a soldier. The man fell back, and collapsed on the concrete floor. Anderson smiled, when he heard a large whine behind him. His smile disappated, and he dropped unto the ground, as an RPG shot over his head, blowing a hole in the concrete wall. Anderson got up, and turned the corner, running for an elevator. He opened the Elevator door, revealing only a shaft. He had no choice. He jumped down, grabbing the steel cable, scraping his gloves apart, as he hit the ground. He was trained to run, and only fight in last situations. He breached down through the elevator, being used as an ammo storage. He saw prisoners running at him, tackling guards. \"Anyone American!?\", he asked, as many hands raised up. \"Let's go! We have to free the others!\" March 6th siberian coast James approched the Russian prison, 6 seperate pieces of C4 were already set at the prison another 6 needed to be set, this would be a distraction and a way to break them out. He placed a knife in his left hand between his middle and ring finger as he approched an opening. James yelled the words \"I need backup help\" in Russian, and two guards poped out of the opening. The first gaurd got his head smashed by a punch and before the second guard coulld shoot he was stabbed in the head the knife was removed and the first guard was put down. Other guards were coming to his position, and the C4 needed to be detonated. He heard massive gunfire coming from the prison. He detonated to cause the outer frame to crumble and a large interior prison could be seen. A wall of guards just glared at James. He turned to run but was shot in the back by the guards. He pulled out a pistol but it was shot out of his hand. For James it was over. \"Hey fuckers, eat this!!!\" yelled a random voice. At that instant, the guards were engulfed in flame. Some of them tried to save themselves, but it was hopeless. The all died a burning death. \"Are you okay?\" asked the voice to James. \"Who are you?\" asked James. Two men then came walking out of the ruins, and one said \"I'm George Wilson, and this is my friend Jack Landon.\" Landon shot into smoke as the hundreds of other prisoners made a break for it, overpowering the guards, he lowered his shotgun when he realized he had no more ammo. \"Lemme guess, mmm...SOG? Search and rescue op?\" Landon said as he approached the man to shake his hand. \"Jack Landon, CIA SAD. Are we taking the hinds or did you bring transport?\" the man appeared to be surprised behind his mask, \"You already had this planned out?\" \"Well, we did,\" said Wilson \", untill you guys came.\" Landon turned back to Wilson \", now is not the time, Will.\" Landon turned back to the man, and asked ,\" Two things. One: what's your name, and Two: do you have a transport vehicle?\" \"James Pearson, SAS/SOG; and we don't have a transport,\" said the man. \"Shit,\" grumbled Wilson. \"No time for that, we need to head for the Hind's or Mil's,\" said Landon. \"Do you have any friends with you?\" asked Landon to James . James replied \",some.\" Wilson, Landon, and James were running toward the helicopter pads. The air could give Wilson hypothermia, but he was pretty warmed up now. \"We need to find a Hind; or the worst case scenario, at least an Mi-8,\" said Landon. Wilson checked his surroundings, it was basicly hangers and such. The surrounding areas had turned into a warzone, since the prisoners were getting their revenge. \"Wilson, two trucks, coming down the runway!!\" yelled Landon. Wilson looked, and indeed saw two trucks on the runway. The trucks stopped, and soldiers began to pour out of them. \"Take cover!!!\" yelled Wilson, running behind a UAZ-469 car. Landon slide behind also, and tapped Wilson's shoulder. \"Why don't we take this baby?\" said Landon, hitting the UAZ. Wilson tried to conflict with his statement, but said \"Not bad of an idea.\" Wilson shoot at the russians while Landon jumped into the driving seat. James got into the back, and managed to shoot three russians. Then Wilson rolled over the hood, and got into the shotgun seat. He aimed his CAR-15, and managed to knock two more Russians off before Landon hit the gas. Two russians had to jump from being hit by the car, but Wilson and James both shot them. \"Wilson,\" said James \", who's going to fly the bird when we get there?\" Wilson turned around and said, \"I've had some experience flying enemy heli's, so I think I can get us out of here.\" It was only four minutes before they reached a Hind. A Russian flight crew was running tests on it, and when they caught sight of the group, they began to run for their guns. Wilson and James shot the Flight crew before they could even reach their weapons. \"Alright,\" said Wilson, getting out of the UAZ \", I'll head to the pilot seat. Landon; I need you in the co-pilot section. James; get into the troop hold.\" \"Got it, I'll handle the guns.\" Landon said, \"Fully stocked, cannons, missiles, and oh, laser guided ones at that.\" Landon excitedly said as he armed the chopper's weaponry.\"We should start heading for the Aleutians, they're the closest US territory.\" ____________________________________________________________________________________________ The team were in the Hind heading out of siberia when loud bangs were heard coming from the troop hold,\"holy crap were hit were hit\". The hind began smoking and they were forced to head into Russia. RPG rockets were fired every where and the Hind was forced to make a crash landing. The group was being forced into a millitary base just so they wouldnt get shot down. That was it James couldnt hold on anymore he was sent flying to ground sent crashing to his doom. Wilson and Landon managed to get out of the base and managed to get the ocean finaly making it out. Will jumped out of the Huey and signalled for his team to go towards a broken down building. Will aimed down his sights to find two NVA having a smoke. He gestured for his team to fire, and suddenly, after the pounding of their automatic weapons, the two soldiers where on the ground. Will jumped off the building and landed in a shallow pond. As his team followed, Will searched for any hidden entrances to the POW camp. He spotted an entrance that resembled a cellar's. He opened the door and threw a flashbang in. Two of his teammates rushed in and shot the NVA inside. Will opened a Comm channel and contacted Anderson. \"Reaper -2, this is Trojan 1-2. Status over?____________________________________________________________________________________________ Landon and Wilson had been forced to crash land the stolen hind in a remote Russian outpost in Siberia, and fight their way out, they had lost James, and now were cut off from any potential US rescuers. \"Wilson? You still with me?\" Landon asked after almost an hour of wallking through the still frozen tundra. \"I'm still here, Landon, but I don't know, I just don't know what to do.\" He said in a tired voice. They were at the coast now, where Siberia ended and the north pole began. The two collapsed on the ice, and Landon was just as hopelessly stumped as Wilson. He looked down at his feet to see a splotch of red in the snow, for a minute he thought he was bleeding, but then he took a closer look and noticed he was looking at a nazi flag embedded in the snow, little did he know on the other side of the snow mound he would encounter a place that was even more of a psychological hell on earth than the gulag. They got up looked over the mound and saw in horror something they should have never seen. It was a concentration camp filled with prisoners of war. Two nazis grabbed the them and pulled them to the camp; where they were knocked out. When they came too, they were strapped too a wall and a nazi commander was infront of them. \"You two, what do you know about operation nova?\" Wilson replied,\"what is operation novis or nova or what ever you call it something to do with nova 6 right\". The commander showed him a report and then pulled out a shotgun. \"Your time here is over ,you know too much,now you must die\". He aimed the the gun at landon and was about to pull the trigger when he dropped to his knees. His head suddenly exploded he hand been tagged with an explosive pistol round. The prisoners were escaping they took off the straps on landon and wilson and showed them the way out. But after all there efforts it was too late they were re captured by the Russians and forced into a small area. Landon and Wilson were told to come up. \"You two will be sold to the black market as mercs if you oppose you die\". The russian picked up a phone as someone called him in response to the mercs for sale. \"Hello I'd like to buy you mercs ,but first, I'd like to know there names\" \"Wilson and Landon thats what it said on there dog tags\" \"Perfect I'll take them meet me at the boundry between siberia and the north pole\". A man came up too the russian at the location stated he was dressed in a black trenchcoat he had a combat helmet on his head and had a gas mask covering his entire face. The russian got up and walked to the man. The man opened his trenchcoat and the russian leaned closer. The man punched the russian in the head a pulled out a saiga 20k. The russian was sprayed with shells and eventually killed. Wilson Landon come on were getting out of here. Landon looked at the man and asked him something. \"Wait who are you anyway\" The man responded \"isnt it obvious\" as a huey lander for pickup. Wilson saw the symbol on the Huey was american, and grabbed the man. \"What the fuck was in that camp....\" Camp Yukon Rehab Facility, Alaska March 20, 1965 Wilson and Landon sat in front of the Camp's doctor, who was looking at a folder. \"You were both pumped with an excessive amounts of drugs. The Russian's had captured you wandering in the snow, and took them to their nearest camp. We managed to rescue you, and when we found you guys; you tried to attack us.\" \"But it was so real, it couldn't have been fake,\" said Landon. \"You'll be suprised of what you think is real when your on something,\" said the doctor. \"Then who was the man in the Black Trenchcoat then?\" asked Wilson. The doctor looked over to Wilson, and said \", sir, we found you both strapped to chairs, screaming your brains out. You could have seen a jesus on a unicorn for all you know.\" \"It wasn't Jesus on a fuckin' unicorn! Shit. The Germans, they're the ones who produced the tech the Soviets are using. Hell! They're still a part of it! The camp in Siberia, It was a broadcast station too!\" Landon yelled \"No, you don't understand, you were dreaming, the result of hallucenogenic drugs they gave you in Chukotka, they wanted to know what you had learned about their classified programs.\" The doctor told him. \"Programs that are...\" Landon began to say as two other CIA agents entered. \"I think our patients are finished here, right doctor?\" said one of the agents, holding Wilson's chair. \"Yes, they are ready,\" said the doctor. \"Come with us,\" said an agent \", we'll tell you what you need to know.\" Bullets entered the room as the man in the trenchcoat returned but this time he said something \"Wilson, Landon, the CIA is trying to mess with your head \". Wilson punched the man and pulled the gun on him but the man said something \"wait you know who I am\" he showed him his medal inside of his trenchcoat it \"james pearson\". \"What the hell James,you're are alive but you fell from the huey?\" said Wilson. James looked at Wilson \",when I was falling I pulled out by grappling hook and threw it at a tree. I ended up impaling myself with a ballistic knife but im still alive\". James lead the two out as CIA entered the building. \" I don't understand, so were there Nazi's then?\" asked Landon. \"Of course not,\" said James \", don't be silly.\" Wilson grabbed James by the neck, and said to him \", what the hell is going on here? \" James pushed the Wilson off of him, and said \", I don't really know either Wilson.\" Wilson then said \", you know, I think it's kind of suspicous that your an SAS agent, and you just shot some of our agents....\" Landon grabbed Wilson's shoulder, and said \"Wilson, stop.\" Wilson looked back at him, and then said to James \", where are you taking us?\" James smiled \"back with me of course, I'll explain along the way.\"Chapter 5: London Rumble  10,000 feet above the Atlantic March 23, 1965 Wilson sat in the chair, drinking a glass of scotch. Landon sat beside him, drinking a can of beer. All the while, Wilson sat watching James the whole time, who now had a buisness suit on. Wilson put his glass down, and asked James \"When are we going to, James?\" \"London, of course,\" said James, taking a sip of water. \"Why the fuck are we going to London!!!\" yelled Wilson, spilling his scotch. Landon grabbed Wilson, and managed to calm him down. \"You have some information we might be able to use, Wilson,\" said James, \"Who the hell is we,\" said Wilson, standing up again. \"My superiors want to speak with you both about what you learnt in Vietnam and in Russia.\" said James. \"Forget it James. I'm going to ask the pilot to turn this hunk of metal around,\" said Wilson, heading for the cockpit. James pulled a Walter PPK from inside of his suit, and two SAS agents stepped in front of Wilson. \"I suggest you sit down, and shut the fuck up,\" said James, pointing his gun toward the seat. Wilson glared at James, and then went back to his seat. \"We dont want to get cocky wilson theres been way to much turbalance this trip\". The plane rocked again one man came from the cockpit he was armed with a pistol,\"everyone sit down and shut up\" The two SAS slowly pulled guns out of ther pocket James got up and walked to the bathroom. Wilson glared at the hijacker and so did the hijacker. Wilson saw that james's gas mask he was wearing during the flight on the ground. More men came down everyone began getting restless. Glasses dropped people screamed as the two SAS agents were killed. It was the moment now James's kicked the bathroom door down. He was wearing a gihlie suit,gas mask,kevlar under the suit and he was holding a VSS Vintorez. The room was covered in blood the plane was dropping slowly most windows were shattered. Landon wasn't sure of what to do, he looked around, seeing nothing but blood, bodies, and glass everywhere. To his right he could see the planes engine, flaming, it exploded and caused a hole to appear towards the end of the plane, he grabbed a parachute and began to stumble out of the plane, bringing Wilson with him. \"Are you fucking crazieeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!\" screamed Wilson, before Landon jumped out of the plane. Landon and Wilson ended up landing in a small town just outside of London. \"Wilson, Wilson. You there? Dammit wake up!\" Landon stood over Wilson and screamed. Wilson quickly stood up, and said \"What just happened? We bailed out of that plane but, Was that real?\" \"I'm asking the same questions man. Now, I don't know what the hell kind of a acid-trip dream world we may or may not be in. But I'm not about to let myself get killed, fantasy or not. Suit up, I brought some gear down with us.\" The two crept through the dark and desolate village wearing simple civilian clothes, baseball caps, scarves, jackets and jeans, all black. Wilson pointed to a standard 4 door SUV and told Landon, \"Hey, we need transport, maybe we can hotwire that car, eh.\" Landon nodded, \"Watch my back, I'll get it...Yeah, 40 year old Texan guy in black hotwiring a car in the middle of the night, that's inconspicuous.\" The sky was lit up with flames James was trying to land the plane in a final attempt james just stuck C4 to the cockpit and destroyed the plane causing it to destroy a large portion of london. As Wilson and Landon drove towards the city lights of London, they saw an explosion in the sky, the plane had exploded in two, and it crashed into a building complex inside of London, \"Guess that's where we're headed.\" Landon said. Wilson flicked on the radio, to see what exactly was going on in London. \"....army forces have been deployed into the city of london to halt a recent attack on london. A group of heavily armed men have taken the downtown area, including her majesty's residence.....\" Wilson flicked off the radio, and said to Landon \"This shit's real Landon, and this means were going to have to fight terrorists, possible russians, and British forces to stop one of England from becoming a Communist country. If that happens, the U.S. is going to be in deep shit with world affairs.....\" Landon finished loading his Smith and Wesson, and put it down his pants. \"It looks like we're going to have alot to do today,\" said Landon, pushing on the gas. Landon and Wilson were still on the road, heading for the now burning London center. The roads were clogged up with abandoned cars, with people running the opposite direction. Landon thought about the past information they had learned about in Vietnam and in Berlin. There had to be some connection with what was happening here....... Landon hit the brakes, and Wilson lunged forward in his seat. \"Jesus, Landon, what the hell is wrong with you?\" said Wilson. \"We have to get out of the car now....\" said Landon. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" asked Wilson. \"EMP!!! The Russians are going to use a fucking EMP!!!\" yelled Landon, jumping out of the car door. Wilson managed to get his seatbelt off, and also took cover on the road. A explosion was heard, and a blue-ish light began to travel along the air. Helicopters and Jets began to crash, and the advancing British Army was stopped in their tracks after their vechiles stopped working. It took less than a minute for London to be completly knocked out, and Wilson began to survey the damage. The lights that had been on in some buildings were now completly knocked out, and cars that had been moving out of the city were dead. \"This is bad, really, really bad\" said Wilson, moving his hand through his hair. James was running from the lawh. After he hotwired a truck he drove off with it he had just destroyed the parliment and he needed to escape. The police opened fire at building while james swerved past crashed cars and eventually crashing into a large building causing it to fall killing groups of officers. Helicopters were flying through the air SAS and SBS soldiers were moving through as the attack was being confirmed as a Russian/cuban assualt instigated by a man know as General Victor Fedorov. Landon and Wilson were hearing mixed Russian, Spanish, and English screaming as they ran through the streets, they immediately got off the street and into an allley as mortars began to fall. They slowly crawled around the corner only to see two Russian soldiers, both Captains, firing at civilians, \"We need those uniforms.\" Wilson said. \"OKay, but we need 'em clean, if they're covered in bullets and blood we won't get very far.\" They moved in closer, \"Grab that crowbar.\" Landon said. He broke one's neck with a tire iron and Wilson killed the other with a crowbar. After changing hastily into the uniforms Wilson said, \"We should get moving to Buckingham Palace, if we can't deny the commies a military victory we can at least stop them from getting a symbolic one too.\" \"Okay, just one problem.\" Landon said, \"What if someone presses the button?\" \"What kind of button?\" asked Wilson. \"You know, the nukes?,\" said Landon \", if the Russian's capture this area of the city, world war 3 is going to happen, and the russians have a couple more nukes.\" Wilson reloaded his CAR-15, and said \"Then we've got about twenty minutes before all hell breaks loose, and the only way we can stop it if we capture that palace.\" Landon reloaded his weapons, and they both began to run toward the palace. On their way, they run into an old friend. \"Mac?\" Wilson asked in suprise. \"Yes, heard World War 3 might be starting and would like to join in.\" Mac say's. \"Lets get going.\" \"How the hell did you get here Mac?\" asked Wilson \"I was called here to \"investigate\" the problems in London. They dropped me off and told 'me to get going. And I ended up here.\" Mac answered. \" I need an airstrike here here and here and one at the buckingham palace the queen has been evecuated so its up for destruction make sure you hit it with a daisy cutter or a MOAB\". James was shotting orders into his radio ordering the destruction of major buildings. He had done a good job at fighting off the invasion as he was sitting on top of a pile of russian soldiers. Then james heard it screaming and the sounds of bones breaking gas filled the air and he heard a familiar motto. \"Damn it cant be but we nuked them but four enemy factions this might be a hard war to win\". Two other factions had just arrived two trackers were sent to clean house and the brotherhood just wanted to up hold the moment. Gas began to fill the air as nova gas airstrikes bombed the area. James heard a large crackling as the daisy cutter had destroyed bucking ham palace. James was ready to leave london but right as he turned and began to ran he was pulled to the ground. \"James longtime no see\" James was pulled down by a tracker but he was too cocky James was holding a revolver in his right hand with explosive armor piercing rounds. A click was heard and the trackers head exploded. More airstrikes littered the air and James was getting ready for pickup. \"Am I glad you're here. CIA's been running counter ops all over the city, but one thing they've failed to do is strike a blow.\" Landon said, \"And that means we...\" Mac shot in reply, \"Kill Castro, kill Federov, kill the officers, and anyone else we can get our hands on.\" \"I'm more considered with stopping the world from being blasted back to the stone age,\" said Wilson \", and I definatly know that Castro is not in this. Federov and whoever lent him these cuban's must be trying to start a war, and this is mearly a power game; and they don't care if they bring the world to shit.\" Mac was impressed. \"Your correct on that, Wilson, exactly correct. You didn't even need to look at my intel to figure that out....\"Chapter 6: Taking Advantage  Joe Stackhouse was sitting on a Huey on his way to Khe Sanh airfield. The base had just suffered an attack fron the Vietcong and it was a mess right now, but he wasn't staying for much, so he didn't really cared about that. The chopper touched down and he practically leaped out of his seat, and he began walking the 60 yards from the LZ to the Command tent. There was pretty much activity, everyone knew the tent wasn't going to hold too much if the attacks continued this much. He stepped into the tent and quickly caught the activity. He headed for a man with a black beret and he saluted. -Captain Joe Stackhouse reporting for duty as requested, sir-. The man turned and faced him: -I`m glad you made it here Captain, I've got a mission for you and your team... Joe was prone in the jungle, his finger on the trigger. The darkness of the night was heavy and he could barely see what was in front of him. -Fox leader to Fox team, status, over- he muttered in the radio, and the response came instantly: -Two hostile tangos on the roof, enemy personel on the road, and a BTR vehicle near the gates-. James was sitting in a dark room before multiple people. \"James glad you could come as you can tell we have a mission for you\". The man at the back of the table slid a folder across the table. \"Whats this general Victor Fedorov\". The man gave him a stern glare,\"James I need you to kill him\". James looked back at him ,\"Yes commander\". James head out a tunnel and entered a helicopter. After a trip he was at the generals base. After two tear gas canisters and a nova gas round James got in the base. He found the general who was prepared for an attack. The two entered a close quaters battle. James removed his gas mask showing his face. The generals eyes grew wide\"they sent a \" before he could finish his sentence he was skewered by a tracker knife. \"I copy Trojan 1-2, we are moving out. Over\" replied Nick. \"I'm moving with Chris. See you there.\" Howlett reported. Howlett signaled for his two men to flank the POW camp from the right. Howlett kicked down a door and Chris rushed through watching for hostiles. Howlett saw two NVA loading a mortar shell. He fired at the two then ran to a jail facility. Chris planted Semtex on it then triggered the explosive. The two rushed in and fired at the interrogators. Chris untied the two soldiers. \"Holy shit. You guys OK? Were gonna get you out of here.\" Chris gasped. The soldiers where in horrible condition. \"Any more soldiers?\" He cotinued. \"No,\" The soldier answered, \"The las of Able Team was killed yesterday and our squad was killed in the first week.\" He finished.\" Howlett opened a cell door and there was a rotting body. He studdered back with nausea and shut the door. He gestured to get moving and Chris followed. They carried the POWs over their shoulders. James started to walk out of the general's office, another job completed. He walked happily to the door, and when he opened it, his mood changed. There, in front of him, was pratically the whole base's force. A russian managed to shoot James in the leg, and he grunted in pain as he collapsed to the floor. Five russians then came toward James, and began to take off his clothes. \"Look how many guns this man has!!!\" exclaimed a russian, throwing a pistol on a small pile. James was now completly naked and standing in the freezing temperatures of Russia. Fuck, it's cold, thought James. James noticed a UAZ start to drive toward him. The UAZ stopped a few feet away from James. The back door opened, and James saw a pair of boots. When the man came from behind the door, James was shocked. \"Hello my friend,\" said Fedorov, alive and well. \"How are you....\" \"Do you really think that you had very good friends. It was pretty easy to pay off those murders to sell you on my double. They lied to you, and the immediatly got a position in my new world order; as soon as it forms.\" Fedorov walked over to a russian, took his AK, and hit James with the butte of the rifle. \"Not so good without your weapons!!!!\" yelled Fedorov, kicking James in the ribs. It took Fedorov about three minutes before he was finally cooled down, and he regained his composure. \"Take my 'friend' to the baths',\" said Fedorov, looking over at James \", I think you will have a chillingly good time there.\" Then two Russian soldier tightly picked up James, and began to drag him toward a small group of ponds near the base, where POW's were already being dunked and drowned in the freezing cold water. \"I want all my things sent to my control center at Eden, I don't want anyone knowing where I am.\" said Fedorov to an officer, walking toward a parked Mil-8 \"Come on Landon, aim for christ's sake!!!\" yelled Wilson, while he was being shot at from Buckingham Palace's windows. \"Shut up Wilson.\" yelled Landon back, quickly firing at the windows. They had only gotten to the gate of the palace, and most of the Russian/Cuban soldiers had managed to whole themselves up in the palace, while there were other pockets in different parts of the city. \"I'm blowing this fucker down,\" yelled Wilson, putting a piece of C4 on the gate. He quickly ran toward the car where Landon and Mac were, and jumped behind cover, sliding over the hood. He pressed the detenator, and the gate exploded. Two russians screamed in pain there was a second James,\"you fell for my trap\" an explosion almost killed the general. James was mowing down soldiers with his MG explacement in a bush. A Surkov flew into the air firing missles at the russians. The general stared at James, and calmly walked calmly to the truck . A second surkov picked up James and the flew to a nearby mountain,\"That was the most fun I ever had they stripped a dead body with C4 in it.\" James was back at the POW camp. \"James you saved us thanks\" James looked over. \"You didnt see my face did you\". The soldiers all looked at james \"of course we did when you got shot in the head you gas mask fell off\" James pulled out a revolver and shot all of them twice in the head,\"my identity must be upholded\". \"I'll retrieve any classified documents from the building, believe me there is shit here you do not want to know about!\" Landon yelled as he charged up the stairs of the entrance to the palace, \"Meet me at the roof when we're done here!\" \"Ok,\" said Wilson, pulling out his MP5K. He quickly aimed for two russians that were on the second floor. He shot at them, and the both fell off, and hit the first floor hard. Some russians came running out from a door, screaming out orders and positions. Wilson quickly slide to cover behind the stairs, and began to shoot at the Russians. A couple fell, but they found Wilson's position. They fired at him with their AK's, which tore through the beautiful marble. \"Flank them Wilson, I keep them preoccupied!!!\" yelled Mac, shooting at the russians. Wilson quickly SWAT turned around the edge of the stairs, and began to run up the stairs. He hit the wall of a column, and began to silently sneak up on the Russians. When he got close to them, he picked a gernade, pulled the pin, and threw it at the Russians. There was a large explosion, and the Russians screamed in pain. Will Howlett moved to a jeep with the two POWs and jumped in the shotgun seat. Chris got in the driver seat and looked at Will. \"Gun it\" Will said. He then picked a radio to contact 40th Pheonixes. He fiddled with the handheld for a bit until they were clear from the base. He opened the channel. \"Raptor you are clear to engage. Repeat: Clear to engage. Over.\" Will said. Howlett waited for the response. \"Copy,\" The Artilery operator replied, \"We'll fire on the base. Raptor Out.\" Wilson ran over to a wooden door, and kicked it down with his foot. A small group of Cuban's and Russian's tried to grab their weapons, but he sprayed them with is silenced MP5K. He started to move silently through each room, with the only light coming from the fires outside. Wilson almost got into the third room when a Russian soldier came from behind the wall. Wilson tried to shoot him, but the Russian pushed him to the floor. The Russian lunged at him with his knife, but Wilson caught his arm. There was a brief struggle as Wilson tried to avoid having a knife in his eye. He eventually overpowered the russian, broke his wrist, and stabbed the Russian with his own knife. The Russian collapsed next to Wilson, and he grabbed his MP5K. He went through the door, and preceded to the other areas of the palace. Carter Sorrens silently stood in his rented apartment watching the evening traffic and smoking a cigar. It was shabby, but he would sell it before long. Slung on his back was a SPAS 12 in his time in the Secret Service. After an incident failing to protect Kennedy, another agent framed him temporarily for the kill. Until Oswald was found to be the guilty, he was still framed for plotting. So he simply resigned and became a mercenary, working for whomever paid him the most. Usually nobody got in his way and if they did, they would easily be eliminated by Carter's quick hand to hand combat. Plus he could draw a pistol faster than normal, people said that he was dangerous which was true. If they paid him, he would track them to the far corners of the earth to hunt them down. If his target offered a better reward, he had no problem turning on his original client. So as a result, his original client paid him the price he charged...not cheap. His phone rang and he picked it up. The words spoken in the speakers sounded vaguely familiar. \"I have need of your service.\" Since Carter was not part of any US armed services, he was free to go up against anyone. \"I'm listening. Identify yourself first.\" \"Fidel Castro speaking. I need profiles of particular soldiers in the field. I'm willing to pay whatever you charge.\" Landon ran through the hallways of the palace, now back in his normal black clothes, attempting to find the room he was seeking, \"Storage, no. Bathroom, no. Security! Ha!\" He kicked open the door and grabbed a Cuban hostage, causing the second to stab his comrade in the chest. He then threw the pair to the ground and shot them both. Using the extensive knowledge of classified data he possesed, he was able to hack the security system, gaining access to the classified files of MI-6 through a primitive remote system, he then eliminated every last bit of information and physically disabled all system access by finally destroying the cables behind the drywall and flooding the mainframe with fire-sprinklers. He left the security room and was greeted by machine gun fire from a BMP outside the building, the bullets had shot 2nd floor windows apart, and Landon took a chance; he jumped out the window and landed on the BMP , he proceded to shoot the gunner with his pistol and, seeing as the vehicle was otherwise unoccupied, hopped in the driver's seat and backed the BMP into the walls of the palace killing the remaining Russians that were accompanying the BMP. He was greeted by Wilson, shocked at the hole in the wall. \"Glad to have some air, huh Wilson, you look as white as snow.\" said Landon, laughing his ass off. \"Shut up, Landon,\" said Wilson, with a smirk on his face. \"So, did you get anything?\" asked Wilson. \"Just some classified MI-6 data,\" said Landon, trying to show off \", what did you do?\" \"Oh nothing,\" said Wilson \", I just saved the Queen of England, nothing much.\" Landon's jaw dropped, and Wilson smiled as he hit the gas on the BMP. \"This is George Wilson, we have secured London, I repeat, we have secured london.\"Chapter 7: The Hunt  On a plane toward the U.S. President Johnson sat in front of Wilson and Landon, smiling. \"Great job, men. The Russians and the Cubans have kept in the dark about the loss of England, and they've turned on their great hero Fedorov. Now is the time to strike. The Prime Minister's already made an excuse about some Irish Men attacking the city, and that the power knock out was caused by an Electrical Storm.\" \"It's honor to be with you, Mr. President, and thank you.\" said Landon, shaking the President's hand. \"Now,\" interupted Robert McNamara \", let's get down to buisness.\" The Slums of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo) , 1000 hours April 1st, 1965 Landon and Wilson were in a Chevrolet C-10, watching people going in and out of a medium sized bar. Wilson had shades on, and was looking outside of the driver's seat, trying to find the target. \"See anything yet,\" asked Landon. While still looking outside, Wilson shook his head. Nothing but armed rebels going into that bar, nothing much. Wilson clicked on his radio, and said \"Be advised, there are alot of armed and unarmed people here, so you guys better leave the infiltration to us.\" \"Ok, we'll lay low for a while.\" responded the Green Beret leader. Wilson flicked the radio off, and layed his head back in the chair. It was going to take hours for the Russian to get here, so he thought it would be best to rest a little. Then Mac showed up. \"Mac? Where did you come from?\" said Wilson, suprised. \"The SAS rescued me as soon as you guys busted through the wall with that BMP.\" Mac replied. \"What are you two waiting for?\" \"A Russian.\" Landon told Mac. It was getting late in the afternoon, and Wilson, Landon, and Mac began to lose their patience with the Russian's arrival, Landon looked out the window, watching for any sort of activity, \"You two, wait here, I need to talk to this guy.\" \"What? Look man, we can't just go and...\" Wilson replied, \"I know what I'm doing, see that guy, in the green shirt?\" Landon asked, \"Yeah\" \"Well he's a, shall we say, troublemaker around here. SAD keeps tabs on these kinds of people.\" He told Wilson. By \"troublemaker\" Landon meant \"communist sympathizer\", not exactly the kind of person the CIA wanted in such an unstable country. \"Well, well, well.\" Landon got out of the truck, \"If it isn't our old friend Jean.\" Landon walked to the alley near side of the bar, \"Jack! How are you? I haven't seen you since...\" Landon cut him short, \"Listen Jean, you know the deal, we let you get away with the occaisional robbery, maybe some extortion, in exchange for no political bullshit.\" Landon forced him up against the wall with his elbow, \"Now, where is the Russian?\" Jean began to sweat as the Green Beret captain came on the radio, \"You two might want to come to the airport, we got some activity.\" Jacinto AFB, South Vietnam It was five days since Will returned from Rhen Tah POW camp. 12 men from the 28th, 40 from the 74th. Only 2 men survived. He couldn't believe it. Will sat on his bed cleaning his CAR-15. Will was already getting ready for his next mission. Lt. Chris Saturn was moved to the 15th Vultures, he was also promoted. Everyone else was moved to the 74th Silverbacks. The 28th Tigers, once in the top three most powerful divisions of the MAC,V-ARC, now dissolved. Rumor had it that this next mission was based on info that a Vietnamese kid reported to a squad of American soldiers. They said his name was Son Pham. We are desperate if were taking info from a kid. Will thought. He stood up and holstered his M1911A1 then put his CAR-15 on his back. Will then proceeded to the B-52 that he would be jumping out of. Howlett stepped onboard, surprised to find his CO, Col. Trevor Smith, on it. Will sat down next to him. \"Our mission is at an NVA outpost. They supposedly have multiple tanks, jeeps, you get the idea. This B-52 will bomb the hell out of the jungle as a diversion, followed by you and your men jumping right onto the oupost. Good luck Howlett.\" Smith calmly ordered. He got and walked out of the B-52 as the doors closed and gave a salute. Will gave a salute back then locked his gun. Over Vietnam \"Look out below, droppin' hell!\" Enthusiastically yelled the pilot. The B-52 shook like crazy. Will poked his head up to look out the window. He witnessed the flurry of fire and napalm hit the lush jungle canopy. In a matter of seconds the area had turned black with orange spot of fire all over. Suddenly a giant explosion ripped through the back of the aircraft. Will struggled to hold on to the bench he was sitting on as he was being pulled out of the B-52. Will couldn't hold on, his grip slipped and he let go. He was sucked out of the flaming plane and wa sent tumbling towards the grounds. He looked back up as the plane lost altitude, however more men jumped out and activated their parachutes. Will followed their actions and the chute flared up. Howlett began to look at the outpost. The exterrior was lined with AA guns, AT emplacments and MG positions. Will turned his parachute into the outpost so he would not have to face the MGs. The AA guns still fired and flak was flying everywhere. Red hot pieces of metal, no bigger than an apple, ripped by him. Although Will was never hit, one of his men's chute was shot and a giant hole was created in the middle of it. He began flying uncontrollably to the ground. Will and his men touched down inside the outpost. He unhooked his parachute apparatus and pulled out his CAR-15. He aimed at four NVA troopers who were loking right at him. Will fired and a barrage of bullets neutralized the targets. Will saw an entrance to the exterrior. He ran to it and planted SemTex on all the emplacments(which came to a total of six). Will cleared the area and triggered the SemTex. The outer walls lit up with yellowish-orange fire and cracked with an amazing BOOM!. Will was knocked off his feet and landed on his side. His team came over to him as he scrambled to stand up. \"Neptune, its set. sould we go?\" They said. Will told them to trigger the explosive. They all jumped in a jeep and were followed by Roman as well as Spartan teams. The explosion had a shuddering effect, and as Will looked back he found it almost blinding. \"I hope you haven't fired on anyone, Captain,\" said Wilson, looking at the people walk by . \"Negative, we're as far as we can be from the target. He's coming outside of the building, and he's just gone into a limo\" \"I'm sick of cleaning up your messes. There will be no more Russians.\" Landon scowled at Jean. He then got back in the truck with Wilson. \"We should get going, do we engage upon contact? The plan didn't call for this.\" \"We follow them, see what their doing here,\" said Wilson \", so what did you do, Jean?\" \"Uhh, Why are you here?!\" Landon complained, \"If you think I'm sitting in that slum bar all night you're wrong. Mister...\" Jean said, \"Wilson\" Wilson answered, \"Mr. Wilson, to answer your question, I'm a...\" \"He's a communist sympathizer and general criminal, we let him commit small-time shit in exchange for NOT INVITING THE RUSSIANS IN.\" Landon said in an irritated voice, \"Then why not just shut him up?\" Wilson asked, \"Because we like fuckin' with him.\" Landon said as he gave Jean a shotgun, and they sped off to the airport. The group was almost to the airport when they saw the Russian's limo exit on to the road, the kept a safe distance as they followed him, hopefully unnoticed. As they continued down the road the limo stopped at a local police checkpoint, \"Get down, stay quiet.\" Landon said as they waited for the limo to move on, He watched one of the police officers say something to the driver, and through the dim light of the setting sun and a few street lamps, Jean saw the driver pull a gun and open fire at the police, he cocked his gun in response, as the limo sped away, one of the surviving officers pulled an RPG, and shot at the limo, flipping it over, but not destroying it. The cop then died of his wounds. As the group exited their truck and investigated the wreckage, Wilson and Mac both pointed out that there were no survivors, but Landon found a paper, \"\u0412\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0413\u0411, \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, 2 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f 1965\" \"What's this say, Wilson?\" asked Landon, handing the paper to Wilson. Wilson read it, and handed it back to Landon. \"It means that you better have a tux.\" April 2nd, Moscow 8 P.M. Landon, Wilson, and Mac, along with several other CIA and intelligence personnel slowly drove through the streets of Moscow in an unmarked van. Only the first three were disguised as the KGB agents they killed in the Congo a few days earlier (fortunately for the trio, they each bore a slight resemblance to the Russians) The CIA was sending numerous other agents to collect information from Russia's secret bases, and the plan for Landon, Wilson and Mac, in their full KGB disguises, was to find out what Moscow knew of the Russian plan to attack the US, by infiltrating the heart of darkness. They stepped out on to the streets after a thumbs-up from a radio operator sitting in the van. \"Jesus H. Christ Wilson, I do not like this,\" said Landon, eyeing any Russian that walked by. \"Don't worry,\" said Wilson \", just let me do the talking, and we'll be fine. I know ten different languages after all.\" \"Touch\u00e9, I can pass for Russian but not with a southern accent. After a while I'll slip out the back door and do some snooping aound town, Mac? How about you?\" Landon said as he walked through the front door and over to the bar. \"What were you doing?\" asked the russian interrogator. Austin Dennis did not reply. The russian slapped him, then asked another question. \"Who do you work for?\" Austin continued the silent treatment. He recieved several jabs to the jaw. \"What does it matter?\" he repied. \"One of us is going to die soon.\" The russian thought for a moment. \"If he does not give in the information, we will leave him alone in here. Navsegda.\" Austin gulped. If he did not give up his identity and business soon, he would be stuck in the damned chair he was tied to. Forever. He waited until the Russians left, then thouht of a plan. After careful thinking, Austin smirked. He would hit them when they least expected it. I'm gonna get you good, he thought. __________________________________________________________________________________________ \"Nice doing buisness with you comrade\"James got up and opened a large garage door.\"6 migs 8 surkovs 9 hinds 3 daisy cutters 2 moabs and 1 emp Dimitri you are a great friend I hope to see you on our side during the war\" James contacted a SAS base south of Russia. \"Hello delta 2-1 I have the supplies we just need the orders and the invasion will begin\" James was near a storage area in moscow he had went there to meet his friend dimitri and too purchase goods. James left the warehouse sure he was American but he spoke fluent russian allowing him to blend in perfectly. He noticed a speech going on and he saw the general that led the invasion of england. He turned arounded and prepared to run but he was spotted. Russian soldiers after him while James ran towards a bar. They shot at him he jumped and dove then smashed a window and jumping through the window entering the bar. He grabbed a bar tendor put a gun up too his head and yelled russian curses at the soldiers chasing him. As he saw the soldiers come in he shot each one of them. He spotted something strange KGB agents at a bar. He shot the wall and told them to leave as James left the bar. \"All troops, all troops, we have a spy on the run! Divert attention to him! Toropit\u02b9sya!\" a Russian said over a loudspeaker. Austin watched the whole scene from the chair he was still tied up in. He watched as the guards talked with an officer. Now is the time, he decided. Jacob started to untie himself. He struggled, but only momentarily. He freed his feet from the legs of the chair, then snuck to the doorway. He listened, then one of the guards jogged away with the officer. Perfect, he thought. He knocked on the doorway to get the guard's attention. The guard realised something was wrong. He opened the door, and Austin grabbed him from behind the doorway, and used the guard's knife to stab him. He whispered, \"I'm on parole, bitch.\" to the guard as he died. Austin took the guard's Kiparis SMG. \"Extended magazines. Nice.\" Austin worked his way through the facility, careful not to be spotted. After some time, he reached the Armory. He found his MPL, but with the Suppressor missing. He didn't care. He threw a magazine in, then stepped outside. He was met by five russian soldiers. He gunned them down immediately. He went back in, and found his ASP, with the silencer still attached. Austin went to the next room, where the power switch was located. After shooting and killing two Russians, he found a flashlight. How convenient, Austin thought. He took out the knife he stole from the guard, and cut the wires, making the whole place go dark. Austin engaged the flashlight. \"Payback.\" he said, as he shot a Spetsnaz troop standing outside the room. \"Good evening sir,\" said the Russian waiter \", would you like to have a taste of our wine or vodka?\" Wilson waved his hand, and said in prefect Russian \", no thank you.\" Wilson continued walking, surveying each of the party goers, to see if Fedorov was here. But he wasn't in the ballroom , it was only filled with other agents. He saw some stairs, and decided to walk up them. If Fedorov wasn't in the ballroom, he was sure as hell that he was somewhere else. \"Landon,\" Wilson said into his small radio, attached to his collar \", you have anything?\" Landon stepped away from the bar, \"Besides vodka, no, but it looks like the police are on high alert outside. I'll meet you in the ballroom and then head for the upper KGB offices once we sign in.\" Landon finished his drink and thanked the bartender, he followed Wilson up the stairs and into the ballroom, which was complete with crystal chandaliers, a full orchestra, and marble statues, \"Damn.\" Wilson said. They sat down at a table adorned for dinner and were joined by Mac, who sat next to them. The music stopped and a Russsian army officer came up to the podium, \"Thank you all for coming tonight\", he said, \"I wish that you all will enjoy the food, the music, and the company, but of course, none of this would be possible without the help of Mr. Mikhail Virashevsky, who will now deliver a speech on the continued success of our great country.\" Landon paused for a moment, and looked down at Wilson's uniform, it was, unfortunately, emblazend with just that name. He almost had a heart attack. \"Come on Mr. Virashevsky, don't be shy,\" said the Russian officer to Wilson. Oh shit, we're fucked, thought Wilson. Still, Wilson walked up onto the platform, where a microphone was already set up. \"Ah, yes,\" said Wilson in russian \", I did fund this party.\" There were laughs from the audience, but not from Landon, who was sweating perfusly. \"Well, um, er....\" said Wilson \", there is nothing I can say about this wonderful country. It's beauty and power estonishes me. It's Military is feared throughout the world. It's economy is properous. It's people, of course, are great. I believe that nothing can stop the Soviet Union, and that communism will continue to be accepted throughout the world.\" There were claps from the audience, and Wilson tried to walk off stage. \"Wait Mr. Virashevsky, we have something for you,\" said the officer. Wilson gloomfully walked back to the officer. The officer started to speak, \"I present you with the Order of Lenin medal, for your outstanding work in improving our country, we thank you.\" There was more clapping, and the offcier pinned the medal to Wilson's disquise. \"Thank you,\" said Wilson, before walking off stage. Landon began to applaud as he breathed a sigh of relief, \"You handled that like a pro, not bad.\" he siad, Wilson laughed. After the first course of the extensive meal being served, Landon left the room, making his way through a crowd of Soviet and East German officials. He reached the halls of the Kremlin, and began to make his way up the building via a maintenance shaft. Carter Sorrens was also in the maintenance shaft although far away, watching the people bustle around the Kremlin. He watched as the general in an office walked out, leaving the database wide open. He eased the door open and dropped silently to the floor. Leveling his Python, he walked to a folder on the general's desk and began rifling through. \"Don't say a word.\" A voice said from behind him. Carter turned to see Jack Landon with a pistol held to his face. Carter's face turned from surprise to amusement. \"You were the thing I was expecting. I ask for no trouble. I'll get what I need and be gone. I don't need a helpless whelp to stand in my way.\" Carter said, acting like a diplomat. \"I'm not helpless!\" Landon yelled, tightening his grip. He was ready to pull the trigger and clean the world of one less asshole. \"You're very clever.\" Carter smirked, hovering his hand to his pouch. \"My lead.\" In a flash, he pulled out a whip and hit Jack's hand. Landon cried out in pain dropping his pistol. Carter fired five shots. Landon recovered and dove behind a chair as Sorrens grabbed the folder and bolted for the door. Landon lashed out, grabbing his foot and bringing them down. He punched Carter in the nose and got a knee in the groin in return. Finally they were kicked apart by a pair of burly KGB who leered over, cocking Uzi's. Out of his mind, Landon looked over to Sorrens who had a plan in his head. \"Any ideas?\" \"Catch.\" Landon almost missed his pistol which Sorrens kicked to his hand. The bigger KGB stepped on the pistol and cried out in pain as Sorrens lashed the whip, blood coming from his chest. Landon swept the man aside and fired his pistol on the KGB about to shoot Sorrens. A spray of blood came from the ear as the KGB agent toppled over. Landon aimed his pistol at Sorrens who held his hands up. \"I don't know who you are and who you are working for. You are an intervention to a CIA operation.\" \"I'd be happy to hear storytime.\" Sorrens replied in his villanous voice. \"It would compromise both of us if we stay here arguing.\" Sorrens and Landon grabbed the bodies, dragging them in a cardboard box. Sorrens used one of their socks to wipe as much blood from the floor and walls. When they put the room as they had entered, they got into the shaft that Landon came from. Sorrens finally spoke. \"Okay. My name is none of your concern and neither is whom I am working for. It's definitely not the CIA. You're after the Soviet attack plans?\" \"Yeah.\" Landon crawled first, he heard Sorrens open his Python and turned around, half expecting the mercenary to shoot him right there. He was simply replacing the spent casings with live rounds before he holostered it along with his whip. \"Well my secondary objective is to assassinate the officer Virashevsky. If the CIA found out I helped you, they would be tracking me down even if I went to the moon. What are you here for exactly?\" \"A while ago, in 'Nam, we learned of those very plans. My friends and I came to find out what Moscow knew about Federov's little idea. And as for Virashevsky, we killed him in the Congo yesterday.\" \"That's impossible, he just gave a speech...\" \"A CIA double gave that speech, a damn convincing one too.\" Landon cut him off, \"So, I'll give you a choice, you help me get those files, and kill Federov, and I'll let you go. Or, you can fight it out with me one more time and get us both killed. Whaddaya say?\" Meanwhile, the SAD surveillance team in the van outside was trying to contact Landon, but with no luck. In the main room were everyone was drinking and watching the speeches bullets were flying. James and dimitri who in russia were well known were being attacked by spestnaz. James was trying not to fight back hoping not to ruin his russian reputation while dimitri was firing Rpgs at the incoming spetsnaz. The building shaked James fell of the rail he was leaning over crusing a noble family when he hit the ground. James pulled out a pistol and shot two spetsnaz parachuting through a hole in the roof. The battle was getting intense James knew he couldnt let the spetsnaz move up or the plan would be ruined. James had his own plan he was after records that the general had on him and his team but he played along. James and Dimitri moved up a floor were there was a large hole in the wall and 5 bodies. James ran up and was face to face with an important military officer. \"who are you and what are you doing here in a time like this\" James thought quickly but dimitri answered\"Isn't it obvious commander were trying to find the general and warn him of the attack. The commander looked shocked \"didnt you know the general is leaving soon his plane is on the top of the building he is just waiting for a few more commanders and then hes leaving.\" Dimitri nodded, \"We better safeguard him.\" They rushed upstaris where the general boarded a Tu-95 Bear aircraft. James stepped on to board but was cut off by KGB agents asking for a military ID, which James lost while fighting. As he distracted the KGB, Dimitri slipped under the tail and lit a cigar, as he shook off the \"ashes\" he threw up a small beacon that adhered to the aircraft. He backed away and the plane sped off. \"Landon, are you there?\" James whispered in the radio as they went back to the ballroom where the guests were still chattering and the Spetsnaz gone. At least temporarily. \"I'm here. I got a mercenary with me. He might be of assistance, did you kill the general or Fedorov?\" \"They got away, but Dimitri managed to place a beacon. So we can find them whenever.\" Landon had exited the shaft with Sorrens behind him. He tried smoothing the wrinkles on his jacket and exited the building to the van. The other men aimed at Sorrens who had a hand on his Python, not drawn, but ready. \"He's a friend. He can help us.\" \"We still don't trust him.\" Sorrens apparently had that thrown at him before. \"You are going to have to if you want to catch the general and the documents. I have a personal modified Mig-21 Fishbed jet that I used to enter Soviet airspace, it has the Soviet logo and everything except the pilot whom I killed as soon as he landed. It's at the airport nearby, if you get me there, I can shoot the plane down and the documents are all yours.\" \"Hey, I heard some gunfire and something about a Fishbed; I hope your not planning to leave me here Landon,\" said Wilson, avoiding the guards that ran by him \", I have a serious problem with abandoment.\" Landon replied, \"Just get out here Wilson.\" Wilson pulled out his silenced M1911, and quickly ran out of cover. He quickly ran from behind cover, and shot some approaching guards. He ran over to the stair case, and slide down the marble handrail. The Russians began to fire on him, but he was already down on the last step, heading for the door. \"Wilson, we also have a reports of a SOG operative trying to escape from a prison in Moscow. The boss says that a team is going to rescue him, and we're inviting him into the team.\" Wilson shot back at the Russian's while running, and yelled \"I'm busy!!!\" Austin found the exit to the building. He was met by 2 squads of Russian Police. He took cover by the door. After pulling the pin on a flashbang, he threw it out. While the Russians were blinded and deafened, Austin ran to the next building, instead of gunning them down, which would require more ammo. He found a car, and got in. He knew how to hotwire a car, it was part of his SOG training. He was caught behind NVA lines, and after being captured, the NVA turned him over to the Chinese, who in turn handed him over to the Russians. Anyway, he started the car, and drove away. He looked at a road map that was taped to the dashboard, then took a hard right, heading for the airport. This drew the attention of a Russian Hip doing exercises over Moscow. Austin headed for the airport, but was stopped by a Hip. He noted the missile pods and the military markings, and knew that there was going to be trouble. He started to get out, and he hid his ASP under the seat, and kept his MPL on his back. When the passengers realized who he was, Austin gunned down the men. He ran to the car, and started to drive it as fast as he could, as the Hip was in hot pursuit. \"Better hurry the hell up.\", he said to himself, as the side-mounted DShK MG opened up on him. Luckily for Dennis, the MG had little ammo, as it was not currently supposed to be in combat. This also meant that the rocket pods were empty. The Russian yelled. \"I'm out of ammo!!\" to the pilot of the Hip. \"Chyort.\" was the pilot's response. He picked up the radio. \"This is Captain Viktor Belov, requesting backup.\" Austin grinned. The Hip pulled away. However, the grin disappeared when Austin remembered how relentless the russians were. He expected more forces. Those more forces arrived in the form of a pair of Hinds. Austin floored the pedal, and he barely escaped a barrage of missiles that the Hinds had fired. He then heard the roar of a Jet engine. He was nearing the airport. He found a tunnel, with a garage on the side. \"Time to try something new.\" he said, as he drove right through the garage. It had a second car, luckily out of the way of the first, and the keys were on a table. Austin thought for a moment, and he noticed the door off to the side. Austin drove the car out of the garage, to the other end of the tunnel. He checked his rearview mirror, and saw the Russian troops run into the garage. They fell for it. Landon grabbed a bolt-action hunting rifle from the van as soon as he saw Wilson exiting the building with Mac, he shot two police through the glass doors, and one sniper on a rooftop, without missing. The pair quickly entered the van and a CIA operative shut the door, \"Is the mission compromised? We need to know now.\" one operative said, \"No, we lost them at the exit, they haven't found the van.\" Wilson replied. \"Agent Landon, are we going to trust this guy?\" The driver asked. Landon put his guns away and replied with a firm, \"Yes, now step on it.\" The van backed out of the dark alley and began speeding to the airport. The van slowed at the back where both civilian and military aircraft were parked, taking off and landing. It was a good place to assassinate a target, but a good place to get mired up too. Sorrens scanned the security, a sniper on the roof as well as a small army of KGB agents. \"No way in.\" He whispered, \"Im finding a way around.\" He opened the door and stepped out, scanning the streets before crossing. He leveled a Dragunov sniper on his shoulder, a suppressor was screwed on the barrel. He flinched as the rifle shot a single round the dropped the rooftop sniper. Then shouldering the sniper, he gripped the sides of the fence and climbed to the top. \"Are you crazy?\" Wilson exclaimed. \"The barbed wire will cut you like a razor!\" Sorrens smiled back, a dangerous one. \"You've obviously never been told that the Soviets never check their fences or repair them.\" He severed a gap large enough to squeeze in. The hangar opened and he rolled the Fishbed out. \"When I shoot that bastard down, you better collect whatever you need.\" He started the engines and they whined to life. Checking everything over, the jet had full fuel and complete ammunition for the twin heavy machine guns. He readied for takeoff accelerating from the airport and vanishing into the clouds. \"I need the bracon if I'm going to track him down.\" Sorrens told Landon. \"I got it here. It should upload onto your jet shortly.\" Minutes later a single red dot appeared, not too far away. Sorrens steered the Fishbed until he saw the Tupolev 95, codenamed \"Bear\" flying steadily alongside two other Fishbeds. He didn't wait for the other jets to react before he flew over the port escort, opening fire with his guns. Rounds tore into the Fishbed's cockpit, severing it from the aircraft, instantly killing the pilot. Before the second jet could react, the mercenary turned to spray the underside with a hundred rounds. It impacted the fuel reserve and the fighter detonated in a fireball. The defenseless bomber could only pick up speed and it tried speeding away. Sorrens smiled, his prey was in his grasp. He fired, taking out one of the engines, that would force the Bear to crash land, leaving everything intact. If the pilots were the best of the best, they typically flew for generals and Kremlin leaders, they would safely land the plane for the CIA team to ambush. \"Sorrens to Landon, target is disabled, crashing twenty miles south of Moscow. I suggest we meet up at the wreck to collect our prize.\" Austin prepared the Harpoon Gun he found. He had seen a rogue MiG-21 Fishbed destroy two other MiGs and cripple a Tu-95. He saw an Mi-8 head for the crash site. He readied the hook and fired, hitting a landing gear. He reeled in part of the line, and was now hanging on to the gun, which had him hanging from the Hip. When the Hip neared the crash site, it lost altitude. When it was low enough for Austin to let go, he did. He landed a few paces away from the wing. He walked in, and found that a few crew members survived, but were extremely wounded. One tried to draw a Makarov pistol. \"If the crash doesn't kill you, I will.\" he said, as he shot the pistol wielder. He proceeded to shoot everyone else. He looked in the cargo hold, and found a few items. The lone overturned crate, whose contents, multiple RPKs, had scattered across the hold, was of no importance of him. But then he eyed a manila folder on the ground that was crushed under one such RPK, with a stamp on it that said, \"Classified\" in English and Russian. He drew his ASP. A search party might be coming, he would have to be gone by then. Wilson, Landon, and the CIA team met up with Sorrens in front of the destroyed Tupolev bomber. \"Well, here it is.\" Sorrens said. They went in. \"What the-\" Landon started, as he saw the dead bodies. \"They were shot.\" said Wilson. \"This guy looks like he was trying to fight back.\" he said, motioning to a body dead on it's back, a Makarov pistol next to it's right hand. \"What if someone already got here?\" Landon asked. \"Probably Sorrens.\" Wilson replied. \"What the- I'm right here!\" Sorrens retorted. Landon went on. \"What about James?\" he asked. \"Impossible.\" replied Wilson. \"There is no vehicle, no parachute, nothing. And I highly doubt he walked all the way here.\" Sorrens spoke up again. \"Maybe we should go in. It may answer this question.\" Wilson replied. \"Alright, we're going in. I sure hope whoever made it here didn't get the files.\" They dropped into the cargo hold. They looked around. RPKs littered the floor, but there was no sign of the file. Landon looked around. He saw something. \"Woah, woah. Guys, I swear I saw something moving!\" \"Probably your mind messing with you.\" Wilson replied. \"I swear, there is something here!\" he replied, as he raised his weapon. \"Alright, stand back, I am shooting the next thing tha-\" he was interrupted by a click. A bullet penetrated his rifle. \"What the-\" he started, before being cut off. Someone grabbed him, and held a gun to his neck. \"No one makes a move, or your friend dies, Ruski.\" the someone said in russian. \"Aww, for god's sake,\" said Wilson, taking out his CAR-15. He started to move forward a little, and the Russian tightened his grip on Landon. \"Take another step, and another man will die for your cause,\" said the Russian. Wilson needed to think of something quickly, or else the Russian was going to blow his head off. Landon began to feel something in his gut, but it took him a minute to figure out what it was, fear. Wilson, Mac, Sorrens, and the rest of the CIA team stood there tensely, \"Well, that makes two of us who are dying for a good cause!\" Landon thrust forward and broke free of the man's grasp, he engaged in a brutal CQC fight with him, causing much collateral damage to the interior of the plane, \"Commie son of a...\" Landon heard him yell, as the two continued to fight Sorrens intervened, \"Landon! Stop! He's not Russian!\" The man looked at Landon, \"So, you're not with the KGB?\" he said as the duo stopped their brawl, \"Jack Landon, CIA SAD.\"Chapter 8: Finale  \"CIA.\" The man breathed, \"Finally someone I might be able to trust.\" The plane shuddered and groaned from the damage in Landon's fistfight. It wasn't going to hold much longer. \"Let's get off this scrap pile!\" Mac yelled, as the hull snapped. Caught by surprise Landon and Sorrens were on the front of the hull as it plunged fifty feet to the forest floor. Landon was hit by a falling Makaroc which shattered the cockpit glass. Sorrens grabbed Landon and hurled them through. They hit the ground with the wind knocked out of them. Sorrens and Landon rolled in front before the hulk crashed where they had been standing a second before. \"You in one piece.\" Sorrens asked as he got up. \"Yep.\" Landon replied, grabbing his CAR 15 that was fallen nearby. \"Out of curiosity, who do you work for?\" \"I work alone.\" Sorrens replied, then added. \"You ever heard the saying curiosity killed the cat? I eliminate whomever knows too much. I'll let you in on a little secret. I work for whoever pays me the most.\" Will jumped off the jeep with his team, his CAR 15 slinged over his shoulder. He walked to the barracks to find Colonel Smith discussing their mission with a man in a black trench coat. The man stood up, packed up his briefcase then left. Will walked in. \"Colonel? Who was that.\" Will asked. \"Nobody to take note of,\" Smith said, \"However, you are going on a mission in three months.\" \"Where to?\" \"Russia. You'll be accompanied by the 67th.\" Outside the Russian's Invasion HQ, Siberia George Wilson layed prone in the snow, watching the base for nearly five minutes now. \"It's fucking cold,\" said Landon \", when the hell are we going to move?\" Wilson still kept focused on the base, not even flinching. \"When they move, we move,\" replied Wilson. Landon went back to looking at the base, and wondered even if the 67th was ever going to move. Landon sighed reluctantly, he knew he could take whoever was inside the base, but he would trust Wilson on this one. After another several minutes of lying silent in the snow, Landon spotted a snowmobile patrol. \"Shit! More guards!\" He pointed out, \"Wilson, you still got that climbing gear?\" \"Yeah, but what good will that do us?\" Wilson asked. \"You'll see.\" Landon told him. Landon used the snowbank as cover for him to crawl to a crevasse in the ice, he jammed a hook into what looked to be a soft spot, he then crawled back to Wilson, with the rope in hand. Landon's was an emergency plan, but he would soon have to put it in to use, as the snowmobile was headed his way, He waited until it was just over the snowbank, and then he threw the grappling hook right at it. The Russian's screamed as the snowmobile swerved out of control. The snowmobile hit a rock and it was sent flying in the air. It made a two turns in the air, sending the russians into the ground. \"Now!\" yelled Landon. Landon and Wilson began to move toward the snowmobile. Wilson aimed his CAR-15 at one snowmobile's gas tank, and fired. It lighted up like a christmas tree, almost rocking the snowmobile next to it. Wilson yelled to Landon \",let's just finish this shit so that I can go back home with my legs still attached!!\" Landon nodded, and they cleared away the rest of the russian patrol. When they were finished, Wilson pulled out his radio. The Russian's knew they were coming, since the alarms were already hollaring down at the base. \"This is Wilson here. Looks like the operation is going to have to start early,\" he said. \"Roger that,\" said the commander of the 67th. Almost on que, two Bell AH-1 cobra's came up from behind a small hill, and began to fly toward the Soviet base. One of them fired two missiles, striking the communication's center on the opposing hill. Landon ran over to a snowmobile, which had sustained two bullets, and flipped it over. \"Come on Wilson,\" yelled Landon, already kicking on the snowmobile. Wilson ran toward Landon, and got into the back seat. Time to kill Fedorov, thought Wilson. Landon hit the gas, and they began to speed toward the base. General Fedorov was standing, looking at the huge screen before him. The attack was going to occur when he gave the order, and he was happy about that. Even though, of course, that the american's were attacking and his government had labeled him a 'rouge general'. Now, his faithful soldiers were fighting two enemies, their own comrades and the captialist pigs. Fedorov sighed, nothing really matter now. As soon as the EMP's went off, the Russian's would take over the United States; and Russia's people would label him a hero. Dead or Alive, Fedorov would win. \"Sir,\" said a officer , saluting automaticly \",the american's have already taken out our communications. We will be having no reinforcements.\" Fedorov took out his Makarov pistol, and put it on the table. \"Tell your men to defend the command area at all cost. We must not lose this area to the americans'.\" The Officer saluted, and began to run back out to the combat. Fedorov sat down in his chair, and watched the timer tick away. James hoped for the best and fired a shot he took out 2 guards and an oil storage unit. James had been on the run from the russian army after a subsequent defeat at the orders sub HQ in siberia was destroyed. James was firing his sniper at every russian he saw. He then proceeded to move in to the area where Fedorov was. He looked in his backpack and saw a wierd gun and a field manual. A few days ago the SAS was called in to check out a quarentined area in germany which was an old Die Gocke facility. He was spotted and shots rained apon him. He was hit in the chest and dodged the other shot. He looked at the manual and read it quickly. He was shot two more time and James then passed out from blood loss. A sniper took the final shot after looking at the cover of his manual. Landon and Wilson rapidly approached the door to the base, and stacked up once they reached it. The two looked at eachother and nodded. Landon went in first, kicking down the door and dropping down for wilson to spray the room in front of them, as they searched for any sign of Federov's plan, Landon noticed a small red glow from under a desk, he picked it up, against his better judgement, and looked at it: \"01: 32: 57 - 01: 32: 56 - 01: 32: 55-----\", it was a timer. Austin watched the russians through his binoculars. He had been sent to survey the Russian Missile Launch facility, which had suspicious activity ever since an SOG team knocked out Soyuz 3. He looked through and saw 2 familiar faces, messing with a timer. He smiled and kept looking. He then saw a missile which read, \"\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0441 \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0430\". This translated to, \"Electromagnetic Pulse Cruise missile\", or \"EMP Cruise Missile\". Austin got out his radio and contacted Wilson and Landon quickly, then he unslung his MPL and began to infiltrate the base. Wilson looked at the timer. \"I don't know what it is for.\" He said. Suddenly, his radio vibrated. \"Wilson and Landon. Long time, no see. This is AUstin Dennis, the SOG operative you met in the plane wreck. I have valuable intelligence.\" He said. Landon replied, \"We're listening.\" Austin continued. \"I am a quarter-mile outside the base, and I am here to gather intelligence for my CIA Handler. However, it seems you guys have already made it here. I ws sent anyway. I have eyes on an EMP Cruise missile, which is currently being transported to the launching structure. What des the timer read?\" he said. Wilson replied, \"01:30:32.\" Austin then said, \"Good. You have an hour and a half to disable that missile. If you do not disable it, then the missile will launch, and the mission for both of us will be a failure. Get on it. I am infiltrating the base now. Good luck. Zulu Four out.\" Wilson then spoke into the radio. \"But, Austin, what is the missile's target?\" he asked. There was no reply. Landon then said, \"We best get moving.\" \"Damn right we should,\" said Wilson, already taking out his CAR-15. They both began to run for a set of stairs, which lead up to the base's main observation post. Wilson and Landon were both hauling ass up the stairs, both of them hufffing and puffing as they ran. Wilson, suprisingly, was in the lead. \"I.....hate.....my......job.......\" gasped Wilson, using a handrail to swing himself onto another set of stairs. There were no Russian's on the stairs, suprisingly, and Wilson thought they were okay. Wilson and Landon went through a door that lead to the observation post, and they were greeted by Fedorov. Unfortunatly, he had six heavily armed men. \"Well, how nice it is too see you both again,\" said Fedorov, clasping his hands together. \"Fuck you,\" said Landon, breathing through his nose. Fedorov walked over to Landon, and bashed him on the head with both of his fists. Warm blood began to trickle from his head. \"That is no way to treat a guest,\" said Wilson, trying and failing to crack a joke. Just then, Fedorov's fist came into contact with Wilson's chin, and he collapsed to the floor. \"With you Wilson,\" said Landon \", it's always a bad time.\" Fedorov began to shake his fists to disperse the slight pain of the punch, and began to walk toward the window's that overlooked the launchpad. The battle was still going on, but the rocket was already steaming. \"In just a minute, my plan is going to go into action. As soon as this rocket detonates over Washington D.C., my agents will begin to set off their EMP devices, destroying your country's chance of fending off an attack. Even if the Soviet Army manages to kill me, the Russian people will cheer my name as we storm the United States and Europe. Either way, alive or dead, I will win.\" \"I've got one thing to say,\" said Wilson, wiping the blood off his face. Fedorov turned around, and glared at Wilson. \"And that would be....?\" asked Fedorov. Wilson smirked, and said \"I wouldn't be so optimistic.\" Two Soviet MIG-17's came tearing through the sky, and dropped their payloads onto the rocket. The bombs hit the fuel tanks, and lighted the rocket up in a blaze. Fedorov's jaw dropped as he watched his plan burn. The guard's were also suprised by the sudden attack on the rocket. Wilson, who was still laying on the ground, knew that this was the perfect chance. Wilson signaled Landon to take out the guards with his head, and Landon understood. With a flowing movement, they both grabbed their CAR-15's, and swept through the soldiers. Wilson got done with his row, and began to shoot at Fedorov's legs. Fedorov screamed in agony as his kneecaps nearly exploded, and he fell to the ground. \"Good job , Landon,\" said Wilson, giving his friend the thumbs up. Wilson and Landon both got up, and began to walk over to Fedorov. While Landon stopped the timer, Wilson stepped on top of Fedorov, who was trying to crawl away. Wilson flicked on his radio, and began to speak to the leader of the 67th. \"We've got Fedorov, and we're already looking for the other EMP devices in the States. Don't fire on the Ruski's, though; they're \"friends\" for the time being. Mission Accomplished, people.\" Wilson and Landon stood in front of two burning building as a Russian Colonel began to drive towards them. When the UAZ stopped, the trucks that were behind the jeep began to pour out with troops, which began running toward Wilson and Landon. They began to raise their CAR-15's at the Russians, but the Colonel waved them down. \"We're not trying to kill you,\" said the Colonel, smiling \", yet. You have stopped General Fedorov from starting another World War, since he failed to recognise that your country has a nuclear failsafe system.\" \"Damn right....\" said Wilson, before Landon elbowed him. The Colonel glared at Wilson, before continuing. \"My superiors have told me to escort you to the Mongolian border, where your goverment will bring you and your friends back home,\" said the Colonel, pointing at some soldiers from the 67th, who had their hands high. Wilson and Landon were both smiling, since they didn't have to fight anymore people. But, Wilson had to ask one more question. \"Mind if we tour your ICBM bases,\" said Wilson, smiling devilishly. Landon sighed. \"Wilson, shut up.\"Epilogue  Langley Falls, Virgina July 10th, 1965 Landon and Wilson were both walking towards the Director's office. The both had suits on now, and on occasion a woman worker would give them the eyes. \"I love these suits,\" said Wilson, smiling back at the women. \"Why don't you focus on getting to the director's office first,\" said Landon, nudging Wilson a little. They turned down another hallway, and walked toward a door. Wilson turned the knob, and they both entered the dimly lighted room. The Director was sitting at his desk, smoking as usual. \"You wanted to see us, sir,\" asked Landon. The Director sat silently for a moment, and Landon and Wilson looked at each other; trying to figure out what the Director was doing. Then, without warning, the Director threw a yellow folder down on top of the table. \"I've got another mission for you two....\" said the Director, lying back in his chair.

Delta 4-7 22:25, November 11, 2010 (UTC)Re: New Fanfic  I like it, with roleplaying closed down on the regular wiki it can't hurt to do something CoD related. I also kind of miss AMR's fanfic. Delta 4-7 01:56, November 12, 2010 (UTC) Alex Martin Rider, he's an editor on the CoD wiki, wrote a Black Ops fanfic back in June but never finished it. Delta 4-7 02:06, November 12, 2010 (UTC) No, \"Deniable Ops\" wouldn't be bad. Delta 4-7 18:58, November 14, 2010 (UTC) \"Special Agent\" would cover it, I guess. The CIA doesn't have any ranks that I know of. Delta 4-7 03:34, November 15, 2010 (UTC) Do you want the story to be paralell to that of Black Ops'? i.e. have one of us discover NOVA-6 in Vietnam, or do something similar, but independent? Delta 4-7 19:34, November 17, 2010 (UTC) No problem. Delta 4-7 00:32, November 19, 2010 (UTC) Glad to see you're back! Now with regards to the fanfic, I was thinking that a more devious plot to ruin the U.S. from within would be better than simply blowing up the country, whaddaya think? Delta 4-7 00:31, November 22, 2010 (UTC) I guess, like, destroy the infrastructure with some kind of superweapon, kill the government, invade. Delta 4-7 00:42, November 22, 2010 (UTC) K, seems a bit too Sci-Fi to begin with. Delta 4-7 00:49, November 22, 2010 (UTC) XD Delta 4-7 02:09, November 22, 2010 (UTC) I'm afraid I don't quite understand what happened in the last chapter. Delta 4-7 02:44, November 22, 2010 (UTC) Oh, I thought you meant we had to go rescue the POW's at the camps, and that we should save the documents too. Delta 4-7 02:52, November 22, 2010 (UTC)\ufeff I'd love to be the rescuer. My group specializes in stealth, but I have a feeling this will be anything but! EliteMaster117 00:22, November 23, 2010 (UTC) I posted. You or Delta's turn! EliteMaster117 00:40, November 23, 2010 (UTC) I'll be honest, it's getting sort of crazy, but it seems like getting it back on whatever track you envisioned would be best, because, the way I see it, you created the thing so you're in the driver's seat.

I'm happy you've taken such an interest in this wiki, and being a central member of the community you've really helped out. So, how would you like to become an administrator? I think you're up to the job, and considering you're pretty much active all the time, you can get jobs done when they need to be. Being an administrator doesn't mean you can't make any more fanfics, you can still be the same person you are now. I need to see if other major community members think you would make a good administrator, and if all goes well, I'll make you one and run through some things with you.

Floody 16 own's you 23:32, December 7, 2010 (UTC)Problems with your post  No offense (I was seriously hoping I wouldn't have to tell you how to run your own FF), but Austin was in Moscow, too, if he was the SOG operative you meant. When the Russian said over the loudspeaker that a spy was on the loose, that spy was James Pearson (I dunno if James is supposed to be a spy, i need to clarify with SGT Sprinkles, but the Russian at lest thinks he is a spy), who had apparently just engaged in a fight with the Spetsnaz. Otherwise, there would be no reaction in the place where Austin was held captive. I had a cool plot twist in mind, if you approve. I would rather not post it here, as everyone can see it here.

The plot thingy in Deniable ops is ruined. Either D 4-7 or Wunderwaffle posted a chapter where they escape the Russian holding landon hostage. I originally had in mind where the \"Russian\" would see the CAR-15 and hear Wilson speaking English, and would realize they were American, and identify himself as Austin Dennis. He only spoke Russian becuse he thought the CIA team was a KGB team (Remember, they dressed as KGB Agents for their op in moscow.) Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 02:22, December 11, 2010 (UTC)Splinter Cell  I've never played the series, but have been persuaded in the past about it. I'll rent the game and try to make an amateur story on your fanfic wiki. By the way, could you extend Urban Warfare? I'd hate to finish it myself. My Wunderwaffle iz missin 23:30, December 16, 2010 (UTC)Fearsome Might  Would you mind if I switched up the last couple lines of text? The whole idea was I just took the docks and had dropped off reenforcements for Thomas. Delta 4-7 21:52, December 21, 2010 (UTC) If you want than I could have Thomas get overrun and pushed back to the rescue team, then head to US lines. Delta 4-7 22:05, December 21, 2010 (UTC)LANCERS  Maybe, I wasn't planning on showing a photo of the LANCERs because I have yet to see a picture that resembles them, more to have the reader picture what they may look. That picture could work, if the title was removed from the side. Nice idea. By the way, isn't my Christmas fanfic hilarious? I'll post something else later. My Wunderwaffle iz missin 01:37, December 22, 2010 (UTC)Kid SEAL  I finished writing Kid SEAL. Help spread the word around this wiki and the COD wiki. (I'm trying to get attention, aren't I a bastard?) Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 22:19, December 23, 2010 (UTC)Irony!  Dude, I wrote a huge chapter to stop Federov, but then \"Edit Conflict!\" Thank God I copied it. Delta 4-7 00:35, January 3, 2011 (UTC) Fuck my life, you wouldn't happen to know anything about MS Clipboard, would you. Delta 4-7 00:44, January 3, 2011 (UTC) I mean, the whole thing was pretty much a climax sequence, so I'm assuming you'll want to keep yours up. Delta 4-7 00:59, January 3, 2011 (UTC) Sure. Note: This picks up at the end of Federov's speech. \"Care to prove your theory, ya fuckin' commie bastard?\" Landon snarled at Federov in a deep, hoarse, and raspy voice. Federov responded with a kick to Landon's side. \"I must prove nothing to you, American. In a few short hours, everyone you fight for will be at my mercy.\" Wilson continued to harass Federov with stinging remarks, but Landon could hear none of them, since his ears were ringing with pain. As Federov and his guards formed a circle around Wilson, Landon propped himself up against a wall and looked around, noticing a sign mounted on the wall, in Russian, it read: \"Attention, prior to launch sequence initiation, check to ensure launch silo exhaust doors are unsealed.\" Landon knew what this meant, closing those exhaust channels at the bottom of the silo would cause the rocket's own engines to tear the complex apart. Landon crawled up to a control panel, with Federov still distacted with Wilson. He looked for a dial thinking, \"Come on Landon, shitty rocket engineering and even shittier Russian are two things you should have picked up by now.\" Landon found the right dial, and switched it off, just as he did a klaxon sounded, and Federov turned, \"So you see, American, there is no stopping me. But I will grant you the pleasure of watching my plan fall in to place before I kill you.\" \"Pleasure's all mine.\" Landon smirked. Duely noted, thanks. Delta 4-7 00:17, January 26, 2011 (UTC) K, I'm ready to start Fearsome Might's next chapter when you are. Delta 4-7 22:54, March 27, 2011 (UTC)What about me?  What about my character in deniable ops?

Look: From Patriotism \"This story is about a Russian named Yuri Gusev, a former security guard...\" From Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's Wikipedia ArticleCharacters  \"...and Yuri, a Russian federal security agent.\" And Goddamnit I know I've seen more! All my theories make sense! Delta 4-7 03:17, July 10, 2011 (UTC)New Editor Redesign  Okay, since I believe you have admin powers on this wiki (and I found out BBP09 doesn't), I think you should enable the New Editor Redesign thing created by Wikia. By doing that, editors will no longer have to go to their preferences to switch from source mode to enriched text editor mode, and the background will no longer interfere with the editing background [I believe]. If you want to do this, enabling the new editing thing can be found in the Wikia Labs, under your \"My Tools\" tab. Just click \"enable\". So, just restating my point, it would be better if you enabled the New Editor Redesign. JerryWiffleWaffle is a loser 22:53, July 24, 2011 (UTC)I have a question...  What are the Badges for?

I've been doing a back and forth war against an anon here. My Wunderwaffle iz missin 20:33, September 8, 2011 (UTC)Hopefully you don't mind...  ...But I'm raising the protection statuses on any article I see. I'm going to stop unregistered users and new users from editing articles. If you could help me, that would be swell. Maybe I could cover A-I articles, you get J-R articles, and JWW can cover the rest. This is kind of harsh, but I have had it. This is the #1 way to get 4chan off of us. It allows for non-admins, such as Waffle, Gloryman, Andy C and myself, to edit pages, while the newer ones and the Anons are barred from editing anything. By doing so, we just need to delete any spam articles/pictures we see. My only problem, is that I don't know what denotes a new user from a normal one, so I'm worried that if we don't do it fast enough, then some of the vandals may get past the 'new user' stage and be ableto wreak more havoc, which can be solved my a modest year-long ban. Bumblebeeprime09 the Pilot 21:14, September 8, 2011 (UTC)Protection  Please do not protect any articles.

I WILL look for it.Signup  Here you are.My Character PMG Guns  See yah.Joint Ops Part One- The Begining Chapter One: New Guy  0901 hours Victory Valley Forward Operating Base (54th Intelligence/Counter-Intelligence Division HQ) Kazakhstan I was nervous as hell when I disembarked from the Black Hawk. I saw Blackhawks and M939s all over the place. I saw a Abrams roll by. \"Helluva secret base,\" I thought in my head. My name is Alex Tom Arthur, and I am a Sergeant. I was in Kazakhstan, at Taurus International Base, the forward base for the 54th. The 54th ICI was supposed to be a group of the most elite combat warriors in the world. It was like those black operations rumors, only not so secret. I was caught off guard when I heard, \"HEY YOU, FUCKING NEW GUY! CAN'T YOU LISTEN TO ANYTHING I SAY!\" Captain Peter screamed, his face centimeters from mine. \"Uhhh, I'm sorry, Sir.\" \"Well sorry doesn't cut it.\" Peter walked away. \"Haha, you just got schooled, bro!\" said SpC. Timothy Smitts, the team's sniper. \"Shut the fuck up, Timmy.\" I shot back. \"Bastard.\" muttered Tim as he walked away. I went on to the training course. 30 minutes later, I went to my bunker. when I saw my bed, Timmy was standing by it. \"Oh, you are kidding me, right?\" I said. Tim started to say something, but stopped when Peter walked in. \"Boys, I see you fighting like a fucking married couple. I'm sending you two behind enemy lines, to sabotage a building. The building contains things vital to them, but useless for us. Get your gear, the chopper leaves in 30 minutes. Go.\" Peter walked out of the room. \"Dammit.\" I muttered. \"Well well well, Alex. Time to get serious, dawg.\" In my head, I thought, Fuck my life. We packed our gear.Chapter Two: Getting Along  1600 hours Altai Mountains Northeast Kazakhstan I watched as the chopper flew away. \"Well, here we are.\" said Tim. \"Okay, let me tell you something. I only tease people to help me not focus on the horrors I have seen. But we're in the field now, so let's do this!\" Tim explained, after which he pulled the charging handle on his M21 sniper rifle. I then readied my UMP. We walked up. \"Hold up- 3 man patrol ahead. AK-103's, Makarov PMs, RGD grenades. Lets kill 'em.\" He aimed his rifle, as I did with my UMP. Silenced gunshots filled the air, but due to our guns having silencers, I doubted anyone knew anything had happened. Except for Tim and I. \"Good aim, Tim.\" I said. \"Hold on a second. Another lone guy. I will get him.\" Said Tim, as he handed me his rifle, and pulled his pocketknife out. With one arm, he held the guy and covered his mouth. The other, impaled the helpless guy with the knife. \"That is how you take a guy out, Alex.\" He said, as he took his M21 back from me. We continued on, until we saw a building. \"That's the building! I\u2019m gonna stay back and snipe, you go in and plant C4 on the inside of the building, so we collapse the goddamn structure. Lets move.\" commanded Tim. I went into the building, C4 and UMP ready. I shot a guy in the back, and got to work, placing each C4 pack just right, so as to cause maximum damage. I'm not ONLY stealth, you know. Anyway, when the last C4 packet was placed, I went to leave the building, but as I turned around, a Russian firing squad was standing right there, every rifle aimed at me. \"Drop the gun, turn around, and get on the ground.\" said the Russian officer. I had no other choice but to comply. I dropped the gun and the c4 detonator, turned around, and kneeled. I raised my hands to surrender. \"You poor, weak, little thing. You thought you could destroy my headquarters? And you think by raising your arms in the air, we would spare you?! No, not when I'm the commander. Deal with him.\" I heard the Russians cock their rifles. I knew it was the end. But, just when I knew my back would be flooded with bullets, I heard the window smash, and through it came Tim. He had come to rescue me! His M1911 drawn, he shot and killed each russian, one by one. \"You okay, man?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.\" \"We can talk later, we have to get out first.\" \"Good call.\" I grabbed my UMP and C4 detonator, followed Tim out, slung my UMP over my back, turned around and pulled the detonator out. \"Alright, here we go.\" I said. \"Click Click-\" I hit the detonator, detonating the C4, and collapsing the building containing my would-be grave.\"-Boom.\" \"Nice job, Alex.\" \"Oh come on, Tim, I would have been dead if it weren't for you!\" \"Ok, lets just get out of here\" \"Good idea.\" Tim pulled his radio out. \"Command, this is Echo Two-Two, the HVB is destroyed, repeat, the HVB is destroyed, mission success, over\" Command station Ozone answered. \"Roger that, Hammer Six-One is en route to your area to get you guys back to base, over\" \"Roger that, Ozone, over and out.\" Tim tried to start a new conversation. \"So, what word starts with Bi and ends in Tch?\" \"Oh, Timothy...\"Chapter Three: Ambush Territory  200 miles south of Kabul Afghanistan  PFC. John Hudson held his M4A1 Carbine nervously. \"What's the problem, Hudson?\" asked Cpl. Jack Marston. \"Im just nervous, thats all.\" \"If its because its gonna be your first battle, then stop worrying. These OpFor dipshits dont stand a chance against us marines.\" The pilot's voice was heard over the intercom.\"Alright deltas, we are approaching the DZ. Get ready to fast rope out of the chopper.\" Sgt. Micheal Wilding gave orders to the squad. \"Hudson, Marston, when we get down there, we are gonna keep them suppressed, Cooper, you lay down some MG fire on the soldiers. If tanks show up, then you help our strykers out, help blow them up. Everyone got it?\" The squad replied all at once. \"Sir, yes sir!\" The squad executed the plan. Before they knew it, they were assaulting the town itself, the one that the so-called \"OpFor\" was defending.\"God Damn, we move through so fast. It's like we have the force of a fucking juggernaut\" said Hudson. Marston replied, \"That is what the United States Marine Corps is about, Hudson.\" The marine squad, designated Delta Four, found an abandoned technical. Cooper spoke up first. \"Nice, we could use it.\" Mike replied, \"Good idea. Hudson, you drive. I will sit in the passenger seat. Marston, you get on the M2. Cooper, you sit in the back with Marston, since you carry the squad's heaviest weapons. Go.\" The pickup started. \"Keep your eyes out for movement\" said Mike. Cooper said, \"This is ambush territory. They are probably watching us.\" \"We are not shooting unless they shoot first\" replied Mike. As if on cue, a bullet struck the side of the truck. \"Shit, we have a sniper!\" screamed Marston. All of a sudden, MGs, Rifles, and RPGs opened fire on the truck. Mike yelled, \"HUDSON! GET US THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!\" Hudson replied, \"I cant! This damn road has too much rubble, and I'm going as fast as I can!\" The truck was battered, but it held together. Both Cooper's 249 and the mounted M2 were tearing out bullets. Hudson shouted, \"Mike, I cleared the rubble!\" Mike replied. \"Alright, haul ass, HAUL ASS!\" Marston pulled out his radio. \"Ozone, this is Delta Four-Two, we just got ambush by a shitload of Afghani militia, requesting evac, over\" There was no answer. \"Repeat, this is Delta Four-Two, can you hear me?\" Again, no answer. \"Damn it. Mike, radio is messed up.\" Hudson spoke to himself. \"This is going to be a long first battle...\"Chapter four: Stranded  The squad had been driving for 20 minutes, when the truck stopped. \"Shit, were out of gas\" said Hudson. \"Alright, we need to go on foot.\" said Mike. \"But where?\" asked Marston. \"We will figure it out.\" The squad moved on, and found themselves walking through a wide, open road. The squad was caught offguard. A shout was heard in Arabic. Then the sound of gunshots filled the air. The OpFor had taken positions in an apartment building. Mike yelled, \"Hudson, clear out that building!\" as he gestured to a bank across from the apartment building. \"Yes sir.\" replied Hudson. Hudson walked in. He cleared the first two rooms, but when he reached the third, an OpFor soldier had hidden behind the door. The soldier, unarmed, punched Hudson in the face and kicked his gun away. The two proceeded to get into a brutal fist fight. Meanwhile, the group outside was being faced with stronger and stronger opposition. Marston was getting worried when Hudson wasn't coming back.\"I need to go find Hudson, it has been three minutes!\" he said. \"Alright, but hurry up.\" said Mike Hudson fought hard, but was succumbing to the power of the OpFor soldier. Hudson was laying on the ground, too weak to fight anymore. The OpFor picked up Hudson's M4A1, cocked it, and then got his helmet knocked off and covered the floor with blood as bullets from Marston's M16 tore into him. \"Buddy, are you okay?\" asked Marston. \"Kind of.\" Hudson tried to get up. He was not able to stand well. As Marston and Hudson came out, Mike screamed, \"Take cover! We have enemy LMGs tearing this place up!\" Gunfire from an estimated one-hundred OpFor soldiers lit up the area. All the squad headed for cover, as there were a few holes in the ground caused by artillery fire. When all hope seemed lost, the sound of helicopter rotors were heard. \"Wait, what's that?\" asked Cooper. Then an AH-6 attack helicopter came into view. \"OORAH, OpFor bastards are in trouble now!\" All the rifle fire had stopped. This was soon replaced by the ominous sound of the AH-6's dual miniguns spinning, and then the sound of them firing. \"Delta Four, this is Hornet Two-Four, a Black Hawk chopper from the Navy SEALS, callsign Able Two-Three, is on it's way to pick you guys up, E.T.A. 5 minutes, over.\" Marston replied \"Roger that, this is Delta Four-Two, thanks for the support, over\" \"Your welcome, Delta Four-Two, over and out\" Hudson then spoke up. \"Finally, we get to leave.\" The squad watced at the Black Hawk's silhouette came through the air. The Black Hawk landed, but encountered MG fire from dug-in Militiants. One SEAL shouted, \"Keebler! Get on the minigun!\" the other replied, \"Yes Sir, Pillsbury\" as he hopped on the minigun, and started blasting away at targets. \"Thanks for getting us out of here.\" said Cooper. \"No problem. By the way, you can call me Pillsbury, and my partner, Keebler.\" Everyone started to introduce themselves to each other. \"You okay with the first mission?\" Marston asked Hudson, who looked depressed. \"Yeah, I guess.\" \"Don't worry, after a few more, you will be fine.\" \"Gee thanks, Marston...\"Chapter five: Intelligence  1700 hours 150 miles east of Pripyat Ukraine I walked on through the abandoned town. My squad consisted of, Timmy, who I now sometimes call Hellraiser, Corey Walden, the new guy, and Captain Peter. Our mission was to secure some old Soviet intel, before the Russians get it and get any ideas, I should say. Rumors say that around 100-200 miles away from Pripyat, there is a ghost town with Soviet intel. We had to get it. \"Hold up, squad\" said Peter. Timmy, Corey, and I stopped. \"Booby trap.\" Peter disarmed it. \"You seriously think that a booby trap from 30 years ago would still work?\" said Timmy. \"I agree with Timothy. I don't think it would still work.\" said Corey. \"Well, we can't take chances either.\" I spoke up. \"Well wait a minute, this type of booby trap was made in 2001. There are people guarding it.\" Peter asked, \"What makes you think that people are guarding the intel?\" Then we heard low engines. We hid quickly, as a BMD-3 went past them. \"That BMD tells me.\" I said. \"Screw you\" said Peter. We became silent again, as a Russian patrol came by. \"They've passed, lets go\" said Peter. We moved up. Hellraiser spotted a small patrol. \"Lets take them out\" We aimed our weapons. A few quiet ticks from the muzzles of our guns, the patrol was knocked out cold. We moved up, then Corey spotted the building. \"How are we going to get past that?\" asked Timmy, gesturing to the entrances. \"There are guards at every door.\" \"We go in by force\" said Peter. We opened fire on the building, then the air was thick with gunshots from Russian weapons, as our weapons were silenced. We made it in the building, when I heard the ominous three words: \"Alex, take point.\"  I went on up there, and practically got jumped by three unarmed men. I was thrown to the ground, got kicked, punched , and nearly stabbed when a one of them took my knife. Corey saved me just in time. \"Thanks, Corey.\" I said. \"No problem.\" was his answer. We then cleared the rooms together, and neither of us got jumped. I was looking in one room when I heard Corey say, \"I found it!\". I replied, \"Good, now let's get the hell out of here.\" I looked out a window, and saw the BMD. At the same time, I heard Hellraiser on the Radio. \"The BMD is targeting us. Take it out.\" I tried to call him back, but he did not answer. I looked around, and, luckily, I found an RPG-7, but with no rockets. \"Corey, did you by any chance see an RPG rocket in the other room?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Go get it for me!\" He came back moments later with the rocket. I slid it, locked it, and fired at the BMD. The rocket curved away. \"No!\" But, it hit a building next to the BMD, causing the building to collapse and destroy the BMD. We took a UAZ, a truck that one could call the Russian verrsion of a Jeep, out of the area. Timmy was first to read the intel. \"Whoa, it says the Soviet Union was planning an invasion of the U.S.. We have to get this to the marines\" \"Yeah\" I said. \"Good call\" At that time, little did we know that we were too late.Part two- All Hell Breaks Loose Chapter six: \"Like Red Dawn\"  1200 hours 20 miles south of Quantico, Virginia United States of America The convoy kept moving, despite the multiple Sukhois strafing them with 30mms. The heavily armed convoy consisted of three humvees, two M3 Bradleys, one Abrams tank and one Stryker ICV. Hudson watched as a pair of Apache attack choppers flew by, then saw them get shot down by RPG fire. The convoy shot at Russian paratroopers. Russia had launched an invasion of the US. Marston made a remark. \"God, damn it! It's like Red Dawn!\" Hudson responded. \"Ain't that right.\" A Kamov Ka-52 attack helicopter started to attack the convoy, and destroyed a humvee, but was quickly shot down by passing F-22 Raptors. The Stryker was in the lead. It got blown up by an AT mine. Then a pair of T-90s tore the convoy apart, and soon enough, only a Bradley and Delta Four's humvee weren't destroyed. They performed a drive-by on troops deploying from a Hip transport helicopter. Then Cooper used his AT4-HS to take out a Havoc gunship, but the chopper crashed right on top of the Bradley. The squad drove on, shredding apart enemy troops like scissors would shred apart paper. Until a BTR-90 blocked the road ahead of them. Then a pair of GAZ-3937 Vodniks came up, blocking the road behind them, followed by a T-90, blocking the road to their side. \"We're surrounded, sir!\" said Cooper. Mike replied, \"No shit, Cooper.\" Hudson spoke up. \"Hey, I have an idea.\" They got out, and started to back slowly towards the building. Then, Marston smashed the glass doors, and the squad ran into the building. They heard the Humvee explode. The T-90 shot a support beam in the building, causing a section of the roof to come crashing down. \"GET TO THE ROOF!\" screamed Mike. \"Go, Go, GO!\" added Marston. The T90, BTR, and the Vodniks proceeded to tear the building apart. Mike jumped to the next roof, followed by Cooper and Marston. Hudson then jumped, and missed. \"Hudson! HUDSON! This is Marston, find a way to the roofs! If you find an enemy troop, throw your knife at him, and take his gun!\" Hudson proceeded to follow Marston's instructions, nearly getting torn apart by a BMP-2 at one point. He got to the roofs, and Cooper tossed him his Nambu pistol, a trophy of his grandfather's victory in World War 2. \"Pillsbury, this is Delta Four-Two, can you support us?\" Keebler answered. \"Copy that, Delta Four, we are on the way, E.T.A. 3 minutes, over.\" \"Thanks, Keebler\" \"No problemo, amigos\" The squad finally got away from the vehicles assaulting them. Mike summed up the situation. \"Alright, squad, here's the situation. Our convoy is destroyed, we have a shitload of Russian armor trying to get us, and Hudson here has lost his rifle. But, we also escped the armor for the time being, and we have a Navy SEAL chopper supporting us. You think we can handle the situation?\" Each member replied. \"Yeah\" \"I'd say so\" \"We'll make it.\" Mike replied to all of this. \"Alright then, let's do this!\"Chapter seven: M.I.A.  The squad watched as the helicopter approached. The squad moved up. MGs hidden in the area lit up. \"Pillsbury, we have MGs everywhere!\" said Marston. Pillsbury replied, \"Already on it.\" The minigun started to spin. Then the explosive rounds from the minigun created gaping holes in buildings where MG nests used to be. The squad moved up. They cleared the building. Hudson found an AK-103 rifle, and started using it. They fought their way to the other side of the building, to get into the open, where they could be supported by the Navy SEAL chopper. When they got outside, a Ural truck filled with russian troops performed a drive-by on the squad. The chopper was quick to blow up the truck. When snipers started to attack the squad, Pillsbury sniped them from the helicopter. \"Alright, Keebler, we are moving into the building, can you take out any armor that rolls up?\" Pillsbury replied, \"Everything except for BMDs and T-90s, but I have a Warthog on hold if one rolls up.\" A gunshot was heard over the radio. \"Yes, got another sniper!\" said Pillsbury. The squad moved in. \"Alright squad,\" started Mike. \"Hudson, you take the third floor. I will take the second floor, Marston, you take the ground floor, and Cooper, you take the basement. When the rooms are clear, regroup on me. Move out.\" Mike started to climb the stairs, and he reached the second floor. He held his G36, ready to pull the trigger at anything that moved. He cleared the rooms, eliminating 3 russians in the process. He then waited for the others. Marston checked each room, one at a time. He eliminated an RPG troop trying to shoot down the SEAL helicopter, then heard, \"Delta Four, this is Pillsbury, we need to exit the area, too many RPGs.\" \"Damn it\" Marston muttered. He swore that the others said that too when they heard that. He continued to clear the floor out. When he finished, he regrouped with Mike. Hudson went up to the third floor, and cleared the floor out. He was careful, and picked up ammo from any russians he killed. He cleared the floor out, and met with Mike, and Marston, who had beaten him to Mike. \"Fuck\" he muttered. \"At least I beat Cooper.\" Marston started to wonder why he had not heard gunshots from Cooper's M1014. \"Hey, did anyone notice that there hasn't been a shot heard from Cooper's gun?\" Mike started to get what Marston was saying. \"Yeah, that's strange.\" Hudson spoke up. \"Should we check on him?\" Mike agreed. \"Yeah, let's go.\" They got to the basement. \"Cooper?\" said Hudson a couple of times. \"Oh shit!\" said Marston. \"What?\" asked Mike. \"His equipment is all right here. His SAW, his 1014, his AT4, all right over here!\" said Marston. \"Ohhhh, fuck,\" said Mike. \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Hudson?\" Hudson replied, \"I think so, Mike.\" Mike said to Marston, \"Tell Pillsbury.\" Marston pulled out his radio. \"Pillsbury, Keebler, this is Delta Four-Two, Cooper is M.I.A., repeat, Cooper is M.I.A....\"Chapter eight: Sabotage  Cooper regained consciousness. He had no Idea where he was. He tried to get up, but was too weak. e tried to move his arms, but found they had been tied up. He looked around, and found he was in a dark room. Then a door opened. A russian soldier came in. \"Now, let's get to work in here.\" Cooper tried to move, but found hat his legs were also tied up. The russian soldier reached behind hisback, and pulled out a probe device. Cooper blacked out. 2000 hours Jacksonville, Florida United States of America. I landed with a thud. I was still pumped from jumping out of a plane and parachuting into enemy territory. But Jacksonville, Florida was under artillery fire. It was up to the 54th to complete this mission. I started to talk to Marcus \"Wildcard\", a demolitions expert from another unit being merged with ours. \"Hi, Marcus.\" I started. \"What the fuck is it you want?\" he muttered quietly. I walked over to Jake \"Tailfin\", who was also part of the other unit. I asked him, \"What is Wildcard's problem?\" He said, \"Just ignore him, he isn't fond of new people.\" I replied, \"Oh, I see.\" Peter then said, \"There. The artillery base. Lets move quickly. On me.\" He started to lead us through the forest. We came across a patrol, and we took them all out. Then Corey pointed out something. \"Hey Captain, is that a sniper nest up there?\" \"Yeah, i think so. Lets kill him. Timmy, we got a sniper, take him out.\" Timmy fired his rifle. The sniper dropped. Timmy and Elliott \"Fudge\", the third and final guy being merged with our unit. He and Timmy were going to be our sniper team. Evntually, we got to the gates of the base. We got through when we hoisted eachother up over barbed wire. We went around, killing guys silently, and had Marcus plant the C4. But, our cover was blown when a patrol found the bodies. We fought against seemingly overwhelming forces of enemies. The air was filled wth gunfire, as well as the usual boom of artillery, not to mention the shots from Hellraiser's M21 EBR and Fudge's M40A3. We cleared out each room, trying to kill everyone, so they couldn't sneak up on us. That is when I found him. I was ordered to take point. I cleared a dark room out, then came to a long hallway, with many doors on either side. I kicked open the first three doors, and found this was where the Russians held captives. I got to the sixth door on the left. I kicked it open, and I found a man wearing the marine's uniform. He was unconscious. He was most likely a POW. I woke him up. \"Who- Who are you?\" asked the man. I responded formally. \"I am Sergeant Alex Arthur of Task Force 141. C'mon, we have to get out of here.\" He responded, \"I am Private Cooper of the First Force Recon USMC unit. I need a gun!\" I looked around, then tossed him an RPK I found. He seemed to like it. I guessed Cooper was the support guy for his squad. We started fighting our way out of the place. Marcus detonated the C4. \"Ka-fucking-boom, dumbshits!\" Behind us, we heard a loud boom. I turned around. The artillery base was up in flames. We started escaping the Russians that were after us. We saw the helicopter, carrying Jon \"Rookie\" Rose, and another person, whom I soon found out to be my old friend Knotdead, as I called him. How did I find out, you might ask? The chopper was shot down, and they were the two survivors. We proceeded to the helicopter wreck.Chapter nine: Escape  I hurried over to the crash site. \u201cKD?\u201d I called. KD was my nickname for Knotdead. No answer. \u201cRookie?\u201d I called. Again, no answer. \u201cFuck!\u201d I muttered. \u201cEverybody is dead.\u201d I said to my squad. Then I heard a groan. \u201cUuhh\u201d I called out. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cAT, is that- is that you?\u201d I heard. I answered, \u201cKD, is that you?\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me, Knotdead.\u201d I answered, \u201cWell, you certainly live up to your name. Thank god you are alive!\u201d \u201cI- I need a gun.\u201d I found an M14 from a dead man. \u201cHere, take this.\u201d KD grabbed the gun. Then I saw Rookie get up. He had his ACR, with all parts working. He grabbed a silver M9 from the pilot, who was dead. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d he said almost immediately. Peter said, \u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201d We started to move, until we came across a Vodnik, patrolling the crash site. \u201cWildcard, take it out.\u201d Peter ordered. \u201cMy pleasure\u201d he responded, as he carefully loaded a 40mm HE grenade into his M203. He fired, and the Vodnik went up in flames. We moved on. We came across a large patrol, and Peter told all of us to take out the tangos. We all fired, and knocked out like twenty guys. We then met up with Hellraiser and Fudge, and moved to the LZ. We had a Pave Low on standby to extract us, since the Blackhawk was shot down. We made it to the LZ, but there was no chopper there. Then 2 BMD\u2019s showed up, cannons aimed at the group. \u201cOh shit.\u201d said Corey. \u201cNot again.\u201d added Cooper. Until the Pave Low arrived. Carrying two mini-guns with explosive rounds, as well as an M2 .50 cal MG on the back, the BMDs were officially screwed. We heard the guns spin up, then the BMDs were nothing but wreckage. The chopper landed, and we boarded. Peter ordered me to hop on the rear mini-gun, and KD on the right mini-gun. We destroyed multiple targets before we hovered over the base. We proceeded to tear apart the base, including the rest of the artillery, with the help of Wildcard, and Fudge and Hellraiser, who were sniping from the chopper. Finally, we left the area. \u201cAttention, Echo Two, we are getting a distress signal from a USMC team, called Delta Four, reporting a downed Navy SEAL Blackhawk\u201d\u2026Chapter ten: United we stand  2100 hours Raleigh, NC' United States of America The squad deployed from the chopper. They were trying to find Cooper. They had gotten more troops in their squad. Spencer \"Moby\" Woodby was Cooper's temporary replacement, Glass was a transfer from Zulu team, Leo Sorenson was a second LMG guy, since our squad was supposed to get one new person, and John Smith was a new guy to the squad, but was a well-trained warrior, and thus, was a specialized stealth-- person. Their mission- find Cooper. They went into an apartment building. When they came out on the other side, almost immediately, enemy MGs from an office building opened fire. The chopper appeared over the apartment building, and blew holes in the wall where MG nests were. The black hawk shot at what appeared to be all of the russians in the apartment building. However, Keebler and Pillsbury failed to notice an RPG troop on a balcony, and this proved to be fatal to Able One-One. The RPG fired, and keebler shot the soldier. But it was too late. The RPG hit the Black Hawk's tail, and the chopper was sent into a deathly spiral, taking it through the top floor of the office building, before it finally crashed on the other side of the building. \"What are we going to do now?\" asked Hudson. Marston replied, \"Call for another chopper, Duh!\" he said, as he pulled out his radio and called for another chopper. A pilot answered. \"We are coming to pick you guys up, I have some spec ops guys on board already, but I can make room for more, over\" Mike gave orders. \"Listen. Hudson, Glass, Marston, help out any survivors. Moby, Leo, we will cover the area. Move out!\" Mike said. Marston called out to the crashed chopper. \"Pillsbury\" he called out a few times. \"Keebler\" he called out a couple times. Both came out, and both were alive and well. \"I'm fine.\" Keebler said. \"Same here\" added Pillsbury. Then gunshots raced around them. Pillsbury cocked his M16 and returned fire with the others. Keebler did the same with his M16. Glass joined in, shooting 7.62mm bullets from his SCAR-H. Seeing everyone else doing it, Hudson and Marston decided to empty their STANAGs at russian troops. They fought all of the troops off. They saw another RPG troop. Pillsbury took it personally. \"Oh no you don't\" he said, as he pulled his 1911 pistol out, and landed a headshot on the soldier. \"Holy shit!\" said Glass when he saw Pillsbury take the shot. \"God damn, you got some mad fucking skills, Pills!\" said Moby. \"Thanks.\" said Pillsbury. Then they heard chopper engines. An enemy Kamov had arrived, and the squad had no rocket launchers. But then they heard heavier engines, and a shadow blocked out the sun. Then about 50 shots ripped into the side of the Kamov and sent it in flames. The shadow turned out to be one of a pave low. The Pave Low landed. Alex's Point of View I got off of the minigun as our Pave Low landed. We met with a marine team. Their names were Glass, Marston, Moby, Mike, Hudson, Leo, and Smith. We also met a team of two SEALs, Pillsbury and Keebler. They started staring at Cooper, then shook hands and did other things. From the looks of their faces, Cooper was a part of that squad. He then introduced us to his squad. But the squad reunion for cooper was cut short when a trio of Sukhoi jets started to zero in on us. \"All units, this is Cpt. Riley, we have a few Sukhois homing in on us, hang on tight.\" I held on. So did everyone else. We heard missiles being shot at us, and I saw two Air-to-Air missiles heading towards us. Then, Riley made a sharp turn, and we saw the missiles fly past us. We heard and saw another pair, as the jets turned around. Riley evaded the missiles again. We shook of a few more. But the jets launched 2 more. This time, Riley didn't try to shake the missiles. \"Oh, shit.\" said Moby, as the missiles sped towards us. I said a prayer to myself, \"Please don't let it end this way, please.\" I heard Mike scream, \"What the fucking hell are you doing, Riley?!\" But then, I heard a different noise, and the missiles banked away. I knew what had happened. We started to head south, and I saw the last of the flares dimming in the air. \"Nice job, Riley.\" said Corey. Riley replied, \"Yeah, I also got some air support online. Damn Sukhois ain't going to stand a chance against our Raptor jets. Score one for the good guys!\" We landed at a field. Sukhois and MiGs passed by, but they were too occupied with our Strike Eagles and Raptors to worry about us. Peter, our squad leader, started to chat with the Marine squad's leader, Mike. \"Mike,\" he started. \"How would you like to go on a mission with us? Before you ask why, we are Task Force 141, a group of some of the best fighters on the planet.\" Mike stood there for a second, probably thinking about the offer. \"Sure, I'll go.\" We recieved our mission- Sabotage Russian ships. If our mission was a success, the Russian An-124s would have no escort, and therefore, no defense. This would lead to a Russian retreat, and, possibly, ending the war in the U.S. The war would still go on, but not in the United States. To simple it down for you: Our mission might determine the outcome of the war.Part three- Find the Truth Chapter 11: Battleship Cheaters  1600 hours Off the coast of Georgia Near the United States of America We all got our gear on. We were aboard a submarine, about to take an SDV to a russian aircraft carrier. I guess we owe it to Pillsbury and Keebler, since they got us all this support. We got in the SDV, and we went away. I heard Syco, as I had by then learned to call Corey by his nickname, say, \"Gee, too bad we take an underwater tour in the middle of a war.\" Fudge replied, \"This is your guide speaking. If you look to your right, you will see a russian battleship raining hell on the east coast.\" I spoke up. \"Very funny, Fudge.\" Peter then said, \"Quiet! We are nearing the aircraft carrier. Stay frosty, we are Oscar Mike!\" Marston replied, \"Yeah, Oscar Mike.\" He whispered to us, \"He plays Battlefield too much. I can tell.\" Mike then said, \"Shut up, all of you! We are about to get out.\" Hellraiser then said, \"Get ready to cheat at real-life Battleship.\" as he got off and pulled the charging handle on his M4A1 SOPMOD he was given, due to the fact that sniper rifles are next to useless in close quarters. All of the snipers were given an M4A1 SOPMOD, except for pillsbury, who had his own M16. We started moving towards the ammo room on the aircraft carrier, silently taking out guards. Everyone had a silencer on their gun, so the mission was easier to pull off. We got to the ammo room, and planted C4. \"Damn, that was fast.\" said Wildcard. \"Now, when do i get to blow it up?!\" he asked excitedly. \"Eager McBeaver\" said Hudson. We then huddled, with Wildcard and Cooper standing guard, since they had shotguns. Peter ordered, \"I am splitting you guys up int two teams; Red and Gold. Red team will have: Me, Alex, Marston, Tailfin, Knotdead, Hudson, Glass, Moby, Keebler, and Pillsbury. Gold team will have: Mike, Hudson, Fudge, Cooper, Syco, Hellraiser, Rookie, Leo, Wildcard, and Smith. Red team will take the repair deck, while gold team will work their way through the control tower. We meet up on the main deck, where Riley will pick us up. Got that?\" The rest of us replied, \"Yes sir!\". We moved out.  I went ahead with Red team. Peter told me and knotdead to take point. \"Here we go.\" Knotdead said. We went around the corner, and found a steel door. We decided to breach the next room. I planted a breaching charge on the door. I watched as the timer went down to zero. I saw it hit, \"00:01.00\". I was ready. The charge exploded. I went in, and as fast as i could, took hold of my surroundings and killed everyone in the room. I felt lucky that i wasn't on the floor, bleeding really hard and in pain. Knotdead shouted, \"All clear!\" Tailfin asked, \"What the hell did you guys do?\" I answered, \"We had to breach the room.\" We went and cleared the rest of the room out. Things went smoothly. We then went to the top deck, when we heard Mike on the radio say, \"Shit! Someone grabbed Wildcard and locked the door on us! I hear him fighting some russian dude, I think it is hand to hand!\" Then we saw the glass break at the window, and something falling out. Marcus' detonator to the C4 he planted. 'Fuck, shit, damn it.' were the words that came to mind. \"Riley, get us out now! We heard a gunshot up from the bridge, then heard a loud clank sound. Then an explosion rocked our feet. \"This is Glass speaking, Wildcard is OK, but obviously not the ship! Get to the higher end of the ship and hang on, we are on our way! Where the fuck is Riley?!\" He shouted frantically into the radio. Soon enough, Gold team came out, and rushed at us. \"We are here!\" shouted Cooper. The ship started to buck, and tilt. We heard helicopter engines, and the Pavelow came, and picked everyone up via ladder. I was last on. I was about to grab the ladder, but the ship turned fast. I lost my grip in my left hand. If I lost the grip in my other hand, i would have been a goner. I lost my grip, but when i started to fall, I felt something grab my arm. \"Gotcha!\" said Pillsbury, and I looked up at him. \"Thanks, man.\" I said. \"No problemo, amigos.\" he replied, as he helped me up the ladder and into the chopper. I then felt a sudden heat behind me for a second. The Aircraft carrier we destroyed gave off one final, huge explosion, and i swear, the others were damaged alot, since we got reports at base that the carriers had been sunk by US F/A-18 Hornets. We all yelled in excitement.Chapter twelve: Flashback  1200 hours Quantico MCB U.S.A. We were having a coffee break at Quantico. I sat down to talk to Cooper. \"Hey, Cooper, you seem out of it, what is wrong?\" I asked. He said, \"Dude, It's my father. My dad's squadmate had told me that my dad had been killed while on a special ops mission. The war has kept my mind busy, but that last mission reminded me of him.\" I asked another question, \"What mission was it?\" \"Some mission to get old soviet intel, but an important dude who was running the place got my dad killed. You know he invented Oscar Mike?\" I thought for a second. There was a guy who was guarding soviet intel before the USSR collapsed. The intel was around the same area that TF141 retrieved the intel that had invasion info. \"Oh, shit.\" I said. \"Remember when you got picked up, and we met for the first time?\" I asked. \"Yeah\" \"Well, we were on a sabotage mission when we got picked up by that chopper. But before that mission, we were retrieving some old soviet intel about a hundred-something miles away from Chernobyl. Was that where your dad's guys were?\" He delivered the news. \"Yes.\" Cooper started something else. \"I think a high-ranking dude killed him\" I thought of something \"Maybe the leader killed him.\" Cooper got all aggresive when he heard that. \"Then if he is still alive, he needs to pay for that!\" He slammed his hand on the table. This drew Miike's attention. \"Hey, everything alright here?\" I answered for Cooper. \"We are fine.\" 32 years ago Victor watched as the forest zoomed past, making sure not to drop his MP5. The Huey helicopter was heading to a suspected area of highly valuable intel. Charlie Baker, who was Cooper's dad and the squad's machine gunner, asked the sergeant, \"What is the intel we are looking for?\" Max, the sergeant, replied, \"I don't know. That is why we need to get this shit, so we will know.\" Soon after, the team landed. \"We're on the move.\" Max said. Charlie said, \"Ya know, we should make a catchy phrase instead of on the move. How about, 'Oscar Mike'?\" Victor replied, \"That is stupid, no one will ever use that term.\" Max said, \"I will.\" Victor then said, \"Why am I always wrong?\" The squad moved on for a little longer. Kevin then spotted the target building. \"Dude, I see the building!\" he said. He went prone, pulled the hood to his ghillie over him, and laid down. he then aimed through an open window with his R700. \"Hey, I think I see the file we need! Who the fuck is that much of a dumbass to leave the top secret files on a table by an open window?\" Charlie replied, \"Russian Soldiers.\" The team moved to breach. Max pulled out his W1200, since an M14 is not very useful in CQC, and said, \"I like to keep this for close encounters.\" He was met with a 'Hooah' from Charlie. Max fired his shotgun at the door hinges, then kicked the door down, and they were met by russians with AKMs. The russians were gunned down quickly. they went upstairs. They proceeded towards the room with the intel, and Charlie was told to take point. He walked into the room, and got shot in the back by a russian soldier. he turned around and unleashed about thirty 7.62s from his M60 machine gun. He grabbed the intel. The squad made it to the roof, when they started taking MG fire from nearby houses. Luckily, Kevin made his way t othe building, and started to snipe from inside the building. But the building started taking RPG fire, and the thing was collapsing. The squad started making their way to the bottom story, then going outside. They barely made it. They started to make their way to the LZ, but then got surrounded. A russian captain called out to them, \"This is captain Vikharevski! Drop your weapons, and hand over the file, and we will not harm you!\" Charlie, having better hearing than anyone else, heard the Huey before anyone else. He picked up his LMG, and shot at few russians before a gunshot was heard, and the fatal bullet pierced his leg. From the captain's handgun. The captain saw the Huey chopper, and ran away as the chopper opened fire on the russian forces. The russian captain was not among the dead when the casualty report was done. But Charlie was. Present Day \"Hey, do you think the guy has anything to do with the war?\" asked Cooper. I answered, \"Maybe, but that is a longshot theory.\" Cooper pressed on. \"Not really, think about it! They guy killed a dude, and wanted to finish his work. so he writes a new plan, and says, 'Hey russia, i found a plan to invade the USA!'\" I asked, \"Why the hell would russia follow him? We did nothing wrong.\" \"Or did we?\" said Cooper. They may have turned something we did against us, like... \" Cooper stopped. \"What? Like What?!\" I said, raising my voice. \"He may have convinced Russia to be mad that we stole something from them, not to mention how we stopped their Nova 6 program and Soyuz 3 in the 1960s.\" Only then did i notice everyone was listening and watching us. Peter said, \"I think our final mission is clear.\" I took this as a good thing. I think Cooper took it that way as well. Marcus called out something. \"Hey, I found information that a Vikharevski that served in the russian army or whatever has a hideout!\" I asked, \"Where?\" He answered, \"Pack your bags, people, we are going to Brazil...\"Chapter thirteen: Behind Enemy Lines  1500 hours 30 miles south of Rio De Janerio Brazil  We landed a couple miles east of some ghost town in Brazil. I marvelled at how hot it was. We moved up, and found a gas station. There were enemy guards there. Due to us having silenced weapons, Only the men from the 54th fired, except for Smith, who had a specialized MP5. But what guns we had wouldn't matter. We were going to change into enemy uniform. And take their guns. We killed everyone there. I found an AKS-74u to use. Tailfin got one as well. Smith found a PP2000. A few snipers were there, so Fudge got an SV-98 Sniaperskaya. Pillsbury and Keebler didnt take anything, since they wouldn't be going in, but providing overwatch if we were compromised. Knotdead took an SKS, Hellraiser got an SVD Dragunov. I saw a few RPDs, Moby and Leo took them. Cooper took an RPK, most likely because he used one when we rescued him, and he knows how to use it. He refused to leave his Nambu behind. He also dropped his AT4 for an RPG. Alot of the riflemen got an AK-47, which i did not find surprising. Marcus took one with a GP-25, a russian grenade launcher. He picked up a Saiga shotgun as well. Cooper also took a Saiga. Glass got an AN-94. We found a bunch of Makarov PMs. Though everyone kept their pisols on them, we all grabbed a PM, in case we needed to show our sidearms to anyone. We all dressed quickly and hid our old clothes and the bodies, and cleaned up everything. 5 minutes later, it looks like nothing ever happened. We made our way into the town. It seemed empty at first, but we started noticing snipers on top of buildings. Then a Technical drove by. \"That looks like the one we hijacked.\" said Cooper. We made our way through the town, looking for a HQ looking place, where Vikharevski would be at. We heard silenced gunfire behind us. Pillsbury was doing us a favor, eliminating snipers so they wouldn't be a pain in the ass for us if we got caught. Considering the fact that Cooper was a POW at one point, Vikharevski might recognize him, and then we would be fucked. Or, he might recognize the looks from Cooper's dad. Either way, we would be screwed if we were busted. Maybe an incident like when I was on my first mission with Hellraiser, or When we were at the LZ, held at gunpoint by the BMDs. And who knows what other situations the marines ad been in? As i thought about all of this, Mike said this, \"Hey, I think i found the place where Vikharevski is hiding.\" We knocked on the door, and Vikharevski opened it. Luckily, I had learned a bit of russian, and he said this in russian: \"Hello, what are you doing here?\"Chapter fourteen: Force multiplier  We started talking in Russian. \"Come in, come in\" said Vikharevski. \"So, what can I do for you?\" I answered, \"We wanted to talk to you about how secret the base really is.\" \"Well, I am confident in our secrecy, We will hide whenever an aircraft is overhead, and we kill anyone who happens to wander onto our soil.\" Kill everyone, my ass. Why are we still alive? is what I thought. \"Well, what if a satellite got a picture?\" \"You ask too many questions.\" Then he spoke English. \"Also, since I know the names of every soldier here,\" as he turned to Cooper, \"Let me guess your name. Cooper Baker.\" Meanwhile, Vikharevski had drawn a PM and cocked it, keeping it out of sight from everyone, except for me. \"NO!\" I shouted in english, and raised my gun. It was too late. I flew back as a bullet tore through my clothes and my body. He then quickly shot Peter, then ran away. Mike, who was second in command, gave orders. \"Go after him! Cooper, Moby, Marston, stay back, help out the wounded!\" he screamed, then ran away. He stopped when Knotdead did not come with them. \"What the hell are you doing, KD?! We have to go, now!\" Knotdead said, \"Alex is hurt! I can't just leave my friend!\" Mike thought for a moment. \"Fine, you stay. Everyone else, Go! Go! GOOOOO!\" I heard the distinct sound of Pillsbury's M40 echoing through the valley. Other than that, i could not tell who was firing at a certain time, save for Cooper and Moby's RPK and PKM, as i saw the flashes. Marston was taking care of Peter. I tried to hang on to my life. Meanwhile... The team was taking fire. Despite the fact that they were crippling strucures and people with 40mm grenades, they were pinned down. \"Marston, come in!\" screamed Jake. \"What is it?!\" replied Cooper over radio. \"How is Marston doing on Peter and Alex?\" \"He is just starting to work on Alex, Peter is fixed up.\" Then, an RPG team took aim at the group. \"Shit, I have to go, Echo 2-7 out!\" The RPGs fired, taking out a building. The squad ran, and barely escaped the falling rubble as the building collapsed. Throgh all the smoke, the squad saw something in the sky. \"Awwwww, shit! Enemy hind, 2 o'clock, high!\" The hind, however, was starting to land. Glass shouted, \"Pillsbury, make us proud! We have a hind, probably here to pick up Vikharevski, kill it!\" Pillsbury shouted, \"How the fuck can i take down a chopper?\" Hudson grabbed the radio. \"THINK OF SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Pillsbury then steadied his aim. The chopper was about to land, and Vikharevski was nearing the LZ. Pillsbury fired. The bullet broke the glass and impacted the pilot in the eye, killing him. The pilot's body fell agains the controls, sending the chopper out of control. The chopper exploded. \"Fuck yeah.\" said Pillsbury. Alex's point of view Marston finished up bandaging me. I got up, and pulled out my USP, and with all my strength, broke the silencer off. I started to run, but stopped when my stomach started hurting like shit. I walked, on the lookout for Vikharevski or my squad. \"Wait!\" called out KD from behind me. He gave me my AK74u, and helped me carry it. I left it at first due to me being weak, since i was still recovering from a bullet in my abdomen. He pulled out his SKS and said, \"Let's go!\" We fought our way through the city, and we practically ran into Vikharevski. We all pulled out our sidearms at the same time, and Petronov had a PM a my face, while KD and I had a M1911 and USP at his face.Chapter fifteen: The Showdown  \"Drop the gun.\" I said to Vikharevski. \"And don't try anything, or you will get a face full of bullets.\" added KD. \"Alright,\" said Vikharevski, dropping his gun and raising his hands, \"Fine.\" We never saw it coming. He banged our heads together and took our guns, and pointed them at us. KD and I nodded to each other, then we kicked our guns out of his hands. We proceeded to fight him, hand to hand. We were winning at first, striking every blow on him. Until he caught my kick. He turned around and flipped me onto the ground. He punched KD in the face, then kicked me so hard, i think he broke a few of my ribs. I laid on the ground in pain, watching as KD fought Vikharevski by himself. They were equal opponents, dodging eachother's blows, and taking a few as well. But Vikharevski was getting stronger. He hit KD harder and harder, and KD was losing. But he kept on fighting Vikharevski. I could now see why they called him Knotdead. He was very wounded, yet he kept on fighting. I saw a guy coming up behind KD, ready to stab him, but the surprise was cut short when Marcus, running ahead of the squad, threw his gun away and knocked the russian's knife away, then drew his own knife, and grabbed the russian and stabbed him in the eye. He then went and helped me out, and called in a \"special present\", as he called it, for Vikharevski. The sender was Pillsbury. I heard a sniper shot echo through the valley, and Vikharevski fell. He was still alive, but wounded heavily, since there was a 7.62mm in his shoulder. He could not move his legs or his left arm. The rest of my squad arrived. Cooper said, \"How do you feel now, Vikharevski?\" Vikharevski replied, \"Don't you dare.\" Cooper then said, as he pulled out his Nambu and cocked it, \"Yes. You need to pay, for killing my dad. And this is how you are going to do it.\" said Cooper, as he aimed his Nambu. The whole squad circled around. Keebler was raising his binoculars, as I looked up at him. Pillsbury was also looking. But Vikharevski had one last trick up his sleeve. He grabbed KD's M1911, laying next to him, and fired at Cooper, three times. The Nambu landed near me. \"NO!\" I screamed, as I grabbed the pistol and fired on Vikharevski, killing him. Riley's chopper arrived, with Pillsbury and Keebler already on board. Pillsbury helped me walk to the chopper. KD was helped by Corey, and Cooper was carried by Marston and Keebler. We left the valley, and went to base. I started to black out from my injuries. The last I saw was KD looking at me. I looked back and showed a faint smile, then my eyelids shut.Epilogue Aftermath  I woke up in a hospital bed. I was wrapped in bandages all around my chest, where my broken ribs were. The doctor said I could get up and walk around, but slowly. I went to see KD, who was also up and walking around. \"Glad you're on your feet again, eh?\" he said. \"Yeah, thanks KD. You did good out there.\" I replied. \"Aww, shut up.\" he said, jokingly. He then told me, \"Cooper wants to see you.\" I asked, \"For what?\" He spilled the sad news. \"He isn't going to make it.\" I almost cussed out loud. \"WHAT? He is going to die?\" \"I'm afraid so. He wanted to see everyone one last time. He wants to see you next.\" We got closer to Cooper's room. \"He has seen about everyone. You're last, since you were hurt bad, and you were unconscious. Pillsbury is in there now.\" Pillsbury walked out. \"He is going to die soon, you may want to hurry up.\" He said. \"Okay.\" I walked in. Cooper was laying down on the bed. \"Cooper, are you okay?\" \"Not really\" Cooper said in a weak voice. \"I want you to have this with you.\" I said, giving him back his Nambu. \"No, I want- I want you to- to keep it. Vikharev-shit killed my dad, and i am going to die soon from what he did. You killed him with this, so I want you to have it.\" I replied. \"I will remember you by this.\" He said, \"Please, I want you to promise me something. If you ever get sent back into a fight, I want you to waste them.\" I replied, \"I promise, Cooper, I promise.\" He spoke his last words. \"Thank you, and also, tell my family, I love them.\" I wanted to ask Cooper one last thing, if he felt that his father's death was avenged. \"Cooper?\" He did not respond. I knew it had happened. Cooper had passed away. I walked out. \"He died.\" I said. \"Come on, Alex, let's go get something to eat.\" said KD. \"Sure.\" I walked down toward the mess hall, trying to clear my mind of what had just happened.Callofduty4  http://encyclopediadramatica.se/CoD_Fanfiction_WikiFallen Angels  This is an old story of mine, feel free to read it, my current story is Homeland Security, A better story using more of my moderate skills in writing, A personal message from BravoAlphaSix. John \"BravoAlphaSix\" Mishnick Small Bio: John\"The Infidel\" Mishnick is a Delta Force Operator and an ex- U.S. Army Ranger. He was born in 1990 and is 28 (2018). He has advanced training in First aid and Hand to Hand combat. He has a Bachelor degree in Science (As need for Delta Force training) and has 6 years of combat on his arms.Russian-Georgian Border 1520 HOURS  Alright Ghost, you and your soldiers move in and we'll come around back. Well cover your escape, and back out of the Georgian border.\". \"Roger that, uhh Mishnick. Let's do this.\" 'As the TF141 teams aproach the safehouse of a Russian ultranationalist Vladmir Makorov, 2ndLT.Mishnick and a TF141 fire team head around the rear of the safe house to support the assault. Soon enough, gunfire is heard in the distance. As the battle rages, nothing is headed towards the fire team's way. As the fire team stays silent, two Little Birds land behind the safehouse. \"Alright guys pick your target and shoot, I don't want any attention towards us.\" While the fire team rips up any ultranationalist aproaching the back door of the safehouse, the assault team heads toward the extraction point. \"Misnick this is Ghost, We have the DM and are heading for the exfil, start running!\". As 2nd LT. Mishnick hears the message, he sees a group of soldiers aproaching their position. Then, the mystery soldiers start spreading out and egaging their position. The whole fire team is ripped up except for 2nd LT.Mishnick and a British guy whos tag said Rider. \"Rider, follow me!\" The two men run for their lives as bullets rip the ground near their feet. At what seemed to be a reasonable distance, Rider stops with Mishnick folowing. \"Mishnick, we gotta get these guys off us... I'll take the right and you take the left,OK?\" \"Uhh, I think thats a bad idea\". As Rider looks back behind him, Two HumVees head toward their position at rapid speeds. Suddenly, BravoAlphaSix feels a sharp pain in his shoulder, before he knew it everything went black.Site Hotel Bravo  \"Bravo, we have possible intruders on the north exit...uh go check it out. Oxide out\". As John Mishnick got up from a nap he and a groups of Shadow Company soldiers dart through their quarters to the north exit. When they reach the exit, they find two dead soldiers. \"This is BravoAlphaSix, We have a problem...We found two soldiers KIA both are stab wounds, Over\". \"All units be advised this is Gold Eagle. The site has been compromised. I am executing directive one-one-six bravo. If you're still inside, your service will be honored. Shepherd out\". The group quickly runs back inside the compound, gathering extra ammuntion and other supplies before a familiar sound echos through the massive cave. \"Thats an Heli, It most be our pickup!\" Suddenly, The group is fired at wiping almost half of them out. On instinct BravoAlpha throws smoke grenades and grabs a fellow soldiers to the helicopter.Site Hotel Bravo Part two, First person view from here on.  I flinched as rounds hit one of the ballistic windows on helicopter. I didn't care about the gunfire from outside, but the heavily wounded soldier next to me. His blood was all over the floor, and his eyes were bloodshot. The helicopter medic was treating him ,but I don't think that helped. \"You all right, Bro?\"...\"Yeah, no hits.\" I replied as I shifted my view from my fallen comrade to the crew chief checking his pistol. His tag read Perry, but he looked like a Thomas. I asked him if he has a family and he replied \"Yeah, Got a wife and 2 kids back home\". From then on I knew I had to protect him somehow. We went smooth flying untill the pilots started talking and kept looking out looking at the heli's 10 'o clock. So I did the same thing and I was amazed to see one of our Pave Lows crashed near a river. I told the pilot to drop me off and he said he'll circle back around in 10 minutes to pick me back up. When I landed I ran straight for the Pave Low and saw a dead Shadow Comapny soldier, he was a pilot though. Then I walked to a body on the ground. It was General Shepard. The bastard that gave me a chance to live if I joined his Company for a while. I was smiling before I noticed his magnum on the ground, I picked it up and kept it as a souvenir, It had 2 load rounds too. I scaned the area and saw a two long imprints in the sand. Hell, They evacuated by heli. When the helicopter came back around, the medic threw the poor soldier's body off and we lifted off.Site Hotel Bravo Part 3  \"Hey, I found that guy....You alright guy? I woke up to see 2 guys in staring down at me. It was Perry and the helicopter medic. I asked what had happened and the medic told me this \"Someone fucked our helicopter\". I leaned to my right and saw our UH-60 Black Hawk engulfed in flame and smoke. I got up with a strain in my back and sat up against a tree, reaching for my canteen. I took a good gulp, stood up and went to the Heli. I saw the pilots dead, still in their seats...Their bodies lifeless. We moved out into a bushy area near our crash site. We waited near the end of the bush for about 2 hours, then we saw a convoy. Humvess, Strykers, and an Abrahams tanks. We moved out and they picked us up. They were U.S. Army Rangers, and they took us back to Fire Base Phoenix. Then Perry and I were sent back to the States while the Medic \"help out\" for a while.Operation Cold Thunder, Russia  I held my ACR tightly when I ran into a dead body. It was a Man with the same outfit I wore 4 months ago. He was in Shadow Company, Poor guy must of been shot up and the frozen from the cold Russian winter. I was on a solo op to recon a possible supply route for the Russian Spetsnaz. There were reports they were spotted in Afghanistan, firing artillery towards a NATO base. I just hope this won't get ugly. I didn't dare to check the guy because 4 months is enough time to set a \"booby\" trap. So I continued on through the woods. I find my designated recon area and made my little outpost, no one should spot me unless they were 5 feet in front of it. I waited 2 days for anything, but I got nothing. But during one night, There was a rustle in the bushes near me. I didn't want to ,but I checked...I saw a outfit I remembered. It was a TF141 soldier... He was huddling his M4, his helmet looked worned. I tapped his helmet and he looked up. It was Rider...Operation Cold Thunder Part 2  I took his hand and helped him over the bush. I was amazed how he was still alive. I took him over to my recon post and we started talking. \" What the hell happened Rider?\" I asked. He was silent for a minute. \"Long story short, You got shot, I kept running, I went hiding. There\". I looked at the road and back at him. He looked like an ass. His jacket was all torn, His boot looked unwearable, and his M4 was half frozen. I told him a fake story about my real op there, Can't trust anyone can I. I got back to my recon mission and saw nothing. \"Hey, You got some food? I've hadn't had a bite since...maybe 4 days ago.\". I gave him an MRE from my pack, He didn't devour it though, He was slow and steady...Like what soldiers should be. That night a Hind passed by, I got out my laptop and put \"Possible patrols\" onto my documents. Rider slept like a mouse, waking up when the wind brushed the leaves. The next day I got my money. I saw a armed convoy, 4 trucks, 2 APCs, and 2 jeeps. They were a good 20 clicks away so I had time. I contacted HQ and they said something that made me spit my coffee out. \"Attack the convoy, Do not let them leave.\" I told Rider and he just groaned and picked up his M4, I got my pack assemble my anti-tanks weapons. We both packed up and head towards the fields near the road. There was no cover ,but it concealed us, only thing we needed. We set up our own 2 spots and waited. We both knew the plan. Take out the lead and rear APCs and demolish them from side to side ending at the middle. About 30 mikes passed, Finally we heard the metal clicking sound and engines moaning in the distance. I got my ATM launcher and readied it. When the convoy got into view, We opened up. Rider and I shot our rockets at the same time, quickly dropping them for or Assault Rifle. I got my ACR and opened up tearing up the jeeps and trucks. In about 1 minutes we wiped them out and we ran back towards the area we came from , but the Russians had another plan. The Hind we saw yesterday came back, Machine guns roaring.Operation Cold Thunder Part 3  The hind came in fast with its cannon, It completely missed us ,but we didn't take our chances. We ran about 100 yards untill the hind had enough distance to come back. This time it fired its rocket pads. I got some shrapnel in my lefy arm , but that didn't do anything. We got into the thick of the woods. The hind fired randomly, hitting the ground near us or completely off target. When we got to a ditch, I aimed and fired at the cockpit, I got the gunner...His blood was all over the windows, but the Pilot still fired. This time Rider got into a steady aim and fired at the pilot, killing him. Quickly he moved his aim and emptied half his clip into the engine. We covered or vitals and waited for the crash. I opened my eye and saw the Hind heading straight for us. I grabbed Rider and ran, He catched on quickly. We got on the other side of the hill, sliding down half the time when we heard the crash. A mushroom cloud appearded above the crash. We gave each other a pat on the back and ran towards the Kazakhstan border. We got a good distance when a Little Bird swooped out, picked us up and returned the way it came from. Damn, I love technology.Operation Sweeping Eagle  Well I got my team today. I now command Alex Rider, The same guy I knew for months, Gunnery SGT. J. Jackson, Our long range expert, SGT. B. Shockton, Our Machine Gunner, and SGT. C. Johnson, Our Rifleman. We had our first operation, It was to scan and patrol the Tora Bora Mountains. It was supposed to be clear years ago ,but There have been too many sighting of activity. We started packing up onto our Humvee. It was heavily modified with M60E4 LMGs on the front and back left passenger seats. Our turret was a armored pod-thingy, We had up and down windows so we can shoot out, and tires that can still run when deflated.We had Johnson driving, Shockton on the turret, Rider on the bottom left passenger seat and Johnson on the right, I was riding shotgun. We headed out, We were silent untill Johnson asked \"Why do we have to drive, Can we land with a Heli?\" \" We don't want the guys to piss their pants and stink up he interoagtion room.\", I replied. Everybody laughed, but that was short lasted. An RPG ripped through the hot air and landed near our humvee. \"RETURN FIRE! FIND THOSE FLASHES AND SHOOT BACK! I yelled as Shockton started ripping up the hill where the trail came from. \"DON'T TALK,JUST SHOOT!\" I yelled as I started firing the M60 at a group of three clay houses where muzzle flash erupted from. Johnson reversed the Humvee so Jackson can take aim, Bang, Bang, Jackson got a kill as I looked over my shoulder to see blood splatter against the clay walls. Rider started ripping up the windows, almost breaking the fragile walls. We kept firing untill we couldn't see the huts. I radioed HQ and told them we were taking another route. HQ replied, \"Continue on, BravoAlpha.\". Johnson looked at the GPS and took a 5 mile road to a long curve going about 10 away from the place we were ambushed. I looked at everybody and they were still alert, Johnson, Jackson, and Rider all nodded at me while I tapped on Shockton's leg. He put his hand down and gave me a thumbs up.Operation Sweeping Eagle Part 2  My team and I got to our first recon area and...found nothing. A few cartidges here and there ,but they were 5.56x45 rounds. Daylight was fading so we got back to our Humvee and unloaded our gear. We had those...large civilian crackers, cheese substitute, and meat substitue. We didn't eat long though...It tasted like crap. We got into out Humvee and moved it to a small are where it was very concealed. So we got our sleeping kits and settled around there. Most of us slept outside while Jackson slept in the back of the Humvee and Johnson slept on the hood. We fell asleep fast with the silent night. A few goats and cows groaning, but it was silent. I slowly drifted off. I soon woke up to a load sound, something falling. I leaned to my left and saw Johnson on the ground. He got up, scratched his back, and got back on. I laughed and said \"Nice one, Johnson\"...He shrugged back. I soon woke up with the dark morning light in my face, I got up and checked my watch. 7 AM. I got everybody up and we loaded up. We all had some boiled water and some leftover crackers. I had a wierd feeling so I took the my M60 off its mount on the Humvee and took it along. Rider started at me, Thought, and brought his too. We started hiking towards our second recon area. We were at the top of a mountain, setting up a small post for recon. I stared through my binos for a while untill, in an area a aerial machine can't see, a small opening with a few heavly armed guards. I told the other and we kept our eye on it. I radioed HQ and they gave us a go, \"When ready, Destroy target BravoAlpha\". So we looked for anything unusual. First, the guards weren't smokers, Second, There was a shift of 3 groups of guards, Third, every hour a man came out and gave them water or gum. So we kept that in mind. When the daylight went, We got our NVGs and headed towards the position. We had a almost unbreakable plan... Shockton, Rider, And I will come in with our LMGs while Johnson cover us with his M4CQBR. Jackson stayed at our post covering all of us. We had the advantage of technology and surprise. Shock and Awe, baby. We started moving, not making a single sound. We stopped when we got close enought to the cave and spread out. I signaled everyone and we started the attack. Jackson quickly took out the guards while we rushed in. I started firing, Followed by Shockton, Then Rider. We emptied our belts and Rider and I backed out while Johnson came in, By then Shockton had a fresh Mag. They fired and fired, reloaded and reloaded. They fired about 390 rounds each. They signaled Rider and I to come back, I dropped my M60 by Jackson and strapped my ACR off my back. I pulled the charging handle back and went in. I held my MWG grip tightly. I threw a flare and the 4 of us saw a sight. A bloody, lots of pink flesh, and your inside organs, sight. There was 33 soldiers in there, Armed to the teeth with G36Cs, M249 LMGs, Automatic Assualt-12s, AK-47s, You name it. I picked a clean AA-12 out of it's nice hard plastic and foam case and gave it to Johnson. \"You can shoot and drive now\" I joked. He smiled and strapped it to his back. We took photos and videos. All the evindence crap. We all patted each other and headed back to the Humvee and then back to base. What a frickin day.Operation Light The Match  I woke up back up inside a cozy UH-60 Black Hawk. I was lying down on the back row. A guy code name \"Lurker\" sat in front of me. I could only see his eyes closed...He was sleeping. I got up and check my gear. A Interceptor Body armour vest, A usual Delta Force helmet, That looks like a skateboard helmet ,but still badass, My trusty black finish ACR that has a suppressor and a 553 Holographic sight, My good 'ol M1911, and 3 flash grenades. I got everything on and sat down again. I took out my mirror and looked at myself. I was wearing a custom black BDU, It's made of nylon cotton fabric or something. My armour vest was black too. My bavalanca was nice and fit. I saw my black eyes...It wasn't shiny at all. I put on my Helmet and just sat there. I slowly closed my eyes...\"ETA 5 minutes!\" I opened my eyes and saw the \"Lurker\" guy. He was getting up and putting on his armour suit. He picked up his MG3, something I have never seen. He attached a suppressor and a 553 Holographic sight. \"So Lurker, Where the hell do you work for?\" I asked. \"Spec Ops, Tight security stuff.\". \"Like Delta Force?\" I replied, I knew he didn't know I was Delta Force, We're not supposed to have any patches. \"No, It's...some project.\" He said wierdly. \"Oh, Okay\". We punched our knuckles together and got to the door. I looked over my shoulder and saw the pilot look at his watch. \"GO GO GO!\" He yelled as we hollered our asses out. We ran until we got to a good position for any resistance. \"Alright Lurker, We have 2 hours to reach our target, A freelance mercanary camp's fuel depot and while we're at it some intel, and we have about 3 hours to get our asses back. You ready?\" I explained. \"Hell yeah.\" He said confidently. We moved up until a small road, hidden by the jungle's too damn tall trees. There was a crack in the trees where a little bit of the moon light came through. I took of my NVGs and looked at my GPS. We were about 1 mile from the base. \"One click, Lurker, One click.\". He nodded and we moved across the road. We quickly turn around after we crossed the road to look for anything. Then, out of the corner of my NVGs I saw white light. I tapped Lurker and pointed at small patrol. We both got into a prone position, under the dense hip-height vegetation. The patrol passed, We got back up and headed our way. We reached the base's left wall. \"Ok, Bravo you got the C4?\" He said as a search light passed over us. \"Hell yeah baby, 20 pounds.\" I whispered. He tapped my helmet and we made our way around the base to a duct behind the Fuel Depot. \"I got you covered, Go now.\" I said as Lurker finished unscrewing it open. He nodded and slide through like a snake. I scanned the area around and quickly slid through. I got inside and put the hatch back loosely, for an easy escape. I turned around again and saw Lurker against a wall. He peered his head and quickly back. He looked at me. \"Most of the base is sleeping, Just watch those towers.\" Lurker said as he pulled out his pistol, strapping his MG3 on his back. He slowly walked out into the open. I pulled the charging handle of my ACR and followed him. I soon got in front and headed towards the main building, strangely close to the Fuel Depot. I opened the door quietly as Lurker followed. We got to the \"Head's Office\" and took all the files from a cabinet marked \"Operations\". We slowly headed out of the office when a randome soldier came toward us. He got in a distance of atleast ten feet and saw us. I quickly got him in the neck and pulled him outside. We carried him back to the small confined area we started from. We left his body there, Then we head back out and planted all 20 pounds in various nucks and crannies. We slid back through the duct. We double-times it to the area we were dropped off. We waited nearly an hour untill a Little Bird came. I tapped Lurker's back and he moved to the helicopter. He got on and tapped the heli. I quickly move to the Bird and got on. Suddenly, I spotted silhouettes in the tree line. They opened fire. I yelled at the pilots as Lurker started shooting back. We quickly lifted off, still firing our guns untill a rough 500 yards. Damn, That was close.Operation Catch The Tiger  My team and I were working on our Humvee. \"So what the hell happened to Rider?\" Jackson asked. \"He went back to his Op, He'll be back. Don't worry.\" I replied. Jackson shrugged and went back to cleaning his seat. Shockton got under the Humvee to check some pipes. \"So are we one man down? Or are we gonna have a FNG.\" He said. \"Uhh...Jacksons Bro is our FNG.\" I said still cleaning my M60E4. Jackson stood up. \"Justin!?\" He yelled. \"Yeah, Our team medic. He'll be right woth you Jackson.\" I said. I looked up and saw him doing like a anime \"Yes!\". We finished up and started packing up for our op. \"So Guys, We will be linking up with another Delta team. They're all Snipers . We are going to find and military arrest a terrorist by the alias of \"Tiger.\" I explained. \"Sounds like a Dumb ass to me.\" Johnson mumbled to himself. I smiled and continued on. \"We will be going in, while Team Two covers us. It will be in broad daylight, So we're more exposed, But the damn bastards sleep in the day, Awake at night. Look here at the map. X marks the doors, O marks where the guys inside regulary are. Got It?\" \"Yes, Sir\" They all said. We hustled up and started off. We reached the outskirts if the villa. \"Team Two, You there?\" I said on the comm. \"Friendlies, at your 2 'o clock.\" They replied. I looked to my right and saw 2 snipers come out of the tree line. \"The names Lt. Cross, He Pvt. Wapner\". I looked at them both, Wierd looking tree people...Na. We planned our routes and they gave us patrol routes for the guards. We finished and started our own ways, They rushed back to the tree line while we continued up the road on foot. We got near the house, We settled behind the a wall. I looked over the wall...Nothing. I nodded at my team and they nodded back. Shockton was with me, While Jackson and Johnson stayed right behind us. We agreed and Shockton and I climbed the wall. Suddenly a RPG ripped through the air. Oh no...I was blasted away from the explosion. Shockton got pushed back into the wall. Everything was dizzy...I stumbled up and ran to Shockton. Johnson and Jackson were already coverung us over the wall. I looked back and saw muzzle flashes every where from the windows. The dirt around me was jumping up like crazy. I grabbed Shockton and pushed him over the wall where Johnson catched him. I turned back and started firing. I cover the top windows, left and right. \"MISHNICK!!!!\" Jackson yelled. I jumped and caught his hand, helping me back over the wall. I sat down and catched my breath, Hearing the first distinc sound of an M200 round rip through the air. I brought up my radio.\" This is BravoAlphaSix, We are compromised, Repeat we are compromised! They were waiting for us, Requesting an air strike over!\" I said. \"This is OverLord, Get your team Oscar Mike out of the area, We have a J-Missiles launched and heading towards your postion.\"\"Everyone Oscar Mike! Get back to the Humvee! Team Two, Get your asses out of here!\" I yelled as stood up. We got back to the Humvee and settled in, I tapped on Johnson and he stomped on the pedal. We roared down the dirt road pursued by 4 techincals. \"Shockton! On our six!\" Jackson yelled as he got his M14 ready. Johnson gave me his AA-12 He strapped in the large space between the board and his seat. He threw a two Drum mags at my lap while I got my M1911 ready. Shockton started firing his M249 LMG hitting the first two technicals. I grabbed my grenade and called Jackson's name. I tossed him the grenaded and he poked his head out the window. He fired his M1911 and threw the cooking grenade. I got my mounted M60E4 and out it on the floor. I poked my head out and emptied the AA-12's drum, Hitting the combatants on the bay of the truck. Johnson peeked his M4CQBR out the window and emptied the mag. I grabbed it and reloaded it for him. Then finally saw the 6 missile make their mark. Smoke and flames rising high in the air. I looked at the Driver's mirror and saw a Technical's engine engulf in flames, falling backwards crashing into one the other techinicals. I tossed the M4CQBR back and reloaded the AA-12. I emptied the drum, Not making my hits,But definately discouraging some of the machine gun rounds firing at us. I out the AA-12 back and grabbed the M60. I put it back on its mount and turned it back. I put my hand around the grip, It felt weird since Im a right hand shooter, But hey what the the hell. I sqeezed the trigger for a brief moment and continued on, Firing small, but deadly bursts, I turned my head around and saw Jackson, Reloading his SCAR-H. Casings falling down from Shockton's turret. I continued firing again, Hitting the driver of the third techinical, Stopping abrubtly and flipping over. The last Technical had a surprise. A armored soldier stood up and aimed an RPG at us, at the worst time. Shockton's LMG had jammed, Jackson had to switch to his M1911 and my M60E4 was over heating. I looked at Johnson and he nodded, But at what. He turned the Humvee 90 degrees and quickly got out of the way. The Technical tried to turn, But crashed into a stone wall. We stopped and got out. \"FREEZE\" Shockton and Johnson yelled. We held our guns tightly at the vehicle. A man with a light kevlor vest came out. He signaled that everyone else was dead. I motioned for Johnson to check. I grabbed the man by his collar and brought him near the road. I threw him down and taunted him. \"You bastards made the worsst mistake of your miserable lives.\" He pissed his pants. I grabbed my M1911 and executed him. Blood got all over the place. Even inside my damn Colt. I came back and sat down, leaning against the Humvee. What the hell did I just do. I turned as Johnson clipped the whole interior of the car. He gave me a thumbs up after that. We got back on out Humvee and drove on. Two quads race near us. I looked at the bikes and saw our sniper team. Cross giving me a thumbs up. We returned to base. Talk about the Op, We did not. We settled back into out tent and slept.Justin Jackson  I was heading towards the airport, Where I WAS going to be transfered to a Delta team in Afghanistan. My brother was in that team. I wanted to go so bad. I had advanced medical training back in the states. Thought it can get me a Medal of Honor someday, But I really signed up for that for myself. I didn't want to die. We were in a small but high profile convoy. 3 Humvees and 2 Strykers. We were happily driving along until something blew up near the lead stryker. \"JACKSON!!!\" Someone yelled. I rushed out of my Humvee and ran to the front, Bullets land near my feet. I saw a man ripped up by shrapnel. The Lieutenant left and started barking into the radio. I started to treat the man, Withing seconds my hand were covered in blood. I tried to bandage him, But his organs were out...chilling on the hot, dirty, Iraqi road. I did everything I can, But his blood, organs, everything was just coming out. I checked his body again and saw that he was almost cut in half. Damn it...I will never forget those sonofabitches.Casey Kennedy  \"Eight years ago, I was calmy walking my Siberian Husky, Martha like I always do. We turned to 6th and Main when gunfire erupted from the the local law firm. I grabbed Martha and took cover around the corner. A police cruiser came by, I quickly told the officer and put Martha in the back. The officer crept along the side towards the law firm. He was quickly killed by a hail of machine gun fire. I barked into the cruiser's radio. A few minutes later, Half the Police force seemed to come...They were all killed. The shooters were armed to the teeth, Rockets buzzed everywhere. I took Marth and ran...I felled down with a bad pain in my right leg...A bastard had shot me. He picked me up and dragged me. But I heard two shots...The bastard shot Martha. I started crying, My neck hurting from the man's grip. I thought everything had ended when a...Man jumped down from a roof. He was somewhat...Military looking. He got the surprise and broke the bastard's neck. He helped me over to the corner, Suddenly pushing me as gunfire hit him. He got back up and returned fire..The rounds that hit him...Just dropped off. He gave me a Colt M1911...I recognized it from my dad's 1911. The man finished his clip and reloaded. Walking towards the firm. I peered the corner and saw him enter the office. It blew up...I started crying. Until a hand gently touched my arm...It was that man. He was covered in dust, But he wasn't hurt. He helped me up and carried me to the Cruiser. He went back and got Martha...Her eyes still open. I saw a patch on his vest which I investigated later. It was a patch from the U.S. Delta Force. I got my Bachelor's degree in Science and joined the army. I was soon transfered to Delta Force, Which was Six years after the incident. I later found out the man's name... (Thanks to my...Friend for the POV)Operation Point Guard  \"O.K. Boys, We got a Op leading the 75th Ranger Regiment and then leading them out. We raiding an enemy underground base...The ones they use for recon and ambushes. We'll have an FNG, SSGT. Kennedy. Jackson, Your brother Jackson...Can't make it. I guess his plane delayed\" I explained.\"We will spearhead the assualt, Clearing up any patrols and, or guards. We will have medium/standard equipment ,But more ammunition for the Rangers. Got It?\" \"Yes Sir!\" The boys said with the high of Kennedy. We loaded up and got onto some Quads. We had four, Kennedy with me since she had our radio.I grabbed an M240 before we head out. We started our engines and raced through the fields.\"This is 2-5, BravoAlphaSix clear the way. Our Ranger boys will do the rest!\" A confident Ranger said in the com. We reached the tree line and headed on foot. We got at least 300 meters from the \"base\". We crept along hugging any cover we can find. I was point. I got to a good visual position...There was no activity. I signaled for everyone to get down on their bellies. We crawled for a distance. I got back up and looked. I signaled for everyone to get up and find some cover. I walked along...Everyone following me. Suddenly machine fire cracked through the silent forest and ripped up everything around us. \"RETURN FIRE, RETURN FIRE, KENNEDY GET OVER HERE!\" I screamed. I turned around and saw Kennedy crawling very carefully, Not even disturbed by the gunfire. Shockton opened up with his M249 while Jackson picked targets. But I couldn't see Johnson. Kennedy reach me and tossed my the a comm device. She started firing her M4 like is was nothing. \"This is BravoAlphaSix, We are compromise, Where the hell are you guys?\" I said. \"Oh you'll see.\" The same Ranger replied. I looked back and saw 3 Humvees dodging the trees, Coming towards us. I turned around and opened up the 240 I brought. I concentraed my fire on a group of bunkers. I turned back just in time to see the Humvees stop, And some Rangers stumbled out, Hitting the soft grass as soon as they left the safety of their Humvees, They returned fir in short bursts and crawled towards us. We had the advantage of Firepower now. I ordered the Rangers to get ready, I was going to charge closer. \"3,2,1, SUPPRESIVE FIRE!\" I yelled as I stood up and ran towards the neares bunker. I got hit 4 times in the chest, But that did nothing than speeding me up. I slid towards one of the bunkers. I looked up ans saw an AK-74 pointed at me. I rolled and the shooter missed his blind-fire burst. I grabbed two M67s and threw them in, Decimating everyone inside. I then blind fired my 240 into the bunker, Bullets bouncing off the renforced concrete. I looked back and saw Johnson scrambling towards me. He jumped into the bunker and signaled me to come in.Operation Point Guard Part 2  I entered the bunker. At least 8 people were in here when I threw the grenades. Most of them were dismembered, At least having lost 2 limbs. I signaled for the rest of my team to come. Heavy gunfire erupted from the Rangers, I saw that a few had taken out spare machine guns and rockets. \"This is 2-5, We have destroyed or at least stopped most of the bunkers, We sweep in from the other side, Out!\" A Ranger said. I gave him a thumbs up and looked back, Disgusted by the intestines all over the ammo crates. I saw as Shockton walked confidently, Firing his 249 as he approached me. Jackson quickly followed, Not hesitating to shoot. Kennedy rushed out of the tree line. I heard a flash, then red splash along with smoke. Shit, She was hit in the leg. I rushed out and slid to here, Firing my 1911 at a bunker. I grabbed her vest and pulled her onto my back. Johnson scrambled out followed by Shockton who huddled the corner, Firing at the same bunker. Johnson took off Kennedy's radio while I got up and started for the bunker. I just looked at the bunker, Staring as is if it was a pile of First aid.Chris Johnson's POV  Mishnick steadly made his way to the bunker with Kennedy on his back. I fired my M4CQBR and ran toward Mishnick. I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. Then a reflection. I jumped and got the bullet, No even Wearing me down. I got back up and fired back. A body soon fell afterwards. I got back to the bunker. Mishnick had laid Casey down and started treating her leg. He tapped my helmet with his bloody hand. I turned back and he tossed my his gloves, the tips covered dirt and blood. Damn...Bob Shockton's POV  I continued spraying my M249 LMG at the bunker. I barely noticed ,but a picture of the infamous Mohammed \"The Red Hawk\" Asad. I leaned out and spray the ugly bastard's face, Ripping the eyes off. I leaned back out and the bunker flashed, Bullets hitting my vest. I fell down and got right back up and returned fire. I got my nickel-plated M1911 and ran for it, Chris providing cover-fire. \"Are you fucking crazy!\" He yelled over the 10+ yards I had ran. I looked up and threw two grenades, Landing in the bunker...But when it exploded, It was big. \"Shit, Shit,Shit,\"I said. \"Kennedy, Your leg feel ok? No sharp pain?\". \"No...\" She anwsered. I finished bandaging her leg and left her alone. I peered around the corner, just fast enough to see Shockton throw a few grenades...But the blast was huge. I saw a metal rod fly up into the air, coming down near Shockton. \"SHOCKTON! GET OUT OF THE WAY!\" I screamed. I got close enough to push him away...The rod landed and bounced off, Impaling the bunker I was at. We both got up. \"Holy crap, Man.\" He said with his breath. \"Any Causalties!?\" I yelled back at Johnson. He looked in the bunker. \"No! No causualties sir!\" He responded. We looked back up and saw the Rangers looking down on us. \"You OK?\" Some Ranger said. \"Yeah! What the hell happened!?\" Shockton questioned. \"I guess we should of called you before we planted our C4...\" Another Ranger replied. \"Damn you guys, It's standard protocol. Just forget it!\" I replied. We made our way back to the tree line. \"Mission accomplished?\" Jackson said. \"Hell yeah.\" Casey replied. The Rangers backed out with their Humvees, We walked back to our quads.Operation Get the Hell out of there!  I woke up in a cell...A dirty, moldy, smelly, Cell. I looked in every direction, No damn exit except for the bars on my right. But that was a door...Shit. \"Open da doors\" I heard. The bar door opened and two small guys with Ak-74s approached me. They dragged me out and put me in a interogation room. With lots of \"toys\". \"What were you doing here? WHAT!\" THe bearded man screamed at me. \"Do you think you'll get anything from me? I wasn't even wearing my custom equipment. All you'll get is standard crap and wasting your time.\" I replied cofidently. HE punched me...Big mistake. \"We have your female. We can get something from her.\" He said. I looked to my right and there was Kennedy. Strapped to a chair like a fricking dog. \"You touch her, I kill all of you. I send your bodies to your families too\" I replied. A guard grabbed her by the arm...Second Mistake...Big Mistake. The same guy grabbed her hip, Third big mistake. I got my hands out and put them on my lap. The Man tried to get me with his pistol. Fourth Mistake. I quickly dodged and twisted his arm, Discouraged his grip from his pistol, Breaking his finger. And I topped that off with dirty, bloody, knife to the eye. I ran and crashed through the window, Kicking the perverted bastard down, I emptied half the magazine and untied Casey. \"Shut up and move.\" I whispered. We got back out the way I crashed in and checked the all cells and rooms on that floor. Bastards got a lucky catch...But they just lost it. When we regrouped I was armoured up, An AK-47 in my grip. I was surprised when I saw Kennedy. Damn she was sexy. She her vest and BDUs. A pistol strapped to her hip, With her trusty M4.\"What?\" She questioned. \"Nothing.\" I replied. We started up a flight of stairs, Checking every corner. We got near the top. Two guards were coming down. They saw us. I grabbed one guard and threw him over, Breaking his neck. I shot him 3 times, You got to make sure. I turned around to see the other guard's AK fly and hit the wall. Kennedy round house kicked him 3 times. Damn... I grabbed the guy and did the same thing, Drop him. Another 3 rounds, Another dead guard. We got up the stairs and entered a hallway. Guards on both sides. I pushed Casey down on the floor...The guards shot each other. Stupid assholes. We got outside and ran for it. We shot at anything that shot at us. We reached a heavy bush. Vegetation everywhere. We just ran North, Towards friendly border. We reached a river. High rapids. Damn it, Desperate situations, call for desperate measures. I grabbed Casey and threw here the whole 10 feet. She sticked the landing. \"Thanks, What about you, Sir?\" She said. \"Lets see.\" I replied. I ran back about 10 yards and sprinted, Jumping thr river...Barely. My boots were soaked. \"Nice try\" She said. We headed off. We thought we were OK, Untill a bastard machines came. Damn, Hinds...Operation Get the Hell out of there Part 2  3 Hinds searched the vegetation with searchlights. \"Casey, I have an idea\" I whispered two her. I crawled away and got up. \"I Surrender god damnit!\" I yelled. The search lights fixed on me. One Hind came down and 2 soldiers came at me. They \"dragged\" me along and we got on the heli. I quickly grabbed my pistol and shot the 2 guards, and the pilots. Through the seats. I then reached over the heavy machine gun mounted on the door. I moved the hunk along and aimed at Hind #2. I fired a burst, The rounds hit the pilots, I fired a second burst, This time blowing it out of the sky. I dismounted the gun and brought it to the other side. I aimed at Heli #3. I got off at 4 bursts. Hitting the side and decimationg the crew, But it was still up. I aimed again, This time I was too late. A missile quickly made it to the Hind I was in. It hit pretty close and the Heli flipped. I was squished between two rotors. I looked around for Kennedy, No sight. The Heli made its way around, Spot light on me. They opened up with their LMGs and missed...I grabbed an AK-74 and fired it at the rocket pods. BOOM! The Hind squished between the 4 massive explosion of rocket pods. I stayed there for a while. I tried to sqeeze my way out, but I got nothing. Footsteps...I raised the AK and got someone in my sights. A female. Damn, Casey. \"Not so good, huh?\" She said. She lift one rotor and I quickly somewhat jumped out. I stood up and got the rotor so she can back out. I let go and let gravity do its work. The funny thing...A Humvee was waiting for us. We were 2 miles from the border. \"Hey, You alright?!\" A familiar voice yelled. I got close to the Humvee and noticed a good 'ol face. It was Rider. \"Sonofabitch, He's back.\" I said with a grin. This time, He looked clean and not like crap back in Russia. \"What the hell happened to you?\" I asked. \"Hey, Got back to the states, Got a new unit, And yeah...Re-location crap.\" He replied. We got into the Humvee. It was stripped down for faster movement, But really? \"So you going back to Delta?\"I said. \"We got Casey here and...No one else. Jackson's brother can't make it. Damn terrorists.\". He laughed. We made it across the border, Welcomed by well equiped marines. We drove back to HQ, We mumbled along, Casey...Not taking any part of it. \"We got an Op securing a city tommorow, Get you ass to sleep!\" Rider said as we stumbled off the Humvee. \"I need chow. You wanna come with me?\" I anwsered back. He rubbed his hand over his belly. Same 'ol Rider.Operation Secure the Gold  The convoy started moving. John Mishnick opened his canteen and took a sip. \"You guys ready?\" The pilot yelled over the \"thud\" of the rotors. I was the only Delta guy in the Heli. The rest were snipers and Marines. \"We're going in as support, We'll have 3 other Black Hawks with us and and an Osprey way above for recon!\" The pilot explained. We stopped hovering and started moving, We quickly catched up. The convoy was a small bulk of a Armoured Divison. 4 Strikers, 2 Bradleys, And 4 Humvees, Another 2 for the Delta. We flew low and slow, We had to stay with the convoy. We were close enough that I gave Johnson, My squad's CQB expert and driver a thumbs up. He called the rest of my team in the Humvee and they all gave me a thumbs up. Friendly bastards. We got into view of the city. It was a large city, Full of poverty and some rich guys like back in Mogadisu. Damn, I was three when that happened. We were really there to see if \"The Red Hawk\" Or Mohammed Asad was there...And to see if there really was a black market commerence in the area. There was 2 Black Hawks on either side of the convoy, Left or right. I was left so we spanned left of the city, While climbing up to a point where we can see the convoy. 2 Miles... The pilot slowly drifted the Heli left, The marines were ready to fire back. Bad thing was that we didn't have a M134 minigun or something like that. We just had .50 BMG on the sides. We slowly climbed up, Drifting away from the convoy. We were above the city, The people scurried around like ants. We followed the Convoy in. \"This is the lead Bradley, Split the convoy, We are heading towards the market, The other half come around to the target area!\" A thick and deep voice said. We followed the second part of the convoy, Sadly, My squad was in the first. \"Alright boys, Get ready, Reports of skinnies on the balconys.\" The pilot said. I was crouching behind the left door, Over looking the convoy. I tapped the gunner's shoulder. \"Tangos, That balcony, Next to the red building!\" I yelled. The gunner quickly fired at the tangos. The catridges fell onto the Black Hawk's floor and bounced off...Hopefully not hitting anyone. \"Nice hit!\" I complimented. \"Keep your eyes out...Shit! Tango, RPG, Next to that market! The gunner couldn't spot, So I pushed him aside and took the .50's grip. I fired hitting the skinny, his arm came off and punk mush was everywhere. \"Sorry, We could of taken that!\" I explained. He nodded and got back on the BMG. I Barely thought of the rest of the guys, I turned back and patted one of the snipers. He looked back at me and grinned. \"This is Oxide, Disciple watch out for RPGs, We just had an encounter.\" The pilot said. We came in low and circled the target area. The convoy stopped and a Delta aquad rushed into the building. Followed by a 2 squads of Rangers and Marines. \"Watch those building, These are skinnies not bulky robots!\" I explained. \"Remember the Battle of Mogadishu, Two Black Hawks went down.\". A few marines gave me thumbs up while a sniper gave a nod. About a minute later, The Delta squad came out along with the Rangers and Marines. \"This is Avatar One, We cleared the building while the Rangers and Marines secured a perimeter, No one escaped, But no damn target\" A late 20s, early 30s Delta Force soldier said, He was pissed. The convoy headed out, As we followed. Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, An RPG rose from the flat and dirty buildings and impact right on Disciple's Tail. \"This is Disciple, We are going down, Repeat we are going down! Tail is hit, No control!\" Disciple's pilot yelled. Shortlt after the Helicopter crashed, Hitting one building and collapsing another.\"Get the Heli moving! Reach the Crash site!\" I yelled. \"This is BravoAlphaSix, Our Heli is going for the crash site!\". We flew low and fast, Reaching the crash site in a blink of an eye. The marines readied there weapons, The snipers strapped in and got prone on the Heli's floor. The sound of an RPG, Ripped through the air. \"Where the hell is it!\" A sniper yelled. KABOOM! The RPG hit the belly of the Black Hawk, Tumbling me out, I was knocked out cold.Operation Secure the Gold Part 2  I opened my eyes, Blue sky in my face, Troubled by a thick and black smoke trail. I got up and looked for the smoke. South-East. I started running, Jumping over debris and junk, Shooting when shot at. I quickly rushed down the two blocks and turned right. A skinny stood, AKM in his grip. He raised his rifle to shoot, I quickly backed out and huddled the corner. I took out my M1911 and jumped the space. I shot him in the neck, Landing on the other side. Bastard was too slow. I got back up and went down the alley way. I ran and made it to the crash site. The Black Hawk was in good shape, But tail gone. I rushed to the Black Hawk for any survivors. The pilots were dead, Most of the crew killed, Just two guys. One badly burnt. I tried to grab one ,But tripped over a cartridege. Rounds hit one of the guys, killing him. I rushed and grabbed the burnt one and dragged him back to the ally way. I took a right, Not going the way I did. A weak, old, brick wall stood in my way. I kicked it and a little came down. I knew this was my first hold point. By then, All the commlinks were filled with \"Get to the crash\" or \"any survivors?\". I realized my mic was broken, My headphones still intact. Damn, I could here ,but I can't reply. I moved some wood boxes and settled the burnt guy. I got into a prone position and waited. I heard mad screaming and mumbling. Damn group was coming. They quickly passed but a few came towards me. I fired my M203, Decimating the four. I got up and kicked the wall, Collapsing and showing a street. The group that passed came back, I quickly killed them with another launch from the M203. I heard what seemed like a half the town...I put the guy over my shoulder and ran, towards the street. A heavily armoured quad came down the street. A Marine was driving it. \"Stop, Take the guy, He needs it more than I do.\" I quickly said. I opened the back and put the guy in. I quickly closed it and ran towards the second crash site's smoke. I turned a left and then a right, Just zig zaging so I won't be shot at. I rushed a right, Stopping in front of a large mob. They were holding the dead guys, Dragging them with ropes. Fuckers! \"Stop! Or I will fire on you!\" I screamed. They didn't stop, They threw rocks and sticks at me, I qucikly dodged a bottle. I grabbed te M240 strapped on my back and pulled the chraging handle. I squeezed the trigger for a brief moment. I killed 4 tangos, Quickly squeezing off another burst. I targeted the Skinnies holdig the crew. They all ran back, I didn't finish any one off. I strapped the 240 back, and held my ACR tightly, Walking towards the marines and snipers. Shit! The bodies looked like shit. The sniper that smiled at me was torn up, Half his hair was ripped out. The gunner I was next to had cuts and bruises all over him. I took out my first aid pack (Which almost filled up my Custom Oakley back pack.) and took out the 6 body bags. I bagged each soldier, Writing their names on the top. I then moved it in a small courtyard, Which looked...ghostly. I hid the bodies all together and put a satellite beacon right next to them. I hope we come back. I heard that damn sound again. The yelling and roaring of the damn skinnies. Still the commlinks were full of the same stuff, But something stood out. I sat down and listened carefully. \"All survivors, Make it to Yaman Street, Repeat All survivors, Make it to Yaman street. I checked my Global Positioning System. I was 20 blocks away, Godamnit. I Wrote the name of the street, \"Ali Road\", on the inside of my helmet and ran. I was pretty light, Only the M240 had a strain. I ran about 5 blocks untill a mob appeared. This time they had guns. I abrutly stopped and ran back, Bullets landing left and right. I heard the same light sound of a Little Bird. I had to make it to the roof tops.Operation Secure the Gold Part 3  I madly jumped onto a dumpster and climbed up onto a balcony. I got on the rail and leaped, Getting a good grip on the roof. I then pulled myself up, The mob clearly below me. I rushed down the rooftops, Hoping and jumping. A Little Bird, The same one I had heard, hovered out from behind a hotel and rushed to my position. I Motioned for the pilot to hover, Not land. I jumped onto the rail and grabbed the seat, I reached for the latch, hooking myself in. I then grabbed my Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device or HABD and put it on. I steadied my arm, lifted my knee and got a good aim. Part of the mob were climbing up, The other bashing out of the stairs. I saw the orange tint of an RPG-7. I focused my 553 Holographic sight and squeezed a shot off. The round hit Mob guy #1, passing through him and hitting RPG guy #1. Damn, Getting my ACR to a 7.62x51 was good. I hope they get it for everyone else, It cuts like butter. The pilot got the HGS right and we lifted off. \"Thanks, You guys saved my ass!\" I yelled. \"It's ok, We do it for a living!\" He replied. \"Well so do I!\". We laughed over it and reached \"The secondary fire\" zone. The pilots eased down, While I still had my safety off. I took heavy breaths through the HABD, Getting my blood pressure to normal. We were smooth riding untill a stray bullets hit the Heli. The pilot was hit. He got pushed back, He hit the chair and bounced back. His blood was all over the screens, The GPD was now blury with red. \"Land the chopper on that hotel, It's high enough and I'll fix him there!\" I yelled. The pilot steered the Little Bird and landed roughly onto the roof of a hotel. 30-40 floors? I unhooked my self and took out my First-Aid kit. I ripped his jacket open, Then another undershirt. He had been hit in the upper-chest, Definately not a serious one. It looked to go upper-right of his sternum, Passing through the gap in the ribs. I cleaned the wound and took the pliers, Along with a \"Medical Metal Detector\". I scanned the area of his shot, Good he wasn't hit in any vitals, And the bullet was a 5.56x45. It wasn't so deep, About inch. I gribbed my pliers and slowly took out the flattened round. I then put it in a bag, While taking out some Vaseline and rolls of gauze. I patched him up quickly, Putting him into the back of the Little Bird. I dropped his canteen next to him. \"He alright?\" The pilot eagerly said. \"Yeah, Not a a serious one, He just needs rest.\" I replied. I picket up the co-pilot's commlink. \"This is BravoAlphaSix, We need an evac, Our Little Bird is damaged, Hotel in Secondary-fire zone. Uhh, Scratch that, Very tall hotel in Secondary-fire zone.\" I said hoping fro a response. \"This is Super Six Four, We got you.\" A pilot replied. A Osprey Helicopter descended from high above. The doors leveled down. \"Come on, Let's go!\" The crew chief yelled. We grabbed the co-pilot and entered the helicopter. We layed him down. \"The Op is finished! Black market destroyed ,But no target!\" The crew chief said. I nodded and sat down. I closed my eyes...No damn target.The New 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment Delta  2019...The new year for us. The U.S. military and the goverment have been talking for a while...We're going to be one of the most secret Black-Op forces in the world. We'll get everything before the Infantry, The Navy, the Air-Force, Everything damnit. The president said we can't even support our own guys...My brothers. I still went along. I was happy to be part of it. The goverment \"officialy\" announced the 1st SFOD-D's disbandment. Unofficialy, We were still here, Out in the world. But everything was going to change. Most of the Operators were chopped off, Sent to the SEALs and other Special Forces. Only a few remained. About 20 is what the General said. My team is still intact, They said Casey might be a problem. But there's one problem. We will be on the dangerous and most...Craziest ops ever created. Im gonna love eating NPs for 3 months. Damn.Operation Get the Ham  I started out from the bush. My cloaking device made me invincible. Jackson and Casey were on a Op in Asia. Johnson was in Africa. Rider was in Afghanistan, And I was in Dear, Russia. I held my \"New\" ACR. It fit like it was made for me. It was changed to a bullpup design, It was really shorter too. I looked through my X-Ray cam. Three tangos moving around in a shed, Another 2 patrolling. I put a mag into my ACR, Didn't even have to pull the charging handle, it was \"auto\". I made my way, Constantly taking cover as if I didn't have my CS. I huddled the building's wall, Moving to the corner. I peered out, The two tangos sat down for a smoke. I squeezed my trigger, Killing both. The gunfire was silent as a pin drop. No one would of heard it. Their bodies quickly were engulfed by the Russia Winter, Snow was falling and constant wind in the area, I entered the shed. Killing everyone there. It wasn't Spetsnaz nor Terrorists. They were some PMC. Shit. We only hire fresh veterans, Comrade. We many a day. One of our new ones is an officer from the west.\" An American accent said. I turned on my thermal. 4 guys, All armed, Only 2 heavily. I slowly creeped out into the open. I got my ID on the men. Two were ex-U.S. army personal, The other two. An American officer from the Marines and a Russian. Alias...The Red Hawk. I walked my way towards them. I put my ACR on auto. I shot the at the bodyguards, Getting quick and clean neck shots, Then sending another to the officer's eye. I then rushed and tackled the Asad, Knocking the cold out of him. \"This is BravoAlphaSix, HVI is secured, Repeat HVI is secured. I need an evac for the HVI, Second objective not completed.\" I said. I shot an anesthetic round into his neck, Making sure he was going to be singing a \"Throw a rock at a baby, Hiding in a tree top\" in his head. A Prototype Multi-purpose Little Bird swooped down. Loaded him into the back, Another 1st SFOD-D soldier strapped him, His MR-B rifle ready to blast the fucker's face if needed. I got made sure my exoskeleton was tight and ready. I started running The exoskeleten supported the equipment I had. I dodged the trees, Jumped over bushes, I was running for the destroyed \"port\" city. \"Run Forest, Run!\" was all I thought. I made my way, Sliding onto the beach and starting from there, Lot's of fricking snipers in my X-ray cam. Hope this CS doesn't get hit. I slowly crept along the beachline, Scanning every building, Every little fricking shack. A sniper was huddled against a beach rock, He was fixing his scope. I raised my ACR. I squeezed the triggger, Sending an steel 7.62 round into his brain. He fell. Pink mush and blood stained on the sand, Breaking the beatiful view. I crept along, Taking cover under walkways, rocks, and most of all, Rubble. I made it to a 4 story building, The paint was old, Windows were broken. Damn Bastards, Over one million people used to live in this city, Now its a haven for terrorists...or in this case, Mercanaries. I got up to the third floor, Shaken by the sound of 2 Helicopters. I turned my CS on. I walked towards the windows, Then huddling a wall. A Black Hawk in black and grey finish and a Black Pave low. The pave low was lowering something, A huge crate. I lied down and aimed for the pilot. Bingo, I sent a round piercing the glass, Ripping the pilots face. \"Where'd the shot come from!\" A voice yelled. I aimed for the Black Hawk, This time sending two into the pilot. The Black Hawk lost control and smashed into the Pave Low. Then the Helis headed towards me. I embraced myself and jumped out the window, Landing on my feet, The two Helis broadside the building, leaving a large crater in the building. \"GO,GO,GO\" The mercs eagerly ran towards the building. They passed me, I raised my rifle and shot a long stream of steel. They all fell down, No movement, No sound. \"This is Golden 34, An American Convoy is headed your way, Do not make contact. You are Black Ops. Support the Convoy, Do you understand my last?\". \"Roger, I'll set up.\" I replied.Cpl. Morgan, U.S. Army Rangers  Are convoy moved up the street, Creepy Russian city freaks me out. I was in the lead Humvee, acting as Gunner. Had two .50s like an AA gun. I had my MISH helmet, Sleeves rolled up, Sunglasses. I don't think any of us expected resistance. I spotted a group 'a dead guys. \"Woah, Woah, Woah, Stop the Car. I lifted myself out, SCAR-H loacked and loaded. I brought Pvt. Freeman along. He was a newbie, Still scared from being that far from the states. I checked the bodies. The long stretch of Humvees, APCs, And tanks waited behind us. \"Woah man, These guys were killed percisely, By an pro. Maybe it was some naz guy\" I told him. \"I du-dunno man, I-I don't know man, Fr-From these wounds, I th-think it was a NATO round, 5.45x39 does this damage...I-it has to be 7.62 area, But def-definatley not x39.\" He replied. \"Since when were you a combat veteran?\" I asked. \"I-I was a medic back in the states, I dr-dropped when I saw my first wounded patient.\". \"Damn,\" I replied \"Captain Marks, Dead guys, Keep moving.\" I said as I walked back. I saw a reflection on the corner of my eye. \"Sn-\" I didn't finished before a round had precisley sliced through the window, Hitting the combatant. \"GO GO GO\" I yelled. We got back in out Humvee, The whole damn convoy was alert. \"Watch those windows!\". Voices started saying. I heard the sound of Abraham tanks swiveling the barrels around to see through their thermal cams, They barking of officers, The panic of the new guys. \"This is 2-1, I thought you guys said this area was clear! Do you fricking understand my last!\", Captain Marks yelled into the raid. \"We got a 200 hundred lives at risk in this convoy and you pencil-pushers can't get a thing right, You wanna walk up to their widows while we're being slaughtered by maniacs!\". I turned the .50s to my left, Two APCs approached us. \"Captain Marks! APCs, to our 10 'o clock!\" I yelled. \"Get an Abrahams up now!\" He barked. One tank moved up, \"War Pig\" was it's name. It squeezed out from the convoy, Taking a left to avoid out Humvee. It moved up at least 20 yards. \"This is War Pig, We're firing an HE round in 10 seconds, Get Ready!\" A soft voice said. BANG! The HE round went like a hundred yards in like a second. It hit the first APC, Shrapnel and the shockwave getting the second. \"This is Overlord, Keep moving, You will be supported.\" The old man said. \"By what!? Luck!?,\" The captain replied. \"Fuck it, Keep moving, These bastards are probably watching TV and eating donuts right now!\" We started moving, War Pig leading us.Cpl.Morgan U.S. Army Rangers Part 2  \"Move up! Watch those windows!\" Marks said. Our convoy moved up, Stopping near an intersection. \"MOVEMENT IN THE TREE LINE!\" A voice yelled. I pulled the charging handles back and opened up with the .50s. Trees fell, Bushes were decimated, The dirt was kicking, The damn birds were flying. We stopped, A couple of indiviuals came out, Hands up. Marks ran out, His SCAR-L held by one hand, His M9 in the other. \"Get your asses over here!\" He yelled. A Ranger named Vasquez came with me. \"Now what the hell are mercanaries doing in an deserted city!?,\" He questioned. \"HUH? ANSWER ME!\". He yelled in the merc's chubby face. The mercs kept silent. He holstered his SCAR-L to a strap, M9 pointed at the merc's face. \"You have 10 seconds, Maggot.\" He said softly...No reply. \"Well ya big stinkin pot crap!\" He pull the trigger, The 9mm round penetrating the man's skull, Coming out the other. His brain was probably swollen so bad, He died from that. Captain Marks pointed the gun at the others. \"Any explanation for why you're here?\" He said, This time calmed down. \"No...We will never tell you...' One mumbled. I lifted my peice up and fired into the bastard's foot. \"Ahh, You cowards!\" He yelled. I kicked him crotch, He was on his knees. \"You tell our commander why your'e here, Now.\" I threatened. \"Heh, spineless pigs.\" He said over the pain. \"Fine, Captain?\". He nodded, I fired another into the man's face, This time the 7.62x51 round went through the Frontal bone and out the Occipital bone in the back. One last merc remained. \"Now, You gonna talk?\" Marks said, We waited, No reply. Vasquez lifted his piece, An SCAR-L, And fired, This time going through the Zygomatic bone, Out the Mandible, Breaking his jaw. I stumbled back to the Convoy, I had just shot a man...Cold Blooded. i shaked that feeling off and got back on my .50s. \"This Sea Bird 9-8, Forces spotted on thermal, Coming in to attack, Take cover, Understand my last?\" A random pilot said. \"Roger, We'll pull back the convoy!\" Marks replied. \"Back it up! Will it be danger close?\" Marks commanded. \"Uhh, Definate no.\" The pilot replied. Two Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt IIs flew threw the sky,\"Fox 3, Fox3, 2 missiles headed for the baddies.\" Another pilot said. They flew fast, Launching their 4 total missiles, Streaking back for another run. \"Uhh, Good shot, Good shot, Coming around for a strafing run, Let's see what our new GAU-8/As can do. They flew low, Their cannons roaring, Depleted Uranium rounds striking the enemy. \"Uhh, Little to no resistance down there, We're bugging off.\" The Thunderbolts flew away, The convoy starting back up, War Pigs commander was out, Manning the new M134 on the top. We passed the tree line, Seeing the shock and awe of what the Thunderbolts did.Operation Save the Dog  I was sitting on a rooftop, Just finished looking at a few thunderbolts do some damage. \"This is Bravo 6-9, I am part of the Hazardous Materials Team, We have pciked up a facility in that city...BravoAlphaSix, It's an active...Nuclear and Uranium Missile Facility. Your going to have to destroy the lab, No missiles MUST be launched.\" A young voice said over the comm links. \"You see it?\", \"Yes, I see it. Shut up and let me do my job.\" I stood up and stretch my legs. I got my exo-skeleton ready. I made a fast sprint, jumping off and landing on another building, Repeat, Repeat, Untill I got to the Silo. The fricking bays were opening. They had found out about the convoy. I rushed into the facility, The CS making my movement invncible. I passed guards, Dodged scientists, And they didn't have a clue. I made it to the launch room. A large room, Filled with computers, TVs, and a BIG screen facing all the equipment. I hugged the wall and found the codes...Right next to the emergencie abort system. The gorund shaked, The scientists stayed calm, The missiles were launching, I punched the codes, Just in time...Or was I. I looked at the screen, The scientist headed my way. I hid behind some boxes, They mumbled and played with the buttons. One yelled. \"MUDAK!\" Asshole in Russian? They ran, I was surprised. I checked the screen. Shit. The missiles were falling back, Not de-activiating the warhead. They landed and crashed. Damn it, I'll never see my team.Pentagon,Washington D.C.  \"We just lost BravoAlphaSix,Sir...He de-activated the missiles...But they were old. It didn't de-activate the warheads, They flew back.\" \"DAMNIT!\" The general yelled, \"He had a good team...Our cover story ready?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"This is Red-Nine, Team BravoAlphaSix, You there?\" The sorry general said into the mic. \"Yes, Sir?\" The team replied. \"Your team leader...H-\" The general didn't finish. \"No,No,No,No,NO!\" Jackson yelled. \"What happened...Sir?\" Casey questioned. \"He was aborting a missile launch...The missiles came back.\" The genera replied. \"Shit\" Shockton said. Rider and Johnson remained silent. \"Im sorry.\" The general sobbed. \"Cut the crap, Come on guys, Let's get back to out Ops.\" Rider said. \"We all remember him, But it's not the time. Rider continued. \"It's not the time.\" The End.Patriotism  This story is about a Russian named Yuri Gusev, a former security guard that was present at the Zakhaev International Airport massacre, and participated in the invasion of the United States. It's a solo Fanfic.Prologue  Zakhaev International Airport 8:38 A.M. Yuri Gusev watched the people walk by as they went to their flights. He held on tightly to the M9 in his holster, watching the travelers pass him by as they went on their merry way. Flight arrivals and depatures were being announced over the Airport's Intercom, flights to Berlin, flights to Beijing, flights to London. Flights everywhere. It was sometimes an announce to hear the drone of the computer's voice over the intercom, but sometimes he was used to it. After all, the job did pay well and he wasn't getting shot by Militants anymore. Once, Gusev had served in the Russian Federation's Army in Chechnya fighting the Islamic terrorists almost fifteen years before; but now he was thirty-nine and defending Russia's \"most-glorious\" airport. He chuckled to himself, he was probably getting paid more now than he had years before. Suddenly, Yuri spotted Officer Igor Bardzecki walking towards him, his stomach nearly busting out past his belt. \"Hello Yuri!\", Igor said, before taking another bite of his Wheat Bar as part of his new 'diet'. \"How is work for you today?\" Yuri shrugged in his heavy bullet-proof vest. \"Umm...it's not that shitty today as it was yesterday,\" he said, and both began to laugh at Yuri's comment. The stood there in front of the food court, talking to each other about the weather, elections and other things; totally unaware as to what was about to happen. 8:40 A.M. \"God is with us,\" said the leader, a man with black hair and extreme motives. The elevator door opened as five men finished checking their weapon's and ammo for the slaughter that was to occur. \"Remember, No Russian.\" 8:41 A.M. Yuri had already pulled out his pistol when he heard the gunshots down near the Security Checkpoint, as well as Bardzecki. He and Igor both heard people screaming in horror as they ran down the Terminal, trying to get out of the gunmens sights before they too would be killed. \"Christ!\", gasped Igor, holding his UMP45 tightly in his hands, \"This reminds me of Afghanistan all over again...\" Yuri aimmed his pistol down the hallway, he could see the Five of the terrorists coming up the stairs: buisness suits, bullet-proof vest, heavy armament. His eyes widdened, these men were the real deal. \"Igor, we have to protect the civilians at any cost\", said Yuri, looking over to his sweating friend \"You and I know that we are going to die.\" Igor was crying now, the tears going down his cheeks; but he was straight-faced. He wiped off the tears and nodded, then took cover behind the food court's walls. Yuri, without thinking through wisely, decided to take cover behind a column near Nate's Restuarant. He waited for a minute, looking from behind the cover to see what was going on. Three civilians ran out of Nate's just as one of the terrorists came walking around the corner, instantly dieing in a hail of bullets. An Airport Security Officer who was just about to fire on the terrorist fell back as the civilians ran out, dieing with them as well. Yuri felt anger and fear as he came around the corner, ready to kill the man responsible for the incident. Suddenly, Yuri felt bullets go into his vest, sending him flying to the ground in pain. One of the five terrorists had managed to get him in the chest, knocking the breath out of him in one large blow. He didn't move even though his chest vibrated in pain, since he knew the terrorists were still passing him. Unfortunately, Igor didn't, coming out from his cover screaming like a banshee. He was shot many times in the chest by the leading terrorist, before he finally fell to the ground. All Yuri could do was watch in horror as his friend died in front of him, reaching out to Yuri before finally ceasing to move.Chapter 1  Above the the state of Maryland, United States. 0800 Hours Yuri sat inside the cargo plane with the rest of the soldiers, praying to himself as the plane rattled and shook in the air. Some of the soldiers of 5th Platoon were sitting around in a dream-like mood. None of them believed that this war was really occuring, none of them at all. At first they did, almost hours ago, but all these former veterans realized what they were getting into. This was a war for blood, and it would be spilt. Yuri looked to the muscular man beside him, who smoked a cigarette as Yuri felt. The scar on Oleg's arm told the story of the truck explosion in Afghanistan almost thirty years ago after Mujahideen soldiers had managed to pierce the gas tanks, and how he managed to survive through brutal torture before a small rescue team managed to save him. His favorite gun, the RPD, was hung over his huge shoulders. \"What are you worrying about, my friend?\", asked Yuri almost innocently. Oleg looked at Yuri wide-eyed, blowing out a cloud of smoke to the side. \"Everything, Yuri. I haven't been in Combat since the Afghan war, and now I'm going to fight the Americans? I often dreamed of doing so as a child when growing up, but now........\" Oleg sighed and went back to smoking his cigarette. Yuri understood perfectly, and went back to his own private thoughts. He often dreamed of overcoming the 'Imperialistic' Americans when he was a child, but not now. Now he knew the truth about what war was.MerchantofDeath/Open Window Project FF/RP  I've decided to make an Fanfiction/roleplay about my Open Window Project Article, 'cause I love science fiction. Setting and Story: The year is 1945. The Red Army is pushing foward into the Third Reich, and are grabbing anything and everything they can find. Rockets and Weapons are some of the biggest things that are found, but the Soviet Hierarches are searching for something more extraordinary.

I never really thought about putting in another character but okay. That's fine. Just go ahead and give me the info. I'll be glad to write in another character. Keep in mind that it may not be how you expect him to come in. (Getting an idea of how to fit him in. It's a scrapped idea that I had.) By the way, our minds must have been working alike because I started it at almost the same time you did yours. Haha. You've just worked harder on yours than I have on mine....yeah, yeah, yeah...I know I'm a slacker. lol. Anyway, I've check some stuff out on here and I've decided I might do some stuff on here. -- Alex Martin Rider 20:33, January 2, 2011 (UTC) Hehehe, Agent Cody Banks.... Do you want any attachments on your weapons? I saw both of them, I personally like the second one better but they're both alright. Quite humorous actually. As for MAC-V SOG, I'll see what I can do. I'll have to think about where to go with the story. Oh, and I made a bad guy character for Kid SEALs. -- Alex Martin Rider 00:40, January 8, 2011 (UTC)RE: FF Idea  No problem, Today marks the end of my break too, but mostly that just means more time for me to hang around on the internet while my parents watch shitty Netflix movies and make my friends think I'm a fag because they use my Xbox Live account. But moving on, I can get the fanfic rolling, just give me a day or two to outline some stuff. Also: Should Weaver, Mason, and Hudson be actual characters controlled by those on the wiki, or merely written around? Okay, I like the slum battle idea, and seeing as how this is 1976, I figured there would be slightly more advanced tech. But, all in all, I like it.

You DO know everything! Btw, Damian Cray was a dick, that's why I had to kill him. -- Alex Martin Rider 00:32, January 16, 2011 (UTC) Also, in the next Kid SEALs, I'd like Alex to be 16. I've got a new picture for him that makes him look older so... -- Alex Martin Rider 00:56, January 16, 2011 (UTC) Well, Alex was almost 16 in the last one so it would make sense. -- Alex Martin Rider 05:06, January 16, 2011 (UTC) No, I think you're getting Horowitz's Alex mixed up with mine. -- Alex Martin Rider 20:01, January 16, 2011 (UTC) Wow, Alex is an asshole... -- Alex Martin Rider 20:47, January 20, 2011 (UTC)The stuff  If this is a falloutish fanfic it would make sense cause in fallout people can get nuke launchers.Sgt Sprinkles 19:18, January 16, 2011 (UTC)Gallery  Okay, so I have an idea to make the gallery sections make sense. We could still have a progression of the characters. Being the image guy I am, I'm sure I could find other pictures of each actor/character we have used. My thinking is that if we have weapons or anything that was only used in only one story, it wouldn't make much sense and anyone who looks at the images after reading the stories would forget, but if we have a gallery on each page it would be easier to understand. What do you think? -- Alex Martin Rider 23:30, January 23, 2011 (UTC) Hey, so I like the format that you used for your Call of Duty: Prime Order page, so I'm going to use your format to make my own \"game.\" So when I post it, you should look at it. It'll include ZOMBIES. -- Alex Martin Rider 22:24, January 26, 2011 (UTC) Don't worry, I changed a lot anyway, but do I seriously seem like the kind of guy who would say something of mine was \"better\" than something of someone elses? -- Alex Martin Rider 23:45, January 26, 2011 (UTC)Spreading  Ummm.

Well, since it's technically a submachine gun (automatic carbine designed for pistol rounds), wouldn't that also make it a machine pistol? I thought machine pistols were submachine guns.

By doing that, editors will no longer have to go to their preferences to switch from source mode to enriched text editor mode, and the background will no longer interfere with the editing background [I believe]. If you want to do this, enabling the new editing thing can be found in the Wikia Labs, under your \"My Tools\" tab. Just click \"enable\". So, just restating my point, it would be better if you enabled the New Editor Redesign. JerryWiffleWaffle is a loser 20:13, July 24, 2011 (UTC) okay then, so I'll tell MoD then.

I'm also trying to find a way to block image uploads from new accounts. --Callofduty4 16:57, September 10, 2011 (UTC) Best to keep that under covers so that none of the vandals find out. --Callofduty4 17:02, September 10, 2011 (UTC)OTROLOLOLOLOLOL FAKE AND GAY  What do you mean by \"fail of a game\" Gloryman3FF.net  Basically, you can write stories there. You create an account and it will go through guidelines and other shit. There is a pen name that is required. I use the same name as I do here. Afterwards you create your account, you can't create anything for 24 hours. I don't know exactly why. FF.net requires you to read guidelines before setting up any new story. Once a story is published, it can be changed title, content and added stuff. On the lists of fanfictions, recently updated ones will appear in the archive that you are looking at. If you're looking for a particular genre, character, etc, there's a search bar for that too. The good thing about this site is that it can't be vandalized directly. You and only you can change anything to your stories. Additionally, there is a review button on every story for other authors to critique or comment on your work. Hope this all helps.

You are the most liked on the wiki, therefore you will get bragging rights for a while (at least until people don't care anymore if they ever did). Just don't be a douche and everything will be fine.

It's only me, CoD4, Azuris (CE), and MoD that are admins I think, and Azuris doesn't come here anymore and I haven't seen MoD in about a month. CoD4 does occasionally come here, but only when there is vandalism. As our wiki population gets bigger (surprisingly), I thought about making one more active admin, but considering CoD4's thoughts, maybe I'll wait a bit longer.

Sprinkles CAPace1 XDEATHMAN4aP90X Seijana CaptainGalexy Soldier of Fortune Members of Adam's Squad  David Adams: Leader Richard Bryce: Heavy Weapons John Grant: Specialist Joseph Ramesy: Sniper Cody Belenski: Special Operations George Loors: Explosives/ Heavy Weapons Alan Smith: Intelligence/computersStory Prologue  Paris, France May 12, 2011 David Adams sipped his drink as he read the newspaper. \"Ahhhhhh....\" he sighed, as he finished sipping his favorite drink here in Europe, Mezzo Mix. He continued reading his newspaper, which talked about how the new French President was going to make sure that France would never have to fight alone again, after recently signing a treaty which allowed other E.U. nations to serve in it's military. Everything else; boring. David put down his paper, and left a tip on the table. He walked out of the cafe's metal fence door, and walked along the street. It was a nice day today, medium temperatures, no clouds in the sky. David smiled, he heard it was going to be like this all week. He continued walking, and made a turn down the road that led to the Lourve Art Museum. Cars passed down the road at high speeds on both sides. They glimmered as the sun's rays hit them, forcing David to close his eyes a little. When he opened them again, he could see a black van speeding down the road. Behind them, four French Police cars screeched behind them. There was no time to think. David assessed the situation very quickly. The speed of the vehicles: seventy miles an hour and about four or three armed men in the van. David quickly grabbed into his jacket, but noticed that the sky was flickering. God dammit, thought David. He tried as fast as he could to get his pistol out, but now the whole scenery was being distorted. Fort Grant, Nevada. 1610 hours, March 10, 2013 \"Greg, stop the simulation!!\" yelled David, taking off the equipment from inside the V.R. capsule. He pushed open the capsule door, and sat upright on the capsule. Chief Technician Greg Pierre was typing on his computer, already trying to figure out what went wrong. \"What the hell happened?, \" asked David, who was now frowning \", everything was fine. The weather, the crowds, the accuracy; and then all of the sudden it starts glitching up.\" Greg was still typing, but managed to look over the screen. \"I don't know,\" he said \", I just don't know. Everything was fine on my screen, then all of the sudden, bang, the program starts to fritz......\" \"Maybe it's because you youngsters need to stop playing video games.....\" said General Michael Roone, who was laying on the side of the door that went into the VR room. \"General!\" said David and Greg at the same time, standing at attention. Michael Roone was now chuckling, and both Greg and David were confused. \"Greg, greg, greg,\" said Roone, patting Greg jokingly on the back \", when are you going to learn that this old man can hack a firewall.\" Greg's eyes widened, and David was now also laughing. \"This. THIS was you, sir?\" said Greg, looking at the computer console. \" Hell yes, soldier,\" said Roone ,\"so you might want to start practicing with safety a little better.\" Greg was obviously pissed at being beaten, but he held it under his calm exterior. \"Now,\" said Roone, letting go of Greg, who went to his computer to fix his defences, \"David. The man I needed to speak to.\" \"What the mission, sir?\" asked David eagerly. General Roone smiled, \"don't be to eager son, you arn't going on a mission today, persay.\" Roone walked over to the V.R. capsule, and sat down. \"I need you to go out east to Georgia. We have some new recruits coming in, and I need one of my best to help train those F.N.G's.\" Roone layed down in the capsule and began putting the simulation gear on. \"You better get going, David. Flight's already waiting for you. Dismissed.\" David saluted, and started walking out of the room. Great, he thought, more babysitting. David exited the door, and could hear Roone saying to Greg ,\" make the setting Jungle, time of day: night and ten hostiles. I want to relive some of my memories.\" Greg said obidently ,\" yes sir.\" On a C-17 above the Mideastern United States 2200 hours, March 10, 2013 \"The problem is this,\" said U.S. Ambassdor Berchman at the recent U.N. assembly \", unless we unite together to stop the increase in violence; we are going to be facing a worldwide crisis.\" There were murmers in the crowd, and Berchman was now looking around nervously. The Ambassdor from China stood up, outraged, and said \", it is easy for your country to say that, since you don't have a problem of your own. My government is still trying to fight the Red Dragon rebels in the southern provinces.\" There was more yelling, and that was when David turned off the T.V. He sat back in his chair, thinking about what he saw. The world had certainly gone to shit lately. More shit, thought David, grinning. For a soldier, David was pretty familiar with politics. After doing a couple of 'non-existant' missions, he had certainly changed the political power play. Warlords, Dictators, Terrorists; they had all faced one of the edge's of American's many spears. He put his seat back in a recline position. A soldier came up to him and offered a drink, but David waved him off. He needed some sleep before he was training the 'newbies'. He closed his eyes, and quickly he was in deep sleep. You'll never amount to anything, Yassen Gregorovich's father said, you'll be like your worthless brother. Boy, how wrong his father was thought Yassen, laying prone on a roof. Millions upon millions of dollars constantly came to him after finishing a contract, and all he had to do was kill some people. After doing about thousands of contracts from every lowlife drug dealer to buisnessman, he had found himself to be pretty successful. He had a house by the Mediterranean, a summerhome in the Alps, and even more women than contracts. But, he liked to save alot a money. He didn't buy his own weapons, not even his own transportation. That the costumer supplied. Even though they sometimes complained at first, he always got the cash when he killed the target. But this customer, this one was strange. He only spoke to him through his messengers, and he there were always the wierd meeting locations. \"Just remember not to miss,\" said the last messenger he saw, before he dissappeared into the crowd in that Innsbruck street. Yassen had to drive a hundred fucking miles just to get to Berlin. Yassen adjusted the sight on his recently supplied silenced Draganov sniper rifle, making sure it was at the right distance. He checked down his sight once, and even though the street lights shined a little into his scope, he was fine. Strange target, too, he thought. Why anyone would want to kill the President of the European Union Council, he would never know. And with a Draganov\u00a0!?!?! That didn't suit his tastes; since he would rather use a flintlock to snipe his target, it would probably be nicer. Just focus, you idiot, he heard his brother's voice telling him. Yassen looked down the sight, a put the blond headed man between his sight's. His index finger gently pulled on the trigger and, almost as quickly has he pulled, the bullet came through the silenced barrel. The President of the E.U. Council's head exploded infront of the large crowd of party goers, and many began to scream. The President pulse was checked by his security guards, and they rushed him to a hospital. He died at 1:00 A.M., while Yassen was already in a safehouse outside of Berlin. The authority's found Yassen's gun on the roof, and immediatly brought it in for investigation.Chapter 1: Training  Road leading to Camp Eisenhower, Georgia March 11, 2013 \".....oh, and then there was when we went down to Kahandar, and I managed to take one guy's head off,\" said Joseph Ramsey \", seriously, head an everything.\" The bus had about nine soldiers in it right now, including Joseph Ramsey, John Grant, and Richard Bryce. \"Do you have to be so graphic,\" asked one airforce pilot \", 'cause I'm eating my lunch here.\" Joseph looked at the pilot, but went back to talking. \"I'd like it too if you'd stop,\" said John Grant, laying back againist the window. \"Hey, that's alot of balls coming from a weirdo who's wearing gas mask,\" said Joseph, grinning. John looked at him \", at least this 'man' could probably out shoot you in target practice.\" Joseph was furious, and started walking toward John. John did the same, before Richard entered the picture. \"If I need too,\" said Richard, with his huge arms crossed \", I will smash your heads together like two walnuts. So both of you better sit down.\" Just then, an Major is the front took notice. \"What the fuck is going on back there!?\" he yelled. All three of them saluted \", nothing, sir!\" The Major eyed Joseph and John, but nodded at Richard in agreement with his actions. \"Then sit the fuck down then,\" said the Major, going back to talking with his friend. John and Joseph went to sit back down, and John did the same. Richard went back to reading his book, when a finger tapped his shoulder. Richard turned his head, and saw a smiling face in front of him. \"That was some pretty heavy shit,\" said Cody \"Sarge\" Belenski. \"Thanks,\" said Richard. \"GET YOUR ASSES MOVING, YOU PUSSIES. YOU NEED TO RUN THAT OBSTACLE COURSE!!!!!!!\" yelled the 19th Joint Ops Drill Sergeant. Even though there were many men and women here that were higher in rank than the Sergeant, they were basicly now privates in the 19th; until they completed their training. Richard ran through the obstacle course quite well, but managed to help other soldiers that were stuck in the mud, or couldn't climb up the climbing wall. Cody Belenski excelled at the obstacle course, completing it in just two minutes. Joseph Ramsey and John Grant, since the discovery of their temporay hatred, were too busy pushing each other off the logs. It took only five minutes for the course to be completed by all twenty people, and they all quickly met Captain David Adams. He was smiling as they came in battered, bruised, and partially bloody. \"That is what it is going to feel like for you during training, and when you participate in the 19th's missions,\" said David while inspecting the new recruits, \"each one of you is going to get this treatment in their whole service with the 19th, and I hope that each one of you know that this is going to keep getting worse. This is no walk in the park. Not another patch to put on your uniform so that you can say that you can jump out of a fucking helicopter. This is going to show you what your going to be dealing with, whether it's terrorists, rebels, or your common day molotov throwing protester.\" David flicked his eyes for a moment, and saw Joseph and John getting chewed on by a Drill Sergeant, and flicked back to the troops. \"Now, I know you may think you can't survive this, but you can do this. You are all the best in your branches, and with you all working together, I'm sure you'll get used to it. Now, Sergeant, do the honors.\" The Sergeant next to him smiled an evil smile , and turned to troops. \"Alright. Time for some F.U.N. Two Mile Run, come on people,\" said the Sergeant, leading the recruits off. David walked over to Joseph and John, who immediatly saluted when he came walking towards him. \"Both of you,\" said David ,\" ten times on the obstacle course, NOW!!!! I will not take this kind of behavior in the 19th.\" The men began to run for the begginning of the course, with the Drill Sergeant chasing them shortly behind. I love this, thought David, before walking toward his quarters. Day 1 of Training Camp Eisenhower, Georgia 0500 hours , March 12, 2013, John and Joseph's legs hurt after running the obstacle course for about an hour, but both of them were sleeping. In fact, the whole barracks was sleeping, including Cody and Richard. Just then, Cpt David Adams came into the room, with two Drill Sergeants on both sides of him. He looked outside of the door, and nodded to the trumpeter. The trumpeter took one big puff of air, and blew into the microphone. All of the barracks soundspeakers began to echo with trumpet playing, and all of the recruits began to get out of bed. John and Joseph both nearly fell out of their bed's, and they began to get there clothes on quickly. Cody and Richard were already standing to attention, along with the rest of the recruits. \"Alright ladies,\" said David \", today is going to be fun. We're going to do some technology demonstrations, and I'll bet you'll enjoy it. But first, two mile run and one run through the obstacle course, pronto!!.\" The recruits saluted, and began filing out of the barracks. David stared at each one of them, wondering which would be his recruits. An hour later, the deeds were done. Everyone was panting by the time they arrived at 'The Range\", which took up most of the base. \"Alright,\" said David Adams, while getting his gear put on \", this is the weapons training, in case you didn't know. First, we're going to seperate into groups. These groups are going to be with you for all four days, and maybe even combat. So, Richard Bryce, Cody Belenski, Joseph Ramesy, John Grant, Alan Smith, and George Loors; your with me.\" The men began to walk out of the crowd; with John and Joseph both glaring at each other. David continued \", second, you need to introduce yourself to the group. No one's going to be a fucking lone wolf in the 19th, we are a team. Third, each of you will get your weapons, and you'll go out into \"the range\" for demonstrations and training. Alright, that's all I have to say, dismissed.\" The recruits listened to their names being shouted out by the other officers, and they would join into their respective groups. David had already finished putting on his gear, and turned toward his new men. \"Alright, my name is David Adams, and I've served in the Army Rangers for a about 10 years. I don't take any bullshit if you bullshit with me, but I can be friendly,\" said David, before pointing to the man besides him. \"Richard Bryce, U.S. Marine Corps. I served in Afganistan for a loooonnnggg time, and I have some kill reports to prove it. I follow orders, and I finish the job. All you need to know about me.\" Richard nudged the next man, Cody, and he began to speak. \"My name is Cody Belenski, and I served with SOCOM. I did some pretty 'black' stuff in some nice shitholes. When I get in there, combat; my friend's tell me that I can be one badass motherfucker.\" \" PFC. Alan Smith, Airforce . I have a pretty good shot, but I'm mostly known for my computer skills. I was a BIG nerd with computers in college, and I'm still am. I destroyed about 90% of all hacker's attempts to attack our nation's infanstucture, which is why I got accepted for this.\" \"Specialist George Loors, Army Sappers. I'm very good with explosives, and I mean very. One bridge need to be blown up, no problem. Can't find a guy to blow up an explosive shock wave resistant building, I can.\" \"Joseph Ramsey, Marine Force Recon; at your service. I've taken out about maybe.........one thousand targets. I've got a crack shot, and I gaurantee that I'll take out my target. I'll have to admit, though; I do have a pretty big mouth. I got kicked down a couple ranks, litterally.\" Finally, they got to John Grant, who was looking at them all through his gas mask. \"John Grant, Navy SEALS. I served in Afganistan for along time, including in the beginning. I was one of the guys that were sent into Pakistan to find our favorite neighborhood terrorist, Osama bin Laden.\" Joseph was surprised, and impressed, with John now. \"Jesus man, that's awesome. Now, can you tell us what's with the mask.\" John looked at Joseph, almost like he was trying to stare into his soul, and said ,\" It was 2004. We were sent to the Northern Provinces to look for some Black Market Areas. We did find one, except they had some fancy chemical weapons. Everyone, including me, got sprayed with it; and I was the only one who survived that. I wear this because at any time, everything can quickly go to shit.\" Joseph frowned, ashamed that he had offended him the day before. \"Hey man, I'm sorry about the other day. You're pretty cool, actually; I hope there's no hard feelings?\" John nodded, and extended his hand. Joseph grabbed it firmly, and shook it. \"Aw,\" said David, pretending to cry \", ain't this sweet. Now, if you can stop being a women and pause 'Pretty Woman; we do have to do somethings.\" Joseph and John both nodded to David, and he said \"Alright, follow me, I'll show you to the demonstration area.\" 1000 hours \"Now, here are some of the crown jewels that shows what the 19th is all about,\" said David, showing his men the tech. Their eyes glowed like they were in a candy store, and they immediatly started to run toward the weapons. \"This here is the M.U.L.E. drone,\" said Davids, moving the huge machine with a controller \", it can carry huge loads of equipment, and can even shot your enemies when you have a turrent variant. David continued down the row, and picked up a sniper rifle. \"Joseph,\" he said ,\" you see that target over there?\" Joseph looked up, and saw a target up on a tower. \"Yep,\" said Joseph. \"I want you to turn in the slightly off the target, and fire your rifle.\" Joseph was suprised, no one had ever asked him to fire slightly to the left . But he agreed, and aimed the rifle. He pulled on the trigger, and the bullet exited the chamber. And as if it was magic, the bullet suddenly made a sharp turn, and hit the target. \"Smart Ammuntion. Probably the next best thing for warfare,\" said David, extending his hands. Joseph put the rifle in David's hands, and exclaimed \", that was awesome!!!\" David smiled, you haven't seen nothing yet. David talked about the multitude of weapons and tech; crosscom communication, heat/night vision googles, portable unmanned drones, and other things. Finally, David got to the the A.T.L. designator. \"This thing you see here,\" said David, pointing to the sleek object, \" links to you crosscom, and allows you to accurately designate your target. I'm going to show you how to do this: since we have an artillery strike available.\" He turned to look down the large range, and closed one of his eyes. David saw a small red circle with a dot in it, and aimed it at the old T-72 tank. \"This is Cpt. David Adams, I'm requesting a artillery strike on this position, over.\" He waited a couple seconds for a reply, and a voice said, \"roger that\". The whole group waited a couple more seconds, before they heard the sounds of heavy metal tearing the air. The rounds, all of them, hit directly on top of the tank; which exploded into a flower.Chapter 2: Hunting the Hunter  Gregorovich's house 1000 hours Yassen Gregorovich sat under his luxurious lamp, sipping a shot of scotch. He breathed a sigh of relief, the sniper they found on the roof belonged to a person that didn't exist. He had purchased it from the black market and when they coped, they found out that the buyer had long deserted the city. Gregorovich's thoughts were rudely interrupted when the his cell phone rang. Not taking his eyes off the view outside, he picked up his phone in his pocket, flipped it open. \"Gregorovich speaking.\" \"I have need of your service.\" A mysterious voice erupted from the other side of the phone. \"I need the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, plus his family dead.\" Gregorovich shuddered a little. \"To get within firing distance, you have to be at the right place at the right time. Impossible, not to mention lethal.\" A full minute passed before the contractor replied, \"It appears that your reputation is quite bluffing.\" \"No.\" Yassen replied, \"I'll take the job. You will have to provide everything I need plus the price.\" \"None of my concern. Your needs make no difference to me.\" Yassen smiled behind his phone. \"You've got a deal.\" 1300 hours Gergorovich piloted his personal Ka-52 onto the small helipad in a small airfield. The helicopter sprayed dust everywhere as he powered down his motors, climbing out of the pilot's seat. A four engine jet, Gregorovich recognized as an Airbus A340-600 sat on the tarmac. A man with a hood and sunglasses stood, beckoning Gregorovich to board. \"We'll take care of your chopper. Step aboard and have a drink.\" Yassen walked the staircase into the aircraft. Champagne filled his nose as his client stood clinking glasses with Gregorovich. \"I can provide all the other things, weapons, equipment.\" Gregorovich negotiated. \"What I need is a stage to begin my task.\" The client cocked his head after he took another sip. \"You came unarmed.\" He was responded by Gergorovich pulling out his twin Walther P99s. \"Very well then.\" He handed Yassen a paper. \"You'll find everything inside.\" The mercenary turned to leave, but stopped. \"I better get paid.\" Then he was gone. 2000 hours. Fucking cold, thought Yassen, as he sat on top of the a Russian Highrise. The building was old and decrepit, but it was a very good vantage point. He turned toward the sniper case, and pulled the rifle out with his gloved hands. A GOL sniper rifle, an excellent way to kill the prime minister. He pulled the bipod down on the rifle, and set it down. He checked the sights, adjusting it so he could kill the Prime Minister as soon as he got out of his car. He smiled, the Prime Minister was going to be a little suprised when that happened. Minutes passed and the Prime Minister was still not yet at his confrence. \"I would like to be there before my drink goes dry,\" said the Prime Minister to his driver, holding his drink calmly. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" said the driver, focused on the road \", it's just that this traffic....\" The Prime Minister waved his hands \", no worries, just get me to my confrence.\" The driver nodded, and pushed his foot on the pedal double. The limo speeded faster that the other cars in the Prime Minister's convoy. It was about five minutes, about ten minutes if the driver followed the speed limits, when the Prime Minister arrived. The Prime Minister opened the door, being greeted by numerous guests. \"Welcome, Prime Minister Nikitin,\" said the greeter. That was the last thing that Nikitin ever heard. A bullet entered the back of Nikitin's head, killing him instantly. Blood splashed the greeter and two guests, and screaming began. The security officers managed to check his pulse, and he was still rushed to the hospital. Yuri was already back to his home, drinking a wine and watching the news. March 13, 2013 Camp Eisenhower, Georgia. David watched the news unravel on CNN in horror , with his teammate's doing the same. \"BREAKING NEWS,\" said the newsman, standing right infront of a hospital in the cold \", we have recieved reports that Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Nikitin has been pronounced dead in Russian Moscow hospital. Police and FSB forces are still trying to find the killer, but it's been so far a failure.....\" David turned off the TV, and faced toward his group. \"Listen,\" he said calmly \", we've only been here for about two days of training, but I think we're ready for this.\" Richard Bryce came from the back, pushing away John Grant and Joseph \"Joe\" Ramsey. \"Ready for what?\" asked Richard. David turned and stared at the group, who were all wide-eyed. \"We're going on a mission,\" said David \", somewhere in Eastern Europe. That's one of the things I know.\" March 13, 2013 People's Freedom Movement HQ, Seattle Majinji Cetewayo walked down a spray-painted hallway, toward Howard Smith's office. The building was pretty compact, unlike their other building in Poland. But Majinji didn't mind; she had lived in worse conditions anyway. She walked down another hallway, and opened a door to Albert William's office. He was talking to someone on the phone, and he held up his hand to Majinji. \"No, just tell him that if he keeps doing jobs like that in the future, he's going to have so much money that he could wash his balls off in them,\" said Albert \", and give him a little 'incentive' will ya?\" Albert then hung up the phone, and focused his attention on Majinji. \"So,\" he said, putting his finger into a delta shape. \"Who was that you were talking too?,\" asked Majinii, looking at Albert puzzled. \"Oh,\" he said nervously \", I was talking to Dominic about our....good friend....\" Majinji snorted in anger \", why do we need to use the Fat Cat's instrument for their destruction? I think I could do it just fine.\" Albert got out of his chair, with his buisness suit still in shape, and walked over to Majinji. \"Baby,\" he said, grabbing both of her arms lightly \", I want our organization to keep fighting, and I'm sure as hell that I won't lose you.\" Majinji wanted to smile, but she held her scowl. \"I still think it's wrong,\" she said, turning away. Albert frowned a little, but quickly thought of something to say. \"Think of it this way,\" said Albert \", we're showing the fascists their true faces by using their own weapons againist them.\" Majinji thought about this, and grasped Albert lovingly. \"How do you always convince me?,\" she asked. Albert, almost blushing, said \", I don't know. I guess I know my way with words.\" March 14, 2013 A town outside of Prague David Adams sat watching the farms going by from the Black Hawk. He had finished reading a report on the HVT, known as 'The B3a5T' on the internet. The target was a very itteligent computer hacker named Boleslaw Dudec, a graduate from M.I.T. He was famous for internet hackings in the Pentagon, NORAD, and other important location. And he was suspected of knowing about the assasinations of the Russian Prime Minister and EU President. \"ETA five minutes,\" said the pilot of the heli. David nodded, and yelled to his squad. \"Alright, everyone lock and load. We're going to be hitting some rough shit soon.\" \"What kind of shit?\" asked Cody, putting a fresh clip into his P90. \"Shit as in rebels,\" said John Grant \", Poland has been turned into a warzone by Communist rebels in Ukraine.\" Joseph budged into the conversation, \"looks like someone did his homework...\" John looked over his right shoulder, not even afraid of falling from the right opening of the Black Hawk \", yeah Joe, I did.\" The Black Hawk continued on it's straight course until it got outside of Prague, which had smoke and sounds of fighting almost splurting out of it. Small Arms fire began to hit the hull of the Black Hawk, and David retailated by firing some warning shots. The Black Hawk began to descend, and the volley of small arms fire began to increase. As soon as the heli touched the ground, the team entered a warzone. David jumped out first, hit the ground, and quickly ran over to a rundown concrete wall for cover. The rest of the team followed him, with Richard taking a position near a hole for suppresing fire. \"Alright,\" said David, pointing to random members of the team, \" Cody, John, Joseph; I need you to give me, Rich, and Loors a distraction while we head to the HVT's location. It's a couple of blocks from here, and we're going to need everything focused on you guys.....\" \"Oh, how fun,\" said Joseph sarcastically, who quickly shut up when John nudged him in the chest. \"Alright, now let's move out,\" said David. David, Richard, and George ran out from behind the concrete wall, and into the ruined street. Richard was huffing as he ram with the XMR; and so did George when running with the AT4. David turned his head, and saw that the rest of the team was doing their jobs as decoys. He quickly tapped a button on his head, and closed his right eye. He could now see John's view, and he could see that the bullets were flying at his feet. He quickly moved John's camera up with his head, and saw a small deli. \"John,\" he said, getting out of Crosscom, \"get to that deli in front of you. It'll give you a good postition againist the rebels. \"Roger that,\" replied John. David went back to running, and took a quick cover near a burnt out Yugo. The sky, even with an ugly grey clouds covering it, gave out enough light for David to see the sniper in the apartment complex. \"Get your asses over here,\" he wispered to Richard and George. Quickly, Richard and Loors took cover, and David faced them. \"We've got a sniper on the fourth floor of that apartment building over there,\" said David, pointing toward the building through the car, \"George, think you can take him out?\" Before David finished his sentance, George had already gotten up, aimed his AT4, and fired it; sending dust flying up from the ground. The rocket hit the sniper's location, sending bricks and concrete flying everywhere. David and Richard ducked as small pieces of concrete hit them, but Loors stood there admiring his work. \"You're a crazy bastard, you know that Loors?\" said Richard, getting out of his cover. \"Yes....and?\" replied George. \"Alright, enough chatter,\" said David, \"we have a job to do.\" David then jumped over the Yugo, and began jogging down the road again. George and Richard quickly followed behind him. Eventually they arrived at the HVT's location, a small two story warehouse on the corner of a street. David assessed the backround, and he could see a group of rebels guarding the enterance, with two off the ten loading in crates of weapons. David thought quickly, and decided it was the right time to use the A.T.L. again. Pressing a button on the side of his helmet, the A.T.L. came out of it's hiding place. He quickly closed one of his eyes, and aimed the A.T.L. \"This is Captain David Adams, I need rain on this position over.\" David got his reply, \"this is Corporal Robert Torres. We are in the vicinity of your area, and we'll bring on the pain.\" David heard the approaching sounds of a Black Hawk's rotors, and then saw the rebels get torn to shreds as the heli's minigun rained upon them. \"Much thanks,\" said David, before running toward the warehouse. David and\u00a0:Loors took opposite edges of one of the doors into the warehouse, and Richard got in front of the door. They were about to do the least advanced door opening technique in the wor;;d/ With one mighty thrust, Richard managed to kick the door down, and David and Loors rushed into the dsorway. David quickly popped off a few rounds at two gaurds, and they fell down to the ground. He turned, and saw the hvt hiding under his desk, with his computer screen still active. David walked over to the screen while Richard pulled the hacker out from underneath the desk. \"Please don't kill me,\" begged the hacker \", I love U.S.A.!\" David sat down at the desk, and looked at the screen. The Polish terrorists must had managed to get Dudec to hack onto the Wall Street's stock markert so that they could steal some good old fashioned e-money, because he was staring at the NASDAQ go by. \"Richard, Loors,\" said David, getting out of the seat \", grab the HVT, we're getting out of here.\" Richard quickly threw Dudec on his back, and began running out the door.; while David shot the computer. He didn't want anyone finding this information at all.Then he joined Loors and Richard by also running out of the door. \"Corporal Torres,\" said David, holding in his radio \", I need some extraction.\" Torres' voice crackled on the radio, \"roger that, I'll be there in a jiffy.\" David took cover behind one of the concrete pillars, and watched the street. All that was left on those poor streets were burning cars, rubble and trash. \"I hope we arn't coming back here after this, sir,\" said Loors, checking the rooftops, \"this place is hell.\" Richard objected to that statement, \"nah, one day in Afghanistan is enough hell. This is a paradise compared to that hole in the wall.\" David silenced the two soldiers as he began to hear the cutting of heli blades. Seconds later, the Blackhawk loomed over the small intersection again, hoverring beautifully as dirt kicked everywhere. \"Looks like I'm going to skip this spot, captain,\" said Torres, waving from the heli, \"but there is a park down the road a couple of blocks away from your current position that I can have this baby land. Meet me there.\"My Wunderwaffle iz missin Welcome  Hi, welcome to Call of Duty Fan Fiction Wiki! Thanks for your edit to the User:My Wunderwaffle iz missin page.

Before you ask, your character uses a CAR-15 in the level. This is because your chosen weapon, the AUG Prototype, didn't exist in 1968, not even a Prototype. Designing of the gun started in the 70's, so until then, I will have your character use a CAR-15. He can still keep his crossbow, however. Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 17:55, December 4, 2010 (UTC)The hell?  Dude, the \"russian\" holding Landon hostage in deniable Ops is actually my character, Austin. He saw Sorren's rogue fishbed destroy the fighters and ripple the bomber, and made it to the wreck first, and took the file first, which is why Sorrens and the CIA team couldn't find it. He only spoke russian because Wilson, Landon, and the CIA team were dressed as KGB. Are you that simple-minded to not put 2 and 2 together? I had a cool way to introduce my character to the rest of the team, and it is ruined. I now have to either complain to MoD, or spend hours trying to think of another ingenuine meeting thingy.

Please choose for your characters, so I can get pictues of them! I get pictures by making a class based on your character and then going and playing around with them in a recorded private match, then taking screenshots of them in theater. It works out awesomely.

I understand that it is non-canon, which is why I didn't say that the Mi-42, Rave, CHAOS bomb, F15SE, etc. were mistakes. Just because the Russians use a gun in MW2, doesn't mean they would use it IRL. In fact, there aren't any guns in MW2 the russians would really use at that time, except the PP2000, which is incorrectly depicted as a Machine pistol.

The Major shook his head, and walked over to the prisoner. Slowly, the Major pulled out his knife and held it in his hand. He was going to toy the information out of him. \"I do not know why you do not speak, American,\" said the Major, laughing underneath his breath \", it seems you've been beaten up enough, but surely you don't need to be stabbed?\" The Prisoner sat on his freezing metal chair, with the only clothes he had on being his pants and his bloody SOG issued shirt. Landon better be the fuck here, thought Wilson, shivering a little bit in front of the Major. The Major put his knife againist Wilson's neck, and growled \", tell me why you are here, American; or I will slice you open like a fruit!\" Wilson only turned his head, cutting his neck a little as he moved his skin againist the blade. \"Do it then.....\"  Jack Landon laid in the snow motionless, surveying the Russian camp below. It was a pretty medium sized base for the area, with other Russian bases being about double the size of this 'puny' garrison. Why the hell does Wilson always do this, thought Landon, shaking his head. \"Snowfox, this is Artic Eagle; you better get a move on right now or else your extraction is bye-bye,\" said the Heli pilot. Jack sighed, Heli pilots were always very teste when it came to low flybys like this one. But Artic Eagle had a good reason to be cocky, their was a whole lot of Reds down in that base, and they were armed to the teeth. \"Artic Eagle,\" Jack Landon said, slowly getting off of his back knee \", I'm moving in.\" Jack Landon behan his trek down the hill, still in prone, to rescue his friend. Jack had heard that Wilson had been doing recon on a new missile silo the Russians had built in the area, and had been captured by a wandering patrol in the area. After that, Wilson went silent. He personally volunteered to go on the rescue mission, and even help Wilson finish the recon if he could. Jack slowed himself with the pine trees as he began to slide down the snow. He was getting closer to the front entrance, and closer to the guards. \"\u0422\u044b \u044f\u0441\u043d\u043e, \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f!\" yelled one of the gate guards, waving on a covered truck carrying weapons for the garrison. Jack stopped, now what Landon? The truck had drove away, and he quickly surveyed the gate. Two guards were leaving for another location, and the one was now left there by himself. The guard looked around, and then quickly ran inside the gun post to listen to the radio. Jack ,made his move, running across the snow covered ground to one of the concrete barriers. Jack lowered his head and then quickly peeked over the top of the barrier, he heard a the sound of a motor approaching, then several more. \"Artic Eagle, this is Snowfox. I need to know what's headed my way 'cause it doesn't sound too friendly.\"  \"Snowfox, this is Arctic Eagle. You have one bulldozer coming from the opposite side of the building and 4 trucks coming up the mountain from a tunnel below.\" \"Copy.\" Landon replied. He crawled through a maze of crates and barrels before he got a clear shot at the bulldozer, but when he did, he fired two rounds in to the brake, forcing the bulldozer to drive off the cliff and smash the approaching reenforcements. As the rest of the guards panicked, Landon buried two claymores face-down in the snow, directly in front of the entrance to the building. \"Artic Eagle, this is Snowfox. Entering the compound now. I'm gonna ditch some of this camoflague.\" \"Roger.\" Artic Eagle replied.  Landon slowly walked through the dim concrete hallways until he began to hear an angry Russian voice, accompanied by an American one. Landon quickly placed a claymore on the wall, and ducked for cover has he pulled the detonator's trigger. The concrete wall exploded into different sized pieces, and the explosion knocked over two Soviet soldiers who were passing by. An alarm sounded over the entire base, and Landon got his face out of the snow. Grabbing his sniper rifle, Landon quickly turned around the broken wall's corner and aimed at the man who was in the room. \"What,\" said Wilson, zipping up the interrogators parka \", does it make it look too Soviet?\" \"Heh heh heh, great to see you again, Wilson.\" Landon chuckled as the Soviet officer on the floor began to cough, \"You fucking hick!\" \"Anything we can beat from him?\" Landon asked. \"No, he's not that well-respected.\" Wilson remarked back as Landon handed him a pistol. Landon kicked the Russian in the jaw while Wilson shot him point-blank. \"Snowfox, confirm the VIP is secured.\" \"Roger Arctic Eagle, VIP secure.\" Wilson turned to say, \"How the hell are we getting out of here? There must be 20 AK's pointed at every door!\" Just then Landon's other claymores exploded, sending debris in to the base as a gaping hole in the wall appeared. \"Not that one!\" Landon said. \"Arctic Eagle, move in now!\" Wilson screamed in to Landon's radio. Wilson quickly grabbed the dead interrogator's gun, a PM63, and grabbed Landon just as the Soviet soldiers began to fire in the room. \"RUN!\" yelled Wilson, running out of the hole in the wall. Wilson quickly ran across the road, with Landon following him close behind. The cold Soviet winter bit at his face as he ran, but this was only small compared to being filled with large holes. \"\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0439!\" yelled a Officer from inside the room, followed by the choir of guns firing. Bullets hit near Wilson's and Landon's feet as the soldiers tried to stop them from escaping, but they still remained unharmed. \"Wilson,\" yelled Landon over the gunfire \", head for the gate. It was clear when I came in.\" Wilson nodded a little, and turned his body toward the main gate while running. The road was clear, and Wilson had a good feeling that they were getting out of this one; when two GAZ-66's stopped in front of the gate. Wilson slid a little on a icy patch of ground, and ran past Jack. \"Wrong way, WRONG WAY!!!!\" he shouted as he went past, grabbing Landon so he wouldn't run any further. The two began to run past small warehouses of weapons and vehicles, trying desperatly to escape from the steadily advancing Soviet soldiers; when Wilson got an idea. \"Follow me,\" said Wilson, turning into one of the Warehouse's doors. The commander of the base pulled in front of the warehouse Jack and George had run into, and began shouting at the two Americans as his soldiers lined up in front of the door. \"Come out with your hands up, and you will not be harmed!\" shouted the commander, waving his armed jeeps to come forward. The only sounds that were in the whole area, though; were the sounds of the soldiers running into position and the UAZ's idling engine. Suddenly, a huge roar came from inside the warehouse; causing the soldiers to shirk and aim their rifles more attentively. Even the commander himself shrunk down in his seat a little, fearing about what would happen next. Before the commander even blinked, a T-55 Tank busted through the metal door, sending some of the soldiers running as it turned for the main gate. \"Hell yeah, this is how you do it!\" yelled Jack, watching through the tank captain's view hole as Wilson drove the tank. Wilson looked through his own view, the Driver's viewhole,and aimed toward the GAZ-65's in front of the gate. He pushed the throttle, forcingthe drivers to eject as he pummeled through the tanks like Moses through the Red Sea. Wilson made a sharp turn, and began to go down the mountain's road. Just then, Artic Eagle radioed Landon \"Snowfox, I need your location, pronto!\" Jack smiled \"In a tank going down a road, where are you?\" Jack heard static from over the other side of the radio, and Artic Eagle finally replied \",Holy shit; I've got you in my sights, but I can't get you while your drivin' on that tank, I think I see a flat part of the road down there, maybe you can stop than monster and get in. Christ\" Jack thought about what Artic Eagle had said, and popped open the Tank hatch. Looking out, he saw the flat area of the road in front of the tank; still situated on the side of the cliff. He thought he could stop there and quickly jump over to Huey, but a fluing RPG right above him stopped that idea. He turned around, and saw two speeding UAZ's coming down the road, four soldiers in each. He radioed Artic Eagle \", I'm going to need you to fly beside the tank. We'll have to jump over, copy?\"  \"Sounds crazy to me, but roger,\" replied Artic Eagle. Jack quickly flung himself down the hatch, and yelled at Wilson. \"You see that flat part of the road there, George!?\" Wilson replied, still looking through the driver's optics with extreme attention. \"Yes, why?\" \"We're going to jump out of a tank, Wilson,\" said Landon \",over to a helicopter. You've got anything that can hold the throttle down?\" Wilson looked around, was there something in this damn tank that could hold the damn throttle? \"Wilson! Catch.\" Landon said as he threw a high explosive tank shell Wilson's way. \"What the? Oomph!\" Wilson grunted as he caught the shell, \"Jack, if we even so much as hit a fucking rock...\" \"Well, what else is there?\" Landon said as he shot from the hatch. \"It's worth a shot.\" Wilson said. As he propped the shell in to place Wilson joined Landon in firing periodic bursts of fire at the Soviet guards, all while the Chinook tried to match the T-55's speed. \"This is Arctic Eagle, we are throwing the side door open, you've only got one shot at this, Snowfox.\" Wilson climbed up on to the turret of the tank, Landon could hear his breathing slow as he ran and grabbed the ledge of the side door and pulled himself in. Jack followed suit, grabbing Wilson's hand as the chopper gained altitude. The crew cheered as they accomplished their mission. \"I've never seen anything like you two!\" said one of the crew members. \"What are you, Greek heros?\" Jack Landon began to speak, saying that they were SOG; when Wilson silenced him. \"You can say that\" said Wilson.Chapter 1  The Supreme Lord said: I am death, the mighty destroyer of the world, out to destroy. Even without your participation all the warriors standing arrayed in the opposing armies shall\ufeff cease to exist. -Bhagavad Gita, chapter 11, verses 31-33 January 1, 1968 Hong Kong, China The man stood smoking his cigar, with the smoke going up into the sky like smoke from a dragon. His military suit bothered him a bit in the warm air, but it was better than being shot straight in the chest by these two timing rebels. \"Are all the weapons here?\" said the NVA Colonel, looking calmly at the Russian with an almost fearful look. The russian took the cigar out of his mouth \"Everything from the AK-47's to explosives.\" The NVA Colonel nodded, smiling with his slightly yellow stained teeth from years of living in poor conditions \"It is interesting why your 'boss' would send you here instead of meeting me himself.\" The Russian smirked \"The Americans seem to be always watching his movements very closely, and he doesn't want to get caught in the middle of a deal. Besides, you already have the weapons you need for your governments little offensive, so why do you need to meet him?\" The Colonel shrugged \"I always like to meet someone who is friendly to the Revolution.\" With that, the deal with done, and Dashkov once again watched as the NVA Colonel walked away back to his soldiers. For the last time of course. He began to walk back to the idle car, with the Russian SpetsNaz standing guard over him. For over a year and a half, Dashkov had been giving weapon supplies to the NVA for use in Laos and Cambodia a direct order from the Soviet Government so that pressure could be added to the slumping American forces in Vietnam. He stepped inside of the car, while the guard closed the door behind him. But these petty weapons exchanges are only oee small detail in the plan, thought Dashkov, before signaling the guard to drive. No, this part of the plan was only the Communist politicians trying to, idiotically, bring down the United States. However, Dashkov's leader was the true man to lead the fall of America; and he knew it with all of his being. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- January 22nd, 1968 12:30 A.M. Kennedy Space Center Jack and George led a small CIA team in to the mission control room of Kennedy Space Center, as they walked through the dim hallways, dressed in the almost stereotypical black suits and sunglasses, they were stopped by a security guard, warning them, \"Hey you guys, I don't care if you look official, but you can't just interrupt these eggheads while they're managing an Apollo mission.\" one of the CIA tagalongs flashed the guard a gun and a badge, effectively silencing him. When the team burst in, almost instant questions erupted, \"Who the hell are you! Why are you here!\"the CAPCOM engineer approached Landon, \"What the fuck? You're with the government?\" \"Might be.\" One of the agents said as he opened a briefcase and took out heavy-duty listening equipment. \"Well, fine! Even if you have authorization, What could you possibly want! This is a test!\" The engineer said. \"The camera; how quickly can we bring it up?\" queried Landon. \"60 seconds sir.\" an agent replied. \"What fucking camera?!\" The engineer angrily asked. \"That one.\" Landon said as the black-and-white images were broadcast on to the main screens. \"Wilson, if you'd please assist the techs in locating our targets, they should be somewhere in Siberia.\" Landon strolled down the stairs towards the center of the room with two other CIA agents. He stopped when he had the NASA employees' attention, and allowed his other agents to explain what would happen if they went public, his presence there was enough. Then, when he was finished, he signaled Wilson to kill the feed on the main screen, and hurried back to the briefcase computer set up earlier. \"Did we find them?\" Landon asked \"We sure as hell did.\" Wilson replied. \"Where.\" \"The Fucking Yukon.\" January 23, 1968 1:45 P.M. CIA Headquarters Wilson threw down the pictures onto the Director's Desk \"Pardon my language, sir; but there's some shit going down in Alaska.\" The Director took the small yellow folder on his desk, and preceded to look at the pictures in the folder. Ant-like battleships and destroyers were the only things he could make out in the water. \"All high resolution photos in there, sir.\" said Landon \"There's some massive ship movements have been seen in the Bering Strait, but none look threatening as of now.\" The Director put down the yellow folder neatly on his desk, and looked toward Landon and Wilson. \"If they weren't threatening us, they wouldn't be there in the first place. This is why I'm going to be sending you guys up to Alaska right now to do some recon.\" Landon and Wilson looked at each other with sad experssions; they were going into the cold again. \"I need you guys to figure out why the hell the Soviets are near our waters. Get on one of those damn ships and find anything about this all.\" January 24, 1968 2:00 A.M. Bering Strait \"These black uniforms are awesome,\" Wilson said to Landon, with cold water spraying into his face \", and I don't care what you say.\" Landon shook his head, and turned his head back to the Soviet ships. \"Do we go for the big catch?\" Landon said, pointing towards the battleship. \"You know it.\" Wilson replied. Landon started the motor on the stealth speeedboat and headed for the stern of the battleship, gradually slowing and using the waves to reach the ship. When Wilson and Landon reached the ship, they were nearly caught by a Soviet patrol, marines. Landon motioned to Wilson with his hand, \"3...2...1...\" Wilson and Landon fell over the side of the boat into the cold water, and began swimming towards the flagship's hull,  When they reached it, they both quickly went to grab some air. Then, Wilson took out his grappling hook, and threw it up onto the ship. The hook latched onto the guardrail, and Wilson gently tugged on the rope to make sure it was stable. Then, putting his silenced CAR-15 around his arm, Wilson began to climb up towards the deck; with Landon following him close behind. Landon climbed up after Wilson on to the deck, switching off the safety of his CAR-15. After taking a moment to shake some of the water out of his gear, Landon peaked around the corner he and Wilson hid behind, the Soviet Marine patrol was still making their rounds of the deck. \"Shit.\" Landon said, \"We'll need a distraction. Hand me that grappling hook.\" Wilson handed the coiled rope to Landon, who threw the end on to a wooden lifeboat, hanging by a few small hooks from the side of the bridge. The two began to tug on the line as hard as they could, until eventually the small dinghy fell from its hooks and hit the guardrail below, shattering in two and partly landing in the water. \"\u0427\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e?\" One marine alarmingly asked, \"\u0427\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b\u043e.\" \"\u042d\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043c. \u0443\u0449\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430.\" Replied his comrade. This break from their patrol gave Wilson and Landon the opportunity they needed. \"Get ready,\" wispered Wilson \",or else we're going to be in deeper shit than we are now.\" Wilson and Landon quickly hid behind two pieces of metal, and waited for the Soviets to approach. Their steps echoed slightly on the metal, and both Wilson and Landon drew their knifes when they heard the Soviets step on the wet metal. \"\u0427\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442?\" asked the one Soviet. At this statement, WIlson flung himself from behind the metal, and quickly stabbed the Russian in the neck. Before his comrade could even raise his own gun, Landon had already inserted his knife into his chest. The Russian stared at the knife in disbelief before finally falling to the ground. Wilson cleaned off his knife on the Russian's shirt, and put it in it's sheath. \"Help me get these bodies overboard,\" said Wilson, grabbing the dead Russian and pulling him over to the edge. With a burst of energy, Wilson quickly threw the dead body over the side of the ship; which made a small splash sound as it hit the water. Landon did the same, but at a faster pace than Wilson. After the work was done, Wilson took point with his silenced CAR-15 while Landon followed behind. \"We need to get up to the commander's controls, that's where we're going to find any information on what the hell is going on here.\",wgispered Landon to Wilson. \"Roger.\", replied Wilson, looking up at the ship's control tower. He and Wilson began to move silently on the metal; making sure not to catch any attention from the roaming guards on the deck. As they moved past the ship's massive guns, Wilson had to check more corners to make sure they weren't caught. Slowly he and Landon moved past the guns, narrowly missing two Soviet Marines who were passing the gun. When they reached the ship's control tower, Landon managed to spot a lone guard watching over the deck from the second floor. Landon grabbed Wilson's shoulder, and pointed him to the guard. \"Son-of-a-bitch.\" ,Wilson gasped. The guard was standing calmly on the walkway, casually waving his body from side to side. He held his RPD with and almost knightly stature, which Wilson found almost amusing at the current moment. There was only one thing he could do. Raising his rifle, he put the guard's head between the crosshairs; and pulled the trigger. The bullet came out of the barrell silently, and entered into the guard's head in a spectacullar burst of blood. \"Let's get moving.\", he said to Wilson, before walking out into the light. That Ruski sure loved his job, huh?\" Landon sarcastically asked. After Landon's comments, the team moved up, silently, on to the deck above. With the guard dead, the pair finally was able to reach the command center, it was empty. \"Okay, we made it, now let's find what we came for, some goddamn answers.\" said Wilson. Landon began searching alongside his partner, attempting to translate the notes scribbled on to a map. in the mean time, Wilson searched a few small lockers on the opposite wall, containg not much aside from a few uniforms and miscellanea. Landon then began to read, \"Left port in Kamchatka, crew of 900, 3 ship escort. Carrying 750 tons *shit!* of cargo to be delivered to \"Dashkov\" (?) January 24, 1968 1:20 P.M. East Berlin Colonel Dashkov sat in his UAZ patiently as the driver drove to the General's headquarters. On the other side of the road, T-62s, T-64s, T-55s, and BMPs passed him on the other side of the road; each sporting hitchhiking soldiers going to their mysterious destinations. Dashkov noticed that the buildings were especially gray today, partly because of the overcast weather rhat the two Berlins were having this week; which made him somewhat depressed. For even the most overly-nationalistic person that Dashkov was, he enjoyed the sunlight very much. The driver turned down one of the intersecting streets, going past a small guard-post as he did. The soldiers that were on duty got up from their card game to salute the Colonel. When the Colonel's car passed, the two soldiers sat down at the small table and began playing their game again. Dashkov opened his small folder again, and looked at the date. February 2nd, 1968. Such a close date to do an extreme event like the Marshal's planning, thought Dashkov. He closed the folder just as the driver looked back, to withhold the secrecy of the operation. If any information about the date got out to the common soldier, the whole plan would fail. \"What is it!\" hissed Dashkov, looking at the driver with fire in his eyes. The driver smirkerd, \"We are here, sir.\" Dashkov looked outside, and saw the Generals headquarters outside of his window. On the roof of the five-story building, a single flag flew in the wind. Dashkov's driver opened the door for him, and the trenchcoat sporting Dashkov stepped outside. He began to walk on the snowy ground, which crunched beneath his feet as he walked towards the stairs. He began to walk up the concrete stairs, and two guards opened the wooden doors open for the Colonel. He was hit with a warm burst of air from the heater that was running, and began walking towards the elevator. By the time Dashkov had reached the fifth floor, the meeting was already in place. He walked into the room just as the General was speaking. \"........Demidov, your division will push through the Fulda Gap while General Alekseev will take his division past the wall. I will personally take control of the attack on the pigs in Moscow.\" Dashkov began to speak nervously, \"General Bure, I am sorry I am late...\" Bure waved down Dashkov in a patient manner, \"Sit down Dashkov. We have much planning to do.\" Dashkov calmly sat at the table, and looked at the map of Europe that was placed on the table. \"750 tons of what, Landon?\", asked Wilson, turning from looking at the ships log. \"Of weapons, George. AKs, RPDs, RPGs; you name it.\", said Landon, moving his hand through his hair. Wilson walked over to the map Landon was looking at, and began looking at it for himself, \"What's some Soviet need with 900 soldiers and 750 tons of weapons and explosives in Siberia?\" \"Well...it looks like they actually loaded this on board in Siberia, it's shipping out to Southeast Asia...\" Landon said, his voice trailing off. \"Fuck, this isn't the show-of-force Langley thought it was, it's a shipping run! Come on, help me collect this, we need photos, copies, anything and everything.\" Wilson and Landon grabbed everything they could and placed it in their waterproof cases, ensuring that the evidence would remain pristine. After what seemed like a few seconds, Landon heard something, the clang of boots on metal, and bored Russian conversation. More guards. Just as Landon was searching for a way out, Wilson called for him, \"Jack, Jack come on!\" Wilson had secured a line from the outside of the bridge to the lower deck, which the two rushed down. As Landon stood silently on the main deck, he saw the shadows of the two guards projected on the ceiling of the command room; they were getting suspicious. Jack quickly flung open the steel door to one of the 14\" gun turrets and entered with Wilson, to his surprise, it was completely empty. There was no ammunition in the gun deck. The pair then proceded to move in to the bowels of the ship, in to the cargo hold. Wilson began to wander through the ship's halls, with Jack following him close behind. The halls were dimly lighted, and the smell of sea water radiated from the metal. Wilson turned his gun down every hallway he passed, ready to put a couple of holes into any Soviet he saw. And as he looked past one hallway, he did find five Soviets coming down one of the hallways. \"\u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b!\" ,screamed one of the soldiers, which made Wilson quickly duck behind the metal wall. AK rounds began to fly through the other hallway, hitting random pipes and pieces of metal as the bullets ricochetted around the walls. Wilson blindfired with his CAR-15, managing to hit two of the Soviets and leaving three others to deal with. Wilson felt a tap on his shoulder, and felt a grenade go into his hand. Wilson gave the thumbs up to Jack, pulled the grenade's pin, and threw it to the soldiers. The soldiers began to scream, trying to gain a grip of the grenade and try to throw it away; when Wilson heard it explode. Some blood and chunks of meat went onto the ground in front of Wilson, which made him sick when he looked at it. Suddenly, alarms began to sound around the ship, most likely because of the large sound the grenade had made. \"We need to move, WIlson.\", said Jack, quickly running around him and running down the hall. In just a few seconds, Wilson gained his composure and began running after Jack, still holding his CAR-15 with both of his hands. \"Where exactly are we going?\", said Wilson, turning down a hallway just as Jack did. \"Munitions room,\" said Landon, smirking even though Wilson couldn't see hjs face \",we're going to blow this ship up.\" \"Why the hell would you expect them to have reserves ready if there aren't any shells in the gun?\" Wilson asked. \"Soviets are being economical, George, they crammed something even better than bullets or HE shells in that room. I saw it on the manifest.\" Landon replied, sprinting with Wilson as fast as possible. \"What then?\" Rebuttled Wilson. \"Jet fuel.\" Landon and Wilson reached the door marked \"Munitions\" Landon kicked the door in, whilst Wilson killed the few guards present, shocked at the team's presence. As Wilson walked in, Landon threw him a small green satchel bag. \"It's full of remote dentonated C4. Lets get moving.\" Wilson began to take the C4 out of the bag, and placed it on some of the huge shells that were in front of him while Landon placed in on the other rows. When they were done, Landon followed Wilson as he ran towards the stairs. As Wilson walked back into the first floor of the control tower, a burst of bullets from the doorway came spraying out like a hose. Wilson ducked begind the entrance to the stairwell, and quickly fired out a burst of bullets. Wilson heard a death scream, and he quickly ran out with Landon, firing at the door so the soldiers couldn;t shoot at them. Wilson and Landon quickly opened another door, and began running across the battleship's deck through gunfire. Everytime they took cover, Wilson would fire a shot from his CAR-15; managing to send three Soviets face first on the deck, dead. When they reachced the end of the deck, Landon shouted to Wilson \"We're going to need to jump!\" Wilson stared down in to the water for a moment, then shouted \"Well what are we waiting for?!\" He dived in and Landon quickly followed, diving to at least partially avoid the gunfire from the decks above. After a minute or so of swimming, the team finally reached their boat, which was now a safe distance from the ship. Landon climbed aboard and pulled Wilson up. He then handed him a victory cigar and the detonator. \"Not today ya red bastards.\" said Jack as he presed the button with Wilson, who sat and enjoyed the sight of the sinking vessel while waiting for evac. \"Look at that!\", Wilson said to Landon, pointing on to the other retreating ships \"Guess they knew what was best for them.\" Wilson and Landon began to laugh in the middile of the Artic Ocean, with the freezing wind still nipping at their faces and the only warmth coming from the burning oil from the ship. January 25, 1968 10:10 A.M. The Kremlin, Moscow \"A battleship was destroyed by what!: yelled the Soviet President into his office's phone \" A 'muntions explosion'? How on earth do muntions just explode in the middle of the Bering Strait!?!\" As the President yelled into his phone, General Bure and Colonel Dashkov, along with three other armed men, entered the office. Bure's men had quickly destroyed all oppostion outside the Kremlin's wall; and Bure's coup plan was going to plan. The President,, turning his head towards the small group of men, dropped his phone even as the Navy Captain was talking to him.  \"Please don't\", said the President; before Bure raised his pistol and shot him straight in the head. The bullet went through the President's skull, sending his dead body flying down to the ground, His blood began to pour on the ground, but the already all red carpet hid it well, Bure began to walk over to the President's table, his table now, and picked up the phone. \"Colonel? This is your new leader Alexander Bure. I need you to contact Admiral Tolstoy in Kamchatka, and tell him to send the fleet back out into the Artic.\" Colonel Dashkov looked out the window of the former President's office, and watched as the tanks drove along the road, securing any pockets of the President's loyalists and destroying them without mercy. At the entrance, new Soviet soldiers were already standing guard at the gate, while other soldiers watched the captured political members that were working in the Kremlin at the timel all of them supporters of the President's downward road for the Soviet Union. Dashkov walked away from the window and began to look around the President's office, which was plastered with Communist pictures and symbols to the roof. The President wasn't a true Communist at all, only a dog of the Capitalists to the West! He began to tear down the pictures of the former President, and stomped on them with his muddy boots. A new revolution had begun, and the West was going to feel it's wraith.Chapter 2  February 1st, 1968 2:59 A.M. Saigon, Vietnam \"Why the fuck are we doing patrols so early for, man?\", complained one Marine inside the M113's hold, waving his arms around like a clown \"So what if the North Vietnameze invade a couple of cities? I was getting my ass laid god dammit!\" Landon and Wilson looked at each other and rolled their eyes, being a sardine can with a complaining marine was hell more than getting up at 2:00 A.M. to do some patrols. Wilson and Landon had done harder things than this. \"Shut your fucking mouth, Marine\" said the Sergeant, loading his pistol as he did \"If Command says we're going to do patrols, we're fucking doing the patrols.\" The Marine scoffed, \"I'm just tired of it Sarge. All we're doing giving the VC more advantage to kill us all, while Command gets to sit back behind lines and go yank off....\" Without warning, and explosion rocked the APC, shaking everyone that was in the cabin. \"AMBUSH!!!\" yelled the driver.  The Sergeant quickly finished loading his weapons, and stood up in the small cabin to speak, \"Alright Marines, let's lock-and-load!!!\" The cabin's door slowly began to open, and Wilson managed to look out and see the fiery sky that was lit up the attacks from all around the city. The NVA had made a huge offensive into South Vietnam, and the U.S. was still trying to get it's act together. \"Everyone move!\" yelled the Sergeant,quickly running out with his Marines following him close behind. Wilson and Landon also ran out, but quickly took cover inside a small grocery store. Bullets began to fly through the already broken windows as Wilson loaded his unsilenced CAR-15, and began firing at the opposite building from his window cover. Meanwhile, Landon got a raido message from one of the duo's new heli pilots,\"This is Alan Johanson, I see that you guys got some NVA on your ass; and I'm here to kickass.\" Suddenly, bullets began to tear into the apartment complex that the NVA soldiers wee hiding in, sending electrical sparks and dust into the air. \"Holy shit...\" gasped Wilson, lowering his CAR-15. Landon approached Wilson inside the small market carrying his Full-auto Remington. \"What did I miss?\" He asked. \"You don't want to know.\" replied Wilson. \"Sierra-Alpha-Delta X-Ray, this is Marine helicopter Romeo 1, I apoligize for my co-pilot's lack of discipline but we have new orders for you from Langley.\" said the other pilot. \"Go ahead Romeo 1.\" Landon told him. \"You've been instructed to get to the embassy, evacuation of American civilians is paramount. They want you to break the siege on that specific block.\" \"And then?\" Landon queried. \"And then mark targets for airstrikes via helicopter, one'll be waiting for you at the embassy.\" \"Thanks Romeo 1. Okay, we need to get to the embassy before it gets shot to shit. How far's the embassy, Wilson?\" said Landon. \"12 blocks.\" said Wilson in response. \"Than let's get to work.\" Landon said firmly. Wilson began to move outside of the store, and began to shout to the Marine Sergeant \"We've got a embassy to evacuate, Sergeant. Twelve blocks; can you guys run that fast?\" The Sergeant calmly lowered his M60, and shouted back, \"Of course we can, 'cause we're the best of the best!\" Wilson and Landon began running down the debris filled street, with the small detachment of U.S. Marines following close behind. In the skies above, F-4 Phantoms flew bombing missions on NVA tanks and other targets to weaken the attack on Saigon. While Wilson and Landon were running, a number of hidden NVA soldiers began to fire down on the streets, hitting some of the Marines and bouncing off the hull of the \"Morning Glory\" APC. Wilson took aim and began to fire at the windows of a four story buiding, managing to kill about three of the soldiers. He then quickly took cover behind a car, where Landon was already firing his rifle at the NVA. \"How the far is this fucking place?\" yelled Wilson to Landon, firing his rifle once more. Landon fired one more shot, and quickly took cover. \"The Embassy is still a couple of blocks away, but with these guys on our asses; we're not going to get there in time.\" By the time Landon was finished, another F-4 came screeching across the sky; dropping it's bombs on the apartment. The building exploded, sending even more debris into the air. \"Thank god for the Air Force.\", said Wilson, jumping over the car and running over to the \"Morning Glory\". The Sergeant, who was still firing at a small group of NVA wholed up in a small park. The Sergeant looked down to Wilson, and stopped firing the APC's M-60. He smiled \"Sorry about all the rough shit, sir. Vietnameze giving us hell right now, and we're going to keep hitting rough spots.\" \"Just get us there Sergeant, and we'll handle the rough spots.\", said Wilson, quickly jumping on the APC. Wilson then yelled over to Landon, who was still firing at the NVA solders. When he heard Wilson's yell, he came running over through a burst of RPD gunfire. He then jumped onto the APC, and fired at the small garden. The 12 gauge buckshot from Landon's shotgun tore through the small shrubs and fenceing the NVA were hiding behind, leaving the G.I.s stunned and Landon momentarily deaf from empyting his magazine so quickly. The APC continued to roll down the streets, stopping for the frequent mortar and RPG attacks the NVA attempted. After putting down what seemed like half the invading force, Wilson and Landon finally reached the embassy, it was dark outside, save for the pillars of flame and AA fire going in to the sky.\u00a0:What the hell, this place isn't what command made it out to be.\" Wilson stated \"You mean under some kind of Barbarian siege? If that's what you were trying to say, then yeah, I'm worried too.\" Landon replied as he and Wilson advanced on the door, along with 6-or-so other G.I.s. Landon switched on his radio beacon, letting their evac chopper know they had found a safe LZ, and stood next to the door, his gun at the ready, with Wilson. Wilson aimed the barrel of his rifle at the locks, than the hinges, and fired. Landon swung his sgotgun like a club the throw the doors open, ordering two soldiers to stay and guard the entrance. The group heard a few small explosions in the distance as they cautiosly swept the hallways, and as they kicked in the door at the rear, they were more than surprised to see that the civilians, mostly dplomats, were already on a chopper dusting off from the courtyard. An Air Force Major turned in the team's ddirection and yelled at the grunts to start unboxing weapons for the guards already present. \"You must by SAD X-Ray, glad you showed up.\" \"Wait a minute, you don't need our help!\" Landon yelled.\"There's no VC, no NVA, no nothing for at least 3 blocks.\" \"Yes, we know, but we had to get you here without letting your friends know really why.\" Wilson and Landon stareed at him. \"Come to the conference room, I'll show you.\" Though the sounds of gunfire still raged outside, the three men calmly walked to the Conference room with ease; the Airforce Major saluting other soldiers along the way as he did. George and Jack, however; remained a mixture of nervousness about the top secret meeting and anger after being forced to come all the way to the U.S. Embassy when no one needed to be rescued. That was until the three came into the room with high ranking generals and CIA agents, who all sat around a brown wooden table watching the three come in. George and Jack quickly saluted, when the Major motioned them to both sit down. After taking a seat, the highest ranking person in the room, a full general stood up and began pacing back and forth, \"Gentlemen, we apologize for the trouble we've caused you but I'm sure that Major Thompson here has already told you our motivation. So I'll cut to the chase. Two days ago a Red MiG was shot down over the forest near the border, a SOG team was sent to examine the wreckage, and they found this.\" The general signaled two CIA agents to present a burnt and dented piece of shoebox-sized steel, with a lens. \"This, along with a Russian pilot and modified engines and weaponry is some of what we believe is being shipped into the country. We want this back in the states and examined, and you need to get it there.\" \"And that's our extract mission?\" Wilson asked. \"Yes it is.\" Another general told him. As Landon, Wilson, and two other CIA men began to haul the camera outside, the Major said to them, \"We left a few toys for in the chopper. Have fun.\" Wilson and Landon both nodded, and continued walking towards the helicopter. \"This is some pretty weird shit,\" said Landon, bending himself down in front of the CIA agents to get good view of it from all angles \"Looks almost like my View-Master I had when I was a kid.\" One of the CIA began to speak, \"That's because it is.\" Jack gave the agent a strange look as they walked to the helicopter, but Wilson automatically knew what he was talking about. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, he had infiltrated one of the missile sites in the jungles and had found one of the same metal boxes in a the CO's quarters. It contained very top secret information about the placement of silos in new locations, chemical weapons being placed along with the nuclear missiles, and even possible detachements of Soviet soldiers. Whatever was in this metal box had to get back to the U.S., because Wilson knew it was something the Soviets really didn't want the Americans to know about. \"Howdy guys!!\" shouted the extract pilot, the very same that had helped in a fire support mission for the two \"Welcome to Air Johanson, the one stop for some kick-ass flying!\" \"What happened to the first pilot?\" asked Landon, who was looking at Wilson with a I'm very nervous about this look. \"Oh, you mean Cpt. Ernest? Yeah, he got shot in the leg by a sniper and he had to get MEDVAC'd. Don't worry though, I'm pretty good at this flying buisness.\" \"Invest in thicker glass I told 'em! Those goddamn idiots in the brass.\" Landon shouted as he jogged towards the chopper with Wilson. \"Alright then, it's about a 12 mile flight to the nearest secure airstrip, and your ticket out. But since there aren't enough gunships to go around...\" \"We have to support ground forces, we know.\" Landon told the pilot. \"Right you are.\" Johanson said in reply. \"And everything you need is back there: M202's, M60's, Flare markers, you name it!\" \"Let's gat to work, then.\" Wilson smirked at Jack, as he hoisted a weapon in to his hands. \"Ha Ha Ha! Charlie, hre we come! Woo!\" Johanson eagerly shouted upon liftoff. It didn't take long for Landon and Wilson to see the intensity of the battle hidden from them at ground level, fires burned in many of the city's poor areas, and insurgents could be seen scurrying around US platoons like ants. One of the first engagements reached by the chopper was a battle for the extravagant prize of an apartment building. About 20 Americans on the gound shooting up at about an equivalent number of Vietnamese in the windows. Jack told the pilot to fly in low and slow, so he and Wilson could mow down as many of the VC as possible, which they did, before finally firing a rocket in to the buildings corner and sending the floors above sliding down on an angle. But everyone aboard feared that this was just a part of a very, very long flight.Chapter 3  Langely Falls, Virginia. 12:00 P.M. \"Son of a bitch\" gasped the Director, staring into the huge metal block that was laying on his table. \"Our point exactly.\" Landon told him. \"We've severly underestimated the amount of support the Red's are putting behind the North. It's become apparent that trying to take the easy way out is impossible, we need to stop the problem at the source, cut off the head.\" \"And where would this 'head' be, Mr. Director?\" Wilson asked, but he was quickly uninterrupted by two technicians saying that the captured film has been developed. After flipping through projection after projection, most of them showing that the Vietnamese were well aware of the movements of nearly every platoon, the schedules of nearly every bombing run, and the paths of nearly every US supply route, Wilson's question was answered. A single photo marked \"Test\" showed the team everyting they needed to know. The picture was of a Russian base, from more than 50,000 feet up, well beyond the cieling of any MiG. \"Oh, Goddamnit.\" The Director said as he leaned in at the photo. \"That plane wasn't our spy, only the messenger. Soviet Long-Rangers have been doing more snooping than anyone else.\" The Director pointed to an Air Force general and instructed him to carpet bomb any piece of flat ground with a hangar north of Da Nang, and sent Wilson and Landon out to the Kazakh Desert to find and destroy their plant. Kazakh Desert, Soviet Union. February 2nd, 1968 5:00 P.M. \"Two tangos on that hill over there, Wilson,\" said Landon, tapping on Wilson's sholder and pointing forward. Wilson aimed his rifle up to the small hill in front of him, and he indeed did see two Soviet soldiers standing on the small dirt hill. \"Let's take them out, Jack,\" said Wilson. 'I'll take the one on the right. Three, two...\" A pair of muffled shots rang out in the sandstorm as the two guards fell. Wilson and Landon dragged them behind a dune, coughing. \"The storm's picking up. There's no time to steal the uniforms, just take the AK's, I don't want to risk a jam in this weather.\" Landon said.\"You got the thermal?\" \"Right here.\" Wilson replied. He scanned the horizon, his breathing now audible thanks to the gas mask and hood getup needed for the sand-laden air. \"Got it, less than half a click north. Guards are heading back in, I don't think they're enjoying the storm either.\" \"Time to move, then.\" Landon said, rising up and vaulting over the dune alongside Wilson. After a trek through the sand, they reached the base perimeter, taking advantage of the security lapse, the team decided to first sabotage the radio tower before heading in to the main hangars. Wilson pryed open a box near the base of the tower and began smashing dials and snipping wires, but a speaker attached to the opposite leg of the tower began to mutter in Russian, \"We may need repairs on tower B, half of incoming drone signals are dark.\" Drones?, thought Wilson, What are the Russians doing with Drones? After Wilson had finished with his escapade, he signaled Jack to follow him on the way to the hangers. They moved quickly in the sandstorm-striken weather, easily concelling their movements to the guards outside as the ran for the doors. Wilson and Landon both had minor trouble breathing in their masks, but it was better than having sand get in their eyes and mouth. When they arrived at the hanger, both of them put their backs againist the wall as two Soviet guards walked out of the large hanger doors, talking about a soccer game that had been played between the Soviet and East German teams the day before. When their bodies disappeared into the sand, Wilson led the plunge into the hanger; with Landon following close behind. When both of them got inside, the quickly gasped at the sight in front of them. A massive plane was sitting in front of them, almost exactly the same to a MiG-17. But the most amazing part was that it had no cockpit, only a series of painted on windows that made it look like it was real, and that it........ \"....it's a bomb,\" said Landon, almost gasping under his breath \"It's a unmanned suicide plane.\" \"That's not all, I think we've found our spies.\" Landon said as he pointed to a sereies of what looked to him like miniature blackbirds - TU123's. \"I don't get it, the Soviet's want to drive the US out of southeast asia with the VC, but why be so secretive about it now? It's like they want to control everything directly from the Kremlin.\" Jack was spot on in this assessment, but he had no idea just who \"they\" actually were. His thoughts were interrupted, however, by the roar of a whistle in the distance. \"Jack, get over here!\" Wilson shouted from the second floor of the building. By the time Landon finished climbing the stairs, he saw Three guards all lying limp in their chairs with their throats slit. Wilson quickly pointed out the Russian train stocked with oil and cargo cars, it stopped as the tracks just ahead of it had been covered in sand, and more than a hundred soldiers disembarked and began walking for the base, seeking assistance. The plans for demolition had become much, much harder. \"Son of a bitch\", Wilson gasped. This mission was getting quickly out of hand, just like in Cuba almost a years ago, and he need to figure out the plan. \"Landon, finish up with those pictures and lets start planting those charges.\" Landon nodded in agreement and quickly ran downstairs, with Wilson close by. While Landon took the last remaining pictures of the Tu-123's, Wilson guarded the hanger doors with his CAR-15, watching for any movements outside. The dust storm had cleared, and now the shadows of the Soviet soldiers were the only thing he could see. \"Done!\", whispered Landon; making Wilson automatically get out his demo charges and begin planting them on the drones. The two began planting the two charges each on each of the five Tu-123's in the room, placing one on the hull underneath and one in the back. \"I still don't understand it, Landon.\", said Wilson \"I know the Soviets have been heloing the NVA and VC a long time, but what gives them the idea to make half-suicide half-recon drones?\" Landon shrugged, \"You think it might be that coup leader in Moscow? What was it, General Bure? He might be building these things just to show \"who's boss\". \"Damn fair assessment, George.\" Landon said. \"But I don't think he want's to show the power of 'the party' I think he wants to let us know he runs the show. The drones, well, let's hope that he's keeping 'em confined to 'Nam.\" Landon finished placing the last charge, a few were placed directly underneath the drones. While the remaining ones were over the barrels of HE chemical fuel. As Wilson and Landon scurried to the back of the hangar, the stranded Russians pried open the main doors and began asking for assistance, when the base personnel met them and followed them back outside, Wilson and Landon lay silent behind a crate. After a brief few seconds of silence, one guard started up a crane truck (the running motor was a dead giveaway) and began to head for the train. \"Alright, we've gotta do this Landon\", said Wilson \"Or we are as good as dead.\" Landon, holding his CAR-15, acknowledged Wilson's comment; and Wilson began to pull out his radio. \"Zulu Team, this is Watchdog; we are ready to move towards the production factory, where is your current position?\" Landon waited for the Jason Carter to reply, which in a short time he did. \"Watchdog, this is Zulu team, we are directly behind the production factory in the Vehicle Depot. Find anything about what exactly we're blowing the shit out of?\" Wilson chuckled softly, and spoke into the radio again, \"Drones, Tu-123s if I'm correct. Seems are Soviet friends are building some suicide drones for use on us, but that's not really certain.\" Carter swore under his breath \"Alright, we'll be here. Just make sure you give us a single, ok?\" Wilson flicked his radio off, and grabbed his CAR-15, and began moving towards the factory's direction with Landon, and started moving past the hanger's doors silently as not to alert the gaurds. He grabbed one of the edges of the left hand door, peering into the building to see what the Soviet's were bringing in. When he saw the barrells of tank fuel come into the hanger, he quicly left with Landon to go towards the factory. This was going to be a big signel. Wilson and Landon both laid down in the sand dune above the main production area, overlooking an ordanance yard holding numerous Soviet Army vehicles: tanks, helicopters, APCs, jeeps. All of these vehicles were either laying on the ground or on train craters, ready to be sent out to various Soviet bases around the Soviet Union and its sattelites. Wilson and Landon were laying down in the sand, with their rifles pointed down on the yard. \"Are you sure your ready for this?\" asked Landon. \"Ain't I always?\" Wilson smirked. Landon put a hand in the air and counted down. Five.....four.....three....two......one... Wilson, eagerly hit the detonator, sending metal, wood, glass and every other material that might go in to a military base in to the sky. But Landon was quick to notice a whitish-yellow tint in the sand laden wind blowing around the base. But just as this appeared the team's HAZMAT air monitors went off, signifying a leak of chemical fuel in to the air. Landon shut his off immediately and threw his mask on once more, saying \"We'll be fine, we've got the gear to make it through this.\" \"Our ride doesn't.\" Wilson warned. \"Shit man!\", yelled Jason Carter through gunfire, talking to the radio through his gas mask, \"What the hell did you guys do? Blow up some Mustard Gas or something?\" \"Now is not the right time, Jason!\", said Wilson, quickly sliding down the sand dune. He aimmed hs CAR-15, and began firing at any target he could see. He fired just one shot from his rifle, and managed to get some poor Soviet straight through the neck; who collapsed to the ground while holding his bloody neck. Then, he aimmed the rifle to his right, and fired two quick volleys of shots; sending two Soviets onto to a UAZs dashboard face first and another into the concrete. The rest were beginning to die from the gas in the air. \"Let's move, Jack! We got some bombs to set!!\", yelled Wilson, just as the base's alarms began to come online. Wilson and Landon began running for the bases doors, still checking to see that no Soviet reinforcements were coming to save the day. Then, when the two reached the metal doors, the two both kicked them open to breach the factory. \"Hey fellas.\" said Jason, before throwing one of the Soviet soldiers off the edge of the catwalk. \"Damn, Jason.\", said Landon, \"Maybe I should stop being so rough on newcomers?\" \"So does that mean you will?\" Wilson asked. \"No, but put this on.\" Landon replied as he handed Jason a mask to replace the scarf pulled over his face. \"So where to? I need to get this film out of here?!\", Landon frantically asked. Wilson thought as fast as he could, trying to think of a way out of the base. \"How about we just use that truck over there?\", said Jason, pointing over to a small covered truck. \"Better yet.\" Said Landon, pointing to an IFV just across the lot. Wilson and Jason followed him to it, Jason taking over driving with Landon and Wilson manning the gun, the first round went off in the direction of the front gate, with the turret quickly rotating to take aim at the remaining Soviets behind them, but the BMP's cannon made quick work of them. \"Team 1, have all long range defences been neutralized?\" the helo pilot asked. Wilson turned to look at the carnage, \"Oh, yeah.\" \"Copy, we'll meet you two clicks out on the highway.\" It was now time to return to Washington and get to the heart of the Russian spy drone project, and the people behind it.TheAmazingBBP  WHERE IS THE TRIGGER?! WHERE IS THE TRIGGER?! WHERE IS THE TRIGGER?! WHERE IS THE TRIGGER?! WHERE IS THE TRIGGER?! WHERE IS THE TRIGGER?! WHERE IS THE TRIGGER?!The Basics  I am a turtle. With a golden shell. With an emblem and clan tag on it. I have been a Bureaucrat here at the wiki since September 15, 2013. I am 16 years old. I am also an Australian. Se hablar alguno espa\u00f1ol.My stance on modern-day pop-culture  Most contemporary culture in the US is screwed up beyond repair.My stance on gaming  Playstation 4 will be the objective best console. There's no doubt about it, stupid. Xbox One fanboys/fangirls can go away. BF4 is a great, enjoyable game, but is very broken and desperately needs to be fixed. It also needs a menu-based squad system.My socio-political views  I also am conservative-leaning young man. So yes, I support overseas military involvement, allying with Israel for better or for worse, tax breaks for businesses, and cracking down on immigration, and I oppose homosexual marriage, gun control, environmentalism, feminism, polygamy, welfare, legalizing weed, and abortion. Yes, I watch FOX News, and I don't bother looking at MSNBC, CNN, or any other liberal-aligned media. Come at me; they call us the 'right wing' for a reason. And don't bother calling me intolerant or a homophobe, they're both pointless insults and are both pretty much always used in a context that is contradictory to their actual meaning. I also abhor socialism and communism. Hate them with a passion. So what does this all mean, exactly? It means I support the New Conglomerate passionately.Religious Beliefs  I'm a Christian. I believe that the Bible is the infallible word of God. Now, to straighten matters out, I'm not a religious 'nut'. I can socialize, make friends, joke around, and have fun (not the naughty kind, gotta stay pure) like anyone else. Those of you who think I'm missing out on a good time: I'm not. Banging ugly hookers (likely with STDs), experiencing hangovers (throwing up in bed), dropping out of school to smoke illegal substances, and having no recollection of the party I drank at the night before doesn't sound like my kind of 'fun'. I'm not 'stupid and gullible' as most 'expert scientists' and other atheists would portray people like me as. There is plenty of scientific evidence that supports Biblical claims (btw evolution =/= science). I'd love to have a discussion with you on that. I might not be able to answer all your questions (because I don't study in that area), but I may possibly direct you to those who can.Other extremely important information  I drink Coca-Cola. Pepsi supports gays, Dr. Pepper is nasty, Coca-Cola is better /discussion Emelie Nereng looks, sounds, and is beautiful. If only I could actually understand Norwegian...Related and/or Unrelated Videos To do list Azuris  ...Im scared...and freaked out! I don't know f i should become an admin, I don't know if i should move my FF, I should right?, And I'm scared because the layout is squished in. AHHH  01:59, August 8, 2010 (UTC) Wait, What. Im not good with editing categories and templates.  02:06, August 8, 2010 (UTC) So i put my articles name? He, Like I said, Should I be an Admin? I know it's not that time right now, But I would like to be ready when all the other Authors come. Maybe only a Sysop. I will...maybe nominate myself in the future. Your buddy, BA6, Whos sig doesn't work. So should I name it...The Delta Op or something. Its about a 1st SFOF-D or Delta force operator. Thanks BA6 Hey C_E, How about, \"The Shadow Operator\". Hmm?  02:20, August 8, 2010 (UTC)Assistance.  Is there anything I can do to help with the creation of the FF wiki? Killerkitten 02:28, August 8, 2010 (UTC)Fan-Fiction of the month?  We did that back on the codjoinops wiki. So i was thinking, If available, We get admins/Good authors (So not someone with a one paragraph FF) read the nominations and read the stories, Then figuire out which one is the best. So let's say someone votes for your Fan-Fiction. SO then I go and read your FF, Then we match that up against other FF that got voted. SO we look on story, Grammar, Plotling, Amount, Quality. Ya know what I mean. (Hell thats the second time I said that to you)  18:18, August 8, 2010 (UTC)Policies  I know its not really my place to discuss this, but some of the policies on our policy page are somewhat irrelevant to the puurpose of this wiki (i.e. Most of the page and file policies.) I believe this wiki should have its own page and file policies. We can make a firum on it. All in all, the wiki is looking pretty impressive, considering its been active for less than a day.  Rambo362  18:22, August 8, 2010 (UTC) Awsome. I figured that there are no perks here and that if there's a character, the person who made him/her can make one up, so those automaticly have no purpose here. Also, we should make a policy about editing other people's fanfics.  Rambo362  18:38, August 8, 2010 (UTC) Nice.  Rambo362  18:52, August 8, 2010 (UTC)Wait  Are there any Sysops? I know your a crat and so is CoD4.  19:14, August 8, 2010 (UTC) Got it...Nevermind. It's un appropriate.  21:54, August 8, 2010 (UTC) I could go for a Sysop position once all the authors read their notices and move over. Like on the Killzone wiki, If I can be a admin, I would want to be an admin before the rush starts (IE, When Killzone 3 comes out or in this case, When people start hanging out.) Just a throught,  22:20, August 8, 2010 (UTC)Hello My comrade.  Hi CodExpert im a joining this wiki!Isn't that a good thing eh.Could you add a template soldier to my page?tHAT WOULD BE AWESOME MAN!!thanks{{SUBST:Signatures/Coolcoolman9}} 19:38, August 8, 2010 (UTC)Offensive Language Template  Since this is a fanfic wiki, should we have an offensive language template or something to that effect?  Rambo362  21:37, August 9, 2010 (UTC) Cool. On that note, we also should adopt a policy on racism. You figure that fan made things can contain offensive slurs if not regulated.  Rambo362  12:08, August 10, 2010 (UTC) Ok. That includes it being in a fanfic, right?  Rambo362  12:48, August 10, 2010 (UTC) Cool. Thanks.  Rambo362  12:51, August 10, 2010 (UTC)Page Mission 0  Is it ok if the writing is like this for my Fan-Fiction?Heres a link Misssion 0 \"Im out!\" COOLCOOLMAN9 02:45, August 10, 2010 (UTC)Language Policy  Would we be aloud to use swears such as \"shit\" or \"motherfucker\" in our fiction? Of course, it should not be in a way like \"HAHAHA!!! TAKE THAT FUCKING SHIT-FACED MOTHERFUCKER!!!!\" but in a way more like \"Oh, fuck!\" or \"Oh, shit!\". Would this sort of language be aloud in a CoD fanfic? Lucario of the Gods (talk 15:19, August 11, 2010 (UTC) Sorry, but also how bout a warning on top of a page that has strong swear words in it. The warning would read \"This fiction contains mild/strong lsanguage. Please do not read if you will feel offended by any language used in this fiction.\" or something like that. Lucario of the Gods (talk 15:21, August 11, 2010 (UTC)Infobox  I'm having a bit of trouble putting in an infobox on \"Elloway\" can you put one it that I can edit? Darkraider09 23:48, August 11, 2010 (UTC) Thanks, now I can do it on all my character pages now Darkraider09 21:53, August 18, 2010 (UTC)Fan-Fiction ended another one an the way  Well, i ended my Fallen Angels FF, And I will have another one...Its kinda pish-pish. Its about the story of Soldiers after the Russian invasion of the U.S. in 2016. Good Idea? It would be like mushes of action, with bits of civilains, parts of camp life, SOunda good?  02:41, August 13, 2010 (UTC)Requested featured articles  I saw you nominated my article. Am i allowed to vote for support as author? Bumblebeeprime09's Quarters|Radio|Records 01:46, August 14, 2010 (UTC)Author Guru  I just thought I want to be an Author Guru on this wiki, Ya know, Ill be the guy to ask for storys. So can you make me a template/something that say \"this user is the author guru.\" I thought about that when some FF were wierd and not so good. Thanks, And your doing a really good job.  19:59, August 14, 2010 (UTC)Vandalism.  I caught 2 acts of vandalism, both on BravoAlphaSix's Fallen Angels. The first, older one was where an anon deleted everything but the gallery. The second deleted the gallery. Joeyaa (OMG ITZ JOEY!!!!) reverted the edits while i typed this up, but i am also willing to do a vandal patrol thingy if you feel this wiki needs one. I also caught a guy vandalizing the lost nuke, which i reported to COD4. Bumblebeeprime09's Quarters|Radio|Records 18:05, August 28, 2010 (UTC)CoD Wiki's Roleplays  I was wondering if we should move them here, considering this is a FanFic wiki and they are technically Fan Fictions.  Rambo362 Well yeah. I had planned to bring it up on the roleplay's talk pages. I wanted to make sure that it was ok with you to bring them here.  Rambo362 Ok, I'll go and put a request to move it to here.  Rambo362Hi  I know this is a really weird question, but can I be an adminstrator/sysops? I'm good at roleplaying and I can take care of the wiki when you're gone. 22:37, September 2, 2010 (UTC) Do you want to create an interactive roleplay with me?-- 00:20, September 3, 2010 (UTC)CoD Wiki  My brother made that account. He thinks its funny because he watches equals 3 and sees trolling a lot.  Rambo362Damn Anon  I would like to report 203.168.37.48 for spamming inappropriate racist comments on a blog. Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 21:11, September 21, 2010 (UTC)Another Anon  Hey, this ano didn't do anything wrong AS AN ANON, but NeloAngelo97 is returning. Said Anon posted Nelo's FF (The Sigma Code). Just letting you know. Also (This is part of the above post), could I form a vandal patrol thingy? Cuz I catch more vandals here than on the CoD wiki, so yeah. Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 18:31, September 26, 2010 (UTC) Do i make a subpage or usergroup page? Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 19:03, September 26, 2010 (UTC) Okay, the page has been created, can you make some templates for us (well, me, since i'm the only person in it)? Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 19:41, September 26, 2010 (UTC) Oh, the vandal warning template, a counter-vandal userbox, etc. Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 19:46, September 26, 2010 (UTC) Can you make a logo for us? I don't have paint or photoshop or whatever, since i'm on a mac. Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 20:06, September 26, 2010 (UTC) Hi, Azuris! I haven't seen you in like, forever!

But I think that's a luxury. Not a curse. To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom. Good time to take...inventory. Out-gunned. Outnumbered. Out of our minds. On a suicide mission. But the sand and the rocks here, stained with thousands of years of warfare...They will remember us. For this.

Kill him.\" John PricePrologue:  Time:2006 Hours Date: September 6, 2016 23 hours after Sheperd's death Location: Aproximately 2 miles from Site Hotel Bravo Dylon Harris jumped out of the Black Hawk. The scene was too crowded, and he quickly regreted the jump. Still, he had a job to do. A man with black hair, blue eyes and entirely black outfit walked towards him. \" You must be Private 1st Class Dylon Harris, right?\". Dylon spotted the \"Major\" insignia on the uniform and quickly broke in salute: \"Sir!, PFC Dylon Harris reporting to you as requested!\". Major Frederickson returned the salute, \"At ease, Private\". The Major extended his hand toward Harris, in a more informal way. \"I think you are aware of the situation\" the Major began, pulling out a couple of cigarretes, offering one to Dylon. He accepted it, pulling his litter to lite both cigars. \"I've received part of the inform, sir, but aside from that, I know nothing, sir\" he answered, The Major stopped by a car, where there was a deadbag on the floor. \"Do you know who's the dead?\" he asked, and faced Dylon blankly. Dylon hesitated, but spoke: \"Yes, Lieutenant General Shepherd\" he answered, puffing smoke to the air. Fredrickson turned and dropped the smoke butt. Yep, that's him\" he lastly replied. Captain Petterson appeared from behind him, and quickly added more info: \"According to intel, this was the action of two ex-SAS operatives: former Captains John MacTavish and John Price\". \"MacTavish, I've heard that lastname. He holds the current record at 'The Pit' with 18.26 seconds, right?\" Dylon stated, trying to find a reason such a good soldier would do this mess. \"Exactly, that same guy\" Petterson answered. He looked around, and gave a nod to Frederickson. Dylon watched this and concluded that Frederickson and Petterson were friends, because there was no such way to threat a superior like that. Frederickson left and Petterson signaled Dylon to follow him. \"I don't want any hard feelings with the American operatives, but I will tell you because you are gonna be in the unit. Sheperd was in command of a NATO black ops unit, known as Task Force 141. Most of it was comprised of British SAS members, along with Australians, Canadians, and Americans. After the raid on Makarov's safe house, in the Caucasus Mountains, contact was lost with most of the unit, except General Sheperd\" \"Wait, are you implying that Lieutenant General Sheperd betrayed the Task Force 141?\" Dylon muttered, first amused, and then found some sense in the idea. Petterson took another look around and nodded, granting the soldier with a quick response. \"I'm afraid to tell you that most of the operatives on the squad believe this too, and we will be operating on that suspicion\" Petterson added, \"So, if you feel unconfortable about it, you may say so\". Dylan thought this for a second. \"I'm not\" he finally said, \"to be honest, I never liked him. He didn't cared for the men under his command, and would save no one's life but his own.\" Petterson looked into his eye and saw what he meant, but didn't trust him enough on it.Chapter 1: Briefing  36 hours after Sheperd's death Classified Location \"Ok, people, listen up!\" Petterson shouted over the noise. The whole room came to silence and everybody paid him attention. The screen behind him changed to feature two pictures. \"Please allow me introduce our targets to you\" he said, pointing to the picture, one of a young man, and the other an older one, \"former SAS Captains John \"Soap\" MacTavish and John Price. Aproximately 4 days ago, their Special Operations Task Force 141 lost any contact with Command. 12 hours later, these two guys killed General Sheperd at Site Hotel Bravo\" Petterson stopped to look at the unit's faces. Most of them were quite surprised. They knew that Shadow Company was the corp asigned to Sheperd's security, and the fact that they took down most of it and took out Sheperd meant that they were better...and more dangerous. \"Let me remember you that our main suspicion is that General Sheperd double crossed them, but it might also be backwards. I need you to stay focus and pay attention. Every single detail might play for us, or for them\". Petterson handed them booklets and proceeded, \"these booklets contain everything you need to know about our targets: Biography, training, asignments, awards, etc. Give them a full read, and keep it with you in case any doubt arises\". Suddenly, the door opened and Petterson was interrupted by Colonel James Green. Petterson stood in his place, making obvious his dislike, both for the interruption and for the Colonel. \"My apologies\", the Colonel said to Petterson, on a clearly sarcastic tone, \"I didn't knew you were having a Pj's party..... \"What do you want?\" said Petterson with a harsh tone. It was clear to every one that he wasn't happy to see Green. \"My apologies for interrupting\" Green continued in a sarcasric tone, which made Petterson get even more angry. \"this is Specialist Robert Myers, my adition to your tea...\" \"We already have enough operatives, thank you\" \"I'm sorry Scottie, I'm not asking you. Either you get him in or you are getting out\". Petterson thought about that last coment, and then decided to give the Specialist a chance: \"Do you have an special ability, kiddo?\" \"I'm a demo man, sir. I can blow the hardest buildings you get on my way\" The specialist was certainly younger than Petterson, but he retained a very serious air. \"Hummmm...ok, take your place with the team. You will be given a booklet telling you everything I've just said\" he concluded. \"May I speak with you in private, Captain?\" Green asked, obviously something not good for Petterson. Both men got out of the room, and Petterson supported himself on the wall outside the room, his arms folded in his chest. \"Now listen to me Petterson, because I wont say it twice: I am in charge of this operation, and if you mess it up, I will ground you in the deepest hole in the world, understood?\" Petterson felt his face burning, but he contained himself and confronted Green: \"Now listen to me, sick bastard. If you dare to get on my way, I'm gonna take care of you, because this is my team, and we are playing with my rules, understood?\" Petterson wanted to throw up, but he held it for himself: Showing weakness at this moment was practically like shooting himself in the head. Green looked the determination in Petterson's eyes and knew he had lost. With everything but a smile, Green left and Petterson knew he had won this one, so he allowed himself a smile. As he entered the room, he saw that the quietness that ruled before he left was replaced by an enormous disturb, more like if the people inside were High School kids and not soldiers. Petterson hitted the wooden desk, and the crowd went silent. He knew they were nervous, and he could not push them too hard without facing problems. \"Ok, people, listen. Intel suspects that the fugitives may be hiding on an old safehouse in Hamburg. We wil storm the safe house to see what we can find. Gear yourself up, we are leaving in 2 hours from now....\"Chapter 2: Safehouse  \"Alpha Leader, this Alpha Niner, confirmed activity on the street. Seems like a Russian Spetsnaz team. Hope they didn't caught our targets\" \"Bad news, Alpha Niner, keep me posted\" \"Roger Alpha Leader, Alpha Niner out\" Petterson embraced his F-2000 and signaled the team: \"Troubles dead ahead\" He shouldered his rifle and scouted the street: empty, at least for now. The rain was heavily pouring and was threatenng to become a storm. \"Alpha Leader, sentries heading your way. They are lightly armed, just a couple of guys with AKs. Shall I take them down, over?\" \"Negative, I'll take care of them. Proceed as planned, rendezvous at the front door of the safehouse\" \"Roger Alpha Leader\" Petterson took a peak down the street and saw them: two guys with AK-47s. He had spected more resistance. He raised his rifle and aimed to the chest of the first enemy. The bullets impacted the man, ripping his Kevlar best, and shreddng his chest. A great splatter of blood arcked in the air, and the second enemy had brely knew were it had came from when his fate was sealed in a similar way. \"Alpha Niner, this is Alpha Leader, we are coming your way, watch your fire on the east\" \"Roger, Alpha Leader, Alpha Niner standing by\" Petterson gave the \"Follow Me\" hand signal and sprinted to the other side of the street. His boots made huge squeeling sounds each time he stepped, but he didn't lowered his pace: one mistake and it could be his last. He arrived to the end of the croosing and covered the right side. His squad moved across the street and halted behind him. \"Cap\" exclaimed Harris, \"I think I've found a dynamic entrance\" Petterson thought for full two seconds. \"Harris, take provitional command of the team. Rendezvouz with B squad at main entrance and wait for me to get in position\" he ordered, as he unholstered his pistol. The FN Five-seveN is a 5.57mm pistol designed by FN Herstal, in Belgium. With it's low recoil and integrated silencer, the handgun is highly lethal in any expert hands. That's why Petterson never got too far away from it. Petterson grabbed his optic fiber and pushed it through an opening bellow the iron door. He could clearly see four enemies stacked up together around a table, perhaps playing poker. He beaconed a flashbang from hi vest pouch and prepared it. A minor push was enough, the door didn't held it Petterson threw the flashbang to the center of the room and slammed the door shut to avoid getting blinded by his own grenade. Some people think that the fact that a flashbang its a non-lethal grenade, it doesn't make noise. The cause of the blindness and concussion its a small quantity of explosives, so, yes, the flashbang makes a big noise when goes off. Petterson kicked the door once more, and quickly targeted the men near the table. Four bodies plumetted into the ground, victims of the quick fingers of Petterson, but he then realised his mistake: he hadn't seen the enemy standing by the door's side. The Russian charged against Petterson, who didn't had time to aim at him. The Five-seveN scaped from Petterson's hands and dropped to the floor. Petterson pusehd his knee as straight to the enemy stomach as he could, requiring a great amount of energy. The Russian gasped and stepped a couple of steps back, and Pettterson quickly fought back: he slammed the guy's head on the table, and a cracking sound was immediatly heard. A blood stripe poured from the guys nose as he screamed in pain. Petterson reached for his knife, but the Russian operative slammed him on the wall, and the knife ended up on the other side of the room. As the Spetsnaz recovered, he watched in awe as he realized that Petterson had his Ballistic Knife. Petterson actioned the mechanism and the blade was shot. The knife embeded on the Spetsnaz throat and made him choke with his own blood. Petterson stood on hs feet once more and coldly removed the blade from the body. He reloaded the Ballistic Knife and picked up all his ordnance. \"Alpha Niner, come in, over\" \"Alpha Leader, this is Alpha Niner. We are in position and ready to breach\" \"Roger that, wait for my go\" Petterson scouted the hall beside the room, which seemed completely empty. The safehouse was considerably smaller than he had thought. The hallway was pretty tight, perfect for an ambush. \"Alpha Niner, search the building. Do not raise hell yet, I repeat, do not raise hell yet. Make as low noise as you can, we need to keep the surprise element\" \"Roger, Alpha Leader, storming in\" Petterson heard the fadded BANG! of a flashbang and muffled shooting near. He walked down the hallway, his rifle aimed at the front, checking the rooms that had their doors open. He was about to shoot a figure that had popped by the corner wen he noted it was Dylon, leading his squad. Dylon was about to shoot him too, but Petterson lowered his gun to his feet and Harris recognized the friendly gesture. \"Status\" Petterson inquired \"Living room clear, Captain\" answered Grudarian, \"awaiting for orders\" \"Gold Squad, follow Grudarian. clear the top floor. Green Squad, with me, we'll clean this floor and the basement\" The force split up and covered their tasks: Gold squad swept the second floor, but they were quickly disapointed for not finding anything minorly important. Green team was a different story. \"Breach and clear\" ordered Petterson Harris moved and planted a breaching charge in the door. The styrofoam frame packed a good quantity of explosives, enough to send the door hell and anyone unfortunate enough to be on the other side of the door. \"Breaching charge in position\" Dylon exclaimed Petterson pulled out a detonator from his duffel and squeezed it three times. The device sent the signal for the explosive to blow, and the door shattered in pieces, killing a Spetsnaz on the other side. Petterson took down the fartest targets, at the bottom of the room, while Dylon and the rest of the team eliminated the nearest targets. \"Status\" he finally inquired \"Clear\" \"Clear\" \"Clear\" \"Roger, move to the next breaching position\" ordered Petterson, and the squad moved all at once. Moments later, a secong breaching charge exploded. Petterson scored two headshots straight, but their finding was the most valuable achievement. \"Well, well, well, looks like we hit the jackpot here!\" Both Petterson and the team were impresed by the amount of weapons and explosives that filled the room. Petterson hadn't seen so much things in the same place: C-4, Semtex packages, Grenades, ARs, Sniper Rifles, Heavy and Light Machine Guns.... \"Getting rid of this will slow down the fugitives for sure.....\" said Dylon \"If they were here at any point\" completed Petterson, \"Myers, get some charges in here\" Myers thought the order for full 3 seconds. \"Sir, we are in a suburban area\" he complained. \"I know, but we can't leave this here and we certainly don't have time to move it out\" \"Sir, there will be collateral damage!\" \"Alpha Leader, this is Alpha Niner. Enemy vehicles coming from the road. Looks like they know we are here\" \"Roger, Alpha Niner. Just do it Myers! NOW!\" Myers reluctantly pulled C4 from his bag and rigged it on the weapons cache. He tried to set them to avoid causing too much collateral damage, but strong enough to destroy the weapons inside. \"Alpha Leader, targets spotted, permission to engage?\" \"Targets description?\" \"Spetsnaz, Kevlar Vests, AKMS, Saiga Shotguns. This guys are playing for real\" \"Hold your fire, let them in, we'll pin them down at the hallway. Regroup with us, ASAP!\" \"Roger, we are Oscar Mike!\" Petterson went up and took a peek down the window, and he could see the enemies: exactly as Grudarian described. He took a look around and decided to pick a gun from the cache: a H&K G36. \"Why would you choose that? \" stated Dylon, who had certain dilike for the rifle. \"In the correct hands\" answered Petterson, it's just as deadly as anything else\" \"Right, if you get killed, I'll keep your Five-seveN\" Dylon stated \"Just try....\", \"Captain\" Grudarian interrupted, \"Spetsnaz are moving in, orders?\" \"Let them in, fall back to the stairway, we can pin them down there\" \"Roger, we are pulling back\" Petterson and Dylon exited the weapons room and headed upstairs to the second floor, and then to the far end of the hallway. Since Petterson had said something of an ambush, Myers had set up C-4 on the stairway. When the Spetsnaz tried to climb to the top floor, they would have a plastic surprise.... \"Charges set\" Myers informed, \"one tap for staircase, two taps to blow this place to hell\" \"Roger, hole yourselves up, attack on my mark\" The team took positons along the hallway, and Petterson held the detonator on his left hand to avoid squeezing it by accident. Suddenly, whispering in Russian was clearly heard, mainly because of the device Petterson had on his ears: a SOG Tactical Earbud. This new piece of equipment was something pretty cool...and pretty expensive. The device was capable of screening out enviromental noise to allow the user to hear just what he wants to hear. A figure appeared on top of the staircase and Petterson knew it obviosuly wasn't the toothfairy. The Spetsnaz stopped when he heard the clicking sound of he detonator, but he never had a chance to guess the source, the staircase blew with enough force to kill a entire fireteam. The muttering in russian became a crowd, and a second enemy squad began to fight back. The enemy AK's began to pin down the team, and Petterson knew it couldn't be good. He grabbed a flashbang from his pack and removed the pin \"Flash out!\" Petterson yelled, as he tossed the flashbang and covered again. The device activated and a white glare was briefly visible. A deafning boom was heard, and the firefight eased down. The team picked the oportunity and shot the russians, who quickly retreated down the staircase. \"Move! Go, go, go!\" Petterson ordered, and the team rushed to a window that faced the nearby buildings rooftops. Dylon looked down to the street and almost felt dizzy. The height was fairly high, any slight miss and his life would be terminated. \"That's one hell of a fall, right?\" Myers exclaimed, and Dylon nodded. The squad ran as fast as they could. The rooftops weren't safe, but it was their only way out of there. \"Watch the nearby rooftops, Tangos might be tracking us\" ordered Petterson, as he fired the enemy team down the street. The Spetznas took cover behind their armored vehicles and returned fire with their AKMs. The street quickly erupted on fire, as GSG-9 teams arrived the area to choke the situation. \"Let them fight each other, move out, we must reach the LZ before the situation settles down\" yelled Petterson, as he shot a few rounds over the Spetznas' head. The Russians ducked and diverted their attention to the German anti-terrorist teams. The operatives laid down covering fire with G36s, covering their fellows armed with Remington Shotguns. The Russian forces where quickly overwhelmed by the fire. The unique survivors mounted again and fleed the scene. \"Good, we are free, go, go, go\" informed Petterson, while a figure appeared on the sky: the distinctive silhoutte of an MH-60 Blackhawk. \"Everybody on board, now!\" shouted Scott, as he leaped last on the craft. The chopper dusted off and the team relieved themselves from the stress. \"Helluva party down there, guys\" acknowledged the pilot, which made Petterson remember the C-4 charges. He held the detonator in his right hand, while watching in direction of the safehouse. \"Fire in the hole\" he muttered, and then a huge cloud of dust and a sonic BOOM broke the peaceful night... \"German officers confirmed a few hours ago that an explotion happened on a suburb of Hamburg. While details emain unknown, some functionaries have hinted that it might a terrorist plot that ended wrong. More information as the situation develops\"Chapter 3: The Afghan Connection  Location: Fire Base Phoenix, Afghanistan Petterson sat in the chair and looked at the team. They were back in the briefing room. \"Ok, people, listen up. Last mission didn`t went as expected, since we didn't found anything. Intel caught word of a local Afghan guns dealer that helped the fugitives with equipment. We'll visit and interrogate him, we need to find out whatever he knows about them. The target is an HVI, so watch your fire, I don't want him dead or wounded, understood?\" Location: Kabul City Time:12:00 hours The team spread acroos the street and played as tourists. 'Floody 16 own''s you 00:53, December 30, 2010 (UTC) Read and write more on the Cell Fanfiction Wiki Splinter Cell Fanfiction Wiki115 Intro:  72 hours ago: Hanz Gudaghast went through the facility doors. He found himself on the courtyard, overlooking some rooms, but he barely knew were he was. He had been transferred to the facility to assist an on-going project, along with some other scientists. Little they knew what the project was about, but as soon as they were informed that it was the development of new technology for the Third Reich, they soon accepted without hesitation. While on the train station, they were still asked if they wanted to decline, but none of them did. While on the way to the facility, they were told a welcome ceremony would happen on the courtyard, where Doctor Ludwig Maxis would introduce them to the work and research of the \"Die Glocke\" project. Hanz was very excited to be part of the project, but little he knew what was under his feet....Chapter 1:  71 hours ago Hanz was standing on the courtyard. Maxis would give a speech in any minute, so everyne was looking at the top. A figure appeared from the balcony, and looked down at them at the same time they did so. \"Gentlemen\" he started, \"Allow me to take this opportunity to welcome you into group nine three five. This is a prestigious moment in the history of our race for you represent the future of technological advancement. You are the pioneers of human discovery. In your hands lies the destiny of mankind. In our hands is a great power and with that power comes a price. You have volunteered to be part of this great experiment and with that decision comes the responsibility of absolute secrecy. No one is to know what you do where you work what our research has discovered or what our purpose will be. You will have no further contact with your governments or your families. Your decision to fully dedicate your lives to group nine three five is absolute. In your lockers you will find your field ops manual which will direct you should our manifest get compromised. We cannot afford to let this power fall into the wrong hands and therefore the field ops manual should be considered your bible. Make your preparations now, a new dawn is beginning for mankind.\" The crowd erupted in applauses, and Dr. Maxis withdrew back into the facility. Hanz fleed from the courtyard into the facility. Just as he began to climb into the second floor, Dr. Maxis appeared and stopped him. \"Mr. Gudaghast, may i speak to you?\" he asked, as Hanz steped down the stair. \"Yes, Doctor?\". Maxis stood for two seconds, then he began speaking to him: \" I need you in my office, I need to discuss some terms with you\".Chapter 2:  69 hours ago: Hanz enterd a lab. He had been on Dr. Maxis office for almost two hours, just to be informed that he was going to help the Doctor in the Teleporters experiments. Big of a new, but there was something bothering him, he just didn't knew what was it. Maxis came in, followed by his assistant, whom he called Edward. The three entered into an experimental room, where there was a teleporter and some spines on glasses. It wasn't precisely the best place of the world, but it was for experimenting, so.... The teleporter door opened and Edward turned on a recorder. A subject test walked into the machine, and stood there, motionless. Before coming, he had heard rumors that the experiments were run with prisoners of war, but he had never confirmed it. \"Ok. October 10, 1944. Test number three of the day. Subject is within test chamber. Activate the power\". As Maxis finished this sentence, Edward pulled a switch, and an electrical flow ran through the teleporter. Suddenly, the subject turned into a mass of blood and gore, and this was thrown into the walls of the teleporter. \"Oh, oh my god!\" exclaimed Edward, terrified on the blood, but Maxis quickly calmed him down: \"Get a hold of yourself and clean that up! Test number three: unsuccesful, the subject has been reduced to the same state as previous subjects, clean up the test chamber and re-calibrate the system! Let's do it again\". Edward calmed down and obeyed the doctor: \"Yes, Doctor\". Hanz stomach was about to come out, but he managed to hold it inside. He turned to see Edward, and found him writting on a sheet of paper something a woman was saying. He turned and saw Dr. Maxis reaching his forehead with his fingers. Edward suddenly gave him a note: \"give this to the Doctor while I clean this up\". Hanz walked to the doctor and handed him a note. He took it and read it over carefully. \"Meet me in my office in an hour\" Maxis saidChapter 3:  68 hours ago Hanz knocked twice on the door labeled Ludwig Maxis. \"Enter\" came a voice from inside. Hanz walked in. \"You wanted to see me Doctor?\" Hanz asked \"Ah, yes\" he said handing him a tape. \"Take this to Sophia, she sould be up front.\" \"Yes Doctor\" He exited his office and began to head for the front desk, then once he was sure he was out of sight of Doctor Maxis he doubled back to his quarters and played the tape. \"Sophia, this letter is to go to the Reichstag High Command immediately. Gentlemen, it is with the utmost urgency that I draw your attention to the lack of funding being injected into The Giant project. While I believe we are close to realizing the ultimate plan, we still have several years of development before it is ready. It would be folly to cut our expenditure so early in our development. As you know, early tests on the DG-2 have easily outperformed expectations and we fully anticipate mass producing the Wunderwaffe within the next few years. Work on the matter transferer has however come to a standstill. We simply do not have enough Element 115 to continue the experiments. The test subjects have survived teleportation but are currently unresponsive to commands and cannot be controlled. If we are to overcome this obstacle we need to increase the frequency and size of the experiment. To this end, I suggest we not only find not only a regular supply of 115, but that we also find a larger conduit to channel the energy. Our operatives in America have informed us that the US have a large supply of the element at the Nevada base, so time is of the essence if we are to stay ahead of them. This cannot be done if you cut the budget, nor can it be done if you insist on pressuring us into action before we are ready. I am of course available for discussion of the matter but in the meantime, I will continue with the work here and try to win this damned war. Signed etc. etc. Doctor Maxis.\"Chapter 4:  Hanz had already took the tape back to Sophia, but he couldn't avoid wondering what was he on, he was beginning to get suspicious: what in the world was \"The Giant Project\"? Everything was so confusing.... .... A big blast door grew open and some Opel Blitz entered. The column stopped. A driver stepped down and headed into Hanz's direction. - We got a delivery for Doctor Ludwig Maxis....you are him?- he asked, handing him some paper work, -No, but he sent me here to pick up the delivery- he quickly answered, as he signed the paper and ordered the people to unload the crates. Before they got them in, he could catch a glimpse at a big \"115\" written on them. He most not lose a track on those crates, he needed to stay near. He had clearance from Maxis, so it would be easy. He followed the crate convoy until they reached the lab, were Doctor Maxis and Edward, his assistant, were standing. -Good work Mr. Gudaghast. You may leave, this experiment its highly confidential and we don't want any information of it to fall into wrong hands\".Chapter 5:  Hanz was on his room. He had managed to hide a recorder on the lab the day before, but there was a great chance that anyone there could discover it and destroy it. He didn't wanted that or there would be a witch hunt all over the facility, and that was the worst thing that could happen. He had to find a way to send a message to the Americans, If there was something that he didn't wanted to do was being an accomplice of an evil plan, if that included betraying his fellow partners, let it be that way. but he would need the recording of that experiment to prove he was right, or the Americans would think he was out of his mind. ..... It was around midnight, and Hanz was sure that everyone in the facility should be sleeping, except, of course for the guards, but saying that he had clearance from Maxis should do the trick for him. Before exiting his room, he grabbed a wooden box and drawed a \"115\" on it, that way, he wouldn't need to explain his wish to enter to the lab. He walked down a corridor until he almost crashed with a guard, the guard was about to shout at him when he calmly explained: -I forgot a crate at the mainframe, Dr. Maxis ordered me to take it to the experiment room, I won't take too long-. The guard looked at him in the \"I'm sure you are not doing what you say\" way, but after a while he stepped aside and allowed him to continue. \"Now, that was close\" Hanz thought to himself. He was sweating on his back. That first guard came out of nowhere, his heart was still beating fast, but he was sure everything would be easier from now and on. He turned right on the corner, and then he entered into the experimentation room. The room was pretty big, but the teleporter inside occupied most of the space, so three people inside was more than enough. He swiftly moved to the counter. He had to retrieve the recording or things would get hot down there. He opened a shelf and quickly took the tape out and hid it on his pocket. Just as he was about to leave, he heard some growling from inside. He walked carefully, trying not to look scared, but there was no reason for that growl to be heard. Just as he crossed the door, an arm tried to reach him, but he quickly distanced from it. He was about to scream, but he kept it for himself, there was no need to call attention in...Chapter 6:  Hanz as sweating hard on his back. The thing on the lab had got the crap out of him. It seemed like human, but the gray skin, and the yellow eyes.... what in the world as that? He had to get answers from Maxis, and he had to do it now. .... Next morning, Hanz headed straight to Maxis' office. He knocked twice, and just as Maxis was about to say \"Come in!\", he pushed the door and entered. -Mr. Gudhagast, I was expecting you- Maxis said, over a pile of documents. Hanz thought he had been told about the midnight intrusion on the lab, and he scored, but Maxis was pretty calmed to punish him: -A night-shift guard told me you had forgot a..crate at the mainframe, and you remembered until last night...may I ask the reason for such a great mistake?\". Hanz filled himself with calm and tried to give an inocent reason for his apparently stupid idea of the forgoten crate. -I'm sorry Doctor, I didn't remembered were I left that crate until midnight, so i decided to go get it and leave it at the lab-. There, a perfect excuse. Maxis thought the answer for a time, and then he decided it made sense: -did you saw anything strange at the lab?-. That was the question Hanz wanted to avoid. If he said \"yes\", Maxis would suspect of him, and there wouldn't be any freedom anymore, because Maxis would put a guard at his door to avoid him making any more \"mistakes\". But he certainly needed to know what the hell was in the lab, and he needed to know it right now. -Actually, doctor, I did, and i was coming here to ask you about \"That\"-. Maxis caught the emphasis on the word \"THAT\", and he quickly set his defense: -\"That\"? What do you mean with \"That\", Mr. Gudhagast?-. Hanz armed himself with patience and confronted Maxis: -The thing that it's on the lab, that gray thing with yellow eyes and almost no skin!-. Maxis knew what Hanz was talking about, and he decided it was time to let the intel go. -Mr. Gudhagast, I think it's time for you to know what is happening here-, Maxis' voice was filled with mystery, and Hanz was beginning to regret his decision,but he quickly got his position firm, and allowed Maxis to continue: -When we first constructed the teleporters and the mainframe, we thought that we could just simply teleport mattery from one place to another without any problem, the high energy production of the element 115 gave us the basis for that idea, but we quickly found an...\"obstacle\" on the way: the teleporting needed accurate calculations to happen, which are hard to make, and we quickly discovered that the great surge of power from the Unumpentium also translated into radiation. We found this out because, even if we weren't able to accurately teleport the test subjects, we did found them-. Maxis stopped, and Hanz knew that Maxis was talking about the \"Thing\" on the lab. -We \"found\" the first test subject on another research facility, where they were experimenting with biological weapons-. Hanz caught the word \"were\". \"They WERE\" he thought for himself, \"then, something happened\". -We caugth a radio transmission from the facility. They claimmed to be under attack by somekind of wild humanoids, and we thought that maybe their experiments had went wrong... we decided to send a team, to contain the situation, collect the research and saving any survivor-. Maxis sitted on his desk, not in the chair, but in the top of the desk, looking through the window. -When we lost contact with them, we knew that there was something wrong. They were Allegmeine-SS, I never knew better soldiers, and they were all lost...- Maxis voice faded in memories, and Hanz quickly understood the seriousness of the situation...but that didn't quit the fact that he needed the truth. - After their loss, we knew what was wrong: The extreme radiation caused by element 115 turned the subjects into a primitive form of human, just feeding basic instincts. They cannot be controlled, they are highly violent and they are not safe. We haven't found a way to revert this situation-. Hanz now understood, but he certainly couldn't allow Maxis to contiune with this...Chapter 7:  Zero Hour: Hanz was hiding on the lockers room. Something had gone terribly wrong, and now the facility was at maximum alert. He decided it was time for the world to know the truth, and he then prepared a radio transmission to his american contact. -R-4808N 37 14 06 115 48 40-, after the cordinates, he began to talk: - I hope that you are receiving this transmission, Peter, if not, then all has already been lost. You must know by now that we failed to contain the asylum, now we had to move the experiment here, to this location. The numbers will guide you. The giant must be contained at all costs, repeat, Der Riese must be contained at all costs. The DG-2 experiments continue. May be our only advantage now. Find Doctor Richtofen and Doctor Max, they may know what's going on. The use of Element 115 is dangerous at best. I'm not sure if we can continue here. We've lost most of our best scientific team. I hope you get this. I hope it hasn't happened there too, but I'm almost out of hope-. Hanz cocked his Walther P-38 and stepped into the teleporter. -Auf Wiedersehen- he finally said, as he activated the teleporter, and he faded into a bolt of blue thunders. No one ever new something about him again. A few seconds later, Maxis entered the room. He was heavily breathing, and he had severe injuries. He began searching madly on is locker. -Damn it!- he practically screamed, -I can`t find my damn pills!- , he suddenly heard the incoming growls. -They are coming.... I most do what I most do....-. He grabbed a nearby chair and unstrapped his belt. He climbed on the top of the chair and strapped the belt around a pipe on the roof, and then into his neck. Before anything else, he said his final words: -God forgive us all...- right after finishing, he kicked the chair, and he then fell down. He gasped for a few seconds, and then he finally gave up. The chaos at the facilty continued for hours, as the few survivors struggled for survival, but they were finally beated by a superior forces. The breakout was the worst and last catastrophic event that happened at the facility.Chapter 8:  2 days after the breakout. Dempsey was sitting on a C-47 on his way to his target zone. Command had choosen him for this mission because he was capacitated for it. Intel reports from an inside contact at a german scientific facility had led him and his team to this location. Apparently, some kind of biological weapon development was on-going, but something went wrong and the Allies had an opportunity to do something about it. He was sure that the incidents were related to an event that the krauts called \"Nacht Der Untoten\" (Night of the Undead), which he had experienced before: death bodies reanimated, but not concious about anything, into a primitive, animal-like state. He had lost some friends on the last experience, and he had seen strange things on the process: \"magical\" boxes that spawned weapons, guns that fired green energy and were highly lethal, and even walls that gave certain weapons and ammo. On his last reflexive lapsus, he began to wonder what the hell have Jerries done, they were apparently playing with forces out of their reach.... -2 minutes!- the pilot yelled. Demsey looked to his squad: Corporal Howard Dalton was playing with his knife. He was the gunner of the team, so he had the big and fast weapons. Private Michael Hughes was smoking a cigarret. He was a rifleman, so he was highly capacitated on average infantry weapons, either American, British, or Kraut. Last, but not least important, was the Navy contact, John Kennedy. He was assigned to the role of Submachine Gunner. Dempsey thought about the only reason he would be here: spying. He quckly dropped the idea. He was here surely to evaluate what could be useful for the Navy from the Nazi Tach. -1 minute!-. Everybody stood up, and they hooked their parachute lines into a cord above them. The side door was opened and a red light lit. Dempsey's head suddenly emptied and he focused on the mission. He was sure the things he saw on his last contact were going to appear, so he readied himself for the battle. -GO! GO! GO!- the pilot shouted, as he turned the red light into green. The squad ran and jumped out of the plane. Dempsey opened his arm wide on midair, decelarating himself. The jump was a low altitude one, so the squad deplyed their parachutes quickly. They touched down expertly, making worth every minute of their training. They discarded their parachutes as Command had told them to and moved toward the facility. Dempsey tried to take a deep breath, but he regreted the action. The air of the forest smelled of burn and old flesh. -I see two ways in- Dalton muttered, signaling two windows on the front. Dempsey gave the team the \"Go\" signal . They stopped on the windows. -Ok,- Dempsey started, -Hughes and Kennedy, take the right window, Dalton, with me through the left window. Let's do this- The team moved quickly and entered the buildding. As soon as they touched the ground, the earth shook, and the windows instantly blocked themselves. -What the hell...- Dalton stated, and then looked to Dempsey. He knew what was happening. IT was happening again.Chapter 9:  -Weapons free- Dempsey ordered. The team was now split. In one side stood Dempsey, along with Dalton, and on the other side were Hughes and Kennedy. -Are you OK back there?- Dempsey shouted, hopping they could hear him. -Yeah, we are just Ok- Hughes shouted on the other side, -would you mind telling us what the fuck is going on?- he addressed. Dempsey just breathed hard, and then let the bad news go: -THEY are coming-. The air filled with the sounds of thousands of growls, and Dempsey could see clear outlines of humans outside...but he knew they were no humans. -Contact! 12 0 clock!- Dalton said and raised his M-1919 Machine Gun. The powerful weapon tore apart the zombies quickly, and Dalton felt victory flowing in his body, and let himself a thriumphant quote: -they are not so hard as you said, Tank-. Dempsey shook his head and replied: -Don't worry, that's just the beginning. The side window began to get breached, and Dempsey hurried to secure it. The nightmare was coming again...The End...?

All enemies are computer controlled Spetsnaz on special Wave Defense Maps that are not playable in regular multiplayer. Players will only start out with a random handgun with a random attachment and will be able to gather ordinance airdropped by a helicopter. The enemies will be dropped off by helicopters and will repeat three times. When all the Spetsnaz are killed, the next wave begins. There are 4 waves of randomized enemies with random tactics. After the players kill 4 waves, the boss wave begins, consisting of multiple Champions and Generals. After the boss wave, the next 4 waves begin and the players must endure a second boss wave and two more sets before the game ends with the player with the most points winning. After each wave a random effect is added on the next wave, tactics, better weapons, etc. This makes the difficulty of playing harder, but also able to score more XP. Players will be able to select a character model for use in Wave Defense. The models will be different per character as well as quotes the player may often say during gameplay.Weapon Cache  The weapon cache is airdropped by a helicopter at a random spot on the map. Players will be able to purchase a random weapon from the cache for 1000 points. Players can get a very powerful weapon from the cache or end up with a pistol. At the end of the boss wave, the cache will be moved and the chances of getting more powerful ordinance rises during the intermission between waves, provided you access it in time.

It is a 8 on 8 game. It pits LANCERs against Spetsnaz in a large map with one team on offense and the other on defense. Assault is divided into three phases. A new spawn feature is included, allowing a team member to spawn on a wingman, with four teams of two. Killstreaks will also get more powerful, but require more kills to obtain and are set for the entire team. Spetsnaz players will be able to choose their set of armor before the game begins.Phase 1  The first phase is for the attackers to plant a bomb in two designated sites. Defenders will have bolt action rifles that can be picked up. At this point, both sides get only one loadout. Pickups M21 EBR ACOG- LANCER Dragunov U ACOG- SpetsnazLANCER Scout Class Spetsnaz Minor Class Phase 2  Should the invaders suceed in detonating in one of the sites, the map will be extended into a second phase. Players will get more pickups, loadouts and objectives. The offense team again will have to detonate one of the two bomb sites.

Elloway\u2019s head narrowly missing a .50 Cal bullet, \u201cTake out that damn sniper!\u201d, \u201cOn it sir.\u201d PFC. MacGregor aimed his AT4 and destroyed the bunker. Maj. Herring reminded the survivors, \u201cRemember we need Bullski alive,\u201d MacGregor replied, \u201cThen can I put one in his leg sir?\u201d \u201cCheeky bastard\u201d. Inside the bunker the 39 Division were pinned down. Cpl. Elloway started pounding grenades from the M203 causing the roof in some places to collapse and cripple a few Russians. \u201cTangos down,\u201d reported Maj. Herring \u201cHe must be in that room there, MacGregor use your M600\u201d \u201cBreaching\u2026\u201d*Click* *BOOM*... \u201cShit, just a dummy!\u201d shouted Elloway, \u201cbut thats good enough for me, sir\u201d.

Herring was lying on the ground with the entire left side of his torso blown off, Elloway retched as MacGregor stood up. \u201cWe\u2019re fucked mate.\u201d. Bullski's army advanced, just as a large shadow crept over Elloway and MacGregor. Two Pave-Lows fired upon the Bullski\u2019s army eliminating every single Tango with a hail of bullets and rockets.Act I Part 1  Location - Peru Cpt. Elloway opened his eyes and look out of the Sea-Knight, below him was a jungle and inside the Sea-Knight was Squad Beta, consisting of himself, Lt. Danny, Pvt. Fielding and SSgt. MacGregor. The Pilot said \u201cLanding in 3 minutes\u201d Danny looked at Elloway, who nodded. Danny and Fielding ran out of the Sea-Knight. After the landing, Elloway scouted the area, \u2018No hostiles in sight. It\u2019s too quiet\u2019 he thought, \u201cMACGREGOR GET DOWN!\u201d Elloway jumped and pulled MacGregor down as multiple bullets ripped through the tree he was leaning against. \u201cEngage all Hostiles on sight, MacGregor! Smoke \u2019em\u201d Both soldiers tossed a smoke grenade and started to shoot at the Insurgents. Screams echoed throughout the jungle as flesh was torn from bone. \u201cRemember kid, keep your head low and don\u2019t move.\u201d instructed Danny over the comm. A convoy of Russians ere marching through the trees with several vehicles destroying the vegetation behind them. Danny reached for his Glock 17, \u201cReady\u2026\u201d he whispered, \u201cGO\u201d they sprung up and fired upon the Russians. Being caught off-guard the Russians were easily dispatched of. \u201cGoodnight ya bastards.\u201d said Danny as he holstered his Glock in the wake of the carnage. \u201cFielding, stay sharp we\u2019re almost there. Make sure that you don\u2018t get seen\u201d \u201cWell, duh\u201d Fielding muttered under his breath. \u201cHoly shit look at this technology\u201d said an astounded MacGregor, \u201cToo bad it didn\u2019t save their arses.\u201d Elloway looked at MacGregor \u201cRemember the mission, find Makarov alive and take him to Thunderbird.\u201d \u201cMakarov slaughtered hundreds of civilians he doesn\u2019t deserve to get out of this unharmed I\u2019ll break his legs,\u201d proclaimed MacGregor, he loaded his SCAR-H and looked ahead at a building crawling with Insurgents \u201cI\u2019ll show him fuck all if I want to.\u201dPart 2  \u201cShit,\u201d whispered Lt. Danny, \u201cThere\u2019s more Russos then I thought, Fielding stay still don\u2019t move at all.\u201d \u201cYes sir.\u201d Pvt. Fielding muttered. A wandering Russian walked out and trod on Fielding\u2019s hand. \u201c\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u044b \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b!\u201d screamed the Russian. Danny and Fielding were pulled from their positions and were thrown in front of a muscular Russian. \u201cMacGregor, stay calm. If we\u2019re gonna take Makarov alive we need to work together, just like in Egypt.\u201d Cpt. Elloway calmly said. \u201cFuck, I hear something.\u201d SSgt. MacGregor and Elloway turned around, a man wearing a boonie hat carrying a SCAR-L and a man with a Mohawk carrying a MP5k were standing face to face with the Squad Beta tacticians. Boonie hat man and Elloway said in unison \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d, Elloway paused, \u201cI am Captain Elloway and this is Staff Sergeant MacGregor we are part of a team called Squad Beta, now like I said, Who the fuck are you?\u201d, Mohawk man replied \u201cI am Soap Mactavish and this is Captain Price, we\u2026 work for ourselves,\u201d MacGregor replied suspiciously \u201cSo you\u2019re mercenaries then?\u201d Price said in response \u201cNo, we\u2019re trying to clear our names, some bastard called Shepherd listed us as War Criminals. Now every factions after us, our Intel told us that we can only trust a team called \u2018Squad Beta\u2019 who apparently are a counter-terrorist squad.\u201d. Lt. Danny was on all-fours, the muscular Russian was pounding him in order to get information. Danny lifted his head and spat out a mixture of blood, tooth and vomit as the Russian picked him up and threw him against a wall. Several Russians mounted RPDs on a wall and aimed at Danny\u2019s head. They emptied the drums into Danny\u2019s head, blood squirted everywhere as his brains fell to the floor, an onlooking Pvt. Fielding vomited. The Russian turned towards the shaking Fielding, he grinned and unsheathed a large, dirty machete and advanced towards the young man.

We are a friendly wiki so don't worry, you'll love it here. I am User talk:Callofduty4, now let's get to editing!Fearsome Might  Hey Delta, I just added a couple sentances to your section, but I didn't put the line between them. I just wanted to keep the story flowing a little. I added the line at the end though, so that you or I can start again. -MerchantofDeath 00:43, November 6, 2010 (UTC) LOL, sorry about messing Spenders name up\u00a0:P -MerchantofDeath 13:23, November 11, 2010 (UTC) Sure, I don't mind. I was just trying to have Thomas's group become overrun by enemies, and they would have to make a run for allied lines. -MerchantofDeath 22:02, December 21, 2010 (UTC) Sure -MerchantofDeath 22:07, December 21, 2010 (UTC)New roleplay idea.  Hey Delta, I was think about making another roleplay (not yet, though) pertaining to Black Ops. It would be basicly be about a special forces team (I'm still thinking about it, maybe SOG or some other team) going into different countries, while fighting commies\u00a0:) Does it sound like a good idea? MerchantofDeath Excuse my ignorance, but who/what is AMR? -MerchantofDeath 02:03, November 12, 2010 (UTC) Oh yeah, I remember him. What happened to AMR? -MerchantofDeath 02:21, November 12, 2010 (UTC) He's still acive. Delta 4-7 02:29, November 12, 2010 (UTC)Black Ops Roleplay name  Hey Delta, I'm really having a creativity block here with names. I want a good name, but all I could think of is \"Black Operations\" and \"Deniable Ops\". Do mine sound good, or can you help me find a better name? -MerchantofDeath 18:48, November 14, 2010 (UTC) Hey Delta, I forgot to add this to the thing, but can you tell me your character's rank, if he has one? -MerchantofDeath 02:59, November 15, 2010 (UTC) Added another parargraph -MerchantofDeath 00:09, November 16, 2010 (UTC)RE: Fanfic  I think it would be better if we took an independent route, since Fan fics are over using NOVA-6. I was thinking about a Neutron Bomb (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_bomb), but that's not a final idea. BTW, I'll be off for a couple days, so hold the fort while I'm gone\u00a0:P. -MerchantofDeath 01:40, November 18, 2010 (UTC) Like, killing the goverment and/or establishing a soviet friendly leader, already planted in the united states? -MerchantofDeath 00:38, November 22, 2010 (UTC) Sure, as long as we don't make the weapon a space laser\u00a0:P -MerchantofDeath 00:47, November 22, 2010 (UTC) DAMMIT, why do the russians always have EMP's laying around?\u00a0:D -MerchantofDeath 01:59, November 22, 2010 (UTC) I......don't know either. I got EMP, and then I added the part about saving the EMP's, because I wanted Elitemaster to have a little fun. I can change that part if you want. -MerchantofDeath 02:49, November 22, 2010 (UTC) Yes, we have to find more documents. \"LANDON!!!! I need you to pick up that stack of papers, go through a jungle warzone, and file them in an hour!!!!\"\u00a0:P. No, all I meant was that we should rescue the POW's, and maybe piggyback on a tank or helicopter. -MerchantofDeath 02:57, November 22, 2010 (UTC) Do you like how the roleplay is going? Because, I wanted to, \"somewhat\", to keep it realistic. Now that the cuban's invaded Britain, I feel my original idea went completly off the track. -MerchantofDeath 21:53, November 30, 2010 (UTC) Yeah, plus I didn't really like the idea of the MOAB being in the 60's\u00a0:( -MerchantofDeath 22:07, November 30, 2010 (UTC) Well, I get that, but just writing MOAB for the sixties gives me the willies\u00a0:P -MerchantofDeath 22:15, November 30, 2010 (UTC) Hey, just to switch to another topic, I posted in Urban Warfare. I renewed my interest in Modern warfare 2 fan fictions\u00a0:P -MerchantofDeath 22:25, November 30, 2010 (UTC)Re: Patriotism  Nikolai? -MerchantofDeath 20:14, December 4, 2010 (UTC) Sorry, I think it was just a coincidence\u00a0:(. What chapter is the cargo plane part in WotH? Maybe I can add Nikolai into the story\u00a0:P. -MerchantofDeath 20:19, December 4, 2010 (UTC) Ok, I'll try to wedge Nikolai in there. This means that I'm going to wedge the WoTH storyline slightly into this storyline. The characters will be there (not all), but not the events. BTW, I read through WoTH again, and I realized how much I sucked at writing again. I'm still improving though. -MerchantofDeath 20:30, December 4, 2010 (UTC)Re: 1980's roleplay  LOL, what do you mean? -MerchantofDeath 01:25, December 10, 2010 (UTC) Shit, now I get it. I have just spoiled a perfectly good joke\u00a0:( /A dragon appears in front of you, you lose -21 HP/ - MerchantofDeath 01:32, December 10, 2010 (UTC) ..........WTF?\u00a0:P -MerchantofDeath 01:59, December 10, 2010 (UTC) /slams head into table FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU- Should of known that\u00a0:( -MerchantofDeath 02:04, December 10, 2010 (UTC)Alright, now listen  I seriously wonder if you have an IQ higher than 90. Did you not read before posting? The \"Russian\" was my dude, Austin Dennis. If you had actually READ the thing, you would have known that Austin made it to the wreck before the CIA team, HE was the one who shot the russians, HE was the one who took the file, and HE was the one who took Landon hostage. He only took him hostage because he saw all of them dressed as KGB agents, and thought THEY were the russians. I already complained to Wunderwaffle, and he told me it was you. If you tell me it is him, I will go back to him. If he says again that it is you, I am going to MoD and telling him aout both of you. And yes, he approved of the thing that is now ruined. And did you not hear the \"Russian\" call the CIA team \"Ruskies\"? Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 02:09, December 11, 2010 (UTC) Alright, my computer's fucked up so I'll just post this here: Bumblebee, I'm Sorry, but I didn't realize anything about your character until you spoke to Wunderwaffle about it. THAT's why I apologized for my mistake in writing the chapter, so if you want, I'll rewrite it with MoD's approval. I didn't assume that any of those subtle things were underlying hints, because, quite frankly, I hadn't read any of your plans for the roleplay beforehand, and I didn't take much time to read the chapter (I was in a hurry). Blame me if you must, but I 'll seek to rectify this in any way possible so you can enjoy the roleplay as well. With apologies, Delta 4-7 14:58, December 11, 2010 (UTC) Alright, I don't forgive you. Kidding. I have recently leard in Language Arts about tiny, seemingly useless hints that foreshadow a big revelation. Now you may think it is useless, but I used that to write the chapter. If you don't know about that, I don't blame you. I still, however, am confused on how you missed the part where the \"Russian\" calls Wilson and Landon \"Ruskies\". Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 17:39, December 11, 2010 (UTC) Hey Delta, it's fine if you change the chapter -MerchantofDeath 01:49, December 12, 2010 (UTC)Yo Dawg  What do you think of Kid SEAL and The Liberators? Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 19:59, December 20, 2010 (UTC) I originally was making another chapter, but I stopped due to a bad storyline. I may just give up on my part of the story, though others are still welcome to change it. I will now allow the Pacific one to be changed, as that was the one that I was writing. I need to go write another chapter in The Liberators, and I just finished writing another chapter of Kid SEAL, with a major twist. Also, when have my stories ever been ordinary?\u00a0:) Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 20:21, December 20, 2010 (UTC)Kid SEAL  I finished writing Kid SEAL. Help spread the word around this wiki and the COD wiki. (I'm trying to get attention, aren't I a bastard?) Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 22:23, December 23, 2010 (UTC) No. Tell a few good people you know on the wiki. I've already told Seijana, MoD, Waffle, and Floody. Bumblebeeprime09(Talk) 01:33, December 24, 2010 (UTC)Your character in \"The Hunt\"  Hello there, lad. As I've aleady told CAPace1, I'm addding the characters' appereances to the gallery, but, of course, i don't find any 100% accurate pics. In his . Tell me if any particular case, he gots 2 options, as you do now. Tell me if you like any of these appereances or if you have another pic, uploadd it and tell me about it. Floody 16 own's you 04:07, December 26, 2010 (UTC)Re: Screengrabs  Easy. I set up an account on Call of duty.com, linked it to my online account. I go to a private match with game recording set ON, then I use the preset class editor to make the classes based on the characters. After that, I just pose, then take pics in theater mode. I then go to the black ops theater beta on COD.com and copy them to my computer. Bumblebeeprime09's Quarters/Radio/Records 23:11, December 28, 2010 (UTC)Re: Irony  Woops, sorry about that. And no, I don't know about MS clipboard. -MerchantofDeath 00:50, January 3, 2011 (UTC) I guess, but do you think you can send me yours? - MerchantofDeath 01:14, January 3, 2011 (UTC) That was pretty good, Delta\u00a0:). I wish I had that sooner though, because I pretty much ended the thing already\u00a0:(. -MerchantofDeath 01:38, January 3, 2011 (UTC)FF Idea  I am going to be less active now (today is the last day of my break), and I have too many Ideas for FFs. So, I want to trust you with one. You are a capable writer. My idea is to make a fanfic on Operation Charbrydis (A Joint CIA-MI6 mission to detain or kill Mason, Hudson, and Weaver. It was seen in the intel file for redemption.). The teams are Mason-Hudson-Weaver (They are one group), the Joint MI6-CIA team, and Kristina, a Spetsnaz GRU agent (Also mentioned on the Charbrydis page on the COD wiki) and Weaver's niece, sent to detain Mason. I am far too bsy with MAC-V SOG and my nex FF that I am already planning, Kid SEAL 2. If you accept, then thank you. If you don't please recommend anyone else who can (They must have writing skills at least as good as yours.) Bumblebeeprime09's Quarters/Radio/Records 01:24, January 3, 2011 (UTC) Uhh, make the FF a personal one that you write alone. Also, the whole battle idea, if you ask me, would be MHW (Mason Hudson Weaver) and the CIA-MI6 team fighting in a slum-like area (They are in South Africa), while Kristina the Spetsnaz GRU (They should make that a spy-action movie. Who wouldn't want to watch a young russian woman plunging a knife through the back of a CIA guy? That would be awesome.) sneaks through the CIA-MI6 team and silently kills her enemies, to get to MHW. You, the writer, are in control of what exact actions happen, though. If you want everyone to get killed on either team, okay. If you want Kristina to kill Weaver, so be it. It's your choice. Anyway, You should allow signups for the CIA-MI6 group, and a vote on what weapons Kristina, Mason, Hudson, and Weaver use. My personal vote would be Kristina using a Kiparis Prototype and a Makarov, while Weaver has an AUG, Hudson and Mason have FAMASs, and they all have M1911s, too. However, that is my VOTE, and you do not have to use these exact weapons. And thank you. You can give yourself full credit for everything except coming up withh the idea, that goes to me. LOL Bumblebeeprime09's Quarters/Radio/Records 10:23, January 3, 2011 (UTC)DELTA!!!  I need characters for my new roleplay, PRONTO!!!!!\u00a0:P I don't want to be alone when I fight the terrorists\u00a0:'(.......... -MerchantofDeath 21:52, January 4, 2011 (UTC)  This is a picture of Jacob Dennis on a sniper mission. The Ghillie suit, the M110 SASS, and the desert setting show that this was before the Russo-american war. Bumblebeeprime09's Quarters/Radio/Records 21:11, January 9, 2011 (UTC) Here, http://falloutfanfic.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Fanfiction_Wiki Just to warn you, the site has been having some problems with saving articles recently, so always save your stuff. -MerchantofDeath 21:58, January 25, 2011 (UTC) Sounds good. -MerchantofDeath 00:14, January 29, 2011 (UTC)Insanity  Do you remember talking about the worst things kids did at our schools? And I said that the worst that ever happened was a student calling the teacher a \"fucking bitch\"? (Yes, I remember this) Well, something WAY worse happened. Some 7th grader on our bus decides to get in an argument with another 7th grader. They're cussing eachother out. So the bus driver pulls over, gets up, and tells them to stop. The seecond one I mentioned sits down and decided to be quiet. But the other one refused to. Here are some of the things that were said. Bus Driver: You need to sit down and be quiet or I will write you up. 7th Grade kid: You need to sit down and shut up! Bus Driver: Watch your mouth! 7th grader: You need to watch YOUR mouth. Bus Driver: Sit down, and be quiet. NOW. 7th grader: You need to sit your ass at the front of the bus up there, you motherfucking bitch. Bus Driver: I do not tolerate that kind of language! Sit down and be quiet! 7th grader: [He decides to be quiet, but refuses to sit down.] Bus driver: [On the verge of screaming] SIT DOWN NOW!!!!!!! 7th grader: [He sits down and immediately gets up again. Like, literally, he lowrs his butt and snaps up again the moment his butt touched the seat.] Yeah. Insanity. I felt like I wanted to say that. He also pulled a 'Spiderman', where he called himself that as he jumped out of his seat, OVER me and my friend's seat, and landing in the seat in front of us. This was before we left the school. {{SUBST:Sig/BBP09}} 13:16, March 27, 2011 (UTC)Hey Delta  Yeah, I planning to have the next Deniable Ops up after I finish an RP. I would have before, but i got a significant chunk of time cut off of computer time. I'm planning to finish off Fearsome Might, and then Cracked Glass. That way I'll have Deniable Ops 2 and Force mulitplier to deal with. -MerchantofDeath 21:47, March 27, 2011 (UTC) I've got an idea that you can type for the chapter. Their going up into the Jaari mountians (which are filled with pro-Jaari insurgents) and get a distress call from Floody's and CApace's characters (it;s on the blog). So, they try and rescue them but along the way the HUMVEE convoy get's ambushed.

This story contains strong language and should only be read by mature audiences. If you get in trouble, it's not my fault!The Story  In the year 2018, the Task Force 141 has been disbanded, yet insurgent groups continue to threaten the security of NATO and its allies. The Ultranationalist Party in the Russian Federation left the United States after their first attempt to invade and threaten to begin another invasion. Despite their losses, the Federation has been able to quickly replenish their ranks in the military and have surpassed the United States' military. They have also formed an offensive military alliance with North Korea who threatens South Korea and Japan for territory. Desperate for an advantage, NATO authorizes Doctor Natalie Lancer to rebuild an elite task force. She proposes the LANCER Project. Although most info is classified, NATO and the US quickly approve. Now Dr. Lancer searches the armies of NATO to find candidates for her top secret project.Prologue  US Firebase Juliet 4 miles north of Kabul, Afghanistan 3:17 pm January 8, 2018 Captain Joel Jackson and his brother Private Jarod Jackson walked along the elongated barrcks passing other soldiers. They seemed confused by being called by the General to his quarters as both had done nothing wrong. \"Wonder what this is about.\" Jarod stated. \"Who knows.\" Joel replied. He had often looked after his little brother since he joined the military. It was by luck that both got into the same squad. Both brothers were the top soldiers at Firebase Juliet and their reputation spread and other soldiers often moved aside to let them through. The General had also asked for thier weapons so they stopped at the armory to retrieve them. Joel grabbed his SCAR while Jarod found his M4 Grenadier and they proceded to the General's quarters. The steel door hissed open and both brothers walked in. The door closed and two Shadow Company soldiers stepped beside the door and stared straight ahead. Major General Randolph sat in his command chair on a laptop with a flask in his hand. The odor of cheap whiskey assaulted their noses. \"Sit.\" Randolph said without looking up and motioned to a pair of chairs in the office. Joel and Jarod sat down. Randolph had replaced Shepherd and was now in command of Shadow Company which he used as a elite force. \"I know this will sound bad, but you are to redo weapons training. There is a possibility that you might be leaving the Marines for good.\" Jarod felt a knot in his stomach and continued listening to Randolph. \"It sounds like a large project. You report in an hour to the training facility. Nevertheless, it was great having you as Marines and I am very proud to be your commander. Pack your bags, you leave at 0500 hours tomorrow. Dismissed.\" Jarod and Joel stood up to shake hands with the General and the Shadow Company soldiers nodded and escorted them out of the door. They walked back and packed their bags in silence. Both brothers then reported to the training facility. \"Jackson. What ya doing here?\" Sergeant Higgins asked. He was a friend of the Jackson brothers and knew them since high school. \"We're here to do the training course for some top secret project.\" Joel replied \"Oh yeah. I heard about that. Reminds me of our first day of freshman year at high school.\" Both soldiers laughed and struck up a conversation until Jarod got them back on track. \"Nice work.\" Higgins complimented. \"Let's move on to the Pit. Joel, you're first. Starting the timer...NOW!\" Joel sprinted and completed the course faster than he had done before. \"Not bad.\" Higgins said when Joel skidded to a stop. 19.2, your best time yet. Both soldiers watched Jarod pull off an impressive 22.1. Jarod was also out of breath and grabbed a drink of water from his bag. \"Very impressove both of you.\" a silky smooth voice came from the spectator tower. All three soldiers turned to see a woman about 5 foot, 6 inches, step out. She must have been at least thirty years old, but her cold stare set uncertaincy in their minds. She sized up the Jackson brothers who were easily taller than her. She wore a pair of jean shorts, a white shirt and a pair of sunglasses. She approached them and shook both of their hands. Higgins quirked up \"Oh yes. I forgot to tell both of you. This is Doctor Natalie Lancer, the head of the LANCER project to create an elite task force. Joel and Jarod are the only two candidates at Firebase Juliet.\" He turned to Lancer and handed her a pair of papers on their results. \"So did they pass all your requirements?\" Lancer studued the papers, she stood still for several minutes and finally said \"Both Joel and Jarod Jackson are Project LANCER subjects.\" She turned to Joel and Jarod. \"I will brief you on the aircraft once we reach out of enemy communication infiltration facilities range. I will see you on the plane. Good night.\" Lancer turned and walked out of the building. Higgins, shocked said \"I can't believe she is kidnapping these people for her task force. You better hope she doesn't brainwash you or something. Anyway, hope you do great on your missions. When all this hell is over, we're grabbing a beer.\" Joel smiled \"Anyway Jarod and I have to go. We still need to pack. First beer's on me!\" He walked out of the facility with Jarod close behind. \"Wow. Those Pave Lows are in a hurry. That can't be good\" Jarod remarked. Both looked up to see a pair of Pave Lows rush past heading south. Joel's radio came online. \"We need to protect the doctor! We lost contact with outpost Foxtrot!\" Higgins yelled over the radio. \"Damn. That's just down the road.\" Jarod said. \"We better get down there fast!\" They headed toward the main base and grabbed their weapons.Chapter 1  US Firebase Juliet 4 miles North of Kabul, Afghanistan 5:50 pm January 8, 2018 \"All units on alert, defend positions!\" Randolph shouted over the speakers. \"Doctor, you still there?\" Jaord asked. \"Yes. But I have to get back to the command center.\" she replied. Joel and Jarod then walked through doors out to a balcony overlooking the airfield. They came to a room where several soldiers stood and walked around gathering weapons, Higgins was watching a monitor and turned, grabbing his Vector off the table. \"Looks like the Opfor decided to join our private party.\" He said smiling. \"Follow me.\" \"Man they got some sacs for coming this far into our controlled territory.\" Jarod said. Higgins laughed \"I doubt it has anything to do with bravery. They don't know they were just sent on a suicide run.\" Minutes later Dr. Lancer got on the radio. \"All units we verify Opfor presence in the base. I repeat, Opfor are in the base!\" All of a sudden a C-17 exploded on the tarmac spewing fiery bits everywhere. The scorching head blinded them for a minute then they saw swarms of Opfor insurgents storm the airfield. \"We need to protect the aircraft!\" Jarod screamed. \"Command, we got some F-16s in the air, we also have visual on MiG fishbeds incoming from the south over.\" Randolph sounded relieved \"Good Private, see about what you can do with those Anti-Aircraft defenses on the southern end of the base.\" \"Wilco.\" Joel replied. At that moment, Opfor walked through the hallway and killed several Marines. Jarod reacted first and killed two with his M4. \"C'mon we need to get to the AA guns!\" The three continued battling Opfor to the south and came to a two door fork. Joel thought fast before ordering Higgins and Jarod to cover the other door. He sprinted to a desk and waited, out of breath before more insurgents destroyed the door at the far end. Joel checked his SCAR's ammo set his sights on the closest insurgent and fired three shots. The insurgent went down and thrashed wildly before dying. One member primed a grenade and lobbed it, Joel saw it roll past and grabbed it and threw it back just in time before it exploded killing all the Opfor in the hall. He ran to the AA guns which the Opfor were using to take out the F-16s. He ran to the first one and vaulted over it firing shots into the operator's head. His SCAR was out of ammo, so he drew his M1911 and cleared the remaining two AA guns killing the operators with all one shot, before Joel and Higgins arrived. Higgins had a gunshot wound in his left knee and it didn't seem to be bleeding. \"Don't worry. I can still fight.\" Higgins replied as if almost reading Joel's thoughts. \"You can't get rid of me so easily remember.\" A deafening crash was head before a MiG 21 crashed into the window nearby and the cockpit exploded ejecting a flaming body. \"General. The AA guns are now back under our control.\" Joel said through the radio. Gunners came from the hallway and manned the AA guns. Jarod and Higgins walked down the staircase to the outside, where three Opfor T-55s and at least a hundred foot soldiers were hammering the base's defenses. One tank set its sights on the two and Joel ran over to the MiG and kicked it. The plane shifted, groaned and fell down in front of Jarod and Higgins. The tank fired and hit the plane and destroyed it. Nobody had anti-armor weapons so Joel decided to call for air support. \"Command requesting air support at sector Foxtrot Hotel.\" \"Copy that. Slasher four four and Slasher four five are inbound over.\" Randolph said without hesitation. Jarod saw insurgents getting closer and wondered what the Viper attack helicopters were doing to take them so long. A rocket soared through the air and a T-55 along with several insurgents went up in flames. \"I got me one!\" Slasher four five exclaimed as he fired more rockets obliterating more tanks and insugenents. They suddenly fell back and retreated under heavy fire from Slasher four four and four five. Randolph advised immediate takeoff for the C-130 for Dr. Lancer which she agreed and directed both Jackson brothers onboard the C-130. Once they got out of range, she showed them a closed room and began informing them of her new project. \"You are two new operatives of the LANCER project. You are to help and try to stop the growing tension between NATO and Russia. If diplomacy fails, then you will be fighting as well. To assist you on these missions. You are issued LANCER armor, follow me and I will show it to you.\" She walked out the door and the Jackson brothers followed. They entered a room where a glass box stood in the center, there was a large suit which had armor nearly two inches thick. It had sleek features and Joel saw grappling hooks and smoke canisters inside one of the wrists. The helmet had a breathing apparatus and a pair of frightening looking green shaded goggles. \"This armor allows a soldier to run faster, jump higher and hit harder than a normal soldier. It will protect you from most fire, however it is still vulnerable to sustained fire, explosives, high caliber shots and sniper rifles. Joel, would you like to try it on?\" Joel nodded and stepped up to the armor, he hooked his feet in the large boots and began strapping on the armor. When he was completed, he felt like he was in a bulky costume, but he felt good when he stepped off the platform and Jarod could tell his brother was enjoying himself in his new armor. It even had a heads up display in the goggles. \"Jarod, you will get your armor once we arrive at our base. Oh, we seem to be landing now.\" Dr. Lancer and Jarod strapped themselves in their seats and the C-130 bumped on the runway and stopped. Joel exited the back ramp and looked around, they were somewhere in Japan as seen the skyline. Dr. Lancer walked out with Jarod who had an armor of his own. His M4 looked small in his hands. Dr. Lancer, pleased by their status asked them to join her in her briefing of their first upcoming mission.Chapter 2  Miho Yonago Airport Japanese Self Defense Air Force Outpost Near Yonago, Tottori Japan 8:10 pm January 9, 2018 Joel and Jarod had gotten to a rough start to the LANCER team. There were approximately a dozen other LANCERs that composed the entire project. Dr. Lancer assured there were additional candidates that would arrive. She would have their team leader and his operatives meet them after the mission. Dr. Lancer hurried to find the Jacksons and couldn't find them, she frantically looked and found them talking to some Japanese soldiers. They seemed amused by their armor and were discussing military tactics and they watched Jarod and Joel together lift a 200 pound bomb into an F4 Phantom. She hurried across the tarmac to them. \"Alright. Mission briefing. This comes from US Command.\" She ushered them into a small room where she opened a laptop and entered a password. The laptop blinked and projected a hologram of the Korean Peninsula. Joel remembered, North Korea and South Korea have had a firece rivalry since the Korean War. Dr. Lancer pointed a little south to the city of Pyongyang. The laptop zoomed in on the hologram and several warehouses were displayed, one of them had nuclear missiles stockpiled inside. \"Here we suspect this to be a facility for secret equipment in North Korea.\" Dr. Lancer began, but was briefly interuppted by Jarod. \"Wait...My suspicion was that we were gonna go to Russia. Not play tourist and go to North Korea\" Dr. Lancer nodded and continued \"Russia and North Korea have signed a military alliance and North Korea is being supplied by Russian Antonov 124s every 10 minutes. By tomorrow they could invade South Korea and even Japan and easily overrun both by suffering minimal casualties. Your primary objective is to locate this equipment and get anything from the base back to US Command, then you are to blow it to pieces. Are there any questions?\" Joel spoke up after a minute of silence. \"How exactly would we get there? They're not just gonna let us walk through the front door.\" Dr. Lancer answered without hesitation. \"You and your brother follow me. This is where the fun is.\" she walked out of the building. Joel looked at his brother, both in their armor, shrugged and followed Dr. Lancer outside. Dr. Lancer covered her ears as an F4 Phantom took off at the nearby runway, she beckoned them to follow her into a hangar. She then typed in a panel and the hangar doors slid open to reveal a black B-2 Spirit sitting in the hangar. Three techs were working on a what seemed to be insertion pods, Dr. Lancer smiled and said \"These are Altitude Insertion Pods or AIPs for short. Their purpose is to insert a soldier in battle or deep in enemy territory. These two are prototypes and are unable to suit a normal soldier. Your LANCER suits will protect you from the friction and the pods are undetectable to enemy radar. If that's not enough, the pods have a small friction trail, minimizing visuals who happen to see it. Commander?\" She turned to the cockpit and knocked on the glass, it opened and the pilot stepped out. \"Yes ma'am? I made all the flight checks as you asked.\" \"Good\" she replied \"Dustoff is at 0200 tomorrow. Dismissed.\" The Jackson brothers left leaving her and the Commander in the hangar. Commander Geoffrey Kinkallen was a veteran pilot of a B-2, he had volunteered for the LANCER project, although he was not an offical operative of the LANCER commandos, he was approached by Dr. Lancer for his exceptional piloting skills and his unrivaled ability to deploy the payload and hit his target flawlessly. He had piloted a B-2 since he was 24. His B-2 the Spirit of Oregon was modified to carry up to four AIPs and/or bombs. In addition, if under enemy attack it had a defensve antiaircraft turret to fend off enemy aircraft. Kinkallen sighed and left the hangar to get some sleep before he flew the Jackson brothers out to their mission. Joel and Jarod found their bunk and unlocked their armor. Neither spoke until Jarod broke the silence \"Wait, if we are inside those pods don't you think it might be damn uncomfortable?\" \"Doubt it.\" Joel shrugged \"I bet they'd have some sort of hatch where we could access the cabin. Relax bro, even if it is unaccessible I don't think it is a long flight to North Korea anyway.\" They both fell asleep. Miho Yonago Airport Japanese Self Defense Outpost Near Yonago, Tottori Japan 12:00 am January 9, 2018 Jarod yawned and rolled over in his bed. His eyes fluttered open and he checked the clock. Midnight. \"Oh shit!\" he yelled out loud and shook his brother awake. They grabbed an energy bar and ate it before suiting up and walking across the tarmac. It was unusually quiet in the airfield, he noticed several civilian aircraft docked at the terminal performing some end of the day flights and the B-2 Spirit sat in the partially opened hangar, looking ominous as ever. \"You know.\" Joel spoke quietly \"We should mask our presence when on the mission so let's stop at the armory and get supressors.\" They stopped at the armory and found suppressors for their weapons before entering the hangar. Kinkallen stood under the wing securing a capsule to the bay. He turned \"Good to see you guys, if you want. I got some breakfast over there for the three of us.\" He motioned over to where three plates were. They had a small helping of eggs and sausages. \"I suggest we eat first so we don't give up our lunch before we leave.\" So they ate quickly and Kinkallen opened the hangar doors and performed flight checks while Joel and Jarod climbed into their pods. \"Oh yeah\" Kinkallen said while halfway up the ladder, \"There's a hatch that connects the aircraft to the pods, so you may come up into the cabin when you feel like it.\" They climbed into the cabin and strapped in before taking off. Joel saw the airliners and watched the city lights of Yonago as the B-2 rolled down the runway. He had to admit that Japanese lights were the most dazzling, even from a distance. A pair of F4 Phantoms escorted the B-2 out of Japanese airspace. Joel looked at one of them, the pilot gave him a thumbs up and he returned the gesture. Jarod fell asleep again and Joel drifted and asked Kinkallen to wake them 10 minutes before the drop before falling asleep as well. Kinkallen agreed before ordering the F4s to break formation and return to Japanese airspace. Kinkallen nudged Joel and he was instantly awake and got up to wake his brother. Jarod nodded and both brothers climbed into their pods. Kinkallen reported 5 minutes until the drop, Joel held his breath and slowly exhaled it. The drop came closer than he expected. \"Three, two, one. DROP!\" He felt a jolt and a continous motion downwards as he watched the B-2, nearly invisible against the starless midnight fade off into the distance.Chapter 3  Somewhere near Pyongyang, North Korea 12:10 am January 9, 2018 Joel felt the impact and was thrown around his pod. He kicked the door off its hinges and stumbled outside. It was pitch black and he pressed a button on his goggles, activating night vision. He crawled back inside his pod to grab his SCAR and M1911 which appeared to be destroyed in the impact. \"Fuck.\" he muttered quietly as his boots were snared in rice plants. He ripped them off and searched for hostiles. On his HUD two red outlines of enemy terrorists walked caually toward a warehouse. One had an AK-47 while the other held a Type 56. The AK-47 guard stopped and pulled out a cigarette and began smoking. The other guard with the Type 56 shouted something in Korean and walked inside one of the warehouses. The guard drew a last puff from a cigarette and tossed it. Perfect. Joel lunged, barely a whisper rustle as he wrapped his arms around the guard's neck and wrenched it with a pop. He held the body and gently laid it down in the grass. He grabbed the AK-47 and searched the guard's pockets for anything. He retrieved a suppressor and applied it to his weapon. Jarod's radio came online \"Joel, my pod got over turned. Can you get me out?\" Joel switched to his internal speakers so he could speak freely without alerting anyone. \"Yeah, place a beacon on my HUD and I'll get you.\" Joel saw a small diamond with an approximate distance to Jarod's pod and hurried to the area. Jarod continued giving him sitreps and told Joel that Korean soldiers found his pod and were trying to get it open. Joel crept behind the guards and struck the first one with the AK-47. He opened fire on the other guards, one fumbled for his Uzi and Joel stitched up his body with the remaining rounds from his AK-47. He leapt beside the pod, grabbed onto the hinges and pulled with all his strength, the door finally gave way and Jarod climbed out dazed. \"Where's your weapons?\" Joel asked. Jarod went back in his pod and pulled out a twisted M4, but his M1911 still worked. \"You don't wanna know what happened to my SCAR and 1911. I had to steal this guy's AK.\" Jarod nodded, he was in a cranky mood. Joel had known that his little brother disliked early morning activities. \"C'mon, we better hurry before anybody else finds the bodies.\" They moved to the warehouse. Jarod opened the side door on the closest warehouse. He saw multiple contacts on catwalks with flashlights attached to their weapons patrolling the top. \"Okay.\" He whispered \"Lets find a database and try not to attract attention.\" They entered the warehouse and saw multiple tanks and APCs stored here. Surprisingly, many of them were older M1 Abrams tanks and M2A2 Bradleys. \"I don't get it.\" Jarod finally said \"Don't you think they would use a tank they are more familiar with rather than steal ours?\" \"Yeah. I think so. Maybe they're using Western Vehicles to fool us into thinking of them as friendly forces.\" \"Great. All the more to blow this place up.\" They agreed and pushed past a rack of ammunition, one shell clattered and fell to the floor. \"Damn it.\" Jarod said. The guards immediately shined their flashlights on the shell which lay on the ground and began shouting in Korean. Some panicked on their radios while others began randomly firing in the warehouse. Joel and Jarod took cover behind an Abrams tank and Joel attempted to call for backup. Which Dr. Lancer could not send, due to aircraft groundings in Japan from bad weather. Joel began firing back at one guard which had thrown a grenade, the guard flinched and fell down from the catwalk. \"Joel! There's fuel tanks in here too watch your fire!\" Jarod warned firing his M1911. Joel stayed behind the tank as Jarod created a diversion, running and gunning. Joel pulled out a Semtex Grenade and threw it at the fuel cell, which exploded and destroyed large numbers of Abrams tanks as well as a handful of guards. Jarod meanwhile found a terminal and began dowloading intel on the supplies as Joel distracted the guards. One of the soldiers activated the lights exposing Joel and Jarod before the two LANCERs destroyed the lights. Now they were firing even more rapidly, not of elimination, but of fear. Jarod switched to his external speakers and crept behind a lone gunman. A clatter was heard and he turned around frightened, to see Jarod. \"Surprise.\" Jarod sneered before killing the soldier. Joel finished the last of the guards and left the warehouse, setting additional charges to the other storage facility. The LANCERs then signaled for extraction and blew the place to pieces. \"Damn.\" Jarod remarked \"Never knew an explosion could be so beautiful.\" Alarms went off and Korean shouts could be heard as well as gunfire. \"Ask it out later, we need to get out alive!\" Joel reminded his brother. His radio crackled \"This is Finger six-three, we are in route over, recommend you neutralize all counter air units before we get there.\" Both brothers found a suitable LZ close to their drop zone and popped their smoke. They defended and even used gas canisters to keep Koreans at bay. Eventually a Black Hawk arrived and Jarod got on. Joel ran out of rounds for his weapons and was still far from the LZ. A Korean machine gun crew opened fire and bullets scarred Joel's armor, yet he still managed to toss C4 onto the emplacement and blow it up. Joel then lept on the Black Hawk which quickly ascended and flew out of view of the terrified yet angry Korean soldiers. Jarod took off his helmet and his hair and face dripped with sweat, \"Man, Lancer should've put some sort of air conditioning in these suits!\" Joel nodded and watched the sunrise before taking off his helmet and wiping the sweat from his face. He fell asleep. Miho Yonago Airport Japanese Self Defense Outpost Near Yonago Tottori, Japan 8:00 am January 9, 2018 Joel woke up in a cot, his armor had been removed and was sitting in a stasis capsule. He got out of bed and joined Jarod next to Dr. Lancer. Lancer looked worried as she told them that the sighting of them earlier had angered North Korea. The ambassador of North Korea began negotiating with Dr. Lancer. She continued to deny anything about it and defended Joel and Jarod, insisting they were a peacekeeping patrol. The ambassador was angered to the point where his bodyguards would simply gun her and anyone else down without second thoughts. They aimed their AK-47s, Joel and Jarod stepped in front of Dr. Lancer. He simply left with his bodyguards intently on declaring war with Japan.Chapter 4  Unspecified Location Somewhere in the United States 5:55 pm January 9, 2018 Rain sat in the Humvee as it bounced along the rocky gravel, looking at his helmet. The driver seemed to be in a hurry, the call may had been urgent, or he was simply fearful of the LANCER. Either way, he breezed through a checkpoint still bumping. Rotors were heard in the distance as a Pave Low flew above the valley and settled somewhere. After what seemed like a long trip he saw a small building with two Pave Lows parked on helipads. The driver motioned for Rain to get off. He dismounted and walked toward the Pave Low, he caught a glimpse of another LANCER, he had greenish armor and was placing rounds into a magazine. His armor's collar read Alpha I and had the emblem of a Master Sergeant. It appeared that Silver Team had members with higher ranks than the other LANCER units Rain had trained with. Alpha I looked up at Rain watching his every move, who quickly moved on. Alpha I went back to placing his magazine into his M14 EBR. He remembered Alpha's profile, saying he was quite talkative. If he was going to get along with any others of his team, then Alpha would probably be his earliest friend. Rain walked in the doorway and saw another LANCER sitting on an ammunition box. This LANCER had a larger suit and was sharpening his oversized Kukri knife. 40mm HE grenades lined his chest and instead of the green goggles on the other LANCERS, this one had bright red. Rain assumed he was the team's Grenadier and spotted the name: Wildcard. Wildcard noticed Rain and looked up, he saw the bars of a Lieutenant. Rain felt as if the bright red goggles were staring right into him. Rain remembered his profile. Wildcard was a more reserved soldier, letting his actions speak for him. He was also nominated as having the highest fear factor when against terrorists, Rain believed that. Wildcard was the last one he would want to run into on a dark night. He entered and abruptly stopped by a LANCER bearing the emblem of a medic. His LANCER callsign appeared to be Butch. Butch looked like a fugitive, Rain didn't like him on first sight. He nodded to two other LANCERs standing over a table. One had heavier gear and was known as Dare. The second LANCER had his callsign as Vector who bore the emblem of Colonel. \"Colonel.\" Butch said, making Rain flinch. Vector slowly turned around eyeing the newest member of his team. \"So.\" Dare murmured. \"Our new number Six.\" The Colonel still said nothing as he got up and began to circle Rain. Dare also got up and stood behind him. Vector and Dare looked a lot more intimidating standing up. Rain knew what they were doing, searching for a weakness. \"Butch.\"Vector said, standing next to the door. \"Have you read his Career Record?\" \"I have.\" He turned back to Rain. \"What makes you think you are worthy to join Silver Team?\" Rain remained silent. Wildcard grunted, but remained where he was, continuing to sharpen his hooked Kukri knife. \"So. Randolph sends us someone to replace our previous Six only to find out he's completely useless!\" \"Vector. His reputation as an assassain is quite...impressive. I'm not the one to be judged, but I want to see his capabilities as a soldier.\" Butch replied. \"Alright.\" Vector said, \"I'm not gonna bullshit you Sergeant, but you're stepping into a pair of boots. A pair that the rest of the squad would much rather leave empty.\" He took a stride towards Rain and thrust his face up to Rain's. Rain did his best not to recoil, but Vector's glare was full of poison and he spoke through tightly clenched teeth. \"One way or another, you'll be out of this team, count on it!\" He then broke gazes. \"I assume you all know who our newest member is. We have a mission to do.\" Vector motioned for all the team members to board the Pave Low. \"Just so you know. FNG. We're a team. You go on your own and you'll be out even faster.\" Alpha laughed at Rain. \"Welcome to the last day of the rest of your life!\"Chapter 5  Unknown location Alaska, United States 11:11 am January 18, 2018 Captain Trent Legg steered his F-16 Falcon over the vast Bering Sea. On a normal patrol. His squadron flew in a tight formation behind him. \"Sir.\" His second in command called \"We have contacts, three Bears approaching 10 miles to the West.\" Trent had intercepted Bears and Blackjacks, but typically they came one at a time. He had never heard of three Bears entering US airspace at one time. A reflection off the Tupolev aircraft gave it away as the three, flying in a triangular pattern accelerated toward the US. \"Squad. intercept immediately!\" The F-16's broke off and began flying next to the three Bears. Legg tried to hail the bombers, but got no reply. \"Scan for any new capabilities the Russians could have added.\" Legg was searching for his camera when he heard an explosion. An F-16 went up in flames and plunged toward the ground. Gunshots were heard as the one of the Tupolevs antiaircraft guns tore apart another Falcon. Legg fired his machine guns a bullet clipped his engine, spinning his Falcon out of control. \"Mayday! This is Captain Legg going down 10 miles west of Nome! Mayday!\" before the Falcon crashed into the Bering Sea, Legg was instantly killed. \"We had a few F-16s escorting us. They were no match.\" Yurisev Sidorov reported to his commander. The invasion of Seattle, Portland and San Francisco were in full swing and US resistance was quickly crumbling. \"Lieutenant. You need to board the prototype now.\" his Commanding officer Voronov replied, sitting in the command seat. Sidorov exited the cockpit and walked to the bomb bay. A Mi-42 prototype helicopter sat. It was the largest attack helicopter ever built and previous test against the Chechen rebels, proved it was much more capable than it was expected. Sidorov entered the single seat and started the engine. The Tupolev dropped the helicopter and Sidorov piloted it towards Portland. He led an Mi-28 attack on the US helicopters. The Us had put up a desperate fight, but ultimately failed. \"Too easy.\" Sidorov sneered. \"Sidorov, there's a American convoy that's moving out of the city. You need to intercept, destory or capture whatever they are trying to move. It looks important due to multiple Humvees escorting the trucks.\" Sidorov acknoledged and moved his Mi-42. Highway 15 Southeast of Portland, Oregon 1:29 pm January 18, 2008 PFC Connor \"Falcon\" Alexander spent the last magazine of the minigun and ducked as bullets flew around him. \"Damn it! That was the last mag!\" His best friend, Sgt. Jim Smith gritted his teeth. \"This cargo better be important if I'm risking my life to protect it.\" The Rangers had been ordered to fight to the death to keep the package secure. Smith heard on the radio, this new massive Russian helicopter they were codenaming the Hydra. \"Shit.\" Falcon said, after the US decided to fight the Hydra. \"That thing took out four Cobra's at once? I never knew Russian junk could even fly.\" A rumble was heard as a massive helicopter hovered overhead. It was the biggest attack helicopter Falcon and Sarge had ever seen. It had a bulky frame and four wings that bristled with rockets. A nose mounted 20mm cannon was aiming straight at Falcon. \"Get down!\" Sarge yelled, pulling Falcon into the hatch. The cannon fired and a Humvee behind them flew above them to crash in an inferno. The Hydra turned to the armored truck and began firing rounds into it. Most shots splintered on impact and the Hydra fired a rocket that nearly flipped the truck. Sarge grabbed his SCAR and fired SLAP rounds. They pierced the Hydra's rotor, but it stayed upright, it wasn't even smoking. \"You gotta be kidding me!\" Sarge growled and began firing his Mk. 23 to distract the Hydra. Usually the other Russian Helicopters like the Hinds and Hokums would be easily taken out by a few rounds to the rotor or the engine. The Hydra had bullets in its engine and was running just as good as it was before Sarge shot it. It turned and retreated behind a building. Spetsnaz soldiers began coming from behind the building. Sarge began dropping them, but every one he killed, it seemed as if four more came to replace it. \"Damn it! They keep coming!\" The Hydra reappeared again, this time facing away from the trucks. A few rounds bounced off its heavy armor. A Pave Low had attacked the Hydra! It fired rockets towards the Pave Low, it responded with a set of flares which decoyed the missiles. A figure with heavy armor jumped out of the Pave Low on top of an Ultranationalist soldier and sunk its knife into his neck. Two more armored figures jumped out. One began distracting the Hydra forcing it back while hitting it with its M249. The other two continued killing Spetsnaz soldiers, who were too terrified to fight. The Hydra went behind the same building as the remaining Spetsnaz soldiers retreated into the troop bay. The Hydra then retreated, moving out of sight. Sarge held his breath, he knew that the Spetsnaz never gave up on their objectives. The armored figures walked over to his Humvee and surveyed the convoy. Only the three trucks and six of the seven Humvees survived. The armored figure approached him. \"Sgt. Smith?\" Sarge nodded. \"Good. I'm Vector, this is Dare and Wildcard. We are LANCERs.\" Sarge knew who they were. He had heard of LANCERs recently and wanted to see them up close. Vector looked past Sarge to Falcon. \"We are here to pick up the package.\" Vector continued. Falcon got out of the Humvee. \"So wait, this shitbox is yours? I risked my life to be a delivery boy to some freaks?\" Wildcard stepped forward, but Dare put a hand on his shoulder and shook his head. \"That package.\" Vector replied \"Are new suits of freak armor to be worn by more freaks. Their value to the US military is about one hundred times higher than you. Any unit that is transporting LANCER suits are required to fight to the death to protect it. And that includes you...Falcon. Now, I suggest we get the equipment out of here before more Russians arrive with something worse than their new flying soup can we call a Hydra.\"Chapter 6  Makkah, Saudi Arabia Masjid al-Haram 10:30 pm January 18, 2018 Jake Smitty observed the enormous crowd circling the Kaaba. He had never seen so many people in his lifetime at one event. He turned away from the scene and walked back to Khaled Al-Asad II. Smitty was ordered to gain Al-Asad II's trust so that Al-Asad II's clan and the United States could possibly negotiate. Smitty was a good friend and an advisor to Al-Asad II, it would hurt his friend to say that he was undercover. \"Let's go.\" Al-Asad II said and left the mosque with his bodyguards and Lieutenant Aram-Bin Asad. He was known as Farhad Al-Kimad in the Arabic nation. Kimad traveled through the streets, bustling with activity as people chatted and traveled to the market. It was a fairly decent place for tourism, however it was deep in war between Al-Asad II's Opfor and multiple resistance fighters. The enemy groups had barely cooperated with each other. At one point, Kimad was watching four resistance groups fighting the Opfor in different sections. Usually, they were no match for the better trained and eqiuipped Opfor. They got into a truck and drove to their headquarters. Many Russian equipment was stored outside and Opfor members were placing covers over BMPs, Mi-24s and T-72s. At the checkpoint, Al-Asad II asked the guard why they were covering as he ordered all helicopters and vehicles operational at anytime. The guard replied that there was a sandstorm rolling in that would likely be there for the entire night. Smitty went to his room and turned on his computer. He set up his jammer and forwarded a message to the US command. Lt. Aram-Bin Asad was heading to Ukraine in a week to obtain a pair of nuclear weapons that Al-Asad II planned to use to threaten the multiple resistance groups to submit. He sighed, closed the laptop and went to sleep on his bed. Somewhere along the Maryland Coastline 12 kilometers South of Chesapeake Bay 10:51 pm January 18, 2018 Dr. Lancer leaned against the bulkhead of the Pave Low observing Silver Team. Vector and Dare were playing a game of cards. Alpha, Rain and Butch seemed to be tidying up their weapons. Wildcard sat with his legs dangling over the edge, sharpening his knife as usual. Anthony \"Prowler\" Sorenson sat on the minigun in his new armor, apparently filling in his mission logs. \"Um. Doctor?\" Prowler asked eagerly \"Are you sure, this armor works, I am not a superhuman like my brother.\" Lancer laughed, Anthony's brother Leo was a famous Ranger and was often idolized by others when he was killed trying to save a wounded teammate. \"No Anthony. You need to grow some and adjust.\" Anthony nodded, but still looked confused. Falcon and Sarge also were in the cabin, wondering if they just had a free ride or were coming along for a mission. Lancer ordered Silver Team over to her while she displayed a map of the approaching Russian Fleet as well as some top secret files. Rain saw something familiar about them, but he kept his thoughts to himself. She began, \"Now. I have a plan to take the fight to the Soviets.\"Chapter 7  Top Secret Location Somewhere along the Eastern Coast of the United States 7:14 pm January 20, 2018 The Pave Low edged itself along the beach and slowly came to a stop, kicking up sand and dirt. Rain jumped out along with the rest of his team. He couldn't believe that Lancer's mission request was approved. Even though she created the LANCERs, she now had access to any top secret equipment in the US military. It was as if she was playing some big crazy ass game... \"Let's move!\" Vector shouted. Rain snapped out of his thoughts and sprinted. As Silver Team approached a hill, rotors were heard and everyone looked up. It was like a movie scene. Mi-8s were approaching the beach by the dozens, flying over to the cities, along with escorting Mi-24s and Mi-28s. There were so many aircraft, too many to count. An Mi-26 Halo flew over and dropped Russians off. The team broke their ranks and began firing. Despite that they feared the LANCERs, the Russians put up a fight and it took a full 10 minutes to eliminate the entire force. Further up the hill, an Mi-8 had dropped off a BMP and two dozen Russians as well as another Russian at the top of the hill. He had a rather more armored uniform and his shoulder pauldron was larger than the others. He carried an MP5K with one hand and a Riot Shield in the other. Rain had never seen the rank before, but apparently Vector did. \"Officer! Take him out before he calls for help!\" Rain aimed his M14 at the officer and pulled the trigger. The officer pulled the shield over his body and the shot bounced off harmlessly. Dare was already mowing down enemies with his M249. Rain primed a grenade and threw it at the officer, it sailed behing the shield and he turned to face it, he took this oppurtunity to fire four more rounds into the back of the officer, dropping him. Silver continued to the top of the hill, at the top there were several buildings and obviously an airstrip. Gunfire could be heard as Russian and US forces were facing off for control of the base. Silver Team entered, Rain was ordered to take point. He went down a hallway to see a russian officer taking cover behind a storage crate. He approached the officer, drew his knife and slashed the officer across the hip. He then drove his knife into the officer's eye and threw him down. The next room had a view to the front entrance. He saw a couple AT4s and was about to get them when an explosion tossed all but one off the side and a T-90 rolled to the base's front gate. The massive tank turned to face Rain, he gulped and braced for the worst. The tank fired and Rain dove out of the way while taking cover behind a destroyed Humvee. A whooshing sound was heard as a rocket soared into the air and crashed into the T-90 vaporizing it. Prowler and his friend Jessup Grogan stood there with Prowler's smoking Javelin and Grogan's RPD. \"You guys alright?\" Grogan asked. \"We're fine. Is it ready for launch.\" Vector, immdiately got down to the main reason why they were here. Anyone could tell that if Vector got impatient, he didn't like someone or something. Rain walked to the first hangar where he saw a familiar fighter sitting inside. \"Rain, get to the Raven before the Russians wreck it!\" Vector said. Rain hurried over like he had never seen one before. The Raven was a prototype 5th generation fighter that had only two prototypes. Although top secret, Dr. Lancer had access to anything she wanted in the US military. It had sleek panels that would often deflect most gunfire and sometimes. It looked as if it were an alien fighter. Rain was involved in the development of the Raven and was ordered not to reveal any intel to anyone about it. He climbed into the pilot seat, it felt uncomfortable and he didn't fit. The single seat was designed for an Air Force uniform, not the bulky LANCER suit. Rain adjusted himself and started the engines. He knew this fighter inside and out, so flying this would make no difference to him. The Raven rolled out of the hangar and onto the runway where he initiated the takeoff sequence. \"Stage 1 of launch sequence commencing.\" the announcer replied. The Raven rolled down the runway and took off into the sunset. \"Stage 2 of launch commencing.\" The Raven had three stages of launching, the first was getting it into the air, the second was to fold out its engines for maneuvering. \"Final stage of launch commencing.\" the announcer ordered and the Raven shot out. Rain grabbed the controls and steered in formation of a few F-15s. \"A Raven?\" One of the pilots asked \"Damn. We could use a hand!\" Rain smiled and observed the US fleet stationed at the Coastline. The US had two aircraft carriers, a dozen destroyers, four heavy cruisers and about nineteen frigates. The approaching Russian fleet was three times as large. Rain was ordered to thin out the fleet's ranks before they got a chance to destroy the US fleet. \"MiG's! Take em out!\" the commanding F-15 ordered. Rain steered the Raven to face dozens of MiG-23 \"Floggers\". He fired the machine guns and clipped two Floggers, sending one into the water and the other exploded in midair. \"Eagles pursue and destroy!\" The Eagles broke formation and began chasing the Floggers. In the fight, Rain had scored over half the Floggers while the F-15s picked off stragglers. One of the F-15 pilots even joked towards Rain and even he almost smiled at. \"Yeah, those Russians are in deep shit now!\" his co-polit remarked. \"Ah. Shit! Flankers!\" The Flanker was a Sukhoi aircraft and was quite maneuverable and was more powerful than the F-15, but not the Raven. Rain wanted to show the Flankers what they were really dealing with and armed his rockets. Locked on. He hit the firing button, the Flanker rolled out of the way, just as Rain intended. He pelted the fighter with a barrage of machine gun fire and it exploded into bits. Rain smiled, if he had a fighter that resembled his personality, this was it. His COM channel was pinging and Vector came online. \"Rain, the USS Coronado needs assistance on attacking a Russian Navy straggler. Clear a path to that frigate!\" Rain steered the Raven and engaged the booster engines until the monitor alarmed him of the temperature. The Booster Engines were two extra engines added to the side of the Raven. It allowed for a fast acceleration going faster than any other fighter, however the engines were quite prone to overheating and would activate fail-safe measures. Basically, the Raven would self destruct if the boosters are engaged too long. It had a computer that could identify enemy targets as well as the distance to the target and a reticule indicating where the operator should fire to lead into the enemy target's path. Rain finally saw the Coronado engaging the Russian Frigate. The Coronado had itself stationed in shallower water, protecting itself from any submarine torpedoes. The Raven banked over the Russian ship and Rain released several bombs in the bay, explosions blossomed around the ship and he turned around to fire a missile onto the ships bridge, putting it down for good. Rain smiled and moved the Raven towards the base. His eyes widened at the sight of Russian fighters now using the airstrip and assumed it had been overrun. He gritted his teeth and moved the Raven into a strafing run over the airfield.Chapter 8  USS George W. Bush 180 miles Northwest of Honolulu 11:16 am January 24, 2018 Silver Team walked through the corridors to the outside of the carrier. The George W. Bush was carrying reinforcements to the Afghanistan front. It had to go right through the North Korean blockade to get there. North Korea has made an ultimatum of allowing South Korea to be absorbed into a single Communist Korea or invade South Korea anyway and send troops to reinforce Russia who was retreating from the Western US. The deck was a busy place. Sailors were carrying boxes of supplies to and from places, fighters were taking off every fifty seconds, it was hectic on the top. Randolph was aboard with three new LANCER candidates, assigned to do a supposed assassination mission. Vector had gone to talk to the new LANCERs while the rest of the team sat in a troop quarters and watched the news on the Russian Invasion. Alpha finally broke the silence \"I heard two of the new guys are Snipers, one's a pilot, a heavy weapons dude and the last guy is an SAS member.\" Butch shrugged \"I'm sure Vector will have any info about them, although they will comprise of Charlie Team.\" Rain looked at Wildcard who listened intently while playing cards with Dare. Dare slapped a card down and smiled. Wildcard said nothing, slammed his fist into the table, knocking it over and walked out of the room. The TV suddenly was interrupted by Breaking News. \"Dude. She's hot.\" Dare sneered, mentioning the reporter. \"Just shut up and watch the program.\" Butch snapped, obviously impatient. Dare shrugged at Rain and they listened to the story. \"Doctor Natalie Lancer along with LANCER Jessup Grogan have not been found for nearly 24 hours. They were last seen in Atlanta, Georgia. Known for creating the LANCER project. NATO has dispatched LANCERs aboard the USS George W Bush to assist on the search for their founder. Nothing else is known at this time.\" The door opened and a pair of LANCERs along with Vector and Wildcard entered quietly listening to the news. Rain knew who they were, the Jackson brothers. They stood in silence watching the last footage of Dr. Lancer being replayed on the news. There was a knock on the door and Randolph arrived with Scott Petterson in his new LANCER armor. \"My apologies for interfering, this is Petterson, a new LANCER who will now be assigned to Charlie Team. I am now commandeering the LANCER program. You will be taking orders from me until Dr. Lancer is found.\" Vector looked reluctant. Butch, Alpha and Dare nodded. Wildcard just stood there, not sure to just walk out again or stay. \"I just recieved a possible sighting of Dr. Lancer in Venice. It is possible that an insurgent group has kidnapped her. They have established a hideout and can be very dangerous. Be careful around civilians.\" Randolph nodded and exited the barracks. Vector turned to his team. \"Charlie, you will continue with your assassination. Silver, lets go find Dr. Lancer and Grogan.\"Chapter 9  Boryspil International Airport Kiev, Ukraine 7:52 am January 25, 2018 \"Finally!\" Tyler \"Pheonix\" Anderson groaned. \"It's been a long ass trip!\" Ryan \"Shadow\" Lewis nodded, Anderson was not very fond of staying put, despite being Lewis' spotter. Charlie team picked up their baggage and went to the outskirts of Ukraine. Charlie Team comprised of Shadow, Pheonix, Tom \"Weasel\" Shaw, Scott Pettersen, James \"Predator\" Riley and led by Max Green. It was a newly formed LANCER team and at first they didn't get along. When they were assigned to assassinate Aram Bin-Asad. They rented an Mi-8 and flew towards the meeting zone. Every LANCER donned their armor and Green unveiled a map. \"Okay, Asad is supposedly coming here to collect Russian arms and ordinance.\" He pointed north of Kiev, near Chernobyl. \"He seems afraid of coming near the plant, so radiation poisoning should not be an issue. There is a hill that allows perfect for a sniper to wreck havoc.\" Lewis smiled and Green continued. \"Once Lewis takes him out, we will fly the Hip near their sniping zone in case Asad's henchmen compromise our mission. The entire LANCER team, except Shadow and Phoenix will stay with me and set up an encampment. Once you two pass the highway here. You'll be on your own.\" The Hip descended, Shadow hopped out along with Phoenix. \"It's a long ass walk.\" Phoenix remarked looking at the map in his hands. Lewis agreed \"Then we better get started.\" The place seemed empty and they passed the highway. By sunset, they were about two thirds of the way, so they started a fire and ate a quick meal before falling asleep. The Next Day The next day, their progress was halted. Phoenix saw three Opfor members at a checkpoint. \"You see em?\" \"Yeah. I do. Should we take em out?\" Phoenix and Shadow were wearing Jet Black LANCER armor and they stood out agains the grass, they couldn't keep their element of surprise for much longer, one insurgent was smoking and was walking in their direction. A truck rumbled by and the third member ran back to his post. \"Follow me.\" Shadow whispered and ran back to a rocky area. He and Phoenix crouched and Shadow told him his plan. \"Okay. I'm gonna start a rockslide and that will cause the truck driver to have to roll them off the road. So we get on underneath and the truck drives in. There we go, a ticket to the city, expenses paid.\" Phoenix nodded and he planted four charges of C4 and detonated them causing several boulders to crash on the road. \"Now we just have to wait.\" Shadow said. \"Aw. Shit. Those Opfor guys are coming here. Let's take em out.\" Phoenix added his silencer and fired three bursts. The weapon coughed and all three insurgents dropped. Shadow and Phoenix walked over and dragged the bodies over in a corner. After an hour of waiting, a truck arrived and they heard doors open. Shadow peered over, there were two Opfor members pushing rocks off the road. He and Phoenix quietly and quickly ran underneath the truck. The Opfor rolled the last rock off the road and got back into the truck. Rocks flew up and pelted Shadow's mask. They both were inches off the ground and could be easily compromised if either of them lowered themselves. The truck stopped at the checkpoint and paused due to Ithe absence of the guards. The driver said something in Arabic and drove into the city. It parked next to a T-72 and the two men took something from the back of the truck and walked out. Shadow was the first one to move, he lowered himself and crawled to the front of the tank. \"All clear.\" He whispered. Phoenix followed and saw the hill where they were supposed to snipe from. They avoided several patrols and crawled to the top of the hill. They saw many warehouses and the metropolis in the background, a helipad sat in the center. Phoenix saw it too. \"I bet thats where Asad will be touching down.\" They began assembling the M82 Barrett sniper and the sun was setting again. So they ate and fell asleep. Aram Bin-Asad was supposed to land tommorow. Shadow practiced aiming at the helipad before falling asleep.Chapter 10  Unknown Location Somewhere in Northern Ukraine 1:25 pm January 26, 2018 Shadow shouldered the Barrett and adjusted his scope. It seemed almost time for \"Viper\" to arrive. Sweat beaded down his hand and he had a white knuckle grip on the handguard. Phoenix was also watching and he checked his watch. \"The shuttle should be touching down in 5 minutes. Look at all those guys down there. He must be a really special guy.\" Shadow looked over, there were guards in a ceremonial arabic armor standing on either side and even a red carpet was being rolled out. At one end, there was a table with a bottle of whickey and an armored figure, who sat by another figure with less armor, but a more elaborate appearance. The guards held Saif swords, but retained their Opfor look. Shadow checked his watch, the shuttle should be touching down any second. In the distance a black dot moved and quickly enlarged into an Mi-8. It landed at the helipad and powered down. Phoenix saw two guards with AK-47s and Saif swords exit the helicopter. A third figure exited the Hip looking higher rank than the others. Phoenix couldn't identify anyone from this distance. \"I can't tell if it is a positive ID, but the guy with the sash has got to be him.\" Shadow nodded and his finger touched the trigger. The crosshairs continued to follow his target's head until he sat at the table and the larger figure poured him a glass of whiskey. They talked and the second figure mentioned to the first to enter a building. Shadow steadied his aim and squezzed the trigger. The Barrett spat the round and Shadow felt the sniper kick against his shoulder despite his LANCER suit dampening recoil. Phoenix saw the target crumple with a spray of blood and all the guard's delayed reactions. \"Let's get the fuck out of here!\" Shadow yelled and they both jumped from the hill as it was pounded by dozens of launched grenades. They ran through the field before they came to a stop near the highway. There were no infantry in sight and an armored Hip helicopter had a spotlight searching the fields. \"Charlie Two to Charlie One, where are you guys? We request extraction. A Hip is looking for us and we can't trick it for long!\" \"I hear ya!\" Green replied \"Engine won't start up! We're trying to fix it. In the meantime get as close to here as you can. Charlie One out.\" \"Great. They just told us were fucked!\" Phoenix shouted. \"No time for bitching we got friends!\" Both turned to see guards in ceremonial armor making use of cover and firing with FALs and TAR-21s. Shadow aimed his M40A3 and dropped three guards before noticing the leader in the back. He had a higher status and was pointing a saif at the two LANCERs. \"What's the big deal?\" Phoenix just kept bullshitting Shadow. \"Did the Opfor finally decide to upgrade?\" He threw some C4 and blew up the cover positions where he killed the remaining guards with his M16A4. The leader charged with his saif and knocked Shadow to the ground. he tried to reach for his sidearm, but couldn't. The guard raised his saif and Shadow struggled, until Phoenix got on top of him and swatted his hammer like arm into the guards neck. There was a shattering sound and the guard stiffened and fell down. Shadow got up and retrieved his M40A3, they both ran past the highway. They got to a rocky field when a helicopter was approaching. They squatted in the rocks and a huge shadow flew overhead. It was the Hydra! The pilot aimed his gun and painted the rocks with a laser and then flew off. Seconds later, a barrage of bombs ravaged the field. Shadow was thrown and landed in a heap. The barrage stopped and Phoenix rushed to his sniper. He got out a medkit, Shadow had severe cuts and almost lost his right leg. Phoenix remained calm, it wasn't a long walk back to where the camp was. In his radio, Shadow called him. \"Phoenix, hurry up, that damn Hydra's coming back. Wait. Shit! It landed and a group of Spetsnaz are coming.\" Gunshots were heard in the radio and he heard static. \"Shadow?! Shadow?! Ryan, are you there?! NO!\" He ran as fast as he could back to the camp. Green waved to him just as the helicopter's rotor blades began to spin. \"Where's Ryan?\" Green asked. Phoenix looked down \"The Hydra took him. I think Ryan is dead.\" He walked into the Hip and sat in the corner seat as it took off and stared into the sky. \"Damn.\" Riley remorsed \"I never knew Lewis, but he was a great guy.\" \"Charlie One to Command. Target destroyed. We're returning to base.\"Chapter 11  Downtown Savannah Savannah, Geogria 5:27 pm January 30, 2018 Daniel \"Spartan\" Baird reloaded his G36C and returned to Silver Team. He was a new LANCER and since no LANCER teams were avaliable, Baird was put temporarily into Silver. The Russian invasion of Savannah proved to be a costly one, the US expected them and they knew the city better than the Russians. They had retreated for an unknown reason and could be coming back with reinforcements. Alpha had gone up to one of the skyscrapers to watch the fleet. Vector stood guard while the rest of the team slept. Alexys \"Cherry 23\" Kinney also sat inside her Apache toggling her headset. All was quiet and Rain found it quite peaceful for a while. He had been fighting for nearly three days nonstop. He began to drift to sleep when the alarm went off. Rain was instantly awake, hands on his SCAR. \"Looks like the Russians want another party! Cherry 23, get to your helicopter, possible Hind approaching.\" Vector said. He had a lot of energy today and he could amp up the LANCERs. Kinney began flight checks with her gunner and she took off flying between the buildings. \"I can't get a target! There's too much fog!\" Kinney reported \"Alright.\" Vector replied, \"Wait until they get closer. If you see any Russians, don't hesitate to rip em up.\" Through the thicker fog and the quickly darkening sky, it was difficult to see them, but the noise they made there was defenitely a Hind. Finally they came into view, there were at least 50 troops backed by 10 officers, one BMP-2 and the Hind came into view. It didn't even look like a solid military unit, the Hind was accelerating forward, right past the foot soldiers. Vector surveyed the approaching force and turned to see US Army Rangers rushing to meet them taking cover behind barricades. \"Do you think they're a scouting party?\" \"They don't look like it, otherwise they would've turned back by now.\" replied Butch who aimed his sights at an officer and opened fire. The Spetsnaz foot soldiers and nine of the officers were easily killed with combined firepower and the officer continued calling for help. It seemed like random screaming to the US forces, but to the Russians, it might as well be a bugle call because more Spetsnaz soldiers began moving toward the battle. Rain finally put as many shots as he could into the officer, but most were deflected by the Riot Shield. The officer threw a flashbang which stunned the Rangers. The Officer rammed Butch with his shield and knocked him down. Rain took that oppurtunity to fire his last rounds with his SCAR, Wildcard jumped on top of the Spetsnaz and fired his Desert Eagle point blank into the officer's thick helmet. The officer was STILL moving, he began to get up. Butch raised his weapon and slammed the back of it into the officer's neck. \"Fuckin knight. Gimme that.\" He picked up the shield and flung it towards the remaining Spetsnaz. It hit an officer and tripped him. Wildcard grabbed him and lifted by the neck. \"Heh. Now we might be able to get some info about why they decided to invade the US.\" Butch brainstormed Dare nodded \"Good thinking.\" The Spetsnaz yelled something in Russian, for all they knew, it could have been cursing them out loud, either way it sounded garbled. \"Hey asshole. Look here!\" Butch shouted, snapping his fingers \"Why are you attacking us now?\" The Spetsnaz bellowed out loud. Alpha looked over, \"Just kill him already. He'd be much more useful if the doc had put some translator thingy in our armor.\" Butch nodded and pulled out his twin G18s and put a round in his head. Wildcard dropped the body and dusted off his hands. Butch put away his G18s and faced the remnant of the Spetsnaz. Since their officer had been killed, they must have known the party was over. Two troopers carrying RPGs turned and attempted to run for it and were instantly gunned down when they went into the clearing. Kinney was a patient lady for sure, waiting like a vulture until she got some trade. She circled and took care of the BMP and turned away. There was a whoosh of rockets and an explosion. Kinney came back on the radio \"Hind destroyed. Coming back down.\" She landed the Helicopter and got out. Vector nodded, \"Thanks for the air support.\" \"No problem!\" she replied Vector got back online, \"Command. This is Silver. Enemy resistance has been neutralized. Prisoner attempts have failed.\" \"Roger that Colonel. Diamond Team has gone missing as well. Charlie Team is returning, but they lost Shadow. I have no further information. Continue your search for the Doctor. I will try to get Diamond's last known location. Command out.\" \"Who's Diamond?\" Butch asked as Vector accessed the list and marked Shadow as MIA. \"They're the secret team going far behind enemy lines. You know, Sarge, Falcon, Buzz and Winchester? That's Diamond. Alright, I want to make sure the Russians are cleared out. Alpha, take Rain and scout the high ground to the north. Once they report clear or neutralize enemy threats. Cherry 23 will move in and we can make a suitable base where we can monitor the LANCER's activities. Move out.\" Alpha groaned \"Fuck. I gotta babysit again.\"Chapter 12  4 miles north of Savannah Georgia 7:00 pm January 30, 2018 \"Follow me and stay low.\" Alpha whispered. He crept under the outcropping. Rain followed, paying close attention to the voices on top. Rain hopped on a step and slowly eased up. Two Russians stood with their backs to him. He drew his knife and threw it. It hit his neck and he crumpled in a heap. Rain then lunged for the second guard knocking him down and then stomped on his neck. \"This ridge is perfect.\" Alpha said, pulling himself to the ledge. Rain surveyed the Spetsnaz base. There were a hundred Spetsnaz soldiers, at least a dozen tanks and a Ka-50 Hokum patrolling the perimeter. \"Patience. Those AA guns will probably be our first priority. Taking them out would alert them to our presence.\" Rain nodded and looked around. There was a small path from the cliff that ran near the AA guns. He tapped Alpha on the shoulder and slid down. \"I just got a transmission. There's an AC-130 with Thomas Kramer callsign Big Brother orbiting the base. Simply laze your target and he'll take care of it.\" Rain smiled, an AC-130 was the perfect solution to his problem. He marked the AA guns and the Ka-50. \"Roger that. Ready to see some fireworks?\" A hail of fire pelted down and obliterated the AA guns. The Ka-50 was vaporized shortly thereafter. The base set off an alarm before Cherry-23 arrived and began tearing through tanks and troops. \"Ah shit!\" she yelled, \"Enemy reinforcements!\" Two Hinds arrived and began to engage the Apache. The AC-130 began pounding the base, as black smoke began filling the night. Rain was firing his SCAR fully automatic, dropping as many as he could. \"Outta rockets!\" Cherry-23 yelled and began moving back. The Hind pursued her and a Javelin accelerated and the Hind exploded, hurling debris everywhere. Dare approached, with a smoking Stinger with a huge grin on his face. \"See. I told Vector, we should have sent the whole team!\" The AC-130 kept raining death from above until Kramer called Alpha. \"I see no more hostiles. Good luck down there, out.\" \"Command, this is Silver.\" Vector said through the radio \"Scouting area cleared. Have you found a lead on the doctor yet?\" \"Yes. I have. At the Savannah Airport, I have a C-130 waiting to take you to Venice, Italy. Also stashed on board are LANCER II suits. Apparently Lancer was working on the a new and improved suit. She finished only Silver Team's before she dissappeared. I will direct you to the last known location where she was. There has been insurgent activity in Venice recently, so don't engage unless nesscesscary. I don't want you in the news. Randolph out.\" \"We get new suits? I think Randolph just made my day.\" Butch remarked, laughing.Chapter 13  Venice, Italy 9:13 am February 1, 2018 \"I never knew Venice could be so warm in February.\" Dare said when they crossed yet another bridge. Venice seemed like a great place. Silver had some good breakfast and were on their way to the beacon. Dare was getting quite excited for some reason, Vector held it to himself until he could take it no more. He turned. \"Dare, what the hell is wrong with you. Oh, I get it. You don't like your new suit.\" \"Nah.\" Dare replied \"There's just a whole lot of girls here that look amazing!\" \"It's Venice.\" Alpha replied \"What else do you expect?\" They moved closer to the insurgent's base and took a look around. The door opened and a woman, about 21 walked out to see the team with raised weapons. \"Get down!\" Vector hissed The woman, began to panic and shouted in Italian. Butch looked at her, \"She doesn't look that harmful.\" \"I don't mean to be overzealous, but Randolph told me to suspect anyone of an insurgent in close proximity of their base.\" Wildcard walked up to her, grabbed her purse and presented it to Vector who rifled through it. He still retained his frightening look that even made the woman step back when he approached. He found many items, but no weapons or explosives. He walked up to her and handed her purse back. \"My apologies for seeming like a thief. May I have your name and your purpose?\" She was shaking from head to toe. She finally spoke English. \"Yes. I'm Madeline. These guys tried to rob me in there! They nearly killed me!\" Madeline pointed in the direction of the insurgents. Wildcard stepped forward and nodded. Vector turned back to Madeline. \"Give him a description of the guy and he'll find him for you.\" She described it to Wildcard, who walked off into the district. Vector asked her if she saw someone like Dr. Lancer and she remembered. Gunshots were heard and Wildcard came back holding a man with a bleeding nose by the neck. \"That's him!\" Madeline shouted. She shouted at him in Italian and he shouted something as well. \"Let me guess.\" Alpha asked Wildcard \"You had to break a few fingers?\" Wildcard shrugged. \"Okay.\" Vector placed himself between Wildcard and the insurgent. \"Who are you and why are you attacking her?\" The guy struggled and Wildcard finally put an end to the guy's misery by a knife to the eye. Rain kicked the dead body. Madeline wanted to tag along with the team, but when she heard they were heading into the insurgent territory, she bid them luck and left, but not before Dare got her telephone number. Vector tracked the beacon until he stood over it. \"It ends here. Now where?\" Alpha looked up from the beacon on his HUD. \"You know what? It's coming from underground.\"Chapter 14  Underneath Venice, Italy 10:39 am February 1, 2018 Rain slid down the slope and tumbled headlong into a large crystal. He groaned and got up, nobody was in sight and he clicked his flashlight. No response, he flipped on his night vision goggles and began walking back up the slope, but it was way too slippery and the slope was made entirely of clay. It was nearly impossible to climb the slick wall. He gave up trying and walked along the tunnel. There were enormous crystals and the caverns were just as dazzling. Rain wondered if he had gone down a mile or something. His thoughts were cut off when he heard footsteps. Rain drew his handgun and crouched behind a crystal. The footsteps came closer until he saw a figure walk out. He approached, grabbbed the arm and twisted. His opponent twisted and countered the lock. Rain reacted first and punched his opponent in the sternum. A crack was heard and a grunt. He didn't move again. Rain knelt and placed his hand on the face. He felt a LANCER helmet. He reactivated his night vision and he was kneeling beside Butch, who was unconsious. He knew what he should do, He grabbed Butch's wrist and activated a beacon. Rain readied his weapon, as his teammates wern't the only ones following the signal. He dragged Butch behind the crystal and readied his SCAR when he heard Russians shouting. A five man patrol with flashlights approached where Butch came from. They spread out and began shining in the corners. Rain moved quietly behind one and held his SCAR in front. He grabbed the Russian and choked him to death with his own rifle. He snapped his foot out and caught another in the head. The guards whispered something, Rain grabbed two guards and smashed their heads into each other. He slashed his knife into the last Russian's stomach and ripped it out. The guard gurgled and dropped to the floor. Butch stirred and got up. He turned to Rain. \"What the fuck did you do that for?\" Rain shrugged. \"Well saying sorry isn't gonna cut it. C'mon we better find the rest of the team!\" He hurried off and Rain followed. They followed the tunnel until another slope, this one much bigger stood before them. Butch slid down and Rain followed. They were in an enormous cavern with crystals that lit the entire place. Rain looked at the top, where there was a two hundred foot drop and many long beams of water were crashing down into a large reservoir. They were on a small stone bridge that was nearly fifty feet above the water. The path led around a massive island where Rain saw Spetsnaz patrolling and even a Hip helicopter landing. There were two Hips circling the island and they pressed against a wall to avoid being in the spotlight. All of a sudden Rain heared shouting and gunfire rip through rock. \"Fuck!\" Butch shouted as he returned fire. \"How did they find us?\"Chapter 15  Underneath the City of Venice, Italy 11:13 am February 1, 2018 Butch vaulted over a rock wedge and crouched. Rain had punched his armor's breastplate and there was a huge crack and the coolant leaked out. His armor's internal temperature was very high and quickly rising. He drew his weapon and began firing at a Hind that had taken intrest. It fled behind the island and launched rockets at the ceiling. He rolled to his side seconds before a razor sharp stalactite crashed into the ground spraying rock everywhere. The rocket had made a newly formed hole and water began falling in another stream. \"Fuck off!\" he yelled and began firing in a blind rage. Rain was trying to get the Hind off Butch's back, but it was so determined to kill him, that even a full SCAR clip failed to attract it's attention. A memory of the rockets to the ceiling formed an idea in his head. He put his plan into action, by lighting a flare and throwing it into the air. The Hind flew over to him and began firing in bursts. Rain picked up a dead Russian's RPG, aimed and fired it at the ceiling. The Hind dodged the rocket, just as Rain had planned. The gunner threw Rain a taunting gesture, Rain shook his head and pointed at the ceiling. The RPG struck the ceiling, a stalactite broke off and fell on top of the armored helicopter, shearing right through it, the Hind crashed into the water and exploded. Rain felt triumphant, until the Hip arrived with fully armed Spetsnaz. He braced for his end. He heard a faint whoosh in the distance. The Hip moved closer and exploded in a fireball. Someone came on the COM link. \"Come on, you two. Rain..I'm dissapointed.\" Butch laughed, it was Dare with a smoking Javelin. He arrived with the rest of Silver Team. \"Good to see the both of you alive.\" Vector said, putting away the greetings. He seemed very battle hardened today. \"There's a possibility that Diamond Team is here. We're getting them out if they are. Let's move!\" Silver Team moved to the island, where the Russians had desperately destroyed the last helicopter so they couldn't use them. \"Wildcard, Alpha. Check the wreckage for any clues.\" They nodded and began digging through the rubble. \"No excat location for anything we're looking for.\" Alpha reported after a few minutes. \"There's something about a President Leonov. They were also saying something about a Mir II and Soyuz II craft.\" Rain vaguely remembered. He also remembered looking up information about Soyuz spacecraft and the Mir space station in school. \"Trace it.\" Vector ordered. Alpha set a small device on the side of the radio and listened. \"OK.\" He finally said. \"Placing the beacon on all HUD's.\" They hurried over to the beacon, sneaking past Spetsnaz patrols who were increasing, the closer they got to the waypoint. It took nearly four days to go what was seemingly north. Unknown Location 1:25 pm February 5, 2018 It had to be the longest trek, Rain had ever done in his life. He had some of the most intense drill instructors that made you do near impossible things that could make you cry in your bunker, dreading the exact same thing the next day. This long journey, avoiding Spetsnaz and walking down deadly slopes made Rain wonder if they would ever get back to the surface. After what seemed like hours of squeezing through narrow tunnels and climbing on stalactites over a pitch black abyss, they finally approached the waypoint. \"You'd think the entrance would be better protected.\" Butch remarked as they opened the doors. There was a lone figure looking at a monitor. He turned to face them with an angry look on his face. He spoke English. \"You must be American.\" They nodded. \"My name is Dyavol. My hatred of Americans grows nearly every day. I suggest you leave before I am forced to destroy you\" Vector ignored his threats. \"Dosn't matter. I also highly doubt you are capable of destroying all six of us.\" Dyavol smiled maliciously. \"Let's see.\" He pulled out a massive double bladed sword and charged.Chapter 16  Unknown Location 1:15 pm February 5, 2018 Dyavol removed an RPG and fired three rockets at the ceiling. The columns shattered and debris began to fell. Rain dodged one, but only him, Vector and Wildcard were trapped with Dyavol. Dyavol then began firing a modified PKM. The rounds shredded throught Rain's armor and he flinched while blood began to leak from his armor. Dyavol sprinted to him and swung his blade. Rain's reflexes savd him as he grabbed the handle and began to push with all his might. Dyavol was quite strong, but Rain had snapped his sword in two making Dyavol retreat. He rappeled over the edge of the cliff and dissappeared. The three rushed over to see Dyavol manning the single seat of the Mi-42 Hydra, he laughed and the Hydra flew off. Wildcard had finished blowing a hole in the rubble. Alpha, Butch and Dare stood on the other side. \"We need to get out of here, I think we got what we needed.\" Vector said. \"Well, there are two more Hinds left in the helicopter dock.\" Dare perked up. They hurried over to the helipads where two unpainted Hinds stood, looking ominous as ever. He mounted the gunner seat of the Hind with Dare and Alpha. They took off and began cruising through the caves and tunnels. Spetsnaz attempted to shoot them down with SAMs and T-72s, but from Dare's expert piloting and Alpha's spotting. Rain, easily put rockets and rounds into the resistance. A Ka-50 ascended to face them and Rain fired a rocket into the rotor. It exploded sparying debris everywhere. There was a loud explosion and the massive Hydra approached and instantly gave chase. \"Make this soup can fly faster!\" Alpha growled \"It's going as fast as it can!\" Dare retorted from the pilot's seat. The Hydra was feet behind them when Rain turned the minigun and shot the rotor. The Hydra spun and dissappeared. \"Fuck yeah!\" Alpha cheered \"That's one for us!\" They finally found a large hole and emerged somewhere in western Austria. They crossed fields and small cities. Rain was about to fall asleep when he heard something coming from underground. Dyavol's gritty voice boomed from the speakers of the Hydra. \"REMEMBER ME?\" \"Fuck!\" Dare said swerving to avoid the Hydra's massive blades. \"Rain, fire everything you got into that flying bathtub!\" Rain armed rockets and fired, the Hydra easily dodged and fired twice the rockets back. \"Hang on!\" Dare yelled as he performed a barrel roll to avoid the volley. Dyavol fired his machine gun and Rain shot it to suppress it. The Hydra shook, but maintained it's course. \"Rain! Shoot the rotors!\" Dare yelled over the gunfire. Rain turned the turret and shot the rotors with hundreds of rounds, but it still kept flying. \"Always hated Russian choppers!\" Vector said over the radio. \"They're impossible to take down!\" Rain kept observing as he battled the massive helicopter. It was quite maneurverable and it had an insane amount of guns, yet it carried only one person and it never banked sharply. So he fired at the tail rotor and it caused it to spin, Dare pushed every ounce of power to the limit and the Hinds accelerated past the Hydra. Rain aimed the turret at the Hydra and continued firing. It turned sharply and cut it's own tail rotor off, but it reamined in the air. Rain's mouth dropped open. \"Are you shitting me?\" Butch ranted. \"How much can this thing take?\" It accelerated in front and Rain fired every rocket at it. It spun and crashed, for good this time. Dyavol was hurled out of the cockpit and landed in a heap. Dare landed the Hind and the team approached the weckage of the lone Mi-42. Dyavol was crawling and drew his Desert Eagle. \"Remember us?\" Vector jeered before he placed a round in the back of his neck. Alpha searched the wreckage, \"Look at this. Coaxial rotors. The tail rotor was just a backup.\" Dare pulled out a chip from the cabin. It was in an armored box. \"Looks like this is what Dyavol wanted to keep away from us. Looks like some sort of rocket.\" Vector took the box and read it. \"They're getting an orbital space station to spy on our loactions and possibly launch missiles at our defenses! We need to get this data back to Command!\"Chapter 17  Makkah, Saudi Arabia 11:14 am February 6, 2018 Jake \"Kimad\" Smitty sat at his laptop. He typed an email to US Command and set up the jammer before sending it. Hopefully the LANCER team had assassinated Aram Bin-Asad so the nuclear arms were not collected. Someone knocked on his door and he opened it. An Opfor soldier stood there, \"Al-Asad wants to see you.\" \"Tell him, I'll be right out.\" The insurgent nodded and shut the door. He got his mask on and walked over to the command center. There were several insurgents operating computers and Al-Asad II stood, overseeing a monitor. Smitty walked up to him. \"Ah. Kimad, isn't it great that Bin-Asad returned alive?\" Smitty's heart stopped. \"What? He was attacked?\" Smitty tried to remain calm. \"Of course he did.\" Asad smiled. \"The one that was attacked was a decoy, we actually achieved the ordinance a day before they were attacked.\" Aram Bin-Asad walked in, just as Asad II said. He was very much alive and well. \"Anyway.\" Al-Asad II continued. \"That's not what I called you here for. We recently intercepted this electronic message sent to the United States by a Jake Smitty. He sent this.\" To: US Command From: Jake Smitty Aram \"Viper\" Bin-Asad has went to collect nuclear ordinance from the Ultranationalists. I have heard this from Al-Asad II who is currently staging a revolution. I have no further information. Al-Asad II plans to use the nuclear weapons to force the curent governemnt to submit. We need to stop them before this seriously gets out of hand. Jake Smitty \"Find this Jake Smitty and bring him to me.\" Al-Asad II said calmly. Kimad saw something in his eye, but he left without a word. He needed to call for help otherwise, it was a matter of time before Khaled Al-Asad II found out his true identity. He decided to risk it. Jake Smitty sent a second email, this time without the jammer to the US Command, calling for help. USS Nimitz 4:15 pm February 6, 2018 The deckhands could only watch in shock as the two Mi-24s landed on the helipad. They were even more shocked when three LANCERs walked out of each Hind. \"My apologies to signaling.\" Vector said. \"We were low on fuel.\" Captain Michaelson nodded, \"That's fine, but you had us worried. We get nervous when a Russian heli comes close.\" Silver Team went into the bridge and inserted the chip. A display of a space station and a rocket came on the screen. Vector zoomed in and saw a pair of missiles being loaded onto the rocket. He sighed and dismissed the team before following Michaelson. \"Excuse me captain. I have something to show you.\" Michaelson followed Vector to a holographic table where he inserted the chip and a hologram of Mir II and the rocket were displayed. \"This is the Mir II.\" Vector pointed to the space station. \"That rocket is taking off in 24 hours to deliver parts and two missiles to the station as it nears the United States.\" Michaelson scratched his head. \"So you are asking me to stop them?\" \"No. I'm asking you to approve a mission to sabotage the rocket or board the station.\" \"Mission request denied. We need to regroup and find out what the fuck is going on.\" Vector didn't back down, even Wildcard and Dare walked up next to him. \"Sir. With all due respect, if that missile gets onto the station and it may even be operational online now. It could possibly vaporize the entire western front.\" Michaelson walked over to a cabinet and poured himself some brandy. He took a small sip. \"You guys want a drink?\" Vector smiled. \"No thanks sir.\" Dare gave a no signal and Wildcard just shook his head. Michaelson took another sip and said three words, \"Mission request approved.\"Chapter 18  USS Nimitz Somewhere off the coast of South Carolina 4:36 pm February 9, 2018 Dare was enjoying a drink when he heard the radar ping and set off the alarm. He tried to hail the unknown aircraft. \"This is the USS Nimitz, identify yourself.\" He turned to Butch. \"No response. Aircraft has been identified as an Mi-26T Halo.\" \"Well, let's get it onboard and see what he wants. If he has a troop bay full of armed Spetsnaz trying to kill us, we're fucked.\" Butch finally stated. Dare grabbed his M249 and armed it. The Mi-26T was a massive helicopter, bigger than the Pave Low. It could carry up to 80 fully armed troops into battle and had two mounted RPDs on the side. Even Dare's modified M249 could barely punch through the heavy armor. He saw the Mi-26T in the distance and readied his weapon, but looked casual. It approached and landed on the helipad, dwarfing the Pave Low next to it. Wildcard was also next to the massive helicopter with an armed MGL. Vector walked to the cockpit and opened it. A pilot with a Desert Eagle climbed out. \"Drop it! NOW!\" Vector ordered. The pilot deliberately laid the high caliber pistol on the deck. \"Do you speak English?\" Vector babbled something in Russian and the pilot relaxed. \"Yes. My name is Matheus Kerensky, me and my Spetsnaz unit are defecting.\" Wildcard had his knife to Kerensky's throat. \"Easy Wildcard.\" Vector cooed. Rain was quite surprised that the Spetsnaz was not even scared of Wildcard. Wildcard, during the notable LANCER voting, was voted as the LANCER with the highest fear factor. It seemed everyone respected and some even were in awe of Marcus. \"I heard you guys killed Dyavol.\" Kerensky finally said. \"I have a plan, not sure if it will work, but it's worth a shot. As long as my unit and I are allowed to create a special forces unit in the armed forces of NATO and the United States. Me and my men were obliged to fight for the Ultranationalists, but their beliefs were not enforced.\" Damian finally spoke up, lowering his M249. \"How many men?\" \"Sixty. Not counting me.\" \"Well, you can tell us the advantage you brought us, besides your Halo. Let's get a drink. I'll ask the ship's captain to prepare bunkers for your men.\" Rain followed Vector and Kerensky into the bar. Vector poured three glasses of whiskey and handed one to Rain and to Kerensky. Kerensky sipped. \"Very nice. Not one of the cheaper brands.\" Vector laughed. \"Anyway. What are you? You don't seem to be an average Yankee.\" \"I'm a LANCER. A top secret commando trained to counter the Ultranationalist threat. So what's your story?\" Kersnsky' eyes hardened and he finally spoke \"We were the Federation, until the Ultranationalist uprising. I had used my Mi-26 in battle against Chechnya. We were scouting for rebels in the Baltic Sea when the message came. I could not comprehend what I was hearing. We had been betrayed by the Ultranationalists. At the time, I had a Ultranationalist Colonel whom I was under command of onboard our carrier. When my people refused to swallow this lie, the Ultranationalists tried to strip us of everything we had. My men looked to me like they never had before, but I knew what I had to do. The Colonel knew I was coming, so I dodged the Desert Eagle shot and kicked him off his command throne. I showed my people of what deception we had, beginning with the only piece of the evidence we had. Our war against the liars began with the Colonel's death, whom I personally executed. Since the repelling of the First US invasion, we hunted the Ultranationalists. It was a brutal fight, the Ultranationalists armed their troops with powerful, new weapons, hoping in return they would protect Russia from our wrath. When the Ultranationalist leaders went into hiding, the lack of a strong leader allowed the party to revert to their more aggressive ways, so they turned on each other for control of Russia. As a result, they were easier targets for us. Some of my fellow commanders continue the conflict to this very day. For fighting for Russia so long, we don't know if dying for our country is truly worth the risk.\" The room fell silent for a full five minutes. Finally Dare just said \"Damn.\" Vector simply said \"So you're defecting to avoid your own extinction? What about that plan that you said could turn the tide of the conflict that has engulfed the world?\" Kerensky snapped out of his dark past and told the team. \"The Ultranationalists ordered us to deliver a missile that will be going to the Mir II orbiting Earth.\" \"Damn. I never knew Russia could build a space station this big, this fast.\" \"My plan was to smuggle a few of my units as well as a couple of your LANCERs to get onto the shuttle heading for Mir II. There you will easily be able to take control of the station. You will have to release the missiles and scan for enemy locations. Once the station has been used to its full potential, you will take the shuttle back to Earth.\" \"Michaelson has already approved the mission. Okay. I know the perfect LANCERs that can go to the station. Prepare the Halo for departure, we will also need three Spetsnaz commandos to accompany them.\" Vector left the room. Two and a half hours later Jarod Jackson and Joel Jackson sat in the Pave Low toying around with their weapons. Wildcard was leaning his back against the bulkhead carving his knife. Across the deck was the Mi-26T, a small crowd of naval personnel and SEALs have gathered around to look at it. All three looked up when Vector approached, he pushed past the crowd and put one foot on the floor. \"Jackson's. They're going on another mission to Russia. I picked you to go with Rain and three Spetsnaz commandos.\" Jarod was excited. \"Finally, we get to kick some Soviet ass!\" Vector smiled and proceded to brief them about the mission.Chapter 19  Makarov Launch Facility 12 miles east of Volgograd 9:44 pm February 11, 2018 Rain clutched the bulkhead of the Halo as it zoomed along, passing over checkpoints. He was ready for nearly anything. Joel and Jarod sat adjacent to him. They looked nervous going into space. The three Spetsnaz commandos geared up, they had NATO weapons and only knew how to use the TAR-21 and AK-47. \"I hope you know how to use American weapons.\" Joel joked as he passed two M4s and an MG4. They laughed too. Rain remembered their names, Mikhail, Leonid and Alex. \"Okay. I'm landing.\" Kerensky finally said \"Take positions and get inside the facility. That shuttle will be launching in twenty six minutes.\" The Halo landed and two guards came aboard. Rain and the Jacksons hid behind seats while the Spetsnaz stood in the open. The guards checked the missile and left. The ramp opened and a forklift came in, it picked up the missile and reversed towards the shuttle. \"We're authorized to use force, but should be kept at a minimum.\" Joel reminded the group. He turned to Leonid, \"So why did the Ultranationalists ditch the old Federation troops?\" Leonid armed his MG4. \"I have no idea. We were the superior warriors. The only reason was we didn't believe in the Ultranationalist ideals. They were quite exterme if you ask me.\" They moved along the Halo and it took off vanishing in the skyline of Volgograd. \"Two and three are in position. Four, five and six move up.\" Joel ordered. The Spetsnaz moved forward. Rain couldn't help but give every ounce of respect he had to these Russian commandos. Hearing movement, he ducked out of cover to see four Spetsnaz soldiers with weapons drawn and aimed at him. He gasped and drew his knife.Chapter 20  Makarov Launch Facility 12 miles east of Volgograd 9:50 pm February 11, 2018 The two groups stood with weapons drawn. \"Don't worry. You can trust them.\" Kerensky said over the COM. \"Why should we?\" Jarod threatened. \"They're undercover. They will guide you throught the mission from the command center.\" \"Don't worry.\" One of them said, \"You can count on it!\" \"Let's move!\" Joel ordered. \"That shuttle is waiting!\" Rain ran over to crates and entered the building with the weapon ready. The team went through a walkway and saw the massive shuttle. It was larger than any aircraft that he had ever seen. Lights lit up its sleek features as it sat waiting for the countdown to launch it into the black abyss. A Ka-50 patrolling it looked like a pinhead near the top. They paused to avoid very tight security patrols. \"Now! Let's go!\" Jarod yelled. Leonid tried to stop him, but it was too late. He ran into four guards who drew their weapons and fired before Jarod could react. Jarod yelped and fell to the floor. Leonid killed all four with his MG4 and knelt beside Jarod to check on him. \"He is fine.\" Leonid said, sounding confident. \"Lucky armor saved him.\" Jarod got up. Rain did note Jarod to be quite reckless, Joel also knew, so he kept Jarod in check as he told him to take point. Jarod spotted three Russians, but they were simply hauling missiles on the shuttle. They were about to get aboard the shuttle when a Spetsnaz officer spotted them. Joel ordered engaging, but Mikhail put himself between them firing his M4. \"Go!\" He screamed. \"You got a mission to complete! I'll hold them off!\" Joel tried to reason, but Mikhail was narrow-minded and continued firing his M4 against dozens of Spetsnaz. Joel signaled to get to the storage area and the five of them ran in the warehouse. Rain slammed his hand on the control panel to shut the warehouse door. Mikhail was still firing and he had killed nearly half of the Ultranationalists until he was shot in the back by the officer's Desert Eagle. He grunted and his M4 was out of ammo. He grabbed the nearest Spetsnaz and began killing them with his bare hands and knife. Finally he had no energy left, his wound was bleeding out and he mustered all the strength he could. The officer put a boot to his helmet and kicked his head. \"So much for Federation might. That's quite ironic.\" Mikhail turned over to reveal two grenades pins pulled on his vest as well as plastic explosives, the Russians looked in horror as he smiled, die hard style. \"Last one to hell is a rotten egg!\" The squad heard a massive explosion in the distance. All fell silent for a minute. \"No! We shouldn't have left him.\" Alex whispered. Joel couldn't confront the loss correctly. They wern't even on the shuttle and they already lost one man. \"We have to keep moving. Once life is not worth millions.\" he finally replied. Alex nodded and they crept in the storage room. Rain held up a fist, they heard voices and he peered around the box. Two Spetsnaz stood in front of the storage containers loading them onto a conveyor belt. \"No way we're getting on the Shuttle that way.\" Leonid said while looking out the window. Rain looked out too, there was nearly three dozen guards with AK-47s and RPD machine guns. Even a BMP was positioned at the back. Even with his armor, he couldn't tolerate that much firepower without getting wounded or most likely killed. \"I have an idea.\" Jarod whispered. \"But we'll have to take them out.\" He nodded to the two in front of the conveyor. The storage room had lights on and gave it nearly a futuristic look. A large 01 was posted digital style on the wall and the lights lit the floor. Rain crept up and jabbed his knife in the back of one's neck. The other guard reached for his sidearm, but Rain's improved reflexes let him pull the knife and toss it at the second Spetsnaz. The knife sailed through the air until it impacted bladefirst into the man's mouth and down his throat. Rain walked over and pulled the knife out, which was dripping with blood. Leonid handed Rain a cloth, which he wiped the stain off of. They heard voices and two Spetsnaz walked in, oblivious of the bodies that Rain stashed in one of the containers. They started activating the conveyor. Rain and his squad watched from inside two containers. The line entered the shuttle and they smiled when they were stowed away in the cargo hold. \"Your plan, bro, was genius.\" Joel complimented as he high fived his brother. Rain, inside the other capsule watched the two spetsnaz in his pod pull over vaccum helmets. A booming voice came online in russian. Rain turned his translator to English. \"System ready, counting down, T-minus five, four, three, two ONE! We have liftoff!\" A roar filled the shuttle as the rockets activated. Rain felt a jolt and a steady ascent. It was nearly fifteen minutes before Rain felt himself floating. He smiled and performed a flip in midair. Everyone else was having as much fun as him. None have been into space. Joel opened his container. Nobody was in the cargo hold, he drifted and nearly crashed into a guard. He gripped a handle and reached for his knife. It was as if it were underwater, things seemed slowed and gravity was absent. He couldn't have delivered a fatal blow with a knife without being alerted. So he took his M4 can strangled the man. He struggled, but still managed to set off an alarm. \"Shit.\" was Alex's comment. Another soldier pointed them out, before Jarod neutralized him. With his final moments, the officer jabbed his knife into a button. There was a loud roar as the large cargo door opened, debris, weapons, missiles and containers flew out. Rain gripped the bar and saw Jarod, Leonid and Alex fly out. Joel was next to him clutching a pole, hanging for his life. \"Shit!\" Joel yelled, \"Rain, look out!\" Rain turned to see a container fly towards him, it slammed into him, flaring pain over his entire body. He cringed and saw Joel lose his grip. His fingers slipped on the slippery bar and was flung out into space.Chapter 21  Russian Shuttle Yeltsin Approaching Mir II 10:59 pm February 11, 2018 Rain struggled in the void. The shuttle was getting smaller by the second and containers were flying out. His strength was completely useless against the laws of physics. He tried to get his grappling hook, but he was too far. Some crates headed for him and he outstreched and grabbed the container. He peered inside, there were a pair of thruster packs. He grabbed one and pushed the other one to Jarod who also was struggling in space. \"Quick!\" Joel said over the speakers, \"We need to get back before the door closes!\" Rain activated his pack and he bagan drifting closer to the aircraft. He marveled at the blue globe below, it was as if he never saw Earth before. He shook off his thoughts and continued thrusting towards the shuttle. Joel, Leonid and Alex were onboard when he and Jarod touched down. Leonid sealed the cargo bay and Rain entered the bridge. Two armed pilots stood with USPs drawn. Rain reacted first, he shot the first one and then jumped to the second one, jammed his handgun in the pilot's eye and pulled the trigger. \"Awesome.\" Alex said settling down in the pilot's seat. \"Now who knows how to fly a space bucket?\"Chapter 22  Aboard Russian Shuttle Yeltsin Approaching Mir II 11:23 pm February 11, 2018 Alex ignited the engines and Rain sat in the co-pilot seat. The shuttle accelerated toward the Mir II, Rain saw another shuttle docked and a third one returning to earth. The Mir II was larger than any other flying thing anyone had ever seen. It had missile silos and nuclear pods filled with armed warheads ready for launch at any minute from the Russian Command. Lights were flashing on every section of the mammoth object. Alex steered the shuttle into one of the bays where a holographic message was displayed. \"Welcome to Mir II\" \"Shuttle Yeltsin. You are about to enter the Mir II station. Please enter your passcode and you may proceed.\" \"Anybody know the code?\" Jarod asked Everyone shook their head. A transmission was heard again. \"If you do not transmit the passcode, you will be treated as an enemy vessel and action will be taken.\" the shuttle docked and a walkway extended to the door. Jarod stacked up on one side and Rain took the other. Leonid stood in the middle, MG4 ready. Jarod tapped the control and the door slid open, revealing a sleek hall lit with lights that resembled an alien starship Rain remembered when he went to the movies years ago. Jarod drifted through, calling clear for every room. \"So where did they go if we didn't transmit the code?\" Rain drifted through the hallway, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a lone Russian with a Riot shield with even more elaborte markings than an officer. He took notice and began firing a Desert Eagle. \"Field Marshall!\" Alex said out loud and opened fire. The Marshall raised his shield and the bullets harmlessly deflected off the barrier. Rain armed a Semtex and tossed it towards the general. The grenade sailed to the top and detonated a gas pipe, incenerating the Field Marshall, alarms screamed and the pipe was sealed. \"I never knew Russians had this technology, they might even be ahead of the Japanese.\" Joel said, still marveling at the interior. \"Probably a secret.\" Leonid added drifting to a door to press the button. The door hissed and the curcular light spun three times before hissing open. A hlogram showed the massive station. Rain saw barracks for an entire platoon, the missile launch facility and a command center. Joel finally ordered, \"Let's split up. Alex, Joel and I will head for the command center and control it. Rain, take Leonid to the launching area and see what you can do to shut the nukes down. Move out!\"Chapter 23  Al-Asad II's hideout Somewhere in Makkah, Saudi Arabia 1:26 pm February 12, 2018 Jake Smitty had successfully sent the beacon, now he could only hope that Al-Asad II and the Viper would not find out. He heard a knock on the door and opened it. An Opfor member stood there armed with an AK-74U pointed at his chest. The Opfor armed the weapon and was about to fire when a figure grabbed him and pulled a knife to his throat. The terrorist gagged, falling to the floor dead. A figure stood behind him holding a knife. Smitty cocked his pistol, \"Relax.\" the figure said. \"I'm here to get you out.\" \"Who are you?\" \"I'm LANCER known as Spartan. If you don't mind, we should get out before they find out their rabbit is missing.\" They hurried down the hall where Smitty saw a large hole blown open with sunlight filtering through the thick dust. Spartan jumped up through the hole and helped Smitty up while handing him an M1911. Three more LANCERs awaited them at the top. \"Our ride got shot down.\" Prowler reported, he clutched his M240. \"What are we gonna do now?\" \"Our mission was to get him out.\" the leader known as Revenant said, stepping out of the shade to reveal his face before he put his mask on. \"And that's what we're going to do.\" Revenant led the group to the helicopter pad. \"Look. We're going to steal that ride. Longsword? You're with me!\" Longsword objected. \"But sir! I don't remember how to fly one. It was years ago I did a simulation.\" \"Well, let's see what you've remembered.\" the two crept up to the ledge where a Hip helicopter was hovering next to a second Hip. The flying helicopter dropped a BMP along with some troops before flying off. Revenant laid down on the sand and began burying himself. Longsword helped him, soon enough, the Opfor troops along with the BMP were approaching the area where Revenant hid. Spartan planted an anti-armor mine on the road. \"Wait for my signal.\" Revenant said, he was quite zealous at whatever he did. \"Go!\" Revenant ordered. Longsword peered out with his FAMAS and fired four rounds. Four bodies hit the floor, the remaining Opfor charged, passing over Revenant's hiding spot. Prowler opened up with his M240, dropping Opfor in a massacre. The BMP passed over Revenant who burst up from the ground and grabbed the nearest opfor member to impale with his knife. The BMP spotted Spartan who detonated the mine and the BMP exploded. Soon enough, all the Opfor were killed and the BMP was burning. Longsword fell into the cockpit and flipped a pair of switches, the Hip's engines turned on and the helicopter lifted off the ground slightly. Smitty and the remaining LANCERs boarded the helicopter. Longsword pushed a joystick, the helicopter ascended and flew over the market along with several other buildings. Revenant saw Smitty, who was hit in the leg. He got out a trauma kit and expertly treated the wound. Smitty took a recording device and handed it to Revenant, who was applying a bandage to the hole. He took the chip and inserted it onto his TACPAD. It flashed once and began to play in his helmet. Revenant stood still for nearly ten minutes until he turned to Longsword. \"Keep going to the bay. We're linking up with the navy and getting this intel back to Vector.\" \"You got it boss.\" Longsword replied and steered the Hip around a large sand dune. \"You got open signal.\" Prowler said, leaning on the minigun. \"Now would be a good time to send the intel to Silver.\" Revenant nodded and sent the message to Silver.Chapter 24  Near the Georgia-Florida Border 1:30 pm February 12, 2018 Alexys \"Cherry\" Kinney leaned against her Apache, she marveled at the sunlight. It was quite warm, even for February. She turned to see Vector and the rest of the team, minus Rain. \"Where's Rain?\" she asked. Vector stopped, \"He's onboard a Russian space station stopping the facility from launching missiles.\" \"Hope he's okay.\" \"He's a LANCER.\" Vector smiled and playfully slapped her shoulder. He suddenly got on his TACCOM and nodded. \"Pirates. Cherry, get to the Longbow. Scout them out.\" \"Rodger that.\" Kinney replied, already putting her helmet on. She took off, circling the beach and linked the COM to Vector. \"Yep. Sure enough. Cuban pirates. Shining them.\" She turned on a large light. \"Drop those weapons or I will open fire!\" she threatened through the speakers. The boats continued their course, leaving behind trails of wake. Kinney revved up the cannon and fired three warning shots. They splashed near the boats, the pirates did not waver and she fired rockets, obliterating one of the boats. Vector ran to the beach where he fired his ACR. Dare joined him, spraying thunderous rounds at the rogue ships. \"Damn. The fuckers won't give up!\" Butch shouted over the gunfire. The pirates were finally killed off, Vector inspected an intact boat as well as the bodies torn apart by vicious rounds. Wildcard grabbed the intact boat and hauled it to shore. It was so damaged, when he heaved it and it broke apart. Vector climbed in the rubble and began searching. \"Nothing.\" he said at last, \"Those pirates were probably coming for food.\" Kinney landed her helicopter and hopped out. She inspected the wreckage like the others. \"Anyway.\" Vector continued, shorting out Butch's sentence. \"Spy Jake Smitty has a possible location on Doctor Lancer. Silver, we're getting her out. I've got a Black Hawk en route. Meanwhile, you guys gear up. It may be a while before we can reach US territory. On the good side, Japan and South Korea have repelled North Korea's aggression. They have signed a treaty and are working to rebuild.\" \"At least North Commies are out of this shit.\" Alpha added. A BlackHawk landed and the team climbed on. \"Good luck Kinney.\" Vector said to her while taking off. Kinney saluted in return. \"So where was the Doc last seen?\" Dare asked, leaning on the table. Vector replied \"Not sure. Locals reported her somewhere in Moscow. Looks like we get to take the fight to them after all.\" Wildcard and Dare clanked fists and cocked their weapons.Chapter 25  Moscow, Russia 12:15 pm February 14, 2018 \"Aw. Fuck.\" Butch's only words were. \"How come we didn't see this.\" Silver was surrounded by Russian officers in a gulag and Field Marshalls. Thankfully, they couldn't remove their armor. One stepped forward, \"Thanks to this beacon, you were lured like a moth to a flame. Without your support, the US has collapsed. Mother Russia has new territory!\" Wildcard struggled in his cell, he punched the cell door hoping to break it, instead his arm flared into pain and he was breathing heavily rubbing his fist. \"Don't waste your energy. American.\" the Marshall said. \"There's nothing you can do for your country. Since its collapse, your people have divided into clans and are fighting each other for control. It won't matter in the future though.\" \"What do you mean.\" Alpha asked, obviously irritated The Marshall pulled out his handgun and pointed it at Alpha. He braced for it. In Wildcard and Dare's cell, Dare saw Wildcard remove his last-resort combat knife. Dare could tell Wildcard always had an idea to get out. The officer turned to see Wildcard crouched behind bars with a throwing knife. He quickly pressed a button, sealing the bars, the only holes were large enough to stick a fist through. \"Face it.\" Butch said. \"We're fucked.\" Onboard Mir II 3:41 pm February 13, 2018 \"Just got word.\" Jarod said, listening to his TACCOM. \"The United States has fallen. Now the American People are fighting each other and the Russians are picking them off.\" \"Hope the family isn't caught in this.\" Joel said, stacking up beside the door. \"Joel, its me, Leonid.\" Joel sighed with relief, Leonid and Rain hadn't checked in for a day. Damn, station was too big. \"Go ahead.\" \"We got a locked door and gunfire seems to be useless. We considered explosives, but that encounter with the Marshall still haunts us and we don't want to risk it again. Have you gotten into the control room?\" Joel sighed. \"We're working on it. Out.\" Suddenly a speaker boomed through the station. \"Arming ballistic missile 1. Firing in three, two one!\" Leonid and Rain rushed to the window, they saw an ICBM accelerate past them. An explosion rocked the station. \"Aw fuck!\" Leonid cried out. \"They took out the shuttle, now we have no way back!\" See the Sequel NATO's Downfall and the prequel Abducted! ==Credits Victims == Ebithio as Green Price25 as Jim Smith My Wunderwaffle iz missin as Vector My Wunderwaffle iz missin as Major General Randolph My Wunderwaffle iz missin as Natalie Lancer Doctor Richtofee as Kinkallen Pillsbury810 as Joel and Jarod Jackson Floody16 as Scott Petterson Wontbackdown as Weasel Bumblebeeprime09 as Jake Smitty SSDGFCTCT9 as Dyavol Fawkes 2.0 as Al-Asad II Wtf man as Butch Alex Martin Rider as Shadow and Phoenix My Wunderwaffle iz missin as Wildcard Gamemasta424 as Dare SeaCrane 1 as Falcon Cpt.

Armed with an extremely-accurate rifle, the Sniper can kill a single enemy infantryman with each shot he makes. He has the ability to camouflage himself (becoming invisible to enemy units) which allows him to scout deep into enemy territory and look for exposed targets.\n Inexperienced players tend to make the mistake of assuming that a Sniper is just an excellent anti-infantry hunting unit. Experienced players, on the other hand, will quickly realize that the Sniper is in fact not an actual combat unit, but rather a scout - meant to remain undetected for as long as possible, and only attacking when the odds are absolutely in his favour.Panzer Elite  The Panzer Elite, also known as Kampfgruppe Lehr in the single-player campaign, is one of two factions featured in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. One of the members of the Axis, it is essentially a counterpart to the Wehrmacht, and fights alongside it in defending Nazi-Occupied Europe from the Allied invasion. The Panzer Elite is a highly mobile force that relies on constant offensive force with very little emphasis on defense. They can field powerful anti-tank units, and are good at denying battlefield assets to the enemy. The Panzer Elite is based mainly on the Panzer Lehr Division.Overview  Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts introduced a new Axis faction known as the Panzer Elite. Together with the Wehrmacht, they strive to repel the Allied invasion of France to protect Nazi-Occupied Europe from being overrun. The Panzer Elite army is a representation of a generic Panzergrenadier (Mechanized Infantry) division, such as were fielded by both the German army (the Wehrmacht) and the notorious Waffen SS. It is primarily inspired by the mish-mash of German units that opposed Operation Market Garden, including the 2nd SS Panzer Corps and the Luftwaffe's Fallschirmj\u00e4ger divisions. The Panzer Elite force consists primarily of fast-moving light and medium vehicles, which provide it with a mobile defense and offense. With virtually no defensive measures, the Panzer Elite are expected to constantly be on the offensive, keeping their enemies off-balance and manipulating battlefield assets to their advantage (or to the enemy's detriment). Their limited infantry is initially very poor, but can be upgraded to become one of the best infantry forces in the game - and is expected to work closely with the Panzer Elite vehicle fleet. Panzer Elite units gain Veterancy through combat action, and have the option to invest this in either Defensive bonuses (to increase speed and survivability) or Offensive bonuses (to increase firing rate and accuracy). This allows each unit to specialize in the tasks it is most needed to perform, giving additional flexibility to an already flexible fighting force. With their varied Command Tree abilities, the Panzer Elite can rely on support from the Luftwaffe (the German air-arm), concentrate on improving their own spectacular anti-vehicle capabilities, or improve their subversion of battlefield assets. They can potentially field some of the most powerful units in the entire game, or boost their defensive capabilities to match those of other factions. In the Panzer Elite single-player campaign, the \"Kampfgruppe Lehr\" division (thus named after its inspiration, the Kampfgruppe and Panzer Lehr divisions of the Wehrmacht) struggles to prevent British forces from attaining control of a series of bridges in Holland during Operation Market Garden. A few Panzer Elite units appear as part of the various SS Panzer Divisions featured as the opponents in the British Liberation of Caen campaign.Basic Force Composition  The Panzer Elite army is comprised primarily of light, fast vehicles. The majority of these vehicles punch well above their weight, capable of doing grievous harm to enemy units. However, most of these units are lightly-armored as well, and are usually very vulnerable to enemy fire. As a result, the Panzer Elite rely on fast attacks meant to rapidly cripple the enemy, and are expected to keep going despite the heavy losses incurred in the process. Mobility and cunning are their most important assets. In addition, the Panzer Elite rely on small infantry teams known as Panzer Grenadiers, which are highly versatile and well-trained though small in numbers, to perform virtually all infantry-related duties on the battlefield. They are often supported by unarmed vehicles specializing in logistics, and together these groups can carry out all sorts of unconventional warfare. The Panzer Elite force is almost entirely devoid of defensive capabilities, instead relying on mobile patrol units to react to enemy offensives.Infantry  The Panzer Elite infantry is entirely made up of a single type of unit: the Panzer Grenadiers. These are small 3-man mechanized infantry teams, which are initially rather weak and vulnerable. With time and investment however, Panzer Grenadiers can become highly effective and very dangerous, gaining a wide variety of combat abilities as well as an increase to squad sizes. Panzer Grenadiers are responsible for field repairs as well as the construction of the various Base Structures. Expected to keep up with other motorized units, they often ride in Infantry Halftracks. It is possible to recruit three different varieties of Panzer Grenadiers: The difference between these units is minimal. The two \"Heavy Infantry\" variants are simply a different way to get an upgraded Panzer Grenadier squad without paying Munitions for the appropriate upgrade or waiting for it to be installed. These three units are otherwise identical in terms of combat properties, they all benefit from the same Global Upgrades and can all use the same combat abilities. Panzer Grenadiers are expected to operate closely with the tanks and vehicles fielded by this faction. They can also be formed into large infantry groups, called \"Panzer Grenadier Platoons\", to enable them to take on larger enemy infantry units. A large group of these is more flexible and more dangerous than an enemy unit of the same size.Light Vehicles  The Panzer Elite field the largest variety of Light Vehicles available to any faction. Many of these vehicles are unarmed, expected to support other units by bestowing various bonuses to them. Others are meant to operate inside enemy territory, subverting enemy resources. Still, many of these light vehicles can punch well above their weight, and are cheap enough to cover the high attrition rate they usually incur due to their light armor. Speed is always of the essence, as many of these units are used as response forces to fend off enemy attacks. On the offensive, these vehicles can take the battle to the enemy in the early stages of the game, or provide support for heavier vehicles later on. Infantry rely on Infantry Halftracks and Munitions Halftracks as part of their most basic tactics.Medium Vehicles  The Panzer Elite field a single medium vehicle, used as an Assault Gun to support both attack and defense: The Marder III is often used to provide firepower from beyond engagement range, though it can also flank and attack enemy tanks from the rear. The vehicle can trade its mobility for increased firing rate and range, allowing it to essentially become an Active Defense Emplacement - though a vulnerable one.Heavy Vehicles  The basic Panzer Elite repertoire includes three heavy vehicles of increasing strength. Two of these vehicles are not actually tanks per-se, though the third is a straightfoward heavy tank unit. Panzer Elite tanks are not particularly well-rounded, lacking a medium-armored tank destroyer component (though one Command Tree later adds this option with the Hetzer). They must be supported by the lighter vehicles and infantry, and are meant primarily to draw enemy fire away from their support units.Defensive Structures  The Panzer Elite have virtually no permanent defensive structures. Their units can only construct the following defenses: The limited variety of defenses means that the Panzer Elite must rely on mobile units to patrol friendly territory and fend off light enemy infiltration attempts. When the enemy makes a larger assault, the entire Panzer Elite force is expected to converge upon it and destroy it.Veterancy  All Panzer Elite units can attain up to three levels of Veterancy. They do this primarily by killing enemy units to gain experience. When a Panzer Elite unit kills an enemy unit, it gains 100% of that unit's experience value. Additionally, it will pass 50% of that same value to all Panzer Elite units within 35 meters of its position. This \"Shared Veterancy\" model allows Panzer Elite forces to rapidly increase their Veterancy level when attacking in large groups. It also provides a way for the (many) unarmed vehicles to gain veterancy, simply by being close to the combat zone. With each Veterancy level a unit attains, it is capable of acquiring one of two different sets of bonuses: a Defensive Bonus or an Offensive Bonus. The choice is normally up to the player, though some (unarmed) units will pick the Defensive Bonus set by default. The benefits from each set depend primarily on the unit's type - whether Infantry or Vehicle. For example, the \"Infantry Defensive Bonus\" gives resistance to Suppression, while the \"Vehicle Defensive Bonus\" gives an increase to maximum speed. Additionally, the level at which a bonus was selected is also important. In other words, selecting a bonus set at Veterancy Level 1 does not necessarily give the same benefits as selecting the same bonus at Veterancy level 2. For example, the \"Level 1 Vehicle Defensive Bonus\" is significantly more beneficial than the \"Level 2 Vehicle Defensive Bonus\", affecting the unit's stats more dramatically. A single unit can mix-and-match sets as required. For example, a unit can receive the Defensive set at level 1, then the Offensive set at level 2, then another Defensive set at level 3. This allows specifically tailoring a unit to suit the current needs. Some units gain additional bonuses as they reach certain Veterancy levels, regardless of which bonus set was selected. For example, a Panzer IV Infantry Support Tank is fitted with Armor Skirts when it reaches Veterancy level 3, even before the player selects a bonus set. Also, note that some units gain no benefit from specific bonuses. For example, Active Defenses can gain veterancy, but since they have no movement ability they do not benefit from the Defensive Bonus Set's Maximum Speed increase.Style and Strategy  Of all the factions in Company of Heroes, the Panzer Elite have the strongest, most mobile offensive force. In addition their units are defensively weak but quite cheap, and most of them are easy to replace when necessary. As a result, the Panzer Elite play a game based almost entirely on a constant offensive meant to confuse and distract the enemy, culminating with a final armored punch designed to bring the enemy to his knees. Outlining the Panzer Elite strategy is very difficult, because of the many different possibilities available to them in terms of tech tree progression and unit availability. At each point in the battle, the Panzer Elite's forces may be more suited to performing one tactic than another. They can never rest easy knowing their territory is secure, and so they must constantly look for the correct tactic with which to prevent their enemies from seizing more land. The Panzer Elite can sometimes win the battle incredibly early. If they cannot, the battle can become drawn-out, until the point where they have completely exhausted all Global Upgrades and Command Upgrades - at which point they can deliver a sudden decisive strike to end the battle entirely.Land Grab  At the start of the game, the Panzer Elite have one significant advantage: they have a Kettenkrad, and the ability to produce more. These unarmed vehicles can quickly acquire a large amount of land, giving the Panzer Elite economy a head start. Naturally, the Panzer Elite commander will have to eventually begin deploying Panzer Grenadiers to begin base structure construction. If an Infantry Halftrack is produced, it can help those infantry assist the land grab operation - though Panzer Grenadiers take land much slower than other units. Denying sectors to the enemy is very important. It is in fact so important early on, that it may be more important than acquiring useful territory. For example, it's possible to drive one's Kettenkrads quickly towards the enemy base, and capture territory the enemy may want to acquire soon - like high resource sectors or sector that would link many territories back to home base. By capturing these sectors early, the Panzer Elite delay the enemy's capture of these sectors, denying them the crucial resources to build an early force. Meanwhile, the Panzer Elite can easily subsist on the few resources they are gathering to build up their small but useful early-game vehicles. If you do capture these forward sectors, naturally they won't be linked to your own base and thus don't produce resources for you. However, that is not the point: you are simply delaying the enemy's resource-gathering, gaining an advantage thanks to the cheap units you can produce early on. Eventually, you'll be unable to protect these forward sectors, but by this time you'll probably already hold more territory than your enemy, and will be producing more resources as a result.Early Game Rush  Some early-game Panzer Elite units can be exceptionally useful at chasing down and destroying early-game enemy units. Cheap Panzer Elite vehicles can make forays into enemy territory, patrol neutral sectors that have yet to be captured, and assault any enemy units they encounter. Vehicles like the Scout Car and Infantry Halftrack are useful for this. They can engage and destroy enemy infantry attempting to make land-grabs, and might even stand up to enemy light vehicles. The enemy has little that's useful against such vehicles: infantry firearms are unlikely to help; and the only real weapon dangerous to these vehicles are Heavy Machine Guns, which can be flanked quickly and destroyed. Remember that Scout Cars can further augment your own resource gathering whenever they have nothing better to do - place them in the highest production sectors available to get the largest bonus. As for Infantry Halftracks, keep these loaded with MP44-armed Panzer Grenadiers or Assault Grenadier Heavy Infantry to get a man-hunting team that can repair and replenish itself! If you can manage to produce enough of these vehicles early on, you may be able to deny the enemy any significant territory grabs, leaving the enemy with few resources - too few to oppose the Panzer Elite as more powerful vehicles become available. To maximize the efficiency of this tactic, try fielding a Light Armored Car as early as possible. This vehicle can dominate the battlefield easily until enemy medium vehicles appear. If you do a good-enough job, once heavier vehicles or large numbers of Panzer Grenadiers are constructed, the enemy will have no means with which to oppose you: netting a fast and decisive victory.Mobile Defense  Once battle lines have stabilized, the enemy will begin making forays into Panzer Elite territory in attempts to grab it. Since the Panzer Elite have no Active Defenses, they must rely on mobile defensive forces to repel the enemy. Fortunately, this should be rather simple, given that most Panzer Elite units are light, fast, and heavy-hitting vehicles. A handful should be delegated simply to the task of hunting down enemy infantry whenever they appear in your sectors, and eliminate them before they can capture any land. Again, Scout Cars and loaded Infantry Halftracks provide the best early defensive units. They are both fast and deadly, and are easy to repair. Later on, Light Armored Cars and Light AT Halftracks may be necessary for tackling larger threats, like enemy light/medium vehicles. When enemy tanks begin to appear, the only thing that thwart them is a converging defense. Draw the enemy units into your territory, and attack them from all directions simultaneously using every asset you have. Normally, Panzer Elite units of similar numbers to an opposing enemy force will come out victorious from such battles, and are much easier to replace (especially with a Bergetiger Repair and Recovery Vehicle to restore destroyed vehicles practically for free). If you can trap a large enemy force and demolish it entirely with relatively few losses, a window of opportunity opens up for an assault on the enemy's own assets - using whatever units are remaining and/or can be replaced within a short time-frame. The enemy will usually take much more time to recover from his losses, and this advantage must be capitalized upon quickly.Small-Scale Incursions  In order to survive, the Panzer Elites must never wait for the enemy to come to them. Instead, instigate as many attacks on the enemy as you can. You can make hit-and-run attacks using a few units to take out vulnerable positions, drawing enemy units to you and retreating when they arrive to make their defense. Then quickly attack elsewhere. Continuously striking one flank and then the other will eventually persuade your enemy to divide his forces to protect both areas at the same time. This is when you must deliver a more decisive punch at either of these locations, to catch and destroy half the enemy force and then the other half. Divide and conquer. Even if you have no clear strategy visible, still continue to make these harassing attacks against your enemy. He must never be allowed to build up his strength, nor to feel secure behind his lines. Use guile, camouflage and deception to grab enemy territory - even if you don't actually have the means to keep it. Keep your enemy guessing about your next move.Financial Warfare  The Panzer Elite have the ability to wage Financial Warfare using their Funkwagen Vampire Halftracks. This may be very tricky (unless using a later patch, where these halftracks have camouflage abilities), but can easily be worth it. A single Funkwagen can not only siphon resources out of the enemy's most valuable sectors - it also hurts production throughout supply lines. You can cost the enemy upwards of two dozen lost Munitions or Fuel points per minute - a very large sum indeed - just by placing the Funkwagen in the right position. Remember that any reduction in the enemy's resources (and increase in yours) is a massive advantage to you, given the low cost of your units and the numerous Munitions-based abilities your units possess. An enemy that cannot adequately replace losses incurred from Panzer Elite hit-and-run attacks will surely fall once the Panzer Elite can consolidate a more powerful armored punch.Armored Punch  If the Panzer Elite cannot win the game early using Light Vehicle Rushes, they will usually need to win by reaching the apex of their research - fielding their heaviest units, the Marder III Tank Hunter, Panzer IV Infantry Support Tank, Bergetiger Repair and Recovery Vehicle, and optionally the Panther tank battlegroup. When consolidated into a single group, this armored force can be utterly devastating - especially when accompanied by lighter vehicles that can protect the flanks and/or flank the enemy themselves. The use of this armored force differs depending on the type of enemy you are fighting: Against the Americans, who rarely have very strong defensive positions, the idea is to draw the bulk of the enemy forces into a firefight, and then envelop and destroy them. Once they're dead, they will be extremely difficult to replace, buying time for the Panzer Elite armor to run over their base and reduce it to rubble. Against the British, all that needs to be done is to punch through the enemy's defensive line at its weakest point, rushing the armored force past the gap and into enemy territory. Once on the other side, the relatively-weaker British mobile units will move to intercept and can be easily destroyed, leaving British Command Trucks to fend for themselves. The key is momentum. Keep pushing through the enemy, deploy more and more units as they get destroyed, and use Bergetiger Repair and Recovery Vehicles to restore \"dead\" vehicles back to operational status. If the onslaught does not end with total victory, the Panzer Elite will usually still be in a position to rebuild their forces faster than the enemy anyway.Command Doctrines  Like all other factions, the Panzer Elite have three available Command Doctrines, referred to as \"Tactics\". Each \"Tactic\" is designed to augment the Panzer Elite force's capacities in one way or another. The three Panzer Elite Tactics are very different from each other, and have a significant impact on how this faction plays its game - arguably more than any other faction's Command Trees. This is in no small part due to the fact that as soon as a Command Tree has been selected, all of the Panzer Elite Kettenkrad units will immediately receive a new ability corresponding to the selected tree. Due to being cheap, fast vehicles, the extra Kettenkrad ability can change the face of their strategy from one end to the other.Scorched Earth Tactics  The Scorched Earth Tactics tree is centered around denial of assets. It can be summed up with the words, \"if I can't have it, neither can you\". It employs age-old strategies of destruction of one's own assets to ensure that the enemy cannot use them if he tries to capture them. Initially, Kettenkrads and Panzer Grenadiers will receive the ability to plant rigged incendiary devices in buildings and then in Strategic Points. These devices are triggered only by enemy units attempting to interact with the trapped asset, and can easily kill infantry. It also becomes possible to construct Road Blocks, to prevent the free movement of enemy vehicles and funnel them into kill zones. This gives some defensive protection against enemy incursions into Panzer Elite territory. Panzer Grenadiers will also be able to disable Strategic Points entirely, requiring players to spend time restoring said points to working status if they wish to gain resources. This enhances the Panzer Elite Financial Warfare capabilities, allowing them to prevent the enemy from acquiring the resources required to gain an advantage, while the Panzer Elite still benefit from their cheap units. Finally, this Command Tree enables two types of artillery: one is an off-map defensive bombardment that can automatically protect an entire sector. The other is the Hummel Self Propelled Artillery, which is one of the most powerful artillery units in the entire game, and can help the Panzer Elite break through enemy defenses and/or destroy enemy units attempting to take Panzer Elite assets.Luftwaffe Tactics  The Luftwaffe, Germany's Air-Force, can give its assistance to the Panzer Elite through both ground-based Anti-Aircraft assets as well as airborne support of various kinds. The Luftwaffe Tactics Command Tree gives the Panzer Elite something they don't otherwise have: straightforward defensive capabilities through Defensive Structures. This starts with Luftwaffe Ground Forces who can construct obstacles as well as the Flakvierling 38 20mm AA gun - a powerful substitute to Machine Gun nests which can also handle enemy vehicles quite well. The Wirbelwind Flakpanzer with its quad 20mm cannon grants the same type of protection, except it is a mobile unit and thus much more useful in both defense and offense. Finally, this tree will allow the Panzer Elite to construct a powerful defensive/offensive stationary gun, the 88mm Flak 36 AT/AA cannon, which has an incredibly long range and is very powerful against enemy armor. Fallschirmj\u00e4ger squads also become available thanks to this Command Tree, and like British Commandos can be used to make sudden surprise attacks against the enemy, keeping him off-balance. These units can also make use of their camouflage abilities to remain hidden inside enemy territory to perform ambushes or assist offensive operations. The Luftwaffe Command Tree also grants two airborne assets to be used: the deployment of Butterfly Bombs to block infantry access routes into your territory, and the use of Henschel Hs 129 air patrols that can wipe out entire tank convoys. Finally, this Command Tree allows all Kettenkrads to camouflage themselves, allowing them to act as scouts and/or infiltrate enemy territory to grab sectors in grab-and-run attacks. The use of camouflaged scouts opens up all sorts of interesting strategies for this faction.Tank Destroyer Tactics  The Tank Destroyer Tactics Command Tree, unlike the other two, is meant to capitalize on the Panzer Elite's greatest strength: offensive firepower. It augments the Panzer Elite's strongest units, and adds two even stronger units to make a powerful assault force. It generally aims to win the game during the later stages of the battle, and usually requires the Panzer Elite company to survive longer - with greater benefits in the later game. Initially, this Command Tree is more defensive than offensive. It allows planting Teller Mines to block enemy vehicle movement, and gives Panzer Grenadiers the ability to detect enemy vehicle movement far beyond their own sight-range. This allows them to effectively defend against enemy vehicles when these begin to appear. The Tank Destroyer Tactics company then gains access to the Hetzer tank, which rounds out the Panzer Elite's tank force by adding a medium tank destroyer component that's more survivable than the Marder III Tank Hunter. Hetzers can also be used as ambush units, especially for flanking enemy forces attempting to enter Panzer Elite territory. All tank destroyer vehicles in the Panzer Elite force will also benefit from the introduction of APCR Rounds, which increase their penetration against enemy armor. In the late game, this Command Tree unlocks two extremely powerful abilities. It doubles the anti-tank strength of dedicated Anti-Tank Panzer Grenadier squads, adding more Panzerschreck rockets and Anti-Tank Grenades to these units. The Tank Destroyer Tactics' final benefit is the introduction of the singular Jagdpanther heavy tank, an almost unstoppable force used as the center of the most powerful armored assault forces in the game. Finally, this Command Tree enables Kettenkrads to perform repairs. This gives the Panzer Elite a mobile repair unit that can quickly respond whenever units are damaged, escort assault forces to repair them during battles, and generally keep a strong and mobile vehicle fleet in continuous operation.Playing Against the Panzer Elite  A novice Panzer Elite player is easy to beat: they don't usually make it to the late game because they can't mount any serious defenses to protect their territory. However, in the hands of a competent opponent, the Panzer Elite tends to be one of the most frustrating factions to play against. Since the Panzer Elite rely on cunning and underhanded tactics, your best counter-strategy would be to rely on heavy-handedness and \"dense\" tactics. In other words, repay small attacks with massive attacks, build a powerful defensive line to stop anything coming near your territory, and never let your units wander around alone. The idea is to simply prevent the Panzer Elite from having any sort of easy access to your territory. This puts a stop to resource raids, hasty land grabs, or any sort of tactics that does not involve direct combat with your units. For this your defenses have to be air-tight, and at least good enough to detect enemy units attempting to enter your territory, if not destroy them. The last thing you need is a Funkwagen Vampire Halftrack stealing your resources. If you're playing the Americans, even Machine Gun Emplacements will do for a while - but must be backed up by constant patrols. Attacks on enemy territory must be performed in force, and never in limited areas. The Panzer Elite will respond to a large attack by enveloping the enemy with everything they have and destroying him, so you must never let that happen. Make wide-area attacks starting in one position to draw the Panzer Elite units in, and then encircle them yourself. Never attempt to drive your force deep into enemy territory - there could be many traps waiting for you along the way. Always make small land grabs, and then alter your defenses to protect the new territory. Finally, a note about speed: The Panzer Elite army tends to be strongest at the start and end of the battle, and weakest in the middle. Therefore, you must be prepared to kill the fast and powerful Panzer Elite vehicles early on, and then try to beat your enemy as quickly as possible. Lingering will simply allow the Panzer Elite to call in their heaviest weapons, and if that happens you may have already lost the battle.Economic Strategy  The Panzer Elite need much fewer resources than you do to operate, and they are very good at denying you access to resources as well. However, do not be tempted to expand too quickly: if you can't adequately protect all the land you have, it will quickly be stolen away or subverted. Also, fast expansion opens you up to all sorts of traps laid by the enemy in neutral territory and/or in their own sectors. Your only chance is to capture a sizeable amount of land, fortify it well, and use your strongest units to defend so that you don't lose any of them. Then advance slowly, grabbing territory bit-by-bit. Acquire any financial upgrade you can get, as early as you can get it, to make sure you are not defeated due to lack of resources. Keep an eye on your resources at all times. Try to figure out whether a Funkwagen Vampire Halftrack is siphoning resources from you, and if so, look for it immediately. Secure your sectors to prevent their capture. Never take a sector you cannot adequately defend. Finally, a very important tip: Destroy all wrecks. Both Panzer Elite and Wehrmacht forces can manipulate wrecked vehicles to their advantage. In particular, destroy wrecked enemy vehicles if you can, to prevent a Bergetiger from recovering these. Remember that a restored wreck is a completely new vehicle that costs the enemy practically nothing!Defensive Line  The Panzer Elite are always looking for ways to infiltrate your territory. They'll want to steal away land, even if they can't get a hold of it, just to keep you off-balance. If they can get a sufficiently large force across into your territory, they can do a lot of damage. Therefore, the first thing to try to achieve is a solid defensive line - one that's air-tight enough to at least detect, if not destroy, any enemy unit attempting to enter your territory. The British have this easiest. Their defenses are very strong, and can even hold back anything but the heaviest assaults. The key, again, is to build densely enough that enemy units cannot slip past. Remember that some Panzer Elite companies have access to camouflaged units, so your defenses need to be close together to detect these units. Building your line as close to the border with the enemy as possible will also ensure that Funkwagen Vampire Halftracks cannot siphon your resources by parking themselves just a few meters inside your land. If the portion of the map under your control shares a small-enough border with the enemy (such as on narrow maps), don't be tempted to save resources on building fewer defenses. Instead, build layered defenses, in the hope that if the first line fails, the second will stop the enemy. This is especially important later on, when the Panzer Elites can deliver very powerful strikes that a single set of defenses cannot hold. As the Americans, your main options for defense include obstacles and Mines, which you should construct as much of as possible. This will at least delay any hit-and-run attacks until your defensive patrols can react. Make sure to place Observation Posts on all Strategic Points to prevent sudden capture by enemy infiltrators. Remember that the Panzer Elite severely lack artillery - which is only made available to them through one specific Command Tree, and then only later in the battle. This means the threat to your defenses is significantly reduced. If you're going to build your own artillery, it's going to be primarily defensive - unless you can build it close enough to the enemy's base to bombard that. Otherwise, the Panzer Elite don't really have any immobile assets you can bombard.Mobile Patrols  To ensure that the Panzer Elite can't mess with your resources and battle plans, you're going to need to use their own tactics against them - i.e. a set of fast, mobile forces that can defend large portions of your territory under short notice. Panzer Elite units will often attempt to make hit-and-run attacks, trying to confuse you and draw your forces into a trap, so you'll need units that can pull back and relocate quickly. Americans are better at this type of defense, since they can employ very good vehicles which are all reasonably fast. Keep these vehicles behind but not too far from your front lines, so that they can drive to wherever they are needed. Use engineers to repair your vehicles constantly and re-plant minefields. Other infantry units are less useful against Panzer Elite forces - so you may want to use a less infantry-centric force on the defensive. Ranger Squads are the exception, as they can often knock out enemy light vehicles rather easily. The M3 Halftrack and M8 Greyhound are some of your best assets. Whenever the enemy makes an attack, meet him with just enough force to repel or destroy that attack. Try not to lose any units and never over-respond - that's what the enemy hopes you will do. If the enemy retreats - let him. Panzer Elites don't really care whether they lose a few units, so a retreating enemy is either trying to pull you into a trap, or is only a decoy to distract you from a second, more significant attack elsewhere along your lines. If you have units with a good detection radius, especially camouflage and mine detection, have them constantly patrolling throughout your territory. This will allow you to detect traps the enemy may have installed in your own lands - like Butterfly Bombs - and detect hidden enemy units performing subterfuge.Cautious Advances  Never attack the Panzer Elite's sectors with small units. A small infantry unit attempting to quickly steal territory from the enemy will soon meet a Light Armored Car or a Wirbelwind Flakpanzer, or could run into Butterfly Bombs, Mines or even Booby Traps. Even if the unit is not totally destroyed, it's still a waste. Instead, attack in force, and expect the enemy to respond in force to each attack you make. You can set traps by attacking with a small force, drawing in Panzer Elite mobile defense units, and then encircling and destroying those units with the remainder of your force. Again, never assume that you can follow this up by driving deeper into enemy territory: confine yourself to the immediate goal, such as grabbing a Strategic Sector from the enemy. Once you've achieved that goal, immediately arrange your units to defend your new acquisition! Small gains like these are far more likely to succeed than all-out offensives. One by one you can drive the enemy back and hurt his economy while significantly strengthening your own. Always remember the option to withdraw your units back behind the lines. Do whatever you can to preserve your own units, even if it means pulling forces back in the middle of an attack. Enemy units are easily destroyed, but are also easily replaced, while your own units are harder to destroy and harder to replace. If you can keep your units alive and repair them constantly, you will stay one step ahead of the Panzer Elite in the long-run.Know your Enemy  It is extremely important to figure out which Command Tree the Panzer Elite commander has chosen. It will influence his entire strategy, and you must compensate as required.Single-Player Campaign  Although several Panzer Elite units appear during the British Liberation of Caen campaign, this faction is only featured as a cohesive fighting force during its own campaign, Operation Market Garden.Operation Market Garden  During this campaign, the Panzer Elite faction represents Kampfgruppe Lehr - an amalgamation of two real-world Wehrmacht elite armor/mechanized divisions. It is commanded by Major general Voss (whose past achievements are explored in Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor), and the two Berger brothers Aldrich and Wolgang. While on training in the Netherlands, the division is thrust into combat as the Allies attempt to invade the country to control several bridges leading straight over the Rhine and into German soil. The campaign begins with Kampfgruppe Lehr performing a routine combat exercise for newly-recruited Volksgrenadiers near the town of Wolfheze, near Arnhem in the northern Netherlands. Before the exercise can begin, numerous aircraft begin dropping British commandos and light vehicles across the entire area. With all communications cut off, the Kampfgruppe Lehr division mobilizes to repel the invaders. During the battle, documents detailing a massive airborne invasion of the Netherlands prompts the division to prepare for a full-on Allied armor breathrough coming up from Belgium. (In fact, the Kampfgruppe von Tettau took part in the battle of Wolfheze, with old captured French tanks as armor.) Kampfgruppe Lehr retreats towards Oosterbeek, where they destroy a bridge leading towards Arnhem. They then take up positions and block a British commando advance towards Arnhem. With the route denied to the enemy, the division moves south to block the British 30th Armored Corps from advancing up from Belgium. They clear the town of Valkenswaard situated on Highway 69, and proceed to hold off an entire 30th corps advance coming up the road, thanks to heavy artillery and Luftwaffe aircraft support. Part of 30th Corps diverts from the highway to attempt a crossing over the Wilhelmina Canal at Best. Kampfgruppe Lehr moves to intercepts them by destroying the bridge over the canal, but its forward elements are ambushed by American airborne units from the 101st division. Nonetheless, they manage to bring in two Pioneers to destroy the bridge before the enemy can cross, leaving 30th corps stranded on the other side. Meanwhile, the northern element of Kampfgruppe Lehr is entangled in a difficult attempt to root out British commandos holding the northern side of the bridge over the Rhine river at Arnhem. Desperate to prevent the enemy from crossing into German soil, the Panzer Elite field a King Tiger. The commandos, on the other hand, use captured German weapons, including 88mm Flak 36 AT/AA guns and Nebelwerfers. Kampfgruppe Lehr manages to destroy several supply boats docked at the riverside, and then destroys the British command posts just as the lead elements of 30th Corps cross the bridge. Taking this bridge represents the turning point in the campaign, denying the Allies a safe route into Germany, and allowing Kampfgruppe Lehr to begin pushing the enemy out of the Netherlands. The southern Kampfgruppe Lehr section re-takes Valkenswaard by destroying the British 30th Corps headquarters set up there, leaving the enemy's armored division in chaos and surrounded. Meanwhile, the northern section of the division holds off a last counter-attack by British paratroopers against their blocking position at Oosterbeek, finally re-taking the town from the American paratroopers that have been holding it since the early portion of the campaign. With this task accomplished, all remaining opposition inside the Netherlands capitulates, ending the campaign. Historically, the Germans managed to hold the Rhine for another 6 months. On March 1945, the Allies crossed the river into German soil. By this point the German army was incapable of resisting the advance, and in two months it surrendered - after the Russians captured Berlin.Wehrmacht  The Wehrmacht is a German army featured in Company of Heroes. The term Wehrmacht ('defence force') is used to describe the Unified Armed Force of Nazi Germany between the years of 1935 till 1945. It consisted of the German Army (Heer), German Airforce (Luftwaffe) and the German Navy (Kriegsmarine). The Wehrmacht was also referred to as the German Army. It replaced the name Reichswehr after 1935, and was officially dissolved by the Allies in August 1946, more than one year after the end of World War II when it was defeated by the Allies, although the last unit (the crew of a weather station on Svalbard, simply forgotten after the unconditional surrender in May 1945) was disbanded in September 1945. Although the Wehrmacht has no playable campaign, it is featured both in Company of Heroes and Opposing Fronts as the German 7th Army, 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, Panzer Lehr Division, 12th SS Panzer Division, and 21st Panzer Division.Overview  Wehrmacht is the most diversified faction, in terms of units. In opposition to the versatile armies fielded by the Allies, every unit has a specific role on the battlefield. Usually, the majority of the units of the Wehrmacht are more expensive or available later, but they are much better at fulfilling their roles than their allied counterparts. The Wehrmacht is capable of fielding 18 different units: 6 infantry support units, 3 infantry squads, 3 medium vehicles, 2 light vehicles, and 4 tanks. Their early force is very dependent on weapons teams, which are less mobile, but can deliver very heavy firepower for basic infantry squads. Later, they will be supported by medium vehicles and heavy infantry. Finally, tanks will appear, in order to deliver the final blow.Infantry squads  The Wehrmacht has more infantry units as compared to the allied factions. Although volksgrenadiers lose importance in later portions of battle, other units remain useful.Support Infantry  Support infantry is a fundamental part of Wehrmacht forces. Thanks to their heavy firepower they can repel even large groups of enemy infantry. The utility of these units, in creating a defensive line or as support in an assault is invaluable.Light Vehicles  The Wehrmacht army has only two units which can be classified as light vehicles:Medium Vehicles  The Wehrmacht has several medium vehicles, which are often useful throughout the entire battle. Some fulfill a utility role, by providing infantry transport and reinforcement, while others are very valuable as part of a mobile defense or assault force.Heavy Vehicles  Wehrmacht have more heavy vehicles than the Allies, and they are the main strength of the Wehrmacht. As with the rest of the Wehrmacht forces, they are specialized in anti-infantry or anti-tank duty. Veterancy upgrades, available for them in the Kampfkraft center, greatly improve their survivability and firepower. Available only in the later part of the game, they are well-armored and armed, and can be relied upon to deliver a strong punch to the enemy and destroy the enemy's forces very quickly.Passive Defenses  Passive defenses consist mostly of elaborate obstacle mazes. Wehrmacht forces can create these at the entrances to their territory, delaying the enemy and receiving early warning before they attack. These obstacles are often used in unison, creating elaborate traps to lead the enemy into. Although they won't stop an enemy army cold (unless constructed very densely over a long period of time), the delay is often long enough to enable units to respond to any attack. Finally, another Passive Defense that operates differently from the others:Active Defenses  Wehrmacht forces have only one structure which can be considered an active defense structure. However, it can fulfill several different roles:Wehrmacht Veterancy  Wehrmacht units do not accumulate experience points. To achieve higher Veterancy levels, specific upgrades must be purchased at the Kampfkraft Center. Once an upgrade is purchased, it will raise the Veterancy level of all units from several specific unit types. Both existing and future units are affected - so newly produced units will already have as much Veterancy as existing ones. There are four upgrades to be purchased, with each upgrade improving one set of units - for example, an Infantry Veterancy upgrade, a Tank Veterancy upgrade, and so forth. Each upgrade has 3 levels, each corresponding with one of the three Veterancy levels. Therefore, purchasing the first infantry upgrade will raise all infantry units to Veterancy level 1, the second upgrade will raise them to level 2, and the third to level 3. As a result, by the later stages of the game the Wehrmacht's base structures will be producing high-veterancy units. For this reason the loss of a veteran Wehrmacht unit is less important than it is for other factions.Style and Strategy  With a variety of units available right from the start, there is many ways to play as the Wehrmacht. While the Americans rely on maneuver and speed, the Wehrmacht depends on heavy firepower and is more oriented on defense. Though at the start of battle, the Wehrmacht is not as fast as the Americans, in later parts of the battle they can field many medium and heavy vehicles.\u00a0 \u00a0 In order to gain more advanced units, the Wehrmacht must research \u201cphases\u201d. After every research, a new building is available to be built. Every phase also unlocks new abilities for units already available. Usually, as the battle progresses, their force changes from an infantry-centric force (based mostly on weapon teams) to a much more mechanized force.Capturing territory  When the battle begins, the Axis commander must decide which units would be useful against the enemy. Pioneers are very cheap, but are unable to effectively fight against any enemy they meet. This usually leads to building the Wehrmacht quarters, which allows the production of four units, capable of fighting with the enemy. Choice depends of commanders strategy, however, earlier mentioned weakness, lack of mobility, should be taken under consideration. A popular choice is the 'Volksgrenadier' squad, the basic infantry for this faction. Armed with Kar 98 rifles, a Volksgrenadier squad can fight with enemy infantry squads and capture territory. However, they are outmatched against infantry equipped with more advanced weapons (like the American BAR, or British Bren LMG). They should keep distance from the enemy, and use cover always, if possible, because close-range engagements are favorable for the Allies. Later this problem can be solved through the MP 40 upgrade. Axis commanders will benefit greatly from recruiting MG42 teams. These units can fight even large groups of enemy infantry or light vehicles. Without them, it will be hard to hold territory. They need protection from other units, otherwise, they are very vulnervable to flanking maneuvers and indirect fire. If resorurces permit, build a motorcycle for providing line of sight and reconnaissance on the enemy, before it is too late. Pioneers and volksgrenadiers should build passive defenses like sandbags, barbed wire, and mines (if possible), to blunt the enemy's attacks. The last unit available in the Wehrmacht quarters is the sniper. The sniper is very expensive in terms of resources, with the ability to kill enemy soldiers outright from extreme range. However, their fire rate is very low, and they are unable to go toe-to-toe with enemy infantry. Good support is a necessity. If resources are available, try to build forward headquarters near most important points. This building will provide reinforcement for infantry, without requiring them to retreat to base, and lets you to produce units. Remember, although MG42 can give you heavy firepower, you shouldn\u2019t overextend. If you do, your positions can be flanked easily and you can suffer heavy loses (enemy might be even able to capture one of your machine guns, and use it against you. Prevent this for all costs!). This is why Wehrmacht should never play too aggressively, at least not in the early stages of battle. The best solution is to capture a sizeable amount of land, fortify it well, and collect resources for units, which can provide a more mobile defense.Middle stage of battle  When the Wehrmacht has managed to establish a good defensive position, it\u2019s time to produce more advanced units. After researching \u201cSkirmish phase\u201d at the headquarters, Krieg Barracks can be built. Krieg Barracks enables production of few different units. A Sdkfz 251 halftrack, medium vehicle, which transports and reinforces infantry, Pak 38 50mm Anti-tank gun, basic anti-tank cannon, \u00a081mm mortar team, first indirect fire option available for Wehrmacht's commander, and finally - enables production of heavy infantry unit, a grenadier squad. Most of these units are useful in holding captured ground, however they also offer offensive capabilites - although these are a little limited. This building is very important for the middle stage of the battle. If enemy has taken the effort to reach vehicle production, you may be in danger from vehicles like the\u00a0M8 Armored Car or M45 Quadmount, which can tear your infantry apart. Advancing to skirmish phase and recruiting units from the Krieg Barracks is the usual response to that problem. The Pak 38 50mm guns can effectively fight against enemy medium vehicles. With the camouflage ability and in right terms, they can destroy them in one shot. The 'Skirmish' phase also unlocks a few other anti-tank abilities. Firstly, all Volksgrenadier squads are now able to fire Panzerfausts. Also, a new infantry unit, the Grenadiers squad can be equipped with Panzerschrecks which are deadly not only to medium vehicles, but also to tanks. Vehicles aren\u2019t the only threat in this stage of battle. Enemy infantry can also be equipped with advancements like the M1A1 Thompson or Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). Although grenadiers are more experienced and more superior at fighting than Volksgrenadiers, they still can lose to these weapons. To prevent this from happening, consider researching veterancy upgrades for Infantry from the\u00a0Kampfkraft Center, at least to level 2. That will greatly increase the squad's survivability. While waiting for that, try to build a\u00a0bunker\u00a0and transform it into a medic station, to help you reduce your losses. For every four wounded men, the medic station will create new Grenadier squad, free of charge! With these units, it is possible to create a good defensive line, which can be broken only by artillery or other bombardment. It\u2019s unlikely to meet artillery emplacements in this part of game, but enemy can have access to command abilities. These however, require line of sight. That\u2019s why you should always patrol to prevent artillery spotters (like Jeeps or camouflaged snipers) from reaching your lines. This stage is important also from other reason. Wehrmacht forces need to collect resources, which will be necessary to launch an offensive on enemy territory. Each squad of infantry needs to be equipped with advanced weapons in order to reach maximum effectiveness; resources are also needed for keeping infantry in good health. It is advised to build observation post on munitions points which will provide stable income of these valuable resources.\u00a0 With new units on the field, Axis forces can now start fighting for territory. Grenadiers, supported by mortars and Sdkfz 251 can start making advances. Attack exposed positions on open terrain. With the help of mortar fire, you can quickly destroy an enemy\u2019s defensive line or resistance point. Against those units, the enemy will have serious troubles if he doesn\u2019t have any vehicles. However, at this stage, Wehrmacht forces still lack mobility. Weapon teams can follow your forces but are very slow and vulnerable to every kind of counterattack (especially flanking). Panzerschreck-equipped grenadiers, can be subdued by medium vehicles, which are able to attack them from greater range. After all, even they need to be stationary, in order to be effective. Every attack on enemy\u2019s territory should be executed with caution.Alternate Production Strategy  Some players decide to skip the Krieg barracks, and go straight for the next phase, known as 'Assault phase'. This is a risky move, because: However, this move may pay off if the enemy\u2019s forces consist only of infantry squads and weapon teams, as medium vehicles, like the Sdkfz 234 Armored Car, can deliver serious damage to the Allied infantry, and push them back, winning the battle in consequence. Usually, this strategy is used together with the 'Blitzkrieg' doctrine, because of the\u00a0Stormtrooper squad. Stormtroopers will replace Grenadiers in most roles. Also, with the camouflage ability, they can simply sneak behind enemy lines and destroy enemy\u2019s valuable assets. If you have encounter a fortified enemy position, use Nebelwerfers, or have one of your officers call in a bombardment. However, this requires munitions. If the enemy has managed to survive your assault, and the battle is lingering, it\u2019s recommended to build Krieg barracks. Stormtroopers can\u2019t be your frontline soldiers (at least not for long) because of high cost of this unit. High casualties may leave you without resources, and be a reason for failure. \u00a0Assault  With a good defensive line, one including heavy infantry and support weapons, the Wehrmacht can now advance to 'Assault phase', which unlocks the Sturm Armory. Units from that building are more mobile and have the ability to attack faster, with greater strength. Sdkfz 234 Armored Cars can be used as mobile defenses. With a 20mm cannon, they can quickly destroy enemy infantry which is trying to capture your territory. It\u2019s a great attack unit, and works well with infantry squads and other vehicles. With the good speed it possess, it\u2019s perfect for \u201csearch and destroy \u201c missions and recon. The Stug IV is your main anti-tank unit. Cheap, and with good punch, it can be very dangerous. Its frontal armor rarely can be penetrated by allied vehicles or tanks (which can start to appear in this stage of battle), although enemy anti-tank guns are still a danger. It\u2019s turretless however, and without proper upgrades, defenseless against infantry and vulnervable for flanking maneuvers, so support is necessary for good combat performance. Grenadiers can now be upgraded with MG42 LMG, which helps to fend off any infantry. Armored cars are even better at this job, killing infantry before they are be able to do any serious damage. Such a combat group, consisting of StuGs, armored cars, and grenadiers, is very solid offensive force. If enemy medium vehicles start to appear, consider upgrading one of your Sdkfz 234 with a 50mm cannon. Then, you will be able to fight against them. The StuG IV assault gun can also be used, but is too slow to chase those units. Finally, the Wehrmacht commander receives his first real artillery piece, the Nebelwerfer 41. This unit, with the ability to fire six incendiary rockets, is deadly against infantry, weapon teams, and defensive emplacements. In this stage of \u00a0the battle, should be used against enemy anti-tank measures, like 57mm anti-tank cannon, which are a serious threat for your (still-growing) vehicle-based force. The Officer is another unit which can be built. Generally, it is very rarely seen on the battlefield, but it has several useful abilities. He may accelerate production, force retreat on the enemy\u2019s squads, and even call bombardment. If the 'Blitzkrieg' doctrine has been chosen, this will be the only \u201coff-map\u201d bombardment available. Finally, the 'Assault' phase unlocks a few other abilities and upgrades. Your mortar teams are now able to fire smoke cover. This is particularly useful during an advance. Soldiers will be much more resistant to suppression and damage from small-arms fire. Sdkfz 251 halftracks can now be changed into a radically new vehicle, the flammenwerfer for 75\u00a075. Equipped with 2 flamethrowers, it can incinerate buildings and infantry with good effect. However, because of weak armor and the fact that American infantry is usually equipped with anti-tank weapons, it isn\u2019t very popular. But in heavy-urbanized areas, especially, when enemy infantry is garrisoned, it can be used with good effect.Combined Arms Assault and Armored Core  Last available and the most advanced building for the Wehrmacht, is the Panzer Command; able to build after entering into the Battle Phase. That building unlocks most powerful Wehrmacht units - elite infantry and tanks. Usually, when the Panzer Command has been built, Wehrmacht forces are busy attacking territory through mobile artillery, assault guns and heavy infantry or reppeling enemy infantry and tanks, meanwhile replacing lost defensive structures because of enemy artillery. Production time of these units is long and may take some time before you will be able to create a solid armoured force. To solve this problem (partially at least), use the Officer\u2019s \u201cSupervision\u201d ability. These units aren\u2019t only the most powerful in your arsenal, but also the most expensive. Buying each one of them can be beyond your budget, that\u2019s why you should decide which will be most useful. If enemy forces consist mainly of infantry units (especially elite), you should consider the production of the Ostwind Flakpanzer. This light tank is well armoured and agile enough to fight with them. Another option is producing a Knight Cross Holders squad. Although very small in numbers, a few squads of this type of infantry is tough enough to tear enemy infantry apart. These soldiers are especially effective in taking out large groups of enemy anti-tank infantry, which can be a serious threat even for specialized anti-infantry vehicles. Unfortunately they are very expensive to produce and reinforce, therefore they are uncommonly seen on the battlefield. If enemy forces are using a combined unit approach, a few Panzer IV tanks will be the great decision. They are reasonably armed and are capable to fight with both infantry and enemy tanks. Their abilities will be strengthened if proper upgrades from the Kampfkraft Center are purchased. If\u00a0 the enemy has managed to create a solid armoured force, it may be wise move to spare resources for Panther Tanks. Although very expensive, solid, sloped armour will deflect enemy bullets easily while the strong and powerful cannon can wipe out or damage enemy tanks quickly. The upgrade to the Battle Phase unlocks other abilities and equipment. All infantry squads are now able to heal themselves even in enemy territory thanks to the Field-Medkit. Stormtroopers, if available can finally be equipped with MP44 assault rifles. Finally, the Sdkfz 251 can now be upgraded to a mobile artillery unit for a hefty 150\u00a0150. Although the cost may be considered high (depends on commander\u2019s ammunition income), it can be worth its price. Halftracks will be equipped with six launchers of high-explosive rockets. Less useful against infantry, but very against enemy armoured forces and buildings. Covered by your army, they can be nearly uncatchable and provide devastating (and spectacular) fire power which will subdue enemy in short order. The units above, with others already existing on the battlefield can advance into enemy territory almost without fear, destroying enemy resistance points with mobile artillery. Snipers, if you can afford them should scout in front of your force in order to provide early warning. Alternatively, motorcycles can be used in this way, although they are often left in ruins if faced against enemy armour or infantry with heavy weapons. Remember, although your army is very strong at this moment, it isn\u2019t invincible. If your units are grouped, they can be juicy targets for enemy planes or artillery strikes. Attacks should be executed on a wide scale, if possible. If done properly, large gains of territory and eventual victory will be only a matter of time.Doctrines  The Werhmacht has three different command trees, which are referred to as doctrines. Each of them put emphasis on other aspect of warfare: I) Defensive Doctrine - This doctrine emphasizes building hardened defense to repel the enemies. All their structures can be upgraded with anti-infantry defense, and the player is granted two artillery strike abilities. This doctrine also allows them to construct the most fearsome long-range weaponry in the game - the 88mm Flak 36. Although powerful and a useful doctrine, its endgame is not as powerful compared to the other 2 doctrines (e.g. Tiger I, King Tiger, V1 rocket strike) II) Blitzkrieg Doctrine - This is one of the most popular doctrines, as it emphasizes fast armored warfare to overwhelm the enemies. This doctrine allows the Wehrmacht to field powerful tanks which arrive relatively early such as the StuH 42 (a tank well suited to urban assaults, similar to the StuG IV but more anti-infantry as it is armed with a 105mm howitzer) and the famous and formidable Tiger tank. This doctrine also can use special abilities such as Blitzkrieg Assault, in which many units are given a large temporary speed boost and all vehicles gain a heavy crush ability perfect for cruching powerful infantry 'blobs' especially with the turretless StuG and StuH. III) Terror Doctrine - This doctrine is designed to demoralize the enemies with unconventional tactics and terror weapons. The player is granted access to the V1 Flying Bombs, which can totally anhilliate the enemy with a super powerful barrage, and the incendiary Firestorm air strike to scourge the enemies even when in trenches. This doctrine can also call in the Tiger Ace tank (Old patches of the game) or the mighty, rolling behemoth known as the King Tiger.King Tiger  The King Tiger or Tiger II (official real-life designation Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. B \"K\u00f6nigstiger\") is an Axis heavy vehicle featured in Company of Heroes with the introduction of the Opposing Fronts expansion.In-game Description  This is a very powerful weapon and thus must be called in times of extreme need. \"A single, very powerful King Tiger is allocated to the battlefield but only once. Such a decisive weapon should not be squandered.\"Game Info  Most Axis commanders of the Wehrmacht in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts choose the Terror Doctrine for one ultimate goal: to call in the ultimate weapon of terror. The Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. B, also known as the K\u00f6nigstiger - the German word for Bengal Tiger, but often semi-literally translated to King Tiger or Royal Tiger - is something out of a nightmare. This massive, over-sized beast is armed with the 88mm KwK 43 L/71 gun; a longer and more powerful version of the famous 88mm KwK 36 L/56 of the standard Tiger tank and sloped steel armor up to 180mm, twice the armour of most Allied tanks. The King Tiger's immense weight means it can easily crush infantry and tank traps alike. The 88mm KwK 43 L/71 is effective against all targets, especially enemy tanks. The weaker armor of the M4 Sherman, Cromwell Tank, M10 Tank Destroyer, and Sherman Firefly is highly vulnerable to the King Tiger' main gun. Its thick armor also make it capable of taking an incredible amount of punishment, making it one of the toughest tank on the battlefield. It has good survivability, making it an excellent vehicle for penetrating the enemy's front lines. Its powerful gun is excellent at taking out heavy support vehicles and heavily fortified positions. It is also one of very few vehicles that are capable of surviving massive artillery strikes almost unscathed. Even if hit by multiple artillery strikes, it suffers only minor damage. Some infantry such as Grenadier Squads, Volksgrenadier Squads and Pioneer Squads can keep up with it. Supporting the King Tiger with infantry and other Panzers is necessary for it to perform effectively on the battlefield. When supporting a King Tiger, be mindful not to keep the supporting Panzer too far away. If used in conjunction with Terror Doctrine's V1 Flying Bomb, Zeal and Firestorm, a well-supported King Tiger can effectively breach the enemy front lines and strike fear into even the most persistent Allied commander. The King Tiger is capable crushing the enemies on the battlefield can shatter even the toughest of the opponent's morale. The King Tiger is a not only a superb propaganda war machine but also an effective heavy tank.Weapons 88mm KwK 43 L/71  The King Tiger's main cannon is a more powerful version of the Tiger I's feared 88mm KwK 36 L/56 (which was a derivative of the famous 88mm FlaK 36 AA/AT gun). The 88mm KwK 43 L/71 was the most powerful tank gun ever fitted in a rotating turret in World War II (excluding the 128mm PaK 44 mounted on the second prototype of Maus). Every single hit drains up to 165 health. The gun has a range of 30m and takes eight seconds to reload.7.92 mm Maschinengewehr 34  The King Tiger's secondary weapon is the predecessor of the feared Maschinengewehr 42. The 7.92\u00a0mm Maschinengewehr 34, it is one of the most powerful machine guns in World War II. Every single hit of it drains up to 6 health and reloads for 3 seconds. It fires 15-30 bullets before it reloads again.Tips Weaknesses  Although the King Tiger is almost the heaviest armored and armed tank on the battlefield (Only the Jagdpanther has superior front armor and cannon), its size and weight make it one of the slowest tank on the battlefield. The main drawback of this vehicle is that it can only be called once. This means that protecting its flanks is a high priority. Once lost, it cannot be replaced, except if it is recovered by a Panzer Elite Bergetiger.   Its slow speed can be an advantage to Allied commanders. You can have multiple M10 Tank Destroyers flank it while the M4 Shermans distract it. Additionally, like all tanks it can be killed easily by dropping it off a bridge that your engineers have demolished. Should the enemy refuse to take it across bridges, it'll have to pass through open ground where anti-tank guns and infantry can flank it. Furthermore, the King Tiger's turret rotation speed is slow. You can take advantage of this by having one of your tanks literally run circles around it, drawing its fire. Eventually, if it does not make a mistake, the tank will move around the King Tiger faster than its turret can track, and therefore, return fire. It is possible for even the smallest tanks, such as a Tetrarch to destroy the King Tiger on their own in this way, however this will take a very long time, so it is not a tactic that should be relied upon, and should only be used as a last resort, primarily because it requires a great amount of micromanagement, greatly increasing the chances that you will lose any other battles that are occurring at the same time. This same tactic can also be used against the Panzer Elite's Jagdpanther, due to its lack of a rotating turret. An American Armor Company Commander can also use his M26 Pershing and/or Calliopes to distract the King Tiger, while having Shermans, Hellcats or even AT Guns flank it. Also, the King Tiger is very loud. Allied commanders with a keen ear will be able to find it and home in on it, even through the Fog-Of-War. This puts it at risk from artillery, even if it is hidden. It is even louder if it is moving, so keep it in a safe spot when idling. If you really need to keep it secret, generate noise around it, like several other vehicles, artillery guns, etc. This will make this huge noise-maker on tracks harder to hear.Trivia British  The British, also known as the Commonwealth, are one of the two factions featured in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts and Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor . A member of the Allies, it fights alongside the Americans to liberate Nazi-occupied Europe. The British play a heavily-defensive game, with considerable artillery support and impressive Commando abilities. Historically, the British played a major role in World War II, participating from the first day to the very last day.Overview  Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts introduced the British faction as the new Allied force. Along with the Americans, they invade Europe on and after D-Day 1944, to liberate it from the Nazi occupation. The British Army featured in the game represents an amalgamation of military forces from the various nations collectively referred to as the \"Commonwealth\". It includes soldiers of the English, Australian, Scottish and Canadian nationalities, working together under a unified command structure. (Other Commonwealth forces included New Zealand, India and South Africa, among others). British forces are made up of a wide variety of units, though their basic focus is centered on creating a strong defensive line to protect captured land, then using powerful concentrated attacks to gain (and then fortify) additional territory whenever possible. What they lack in offensive versatility, they make up for with some of the most powerful (and comparatively cheapest) Defensive Structures available. Additionally, the British can enlist the help of specialized Support Companies that enhance the function of one specific portion of the British army. For example, they can enhance the performance of their artillery (making it one of the strongest artillery forces in the game), recruit tough tanks to spearhead their assaults, or utilize the assistance of glider-borne Commandos to perform surgical strikes behind enemy lines. In their single-player campaign, the British are seen attempting to capture the city of Caen in Normandy to secure a way off the beaches after D-Day. During the Panzer Elite campaign, British Commando paratroopers land in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands to secure a way for the Allies to cross the Rhine during Operation Market Garden.Basic Force Composition  The British force is structured very differently from those of other factions. It only fields 9 different kinds of units, 2 of which are fighting infantry, 1 is a light transport vehicle, and 3 are tanks. 3 additional units are unique command units, which are responsible for bestowing Veterancy-like bonuses on other British forces. Most importantly though, the British can field a very wide variety of extremely-powerful defensive structures, which form the basic focus of this faction's strategy. Additionally, the British base structures are in fact mobile Command Trucks, which can relocate around the battlefield as necessary. These trucks are responsible for spawning units (and each other), and serve to protect resource sectors and enhance resource production.Command Trucks  Unlike other factions, the British army does not have stationary production facilities. Instead it has specialized vehicles called Command Trucks. Command Trucks can move around the map freely, and can set themselves up in friendly sectors. Once set up, a truck secures that sector to prevent enemies from re-taking it. It also increases resource production in that sector. Trucks produce all the basic British units. Each truck can produce three different unit types, and can reinforce infantry within a radius around itself. The Headquarters Command Truck, available at the start of the game, is responsible for creating the other trucks. The trucks are extremely tough when deployed, but are more vulnerable to damage when mobile. They must be set up in order to produce units. They are often placed in sectors that are very defensible - to prevent their destruction - but their resource bonus means that it's often more important to put them in sectors with high resource production values.Infantry  British infantry is very basic, in that it contains only two types of units (barring the aid of the Royal Commandos Support): Both of these units are significantly more expensive than their counterparts in other factions, and do not exhibit any spectacular combat abilities. Moreover, they move very slowly through non-friendly territory, making them less useful for offensive operations. However, both units are mostly responsible for constructing the British Defensive Structures, making them vital for all British tactics.Light Vehicles  The British can field a single Light Vehicle, which is mainly used for transporting infantry units quickly around the battlefield: The Bren Carrier mostly assists with transportation of troops, moving them between locations in order to provide support at various points along the British defensive line. Early on, the Machine Gun upgrade allows it to quickly chase down infantry attempting to take British territory, or even make raids into enemy territory to kill exposed units.Tanks  The British can field three very different types of tanks, each tasked with an appropriately different function: British tanks are quite vulnerable on their own, as they are considerably less-armored and less-armed than their Axis counterparts. When massed in large groups however, they can destroy an enemy position, allowing infantry to take and fortify it against the enemy. All British tanks can be upgraded with tank commanders to increase their sight-range significantly, allowing them to provide reconnaissance-in-force.Defensive Structures  The most unique feature of the British army is its ability to field a large variety of very powerful and surprisingly cheap Defensive Structures. All of these emplacements are constructed by the British Infantry units. Passive defenses include: Active defenses include: Each of these emplacements is powerful in its own right, but together they can form impassable barriers to block enemy advances. Vulnerable only to enemy artillery, these buildings are durable and can be constantly repaired by Sappers to maintain an impenetrable defense. They are deployed along the British front line while the British army gathers the resources and units to form a massive attack force that can then strike and take territory from the enemy. Without these emplacements, the British army is significantly weaker than other factions. Note that all British active emplacements take up Population Cap points. As such, the number of emplacements that can be fielded is quite limited - especially if one wishes to also maintain an offensive force for taking enemy territory.Command Units  Unlike other factions, British units do not accumulate Veterancy (more on this below). Instead, they rely on Command Units to give them powerful bonuses to enhance their performance. These Command Units have virtually nothing in the way of combat abilities, but the combat bonuses they bestow make British units considerably more useful. Additionally, these Command Units are crucial to the British tech hierarchy. The British can field three different kinds of Command Units: These three Command Units are also the only British units that accumulate Veterancy, which they get from the units in their vicinity. As they go up in rank, the bonuses they apply to other units increase. Unfortunately, all three Command Units are especially high-value targets for enemy fire, and should never be left unprotected. The loss of a veteran Command Unit can be a significant blow to the British. Finally, the production of Command Units is absolutely necessary to advance the British tech hierarchy. A Lieutenant is required for the production of a Field Support Truck and Bren Carrier, a Captain is required for the production of an Armor Command Truck and Stuart Light Tank, and the Cromwell Command Tank is required for the production of Sherman Fireflies. Therefore, without producing each of these Command Units, the British cannot field their entire array of units.Veterancy  The British army has one of the most unique methods of handling Veterancy amongst all other factions. In this army, only three units (!) can accumulate Veterancy at all, while other units will never rise in level. These three units, collectively named \"Command Units\", in turn apply a set of bonuses to other units around them, thereby simulating Veterancy through proximity. These bonuses improve as the Command Unit's own Veterancy level goes up. The three Command Units are the Lieutenant, Captain and Cromwell Command Tank. Each of these units provides a different set of bonuses which are applied to different units. The Lieutenant affects nearby Infantry within a range of 30 meters of himself. All affected infantry units receive bonuses to their firing speed, reloading speed, and/or weapon accuracy. Several Lieutenants can accompany an infantry group to \"pool together\" these bonuses, thereby increasing the entire group's combat effectiveness quite dramatically. Lieutenants reaching high levels can increase this bonus. The Cromwell Command Tank performs a similar function, except it only affects Vehicles. It increases their rate of fire, their sight-range, and the range of their weapons too. This can turn a group of British tanks, normally mediocre in capabilities, into a much more fearsome fighting force. Additionally, Sherman Fireflies receive a significant extra boost to their firing speed, thereby increasing the potential damage output of their powerful anti-tank cannons to a terrifying level. Finally, the Captain affects all Defensive Structures in the same sector as himself, increasing their Maximum Health and reducing all damage taken from enemy attacks. This effectively makes defenses in a single sector far more durable. In addition, high-level Captains can give infantry in the same sector the ability to slowly regenerate their health. All three units lack any significant offensive capabilities. Even the Cromwell Command Tank is missing its main gun. Instead of killing enemy units, these Command Units accumulate Veterancy simply by being close to other British units when they kill enemies. The Lieutenant and Captain accumulate veterancy from kills made by nearby British infantry, while the Cromwell Command Tank accumulates veterancy from kills made by nearby British vehicles. Since they lack offensive power and are so valuable, it is important to always keep the Command Units safe from harm. Fortunately, these units can be told to maintain a minimal \"Command Range\" from another unit, following closely behind it for their own protection (and for applying their Command Bonuses to that unit at all times). However, micro-management is still required occasionally to keep the Command Units from exposing themselves to danger.Style and Strategy  Out of all the different factions in the game, the British army is the most defensively-oriented faction as it was mentioned several times above. In order to stand a chance against enemy factions, the British need to capture as much territory as they can, and then proceed to fortify it against enemy attacks. Otherwise, British units can be easily defeated by the strength of Axis forces. A typical British battleplan has five distinct stages: This progression by stages is tied to the high cost of unit construction, and the relative weakness of British units compared to their Axis counterparts. It is derived from World War One combat strategies, though it is far more effective due to the use of tanks and/or Commandos to drive powerful strikes into enemy territory.Stage 1: Expansion  At the start of a skirmish/multiplayer match, the British have one Infantry Section with the Recon Element upgrade already installed. Their Headquarters Command Truck can only produce Infantry Sections,\u00a0Bren Carriers or a\u00a0Lieutenant. Both of these have quite a high cost for early-game units. Therefore, the British need to make do with what they have, by quickly securing as many resource points as they can. Unfortunately, all British infantry moves very slowly through non-captured territory. Therefore they will take territory much slower than enemy factions, and will usually end up with less land once all neutral sectors are gone. There are several solutions to this: When getting close to the enemy's own advancing lines, it's important to concentrate on capturing sectors that are more easily defensible, rather than sectors that produce lots of resources but can't be easily defended (i.e. open terrain). Some players like to produce a Lieutenant and then a Bren Carrier or two. The Bren Carriers can quickly ferry infantry from sector to sector to quickly take plenty of ground. Once sufficient Munitions are gathered, one or more Bren Carriers can be converted to MMG Carriers, using them to fend off enemy infantry entering your new captured territory, or even hunting down enemy units in their own territory (since, at this stage, the enemy can do little against vehicles like the Bren Carrier).Stage 2: Fortification  This stage officially begins once a front line with the enemy has been established (i.e. no more neutral sectors remaining between your land and the enemy's). During this stage, the British toil to produce their powerful defensive emplacements to defend the line. Sometimes stage 2 can overlap with stage 1, with Infantry Sections using left-over Manpower to construct Vickers Machine Gun Emplacements to protect sectors as they move to capture new ones. More concretely however, at this stage you should begin working towards producing Sappers, which would require a Field Support Truck (and vicariously at least one Lieutenant to enable construction of that truck). The Sappers will build more powerful emplacements, beginning probably with Bofors 40mm Cannons, as these are most suitable for tackling both infantry and light vehicles - the only units available to the enemy at this stage. Subsequently, 17 Pounder AT Guns are set up at crucial points to protect against future incursions by enemy tanks. During this stage, Infantry Sections are usually delegated to further construction of Vickers Machine Gun Emplacements to protect weak spots against enemy infantry, and 3\" Mortar Emplacements to complement other defenses. If necessary, Infantry Sections can assist in the protection of weak points along the line, digging Slit Trenches where necessary to provide themselves with extra protection. The production of a Captain is necessary at this point, to provide defensive bonuses to emplacements wherever the enemy attacks. This also allows creating the Stuart Light Tank, which can begin intercepting enemy vehicles and infantry, and/or reconnoitering enemy positions. This stage only ends once you feel sufficiently secure behind your defensive line - whether because it is heavily fortified or because you have sufficient mobile units to protect weak points.Stage 3: Battle Production  While the British defensive line is secured, the Command Trucks will gather a large amount of Munitions and Fuel, which are used for the construction of main battle units. This requires the Armor Command Truck, which is tasked with producing Cromwell Tanks, a Cromwell Command Tank, and subsequently Sherman Fireflies. These units make up the bulk of the British offensive force. These units should not be sent piece-meal into enemy territory, as they will not be a match for the powerful units the Germans can field at this stage. Let the Germans perform futile attacks against your line while you bolster your power, aiming to reach the Population Cap as quickly as possible. In the meanwhile, an artillery-minded British commander will begin construction of the powerful 25 Pounder Gun Howitzers, used to bombard enemy positions into dust or providing defensive fire on enemy units approaching your line. Also, use this time to have your cheaper units (infantry and Stuart Light Tanks) to reconnoiter the enemy's lines. This will reveal weak spots in enemy defenses, and you may even be able to destroy a few lone enemy units in the process. However, any actual attack by your recon units will usually bear little fruits, unless you can pull off a clever deception or otherwise outwit your enemy. This stage ends once you've accumulated a powerful force of tanks and infantry.Stage 4: Attack  During this stage, the British deliver a powerful armor punch at the weakest point in the enemy line. This is done using pretty much the majority of accumulated British strength, because a weak force may not be able to stand up to the German units. The armored advance is usually lead by the tanks. Once contact is made with enemy units, the force splits up into teams, with one team taking the enemy on frontally to draw it's attention, while other teams maneuver quickly around the enemy to achieve flanking positions. British tanks are particularly good at such flanking maneuvers thanks to their speed bonus abilities. Of course, without this flanking, British tanks are no match for their German counterparts in face-to-face combat. Infantry usually move behind the main force, to avoid taking unnecessary casualties during the initial contact. They can be used to clear out enemy infantry during the assault, and can even take part in flanking maneuvers using Bren Carriers to put them in advantageous positions behind the enemy. However, the infantry's main role in this is to help secure the sector after it has been cleared of enemy troops. The Infantry will capture the sector, and immediately begin fortifying it to prevent an enemy counter-attack. British tanks can continue to provide support during the fortification efforts. It may be necessary to dismantle other fortifications further back behind you in order to attain the required number of Population Cap points. This essentially repositions the defensive line forward of its original position. This stage is completed once the sector is suitably defended, and the tanks and infantry can retreat to heal and repair for the next assault.Command Doctrines  As with all other factions, the British have three Command Doctrines available. They are generally known as \"Royal Support Companies\". Each of these doctrines is meant to enhance one specific aspect of the British strategy, focusing on fielding and improving one set of units. They will often radically alter the behavior of the British army during the mid-late stages of the battle.Royal Artillery Support  This Support Company is a British artillery battalion. By selecting this Command Doctrine, the British player is committed to the application of extremely powerful artillery barrages on enemy positions. The Royal Artillery Support company provides increased range for all British artillery emplacements and units. It also allows them to perform reactive fire, by automatically bombarding enemy units moving through a certain point on the map, or automatically bombarding enemy artillery as it opens fire on your positions. This Support Company also allows officers to call in off-map artillery barrages, and allows artillery to perform wide-area offensive barrages to wipe out a section of the map or carve a line through enemy defenses. Finally, this company allows fielding the Priest Self-Propelled Artillery, a mobile artillery unit that packs one of the strongest punches in the game. Coupled with all the other upgrades, this type of artillery can flatten enemy positions in preparation for an armored advance, or even bombard the enemy base all the way across the map. The Royal Artillery Support company is therefore wisely feared by most Axis players, who often respond by attacking the artillery sites with everything they have.Royal Commandos Support  The Royal Commandos Support company gives an entirely different flavour to the British army, by concentrating on the production of surgical strike units and increased intelligence. Royal Commandos are elite units that are landed on the battlefield by Commando Gliders, and thus can be placed behind enemy lines. The gliders also function as production structures if they are in friendly territory that is in supply(with the exception of the HQ glider, which can produce units anywhere). Five different types of Commando units are available, ranging from a basic 6-man elite infantry team (called Commandos), to one of the fastest vehicles in the game (the Tetrarch Tank). This is also the only way for the British to acquire infantry support teams (HMG Commandos, PIAT Commandos and Mortar Commandos) that other factions take for granted. Intelligence-wise, the Royal Commandos Support company allows construction of Detectors for Radio Triangulation to make enemy units visible on the mini-map. This allows the planning and careful execution of Commando raids deep into enemy territory. Additionally, a decryption team can listen in on enemy communications to learn which upgrades and units the enemy is purchasing at any time. Finally, this Command Tree opens up an off-map artillery ability, and also allows dropping smoke flares to make the enemy think he's about to be bombarded with artillery, for no actual cost to the British. These mind-games with the enemy pretty much define the Royal Commandos Support company's mentality.Royal Engineers Support  The Royal Engineers Support Company is a Scottish regiment that is primarily focused on defense, but offers a significant boost of survivability to the British offensive armored forces as well. For starters, this Support Company significantly increases the durability of all British Active Defenses, like the Vickers Machine Gun Emplacement or 17 Pounder AT Gun. It also increases many of the properties of the British Command Trucks, including their survivability, resource production, and even production speed. This Support Company also allows all British tanks to go into \"Hull Down\" position, trading in their mobility for extra defense. This can be used to entrench tanks along the front lines, but also to help tanks survive a British armored advance. Finally, this company enables fielding three types of heavy tanks: the Churchill Tank, Churchill AVRE and Churchill Crocodile. These are infantry-support tanks with different weapons (primarily anti-infantry and anti-building), though their greatest feature is their heavy all-around armor which makes them perfect for leading other British armor and infantry units into combat in enemy territory.Playing Against the British  Due to the defensive nature of British strategies, playing against this faction is sometimes considered an \"uphill battle\". Once the British manage to fortify a line, it may be exceptionally difficult to punch through that line to acquire territory, resulting in either a stalemate or heavy losses. While British units are individually weaker than their Axis counterparts, in groups they can deliver quite massive punches. As a result, many Axis commanders balk at the idea of fighting the British: even if they win, it would have been a long and tedious fight. However, the key to defeating the British, as with any other army, is to understand and exploit their weaknesses - of which they have several. The primary advantage one always has against the British army is that it is a static army and has little flexibility. By confusing, out-witting or out-punching the British, it's possible to subdue them simply by breaking through their lines. Once on the other side of that line is reached, victory is often imminent.Artillery  One major weakness the British can't get rid of is their reliance on static emplacements. While these structures can take out almost anything that comes at them head-on, they cannot fight what they cannot see. Therefore, the obvious first step to punching through the British line is to build up a formidable artillery force, and then concentrate all firepower at one spot along the line. This can sometimes reduce an entire fortified position to rubble, creating a gap through which armor and infantry can quickly rush through. Watch out though, if the British commander has chosen the Royal Artillery Support Company: his artillery can react to your fire, raining highly-accurate shells at your artillery. If this is the case, always remember to move your artillery back as soon as they're done firing their salvos, so that when the enemy fires back you are no longer there. Alternately, consider massing your artillery to fire at the enemy's artillery positions in order to shut them down. That is, assuming his artillery is not placed too far back.Remain Mobile  The British are strong defensively, but weak offensively. Their primary method of attack is to use masses of their medium tanks, sometimes accompanied by infantry, to raid your sectors and take them away. To make these raids effective, their units need to stay grouped together, supported by heavy artillery. To reduce your casualties, try relying as little as possible on static defenses. These tend to get bombarded or out-flanked as soon as the British make contact with them, so they will eventually be pointless. Instead, field a large force made up of the most mobile units you have - including anything from light vehicles to heavy tanks. These need to be able to respond with haste to any move made by the British. If you promptly respond to an attack, you can surprise and encircle your enemy easily, crushing their entire offensive and forcing them to spend a long time rebuilding. You can use this time to punch through their defenses and wipe them out while they are recovering. Also, keep a unit or two of repair-infantry close to (but not inside) your base. If the British bombard it, you'll want to be able to fix it quickly without having to retreat engineers all the way from your rally points. It will also help to keep your base structures are widely spaced as possible to avoid losing several structures in one artillery attack. Spread them out all over your HQ Territory. This has the added bonus of giving a larger radius in which to detect Commandos trying to move around your base to plant detectors.Reconnaissance  It is important to stay up-to-date with the location of British emplacements and artillery. This is done by performing reconnaissance of the enemy's lines as often as possible. Look for passageways protected only by a single emplacement, like a Vickers Machine Gun Emplacement or a Bofors 40mm Cannon. These can be breached by a tank column advancing straight through them. Alternately, you can look for 17 Pounder AT Guns guarding a passageway on their own, as infantry can often get close enough to destroy these with grenades, demolition charges or flame-throwers as available. Naturally, the best possible result is to find a narrow passageway that the British enemy has failed to secure. During an attack, your units can rush straight for this gap, and while you may lose a few of them, the rest will be able to move through the gap and zoom straight into enemy territory. The Wehrmacht will find reconnaissance easiest thanks to their Snipers. The only equivalent for the Panzer Elite is the Kettenkrad, though it only has camouflage abilities when selecting the Luftwaffe Tactics Doctrine. Otherwise, consider throwing Kettenkrads straight into the enemy lines in the hope that they'll make it far enough to reveal the extent of the defenses before they are destroyed. Infantry also works for this, but is obviously more expensive.The Punch-Through  Once you've located the best place to attack the enemy (i.e. the weakest point in their line), amass a large number of heavy vehicles and infantry. Make sure to spread them across your territory to keep from being bombarded. When you're ready, quickly amass them about 50 or 60 meters in front of the weak spot, and make a powerful charge at it. Artillery can be used to soften that spot up further. Keep driving. Don't stop to fire at enemy units or emplacements - just keep going through them. If you've picked a sufficiently weak spot, the majority of your force should be able to make it to the other side. Even if some of your units are damaged or destroyed, you will usually have enough forces remaining to continue your attack. Once on the other side of the defensive line, start spreading out your forces, driving as deep into enemy territory as you can while doing so. Don't forget that most enemy emplacements can rotate to fire behind them, so you need to put distance between yourself and the enemy emplacements before this can happen. Once you've put some distance there, you've already nearly won. From that point onward, you can begin to freely raid the entire enemy territory. Their mobile defenses are usually very weak (given the amount of Population Cap points they must spend on defensive emplacements) to not present much of a problem for your heavy units. A single King Tiger accompanied by a few support units can usually take on the entire British mobile defense, obliterate their tanks, and locate and destroy their Command Trucks. While you're romping through enemy territory, keep producing units! Your new units may not be able to exploit the same breach (they might, if the enemy did not seal it quickly enough), but they will be needed to make sure the enemy does not attempt to suddenly exploit the lack of units on your side of the defensive line by attacking with his armor. Though, if he does try that, he's leaving his territory and command trucks exposed, so be sure to counter-exploit this! If your infantry has nothing better to do, start capturing the enemy's sectors. Those sectors may be cut off from your supply lines, but they are at least denied to the enemy, and god knows the British need those resources. Also, taking sectors from the enemy reduces their Population Cap, forcing them to scuttle emplacements if they wish to produce more units to counter your attack. Whatever happens, do not get close to their defensive line. As far as you're concerned, they can keep it. It saps their Population Cap, and since you're already behind it, it can't do you any further harm. Just make sure your breaching units do not go near the defensive line.Two Waves  An alternate method of breaching involves creating two separate groups. One group exploits the weak spot in the enemy line by charging through it as described above. Then it starts engaging a nearby enemy emplacement from the rear. As that emplacement turns to fire at your breaching force, the second force charges at it, causing a sudden encirclement. If done properly with the right kind of units, you may be able to destroy an entire section of enemy defenses in a rapid manner, resulting in a large gap forming in the enemy lines. This gap can then be used to keep rushing in troops produced at your base straight into enemy territory. From this point you can proceed either as outlined above (using your units to roam enemy territory and destroy everything he has) or continue enveloping and destroying enemy emplacements in a similar manner, by running both your forces up along the enemy's defenses and encircling them one at a time. This tactic will surely cost a few units, but if you can keep up production you can easily overwhelm the British defenses. Once those defenses are down, the remaining British force is no match for the Axis, and will quickly succumb.Single-Player Campaign  In Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts, the British play a part in both available Single-Player campaigns: The Liberation of Caen, and Operation Market Garden.Liberation of Caen  The Liberation of Caen campaign covers four different operations carried out by British and Canadian forces as part of their attempt to take the city of Caen and pave the way for the Allied forces to break out of the beaches of Normandy. This campaign combines the real-life events surrounding Operation Windsor, Operation Charnwood, Operation Jupiter and Operation Goodwood. During this campaign, the British encounter opposition from various SS forces, represented in the game by the Wehrmacht faction (with several Panzer Elite units making guest appearances). At the start of the Campaign, the British take the town of Authie, south-west of Caen, against light enemy resistance. They proceed to cross the river and capture the towns of Baron-sur-Odon and Tormauville on their way to the heavily-fortified Hill 112, as part of operation Jupiter (incorrectly referred to as \"Operation Epsom\" in the game). The British advance up the hill in the wake of a powerful \"walking barrage\". Once captured, a Scottish artillery battalion sets itself up on the hill to provide supporting fire for further operations. Next up, British Commandos proceed to land in and around the Carpiquet airfield on the outskirts of Caen. Taking control of the area in front of \u00a0he airfield, they link up with Canadian infantry to secure a line of fortifications outside the airfield's perimeter. The Germans launch a last-ditch counter-offensive in an attempt to break out of the base, but the British manage to push into the airfield and destroy the German bombers before they can take off. (In the real world, the SS forces evacuated the base overnight, leaving it to fall into Canadian hands with little fighting in the morning). As Carpiquet airfield is being secured, the British receive word that the Scottish artillery on Hill 112 has been decimated by a German counter-attack. They return to the hill and fortify it and the bridges over the Odon river against a night-time German attack. Following a gruesome battle, the way to attack Caen itself is now clear. As part of operation Charnwood, the British make their way into Caen, much of which had been reduced to rubble by a massive allied air raid. They establish a forward base in the ruins of the local castle, and begin pushing into the city. The Germans provide stalwart opposition by ambushing the British forces as they make their way through the rubble, and eventually the Allies must call in a second airstrike to remove an impenetrable line of German defenses. The British then proceed to take the majority of the city, and fortify it against the German night-time counter-attack, lead by heavy Tiger tanks. With Caen now firmly in their grasp, the game skips a few days forward to the British attempt to secure the high ground south of the city, in Operation Goodwood. With a German Panzer Division parked on the ridge at Bourgu\u00e9bus, the British must capture the towns of Soliers and Fours, and hold them against a several powerful Panzer group charging down off the hill. They then take to the offensive, scaling the ridge and confronting the heavy Panzers protecting it. With Bourgu\u00e9bus secured, the Allies have finally liberated the Caen region, and allied forces can now begin mustering an offensive to break out of Normandy and drive on towards Paris.Operation Market Garden  During this campaign, the player controls the Panzer Elite Division known as \"Panzer Lehr\", as it struggles to protect a series of bridges in The Netherlands from an airborne British and American assault. In this campaign the British are the enemy. Using para-dropped Commandos, they quickly secure several bridges, including the bridge over the Rhine. Another British and American force is making its way up from Belgium in an attempt to link all of the bridges together to form a single highway through The Netherlands and directly into North-West-Germany. Panzer Lehr division spends this entire campaign attempting to root out the British Commandos and halt the advancing armor before it can reach German lands. Surprisingly, during the campaign, the British use very little of the strategies for which they've become notorious in the Skirmish and Multi-Player battles. They rely almost entirely on continuous flooding with both airborne troops and tank columns, rather than establishing defensive fortifications. The only time they are actually playing to their strength is during their defense of Arnhem, in which they use several captured German emplacements (especially 88mm Flak 36 cannons). More often, you'll encounter British Royal Commandos Support troops, which can appear out of nowhere to disrupt your attacks. For more information on this campaign, read the Panzer Elite article.Company of Heroes: Eastern Front  Company of Heroes: Eastern Front is a fan-designed modification for Relic Entertainment's critically acclaimed real-time strategy game Company of Heroes. Set in the late Eastern European theater of World War II, the mod primarily features the Soviet Union's Red Army and Nazi Germany's Ostheer.The Mod  This free mod offers a fully-packed Soviet faction and an Ostheer faction to play. The mod itself does not overwrite the base game. People can thus play with all six armies at once. Players must have the Company of Heroes New Steam Version to be able to play this mod.Red Army  The Red Army is a completely new Allied faction that fights against the Axis faction. HQ: T1: Red army mustering tent (100 \u00a035 ) T2: Soviet support barracks (200\u00a00\u00a0) --> infantry upgrade (needed for recruiting the following units): --> support weapon upgrade (needed for recruiting the following units): T3: Russian Tank Hall (200 \u00a055 ) Unlocking both upgrades grants the Soviet player access to the Breakthrough Tankovy upgrade which unlocks the mighty IS-2 Heavy Tank.Doctrines  Doctrines are, as they are called 'Strategies'.Reward units  Also, it adds a number of new Reward units:Singleplayer  A full single-player campaign for the Soviets is planned as a future update for Eastern Front. It would cover various stages of the Eastern Front campaign, such as the Battle of Bialystok-Minsk, the battle for Sevastopol, the encirclement of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad, and the Battle for Berlin.Multiplayer  Because of Relic's online system the new factions will not have online Ranks and stats for the same reason the factions can't re-crew and retreat. (Update: The new factions can now retreat and recrew.) You can play as the Soviets online versus people who have Eastern Front installed and patched. The same will be for the future Ostheer.See also External links Tiger  The Tiger is an Axis heavy vehicle that is featured in Company of Heroes. It is well known for its ability to take and deal heavy amounts of punishment as the end-game unit for the Wehrmacht Blitzkrieg Doctrine.Overview History  The Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. E, usually just known by its nickname \"Tiger\", was one of the most powerful tanks to see action during World War II. Conceived as a result of the heavily armoured Soviet tanks encountered on the Eastern Front, Such as the T-34/76. It completely outclassed all existing tanks in the world at the time of its introduction. It's incredibly thick armour was virtually invincible to all known anti-tank weapons at the time - even from the sides and the rear - and it's infamous \"88\" KwK36 gun was capable of engaging and destroying virtually all targets at ranges well in excess of 2km - there were recorded kills at 4km. The Tiger served extensively throughout the war as a battlefield superiority weapon and an armoured breakthrough vehicle. From the Eastern Front, to North Africa, to the Battle of Normandy, it was the spearhead of the German Army. Legendary tank aces such as Michael Wittmann and Kurt Knispel were born in this tank.In-game  In-game, the Tiger is actually fairly accurately modelled: It's the alpha dog, with only a very few other tanks being slightly better than it. It commands heavy armour with its only real threats being the M26 Pershing and the M1 57mm Anti Tank Gun. With the addition of the Opposing Fronts expansion, this list spreads out to include the Firefly. It is only available with the Wehrmacht's Blitzkrieg Doctrine. It is decently fast (just as in real life), and armed with coaxial and hull-mounted MG34 light machine guns to counter infantry attack. They unfortunately lack suppression though, lending to them having marginal effectiveness. The 88mm main gun easily penetrates nearly all Allied tank armor, dealing fairly heavy damage: The only tank that can withstand its gun is the Allies M26 Pershing. Any conventional AT weapon will have a hard time knocking out the heavily armored Tiger (unless used in large numbers), due to the fact that even though some weapons outside of the M1 57mm and the Pershing's 90mm gun can penetrate, they do so sparingly and will usually bounce off its front armour. Tanks like the M4 Sherman, Cromwell Tank and M10 Tank Destroyer stand little chance against the superior armed and armored tank (unless used in conjunction with infantry or in numbers) making it a pretty nasty vehicle to deal with, even if operating alone. The Tiger can be an excellent heavy support vehicle for infantry and tanks, providing fearsome anti-infantry, anti-tank and anti-fortification fire. Most Axis Commanders intend to use it as a spearhead, storming into the battlefield and crushing any resistance, both man and machine. If well supported by infantry such as Grenadier Squads & Stormtrooper Squads, the Tiger can dominate the battlefield with its superior firepower and armor protection. If a Wehrmacht Commander utilizes the Blitzkrieg Assault ability, the Tiger will receive greatly increased movement speed and rate of fire, lending it a surprising amount of agility and further increased firepower. The Tiger is truly a foe to be feared.Weapons 88mm Kwk 36 L/56  The Tiger's main weapon is the tank version of the feared 88mm Flak 36 AT/AA Gun, the 88mm Kwk 36 L/56. It is among the most powerful tank guns ever fitted into a rotating turret in World War II. The weapon deals 137.5 HP per shot and has a reload rate of 6 seconds.7.92 mm Maschinengewehr 34  The Tiger's secondary weapon is the predecessor of the feared Maschinengewehr 42, the 7.92\u00a0mm Maschinengewehr 34. Each hit deals up to 6 health, with the reload rate being only 3 seconds. It fires 15-30 bullets before it reloads again.Tips Veterancy  The Tiger is classed as a heavy vehicle, and gains veterancy through researching Tank veterancy upgrades available at the Kampfkraft Center. If the Tiger is lost, a new one will still have these obtained upgrades. Note that older versions of the game will have a Tiger Ace available for 1000\u00a01,000; this is a slightly different unit from the Tiger in the final version of the game, and does not receive upgrades from the Kampfkraft Centre as it is already completely upgraded - hence its name, \"Ace\". These bonuses are cumulative to each other:Tiger campaign use  The Tiger serves as a formidable foe for Able Company. It was first seen in action in the last two missions during the Falaise Pocket, starting with the Autry mission. Joseph Gunter Schultz and his Tiger Ace tank along with a few other Tigers was sent to guard the escape route in this mission. Captain Schultz's Tiger tank in particular is incredibly tough as it has twice the amount of hitpoints of the average Tiger tank and is equipped with a smokescreen. It also has a surprisingly short repair duration similar to a normal Tiger tank. Able Company will usually have a hard time during this mission. During the last mission-Chambois, the German Seventh Army makes its final attempt at escaping the Falaise Pocket. When Able Company successfully captures all strategic points and closes the road the German Seventh Army sends Tigers in an attempt to reopen it. Able Company must destroy all the Tiger tanks and close the road of Chambois, cutting off the only escape route of the German Seventh Army.Weakness  No matter how dangerous the Tiger can be it still requires large amounts of manpower resources to deploy. And only one is available to be deployed on the battlefield at any given time per commander. Since it is a slow moving tank it can be easily ambushed by the weaker but faster M10 Tank Destroyer. The M26 Pershing can also be used as a shield for the M10. Large amount of AT weapons and tank fire concentrated on the Tiger could also knock it out. Most Axis Commanders will use Tigers as spearhead to the front, so it is advisable to deploy mines to badly damage it or better, making it immobilized. Tigers are also a tough tank to repair, so it is advisable to take out a Pioneer Squad using snipers and light weapons and then flank it and attack its rear armor. The Tigers armor was engineered to survive the impact of shells, not deflect them, allowing multiple successive hits to land, in contrast to the Hetzer and Jagdpanther where most shells harmlessly deflect. The Tiger is expensive and slow moving and should not be squandered by charging it mindlessly into enemy defenses. Losing a tiger is often a very costly mistake. However, Unlike the King Tiger, it is not a single use ability and can be replaced the instant you lose your current Tiger. Assuming you have the manpower.Tiger Variants  If you have the Wehrmacht army with Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts patches (not necessarily the actual game) and access to the Terror Doctrine, then instead of the standard Tiger Ace, you will have the chance to access the ultimate psychological weapon of terror - the King Tiger! Another variant of the Tiger is the Bergetiger, an unusual but highly important armor repairing and recovering vehicle. Variants not included in the game include the Sturmtiger, a Tiger assault gun with more armor and armed with a 380mm naval rocket launcher.Tiger Ace  The Tiger Ace commanded by Hauptmann Joseph Schultz in the original Company of Heroes. The Tiger Ace could be deployed with the original Tiger Ace ability (costing 5 command points) in the Terror Doctrine for 1000\u00a01,000. This Tiger \"variant\" was a repainted Tiger, but with various buffs. It had more protection, higher health (1500\u00a01,500, where normal Tiger has 1064\u00a01,064), higher accuracy by 50%, and penetration buffed by 2x. With later patches the Tiger Ace has been replaced by the King Tiger, and is no longer available in the game. The King Tiger possesses significantly more firepower than the Tiger I, though the king tiger is significantly slower than the Tiger I and unlike the Tiger I which can be replaced once destroyed, The King Tiger can be called in only once.Tiger Tank \"205\"  Tiger is back, as a campaign playable unit in Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor. Instead of playing the Wehrmacht Heer army, the campaign featured a single Tiger tank in which the Axis player can control its turret, direct fire control, switch firing shell types, and purchase and upgrade abilities similar to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II. This campaign, known as the \"Tiger Ace\" featured 5 veterans that fought in the Eastern Front and were redeployed to France to engage the Allied forces. The Tiger belongs to the 101st Tigergruppe, and is commanded by Major-General Maximillian Voss (from Opposing Fronts) and Hauptmann Josef Schultz (the antagonist of the original game). This Tiger is based on the real-life Tiger Tank 205, which was commanded by infamous Tiger Ace Michael Wittmann, or \"The Black Baron\". This tank actually did take part in the battle of Villers-Bocage, actually did destroy around 20 tanks before being disabled, and the crew did actually escape death, like in the game, though the events are dramatized for gameplay reasons.United States  The United States of America (or, the Americans) is one of the two factions featured in Company of Heroes. As one of the Allies, it leads the invasion of Nazi-Occupied Europe on D-Day, alongside the British army. The Americans are a very balanced faction, equally capable of both defense and offense, but excelling in neither. They are the only faction to have its own single-player campaign in the original Company of Heroes.Overview  The United States is one of the Allied factions in Company of Heroes. Their massive war machine fuels the invasion of Nazi-Occupied Europe, bringing with it enough fresh manpower and firepower to relieve the Wehrmacht of its earlier conquests. American soldiers may not be the most experienced, but they are highly motivated and outnumber their enemy and enjoy the virtually endless supply of equipment, weapons and assets brought over the massive convoys traveling daily across the Atlantic Ocean. American soldiers also learn quickly, as they have the most potent veterancy bonuses in the game. The potent veterancy upgrades as well as actual equipment upgrades makes American infantry versatile, and superior to Axis variants in the late game. The Americans field a rather limited variety of units, but nonetheless have at least one unit for any battlefield role. Thanks to their large number of fresh conscripts, American Infantry units are extremely cheap and easy to replace, thus forming the back-bone for their entire army. American Vehicles, though expensive, keep a very good balance between offensive firepower, mobility, and protection. Overall, this faction combines good defense with good offense, concentrating on whichever is most important at the time. Of course this also means that they excel at neither option, but rather strive to find the right balance between them. Their Command Trees also refrain from putting too much emphasis on either of these options, resulting in a faction that can easily adapt to the changing situation on the battlefield. In their single-player campaign, we follow the American army's Invasion of Normandy, as it struggles to establish a beach-head and later break out into the French mainland. Different American companies are portrayed, each assisting the invasion in its own fashion, from the infantrymen assaulting the beaches to the Airborne troops landing behind enemy lines, and finally the Armor Company making their break in-land. Additionally, the American Airborne Divisions play a significant role in Operation Market Garden, the Panzer Elite single-player campaign in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts.Basic Force Composition  The American army fields 12 different types of units, with 3 infantry squads, 3 heavy weapon teams, 3 vehicles and 3 tanks. In general, these units cover the entire spectrum of basic battlefield roles, giving the American army the ability to remain as versatile as possible, and specialize only when required. This is further augmented by a light-but-useful variety of Defensive Structures. Unfortunately, no unit is an expert at any specific role, which means that American units always need to work together to overwhelm the enemy, as they will often lose in one-on-one confrontations with similar Axis units. American force build-up is very simplified and straightforward: Infantry are available en-masse in the early game, then they become supported by heavy weapons, then medium vehicles begin to arrive to provide a better mobile defense, and finally tanks enter the field to supply an armored punch. As a result, American tactics often change during the mid-game from relying on their Infantry-centric (mostly defensive) force to relying on stronger (mostly offensive) tank groups. The cost of American units also factors in strongly here, with infantry being remarkably cheap and expendable, while vehicles are expensive and difficult to replace.Infantry Squads  The Americans have only two basic infantry squads, but these form the core of the entire American army for a large proportion of the battle. Cheap and expendable, they go into battle again and again, putting continuous pressure on the enemy. These two squads will often make up the bulk of American units through the early and mid-game, with other units created to support them during both offensive and defensive work. Almost all American strategies revolve around Riflemen Squads leading into battle, and keeping an enemy force in place while other units destroy it. Engineer Squads, of course, build all American base structures and are in charge of putting up the defensive obstacle course that protects their territory. Later on, Engineer Squads become important for maintaining the growing vehicle fleet. The Riflemen Squad lose some importance - though Veterancy and captured equipment can keep them useful alongside the tanks for a long time.Support Infantry  The American army relies on several support weapons to assist his core units during the early game. Most are carried by specialized infantry. There are 4 such infantry-operated weapons: These units have little combat value on their own, as they will be easily destroyed by any varied enemy force. In support of infantry or other units however, they can be a devastating addition of firepower. The first three are produced by the Weapons Support Center, making them available rather early in the battle - again, to give aid to the Riflemen Squads and the Defensive Construction. The M1 57mm Anti Tank Gun is produced from the Motor Pool and thus will appear around mid-game - remaining useful for some time, especially in defensive operations.Light Vehicles  The only true American Light Vehicle is the Jeep, available almost immediately, from the Barracks. This fast attack car is an excellent scout, capable of \"hit-and-run\" reconnaissance inside enemy territory. Not really used as a weapon, so much as a tool. Also makes a great patrol vehicle for covering ground and looking out for enemy infiltrations.Medium Vehicles  The two American Medium Vehicles make their appearance during the mid game. They are used mostly as support weapons, to assist American infantry and later armor, or provide a strong mobile defense. Both vehicles are relatively cheap, and used primarily to support infantry or tanks during the mid and late game. They help deliver sudden strikes against the enemy. A main battlegroup supported by these two vehicles can last significantly longer in combat - if they are properly used.Heavy Vehicles  The basic American company has access to three very different tanks, which make up its armored core: American tanks often operate together, in mixed groups (possibly with infantry) and assisted by Medium Vehicles. Though not as strong as some Axis tanks, they use cunning and speed to envelop and destroy the enemy. With an M4 Sherman at the front, the other tanks simply swoop into flanking positions. Enemies cannot last long against this smart application of force.Passive Defenses  American defenses consist mostly of elaborate obstacle mazes. They create these at the entrances to their territory, delaying the enemy and receiving early warning before any attack. These obstacles are often used in unison, creating elaborate traps to lead the enemy into. Although they won't stop an enemy army cold (unless constructed very densely over a long period of time), the delay is often long enough to enable American mobile units to respond to any attack. Finally, another Passive Defense that operates differently from the others: The Americans will strive to put one of these on any resource-producing sector, and any sector along the front lines. This has important benefits both to the American economy and the security of their territory.Active Defenses  The only non-mobile defensive weapon available to the American army is the Machine Gun Emplacement. The Americans build Machine Gun Emplacements along their front lines, to protect against enemy infiltrators. A single emplacement can defeat large numbers of enemy foot soldiers, though it stands no chance against an armored vehicle. This structure is often used in conjunction with obstacles, to create a kill-zone. While it fights the enemy, other units can respond to provide more firepower in its defense.Other Structures  The Americans can build two other important support structures not listed above. While not absolutely necessary, both structures can provide useful assistance to American operations - particularly Infantry operations in the early and mid game. They mostly help keep the infantry force well-supplied and healthy, thus helping keep constant pressure on the enemy - or at least a constant defense force.Veterancy  American Veterancy is the simplest and most straightforward Veterancy system of any faction, and as such is used as the basis for comparison between all Veterancy systems in the game. American units gain experience points during combat, when they kill enemy units. An American unit gains 100% of the experience value of its target, and passes none of it to other units. Therefore, all units must do combat in person in order to gain experience. When enough experience has been collected by a unit, it goes up in Veterancy level - immediately receiving a set of bonuses. There are three Veterancy levels, and therefore three sets of bonuses to be won through combat experience. The bonuses are pre-determined in the game files, tailored to augment a unit's performance based on its specific needs. Therefore, units of different types receive a different bonus at each level. For example, at each level, Riflemen Squads receive a slightly different bonus from Engineer Squads, because they have different needs; And the bonuses given to an M4 Sherman tank at each level are completely different from either of these. Each unit's article outlines its particular bonuses. American units reaching Veterancy Level 3 are therefore quite dangerous - and very valuable. Even the normally-cheap Riflemen Squad, expected to die in combat often, become deadly with enough Veterancy and therefore worth keeping alive as long as possible.Style and Strategy  When looked at in the simplest terms, the Americans use a very balanced mix between defensive and offensive capabilities. They can easily and smoothly shift between protecting their territory and launching attacks on the enemy. Most American units are suitable for either role, so even individual units can shift between offensive and defensive roles quickly during the battle, as necessary. This flexibility is what makes the American army strong, and needs to be exercised often in order to win. On the other hand, the American army excels at nothing. It has neither the heavy defenses of the British, nor the heavy firepower of the Axis companies. It can never rest safely behind fortifications - a mobile defensive force must be on-hand to take on any enemy that tries to steal American territory. While attacking, small gains by the Americans are usually the only possible way forward. Fortunately, American units can usually keep whatever they manage to seize, thanks again to their ability to switch from an offensive to a defensive role immediately after combat. All American strategy is bound to a rather linear progression in unit production. The Americans must initially produce a sizeable Infantry force, which may sometimes be used well into the late game. Normally however, the infantry force will become supported by Medium Vehicles about halfway through the battle. Finally, tanks will enter the field, providing the required firepower to forcibly take chunks of territory from the enemy. Although this progression is not absolutely fixed, the cost of American units helps to enforce it. Basic Infantry squads are dirt-cheap for this faction, and can produced in large quantities. Vehicles, especially tanks, are prohibitively costly in the first half ot the game - so even if they become available, they're not very affordable. Nonetheless, flexibility with production, just as with tactics, can yield a lot of interesting ways to play this faction. Each of the sections below lists an alternate strategy that can be used when selecting a different line of advancement through the production tiers. These are usually more difficult to pull off, and require experience with the game - but can yield very powerful results.The Land Grab  At the start of the battle, the American player has one Engineer Squad and the ability to make more at the American Headquarters Already, the American player is in a serious dilemma: How to be prepared for first-contact with the enemy. On the one hand, Engineer Squads can start capturing territory straight away - but on the other they will be largely helpless against any enemy unit they meet. Therefore, the player has to ask himself these questions: If this problem is not considered properly, the Americans can lose a lot of the ground they've captured once contact with the enemy is made. They may lose a few Engineer Squads as well, if they're not careful! Normally, this leads players to the early (sometimes immediate) construction of the Barracks. This base facility will provide cheap and survivable Riflemen Squads to take over as land-grabbers. They capture sectors very quickly, and can defend themselves if necessary. Riflemen Squads can hurry forward to make contact with the enemy or even capture some very forward sectors, while Engineer Squads can take care of sectors closer to the HQ, linking up territory as they go. Note however that the Americans should not rush to capture anything they cannot easily defend! If Riflemen Squads make contact with the enemy, they can usually repel him. Advance no further - this is your basic front line for this battle! Once it is established, and assuming the Americans have grabbed a sufficient amount of land so far, they can begin fortifying it with obstacles. Engineer Squads will usually do this, under covering fire from Riflemen Squads. Resources permitting, mobile defense riflemen should already be patrolling along the gaps between these obstacles, to make sure the enemy doesn't try anything sneaky. The construction process will usually go on for a while. Machine Gun Emplacements must be set up to defend the weakest spots - preferably two or three sectors each, if at all possible. More importantly, both Engineer Squads and Riflemen Squads need to get to work setting up Observation Posts on the highest resource-producing Strategic Points, as well as on the most threatened front-line points. American units performing construction are very vulnerable, which means that the Americans need a way to keep the enemy from attacking them. Fortunately this is faction that can easily go from defense to offense, so the best way to stop an enemy attack is simply to attack them first. This will buy time for construction work to proceed.Infantry Skirmishes  With a defensive line being built, and strong enemy units appearing, it becomes necessary to pre-emptively attack the enemy on his own ground. This is when the Americans enter their Infantry Skirmish phase. For this you'll need sufficient Riflemen Squads out near the front lines, and (if possible) additional Support Infantry. With these, the Americans begin making forays into enemy territory. Make shallow attacks on exposed Strategic Points or weak enemy positions close to your front lines. Get the infantry in, take cover positions, and make flanking attacks on the enemy defenders if necessary. The goal is to cause as much damage as possible in a short amount of time. At this point, assuming your units were victorious, you need to make an important choice: Do you try to hold the ground you've taken, or retreat and regroup? American defenses are rarely powerful enough to hold back an Axis force on their own, so while you are busy attacking the enemy, he is usually busy setting up a powerful counter-attack against you - either against the sector you've just captured, or against a completely different section of your line. Therefore, you need to decide whether you want to risk your units trying to capture and hold the new territory, or retreat to reinforce your line. If you've made a serious impact on your attack, you may wish to capitalize on it and hope the enemy counter-attack will not be too powerful. Otherwise, the enemy will likely respond with great force, and trying to fortify this territory will leave the remainder of your line exposed - especially if the enemy is on the way to acquiring Medium Vehicles, against which your defenses can do little. If you decide to retreat, send your units back to the nearest reinforcement point and spread them back along on the defensive line immediately. This ends the raid, hopefully with sufficient damage done to the enemy during the initial attack, with the Americans now ready to repel the enemy. When you feel confident enough, simply make another raid and another, until the Infantry Skirmish phase ends with the introduction of American medium or heavy vehicles. If you decide to try and hold your new land seizure instead, send one unit to work grabbing the Strategic Point while the others get into defensive positions. It's often best to set up some Passive Defenses around the Strategic Point before starting to capture it, if you have the ability to do so, since you'd probably prefer holding the sector physically than capturing it only to quickly lose it to an enemy counter-attack. Defend your position valiantly, killing as many enemy units as possible. Don't worry too much about losses among the Riflemen Squads, as these are cheap to replace. Do try to keep more expensive units safe (like the HMG Team). If you can defend the sector adequately against the counter-attack, waste no time expanding into it. Again, remember that if you keep your entire attack force here for a long time, an experienced enemy will simply attack and overwhelm another point along your line, essentially trading sectors with you. Try to feel the right time to withdraw some units to protect the rest of your territory. When making raids, attack in different locations each time, to keep the enemy guessing. Most importantly: Never go deep into enemy territory during a raid - Axis mobile defenses will simply surround and destroy your units. During this phase of the battle, try to construct Forward Barracks near the most major hotspots - they will do wonders at this stage. A Forward Barracks can reinforce units returning from raids, so that they can regroup and return to their defensive duty as soon as possible. This way you can keep a strong defense even after heavy combat. If a unit is destroyed, the Forward Barracks may be able to replace it entirely (i.e. buy a new one). Again, the whole point is to keep the Forward Barracks close to the front lines, so that infantry squads don't need to retreat all the way to base to receive reinforcements, and new units don't need to travel all the way from the base to make a defensive stand. A Medic Station placed just behind the defensive line will do wonders for your economy. It will automatically create new Riflemen Squads, free of charge, as you lose the ones you have. By the end of this stage, you should have Machine Gun Emplacements covering the majority of your front lines, reducing the need for HMG Teams. Elaborate obstacles feed the enemy directly into the kill-zones, protected by Snipers, Mortar Teams and other infantry. The Infantry Skirmish phase is often considered over when the Tank Depot is constructed. Players hoping to make a Vehicle-centric force will end this phase with the construction of several M8 Greyhounds and M45 Quadmounts, starting to replace infantry with these fast, mobile units.Support Vehicle Stage  The first stage in the transition from an Infantry-based American army into a more well-rounded one comes with the construction of the Motor Pool. This often occurs during the mid-game, often actually marking the mid-game point. To get to the Motor Pool, the Americans must first construct a Supply Yard. This is very important, as it significantly increases Manpower\u00a0Manpower income, which will be necessary to field all the new units as well as prepare for the late stage tank-building effort. The Motor Pool unlocks the production of three new units: the M3 Halftrack, M8 Greyhound and M1 57mm Anti Tank Gun. These are all support vehicles, meant to work together with existing infantry units. They are not capable of taking the fight to the enemy on their own. During the Support Vehicle Stage, the American army goes to a stronger defensive position. At this stage, the enemy will often be equipped with much heavier weapons, possibly even Light Tanks (like the Ostwind Flakpanzer or heavier). The newly unlocked units will help the Americans maintain their line against onslaughts by these weapons. M1 57mm Anti Tank Guns greatly serve this purpose. Stationed along your defensive line, they can fend off enemy vehicles with ease. They must be used in conjunction with existing and new Machine Gun Emplacements, with this combination providing both anti-infantry and anti-tank firepower against invaders. M1 57mm Anti Tank Guns are placed in such positions where they can protect two or more sectors simply by turning to a new facing. Camouflaged Snipers out ahead of the lines can be deployed to increase the M1 57mm Anti Tank Gun's firing range, and to provide the necessary early-warning against enemy attacks so that these guns can be relocated and/or rotated to meet these attacks. The M3 Halftrack is also extremely important for defense, as it allows providing a much more mobile defense - by transporting the now-stronger American infantry units to any threatened sector along the lines. It also dramatically reduces recovery times after a major battle, by allowing infantry to reinforce quickly on the field without having to retreat to base or a Forward Barracks. M8 Greyhounds can be produced to provide your first actual mobile defense unit. Fast and aggressive, they are used to patrol American territory against both infantry and vehicles. Packs of M8 Greyhounds can surround and destroy an enemy vehicle rather easily (except heavy tanks, which often destroy them in one shot, unless upgraded). M45 Quadmounts, if they can be afforded, are even better at this job - tearing enemy infantry attacks to shreds in short order (and still providing reinforcement for infantry, though no transportation). Again, offensive options are rather limited, especially given the increasing power of enemy units. Axis mobile patrols at this stage often include heavier vehicles, and can destroy your raiding units fairly easily. Your primary options would be to use the well-equipped special infantry units bestowed by the selected Command Tree (see below), as these have a better chance against such vehicles. M8 Greyhounds can accompany an assault force for increased anti-tank firepower. M3 Halftracks can transport the entire force into enemy territory quickly, and provide reinforcements for the infantry while in there. If you really need serious anti-tank firepower on an assault, an M1 57mm Anti Tank Gun can accompany your units, but it is slow and vulnerable, and may not provide sufficient help. Fortunately, it can linger back a bit, since it has a very long firing range. All in all, during this stage you'll be busy collecting additional resources and protecting what you've got against a steadily-increasing enemy offensive force. The goal is to survive long enough to construct the Tank Depot, beginning the transition into the armored stage - the final stage of the battle. This often includes upgrading the Supply Yard at least once, to increase Manpower\u00a0Manpower income.Armored and Combined-Arms Assault  With the Tank Depot erected in the American base, the army finally has access to its heaviest and most offensively-oriented units - the three Sherman tank varieties that constitute its main armored force. By this time the Americans are usually on their hind legs, at best sending intermittent infantry raiding parties into enemy territory, and at worst busy fending off waves of Axis tanks. American armor is expected to turn the tide by providing both a stronger mobile defense as well as a powerful punching force to take the battle to the enemy. American tanks almost always operate in groups - whether large armor groups comprised of several tanks, combined-arms groups together with infantry, or full-spectrum groups containing a wide variety of American units (including medium support vehicles). The main reason for this is that none of the American tanks is particularly useful on its own, or provides solutions to every problem. The M4 Sherman is the closest it gets to an all-purpose tank, but alone is no match for the heavier Axis tanks. Therefore, assault groups are built with versatility in mind. The first step, naturally, is to get at least a few tanks out in the field - even to provide basic mobile defense. Construction priorities at this stage depend greatly on the type of force being fielded by the enemy: The M4 Sherman is the only tank which is capable of handling any target - especially when produced in large groups. However, it is the most expensive of the three available tanks, and is notably weaker than Axis armor until upgrades can be purchased at the Tank Depot to augment its combat performance. M10 Tank Destroyers, being the cheapest, are often produced first in order to counter Axis armor assaults, and provide fast and mobile Anti-Tank firepower on any attack. Nonetheless, their weak armor makes them less adequate for solitary attacks on enemy territory - they need to work in groups with other units that can protect them. Finally, the M4 Crocodile Sherman provides an interesting anti-infantry option. Virtually powerless against enemy vehicles, it can nonetheless incinerate enemy infantry both in the open and in any type of cover, and can turn buildings to rubble very rapidly. Again, due to a lack of anti-tank firepower, this tank is more suitable for combined operations with other units, especially anti-tank infantry. Once a group of tanks is available, they can be grouped together with or without additional units to create an assault force. There are many possible combinations for such a force, with the main goal being to create a team that can handle any kind of threat it encounters. No American unit is fully versatile, and they are all generally weaker than their Axis counterparts - but in groups they are very difficult to stop. A typical combined-force assault group will contain a couple of M4 Shermans and M10 Tank Destroyers, accompanied by infantry (either Riflemen Squads or M1917 Browning Heavy Machine Gun Teams, possibly others). M8 Greyhounds and M45 Quadmounts can be used to screen the flanks, fending off infantry and light vehicles. In a battle against infantry and/or defensive positions, the American infantry will often race ahead to do battle, while the tanks rain fire from behind. When enemy armor is encountered, the M4 Shermans will take up pinning positions at the front of the column, while the tank destroyers and anti-tank infantry make flanking maneuvers. During an assault, it is important to keep the group cohesive. Exposing the flanks or sending units too far ahead in chase of the enemy can result in the entire assault disintegrating and being picked apart by enemy mobile defenses. As long as the assault group remains cohesive however, it can literally continue from one sector to the next, obliterating anything it encounters. Infantry in the group will take points if necessary, possibly fortify them lightly, and then the group can simply move on to the next target. Engineer Squads may be required to keep the vehicles in good shape. If the enemy does not muster everything he has to push you back, it's possible to drive all the way up to the enemy base in this manner. If sufficient Population Cap\u00a0Population Cap is available, it may be wise to create more than one such assault group. This allows making two assaults at the same time, forcing the enemy to either split his forces (and thus be less able to stop you) or hit one group and then the other - buying you time to encroach on his base and cut his supply routes. Note that during this stage, you cannot let down your defenses for even a moment - it will be necessary to attack and defend almost simultaneously. Again, American assault groups are very good at switching right back to defensive activities if the enemy pulls a surprise out of his sleeve, so make good use of this versatility. Never fully commit to an attack unless you're willing to risk losing part of your front lines. Stay mindful of what the enemy is doing, and only go deep into his territory while your defenses are holding. Be content with small gains - they're better than nothing - but always be on the lookout for making sudden, larger gains as well.Command Doctrines  The Americans Command Trees are referred to as \"Companies\", as they simply augment the basic American force with additional support from other American companies in reserve. The three Command Trees are very arch-typical, each providing a very clear direction for American Strategy. On the left, the Infantry Company brings in support from basic but powerful ground assets, primarily increasing defensibility but not without offensive firepower. On the right, an American Armor Company will provide heavier units to field, and improves the performance and staying-power of all existing vehicles as well, making this a strong offensive option. Finally, the central tree provides aerial support from the Airborne Company and the U.S. Army Air Forces. This is a rather balanced option, but like most \"middle\" trees relies greatly on subterfuge and surprise attacks behind enemy lines, keep in mind though that several of it's abilities require a lot of munitions. The choice of Command Tree for this faction normally has surprisingly little effect on overall strategy, though experienced players can aggressively deploy the assets provided by these trees to create very focused, and sometimes very lethal attacks.Infantry Company  The American Infantry Company is a combined force containing expert infantry units. For the most part, this company actually improves the performance of existing infantry units, thus increasing reliance on infantry forces for the majority of the battle. Moreover, it provides some powerful off-map assets to help bring the enemy to its knees. To start off, this company increases the production speed of all infantry-based units (except the Motor Pool-produced M1 57mm Anti Tank Gun), allowing a steady stream of infantry to maintain defensive lines. Defense work is also augmented by the addition of Riflemen Squad defensive construction options, allowing them to do pretty much anything the less-powerful Engineer Squads do except repair. As a result, the army relies much less on Engineer Squads, freeing up Population Cap\u00a0Population Cap points for more powerful squads. Two artillery options are also opened for this company. One is a basic off-map artillery, costing 150\u00a0150 to use, and requiring line-of-sight to the target. This is only a temporary measure however, because a field artillery piece (the M2 105mm Howitzer) can be constructed soon afterwards, an emplacement with massive range and free howitzer barrages. This allows direct attacks at virtually all enemy units on the map - possibly even as far as the enemy's own base. Most Infantry Company commanders will, however, benefit most from the purchase of Ranger Squads. These tough infantry units, equipped with two M9 \"Bazooka\" rocket launchers, are some of the most powerful infantry squads in the game. Especially when used in large groups, these soldiers can lay waste to enemy forces, and can make significant advances into enemy territory and take on significant enemy forces. Finally, this company provides an emergency measure called Off-Map Combat Group, which will call in a randomized group of several infantry and/or vehicle units for a significantly reduced price. This can be used to create a sudden increase in firepower, either to protect the base in a pinch or reinforce a weakened defensive line. Overall, the defensive options and artillery make this command tree more useful for a conservative player who excels in protecting territory and keeping whatever he can acquire. However, make no mistake: the Ranger Squads unlocked here are extremely useful offensive units, who can make both small and large gains if used properly. Furthermore, the ability to bombard the enemy's base with masses of artillery can turn a strong defensive position into a battle-winning asset.Strategy  With the increased production and performance of infantry squads, it should be obvious that the Infantry Company relies much more on its infantry than its armored forces. In fact it is not uncommon for this company to forgo heavy vehicle production completely (though M3 Halftracks and especially M1 57mm Anti Tank Guns may still be crucial). The Infantry Company will usually try to grab a lot of territory with its initial Riflemen Squads or even support infantry units, and spend great effort to turn its front lines into a maze of obstacles and minefields that can easily be defended by these slow-moving units. Since replacing infantry is also easier, it should be no problem to maintain a strong presence along the front lines - even if this means constantly replacing dead Riflemen to maintain that presence. With a solid defensive line, the Americans need to decide whether they will spend their resources on producing large Ranger Squad groups, amass M2 105mm Howitzer field artillery emplacements, or combine both assets together. In both cases, large amounts of resources will need to be gathered before the Americans can make any significant advances into enemy territory. The artillery option may be a little more \"lazy\", but is extremely effective. M2 105mm Howitzers, if placed close enough to the middle of the map (and protected well enough by static and mobile defenses) can begin shelling the enemy base repeatedly. This economic warfare can actually bring the enemy to his knees, struggling to rebuild lost base facilities. This needs to be eventually followed up by some sort of powerful assault - possibly carried out by those defensive infantry/armored units freed up from defensive duties due to the general weakening of the enemy's attacks. The choice of Ranger Squad use is a little riskier, because Rangers are expensive but also fragile on their own. It may take some time to build a sufficiently large Ranger force that can go without fear into enemy territory to begin wreaking havoc. Also, reinforcing these rangers is very expensive, leading to long lulls between American offensive actions while this reinforcement is proceeding. Nonetheless, a large force of Rangers, especially when backed up with good support units, can literally fight its way straight through enemy territory, leaving nothing but destruction in its path.Airborne Company  The Airborne Company is a very strange Command Tree to choose, and a very demanding one. Unlike the other trees, it provides no benefit to any of the existing units, but rather provides a wide variety of useful off-map assets. As a result, the use of this command tree is recommended only for experienced players. First and foremost, the Airborne Company tree is all about attacks made on the enemy's rear. The epitome of this concept lies in the Airborne Squads: tough infantry with optional anti-tank capabilities, who can enter the map virtually anywhere (with the only requirement being line-of-sight to the landing zone). They can immediately begin causing damage to exposed enemy assets, capturing Strategic Points and fighting off enemy infantry as they go. Most importantly, these squads can reinforce anywhere - thus being able to keep fighting behind the lines rather than having to retreat to replenish their casualties. Airborne Squads can be further augmented with air-dropped M1 57mm Anti Tank Guns. Again, these can be placed anywhere, requiring only line-of-sight to the drop zone, and thus can provide crucial anti-tank support to the Airborne Squads. Crewed by airborne riflemen themselves, these guns are more formidable and can also reinforce anywhere. The Airborne Company provides an important and unusual service: converting excess Manpower\u00a0Manpower into Munitions\u00a0Munitions and Fuel\u00a0Fuel. This is done by dropping supplies and picking them up with infantry forces. The air-dropped packets also contain heavy weapons, which Airborne Squads can use to add variety to their attacks (assuming they can't capture such weapons from the enemy). Munitions\u00a0Munitions, in particular, will assist this company in paying for its other capability: air attacks. The U.S. Army Air-Force will dispatch P-47 Thunderbolt ground-attack aircraft on demand to assist the Airborne Company. The Thunderbolts can be used to make simple recon runs (revealing enemy territory), attack infantry and vehicles (using their cannons in a \"strafing run\"), or bombard and destroy a narrow strip of land. These runs are all very costly in Munitions\u00a0Munitions, but when used properly they can leave a whole swath of enemy territory in ruins. The use of surprise attacks, whether ground- or air-based, allow this company to keep its enemies on their toes, thus reducing the pressure on the American front lines. This usually buys time for the Americans to produce heavier assault force that can link up with the Airborne Squads to make permanent gains on the battlefield. Alternatively, Airborne Squads can sometimes link up into large, powerful units that can lay waste to the enemy's base in a surprise raid, essentially winning the battle in one surprise assault.Playing Against the Americans  Americans are all-rounders, but will rely mainly on infantry attacks and defences. If the American commander has chosen airborne company, be prepared for airborne attacks made by para-troopers after an air recon. You cannot starve them out of troops, as these will easily be replaced, so focus on strikes against medic stations and deny them the opportunity of manpower points. If the American commander did not choose to play as armoured commander, do not worry much about the enemy's armour. Nevertheless, keep a small reserve of tanks to combat the enemy tanks. If the commander has chosen to play as the infantry commander, they will almost certainly include rangers who are expert at destroying tanks. As the American faction are mostly all-rounders, you cannot expect them to play too defensive or too offensive, so you may find your initial plans ruined by them. Also, get rid of their engineers med-game to stop the construction of defensive structures. The main force, as earlier stated, will be made of riflemen. You can use this to your advantage. Though, ultimately, this may not lead to their or your demise. When you do prepare to attack, keep a strong defensive line as well, because the American commander may decide to attack your line as well.Gallery  I)Infantry Company: Choosing this company allows infantry and Weapon Team units to rapidly respond and deploy. This company also allows basic infantry such as Riflemen Squads to build simple defenses such as sand bags and barbed wire and allows Engineer Squads to build the 105mm howitzer. II)Airborne Company: Choosing this company will allow you to access the Airborne Squad, a group of elite infantry that can drop behind enemy lines. This company also provides airdropped Team Weapons and supplies. P-47 Thunderbolt strafing runs and bombardment become available through this company. III)Armor Company: This company emphasizes building up armor strength. Choosing this company allows you to repair all American vehicles without Engineer Squads and replaces them quickly if destroyed in combat. This company also allows light and medium vehicles such as M3 Halftracks and Jeeps to capture Strategic Points. Sherman Calliopes and the slow but powerful M26 Pershing can only be deployed through this company.Riflemen Squad  The Riflemen Squad is the core infantry unit for the Americans in Company of Heroes. Comprised of 6 men and initially carrying only semi-automatic rifles, this unit's primary advantages are its size and its low reinforcement costs. Like other core infantry units, the Riflemen Squad can receive several upgrades (all purchased at the Barracks) to enhance its combat capabilities, and eventually become a good general-purpose infantry squad.Overview  The Americans joined World War II over two years after it has started. They brought with them a very large number of fresh soldiers who, in 1944, constituted the majority of Allied troops landing in Nazi-occupied France. This surplus of able bodies is represented in Company of Heroes through the cheap, expendable Riflemen Squad. This is the core infantry unit around which all American strategy is based, at least until American tanks begin appearing in the battlefield. Riflemen soldiers are inferior to Axis soldiers at longer distances due to the modifiers on the weapons used. However, at medium and close ranges, a single rifleman is superior to a single basic Axis soldier such as a Volksgrenadier. American commanders moving up riflemen squads aggressively establish a positive kill/death ratio, which is devastating against the Axis commanders with the more expensive units. The Riflemen Squad is built at the Barracks for the price of 270\u00a0270, 6\u00a06. It is a 6-man unit, and as such is one of the cheapest infantry units available to any faction, whether going by total price or by the individual cost of each Rifleman. For example one single panzer grenadier is more than the price of two riflemen (at least before the patches). 5 of the Riflemen in this squad are equipped with .30 Cal M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles, designed for long- and medium-ranged combat. The sixth member of the squad is a sergeant, carrying a field radio backpack and an M1 Carbine \"short\" rifle. These weapons are somewhat superior, as the Axis factions use bolt action weapons. The 6-man unit size is also a great asset, as Riflemen Squads tend to win through outnumbering their opponents. The only non-American 6-man squad in the game is the expensive (though elite) British Commandos squad. The Riflemen Squad is designed to be able to perform many different roles on the battlefield. Aside from combat, they have the innate ability to capture Strategic Points at 150% the standard rate (i.e. 50% faster than the normal rate for most units), and can construct Observation Posts to protect captured sectors. Additional abilities, purchased as Global Upgrades from the Barracks, enable this squad to effectively engage enemy Weapon Teams, garrisoned Infantry, and even Vehicles. Most importantly, one of these Global Upgrades can outfit the unit with Browning Automatic Rifles, providing extra firepower at all engagement ranges, and allowing the unit to suppress enemy troops. Riflemen are individually weak in combat, and are expected to die fairly often. Fortunately, they are very cheap and fast to replace, costing only 27\u00a027 to reinforce a single missing man. The Americans have several abilities that support this way of doing battle, including massive increases to their own Manpower\u00a0Manpower income through the Supply Yard, the use of field reinforcements through M3 Halftracks and Forward Barracks, and so on. Therefore, the Riflemen Squads can put continuous pressure on the enemy through a seemingly endless supply of fresh troops. American strategy relies on this squad to serve as the lynch-pin for both its defense and offense throughout the early and middle portion of the battle. Other units are expected to provide support fire to the Riflemen Squads as they battle to seize and protect territory. When tanks roll into the battlefield, the Americans usually switch to using them as the core units, though Riflemen are still expected to lead the charge, expose enemy units, and provide overwhelming firepower in support of those tanks. Note that the Infantry Company Command Tree increases the importance of Riflemen Squads throughout the battle significantly. It involves them in defensive construction, and also speeds up their reinforcement rate to shorten the time they have to spend outside of combat.Weapons  When a new Riflemen Squad is created, 5 of its members are carrying .30 Cal M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles, designed to do prolonged mid-range combat with enemy units. The 6th man is carrying an M1 Carbine semi-automatic rifle, with similar properties. The M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) Global Upgrade, purchased at the Barracks, will equip this team with two of the eponymous LMGs, which are deadly at virtually any infantry combat range, and significantly increase this unit's usefulness. Like most other Infantry units, the Riflemen Squad can also pick up a wide variety of abandoned weapons, from automatic rifles and anti-tank launchers to heavy weapons like Mortars and Machine Guns..30 Cal M1 Garand  The .30 Cal M1 Garand is a fairly standard semi-automatic weapon. A basic Riflemen Squad carries 5 of these rifles. This slow-firing weapon is designed to kill infantry at relatively close ranges: about 10\u201320 meters, where accuracy is still somewhat lacking. Each shot hitting the target delivers 10 points of damage, so it would take about 6-7 hits to kill an enemy infantryman. The firing rate of this weapon leaves something to be desired, with ~2.5 seconds between each bullet. When compared to the standard Axis combat rifle, the Kar 98k, the M1 Garand is almost identical - except for one major difference: the Firing Rate (\"Cooldown\") modifier they receive based on range to target. At a range of 17 meters, about the average infantry engagement range, both M1 Garand and Kar 98k have a similar Firing Rate. However, the Kar 98k's firing rate doesn't change much with distance, while M1 Garand fires significantly slower at long range, and much faster at short range. As a result, Riflemen Squads won't do very well in long-range combat against a basic Axis infantry unit, having a much better chance if they can close the distance. The large squad size coupled with faster firing rate will subdue such an enemy - assuming the Riflemen can cover the distance without being seriously wounded first. Of course, coming closer is usually a bad idea if the enemy is armed with close-range or rapid-firing weapons like SMGs or LMGs..30 Cal M1 Carbine  The .30 Cal M1 Carbine (no actual relation to the M1 Garand, above), is a \"short\" magazine-fed semi-automatic rifle. One member of the Riflemen Squad, the sergeant, carries one of these by default. The M1 Carbine is less accurate at long range than the M1 Garand, but makes up for this with a slightly higher firing rate, and the fact that it doesn't need to be reloaded as often. This weapon also suffers a much smaller accuracy penalty while the squad is moving (the smallest penalty of all infantry weapons, actually). This gives it a slight advantage at close and medium range, where it can unload more bullets into the enemy. Unfortunately, the damage output of this weapon is also somewhat lower.M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle  The M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle Global Upgrade, purchased at the Barracks, will outfit each existing and future Riflemen Squad with two of these fully-automatic magazine-fed weapons - essentially early assault rifles. Though slightly less accurate than the M1 Garand, the Browning Automatic Rifle (or \"BAR\") fires 5-10 bullet bursts, making it a very deadly weapon. It can fire about 8 such bursts before having to be reloaded, and is quite fast overall anyway. The addition of two of these weapons makes the Riflemen Squad a very good anti-infantry unit, capable of overwhelming enemy infantry at most ranges. Though the squad will still lose out to SMG-equipped infantry at close range, it will nonetheless inflict serious casualties on the enemy. It's also important to note that the squad will retain the two Browning Automatic Rifles as long as at least two squad-members remain alive. Since these weapons constitute the squad's primary firepower, the loss of up to 4 infantrymen from a BAR-equipped squad does little to reduce its firepower. The enemy would have to kill at least 5 infantrymen to start making any serious dent the squad's damage output. Furthermore, this weapon allows the unit to activate the Suppression Fire ability, which will quickly suppress and/or pin-down enemy infantry, making them easier to kill. occassionally if the BAR armed Riflemen Squad gets close enough to an enemy squad, the enemy will\u00a0automatically be supressed. However this rarely\u00a0happens.\u00a0 This weapon is utterly essential to ensure that Riflemen Squads are not outmatched by enemy infantry in the mid and late portions of the battle, and it is probably the first upgrade that should be pursued. Note:  When an infantryman holding a Browning Automatic Rifle is killed, and there is no other squad-member available to pick the weapon up, there is a 20% chance of the weapon being dropped and becoming abandoned. Other infantry squads (friendly or enemy) can pick this weapon up if they have at least 1 Open Weapon Slot.Production  The basic Riflemen Squad can only construct Observation Posts. These structures protect a Strategic Point from capture, and enhance its resource output. The Infantry Company Command Tree can also unlock construction of four different Passive Defenses, allowing the Riflemen Squad to take over some of the defensive responsibilities of Engineer Squads by hastily constructing defenses to protect newly-captured sectors until such time that an Engineer Squad can be disposed to construct heavier defenses.Observation Post Barbed Wire  Barbed Wire is an anti-infantry obstacle. Infantry cannot pass through a piece of Barbed Wire, and have to go around it. Place Barbed Wire along infantry approach routes to funnel infantry into a killing zone, I.E. an area covered by machine guns and/or mortars. This ensures that the enemy cannot flank your positions, and has to come straight into your line of fire. Barbed Wire can be run over by almost all Vehicles without a moment's thought, so avoid placing it in areas where vehicles (both yours and the enemies) are likely to pass, or place Tank Traps in front of the wire to block vehicles as well. Also, remember that enemy Pioneer Squads can dismantle Barbed Wire.Sand Bags  Sand Bags are man-made cover for infantry. Infantry units behind sand-bags are said to be in \u00a0Heavy Cover, making them less vulnerable to direct damage and Suppression. And they are slightly less vulnerable to explosives and artillery fire compared to troops in the open. Like Barbed Wire, Sand-Bags also act as infantry obstacles. They are less useful though, since they give passing-by enemy infantry units a good place to take cover as they move, and so should not be used in this capacity unless you actually want the enemy to take cover there (to bombard them with a nearby mortar, for instance). Sand-Bags can be run over by all medium and heavy vehicles without a moment's thought, so avoid placing it in areas where vehicles (both yours and the enemies) are likely to pass. Sand-Bags are also quite easily destroyed whenever anything explodes near them.Tank Traps  Tank Traps are anti-vehicle obstacles. Light and Medium Vehicles cannot pass through them, and must seek another way around the obstacle - preferably into a prepared kill-zone covered by Anti-Tank guns and/or infantry. Most tanks are also stopped by Tank Traps, but Heavy Tanks like the Axis Panther and Tiger can crush Tank Traps quite easily by simply driving through them. Also note that your own M4 Crocodile Shermans upgraded with the Bulldozer can accidentally crush these traps too. Note however, that they can be destroyed not only by heavy tanks, but also by continuous artillery strikes. Since Tank Traps don't block movement for infantry, it's customary to place a line of Barbed Wire behind the Tank Traps. That way, vehicles cannot crush the Barbed Wire (they can't reach it), so this defensive setup will block anything but the largest vehicles. Unlike Wehrmacht Tank Traps and Panzer Elite Road Blocks, American Tank Traps do not provide any sort of cover to nearby units.Mines  Mines are powerful bombs that are buried underneath the ground. Whenever an enemy unit moves over a Mine, it will detonate with incredible force, usually destroying or at least heavily damaging the enemy. This specific type of mine is indiscriminate, detonating regardless of the type of enemy unit that passes over it. Therefore, both enemy infantry and vehicles will trigger the Mine. Your own units and vehicles can move freely over any mine set by friendly forces without detonating it. Mines explode at a radius of 8 meters, and inflict 100 points of damage. The damage is distributed nearly evenly across the entire explosion area, meaning that it will usually kill most or all of a triggering enemy infantry squad. Against vehicles, mines usually cause extra damage, and even if they fail to destroy the vehicle they will usually damage or destroy its engine, slowing it down considerably. Mines should be set as a preliminary defensive measure against incoming enemy attacks, while permanent emplacements are being set up, or as part of a more complex line of defenses. You can use Tank Traps and Barbed Wire to funnel enemies into a minefield. Note that Mines can explode if struck with enough force (for example artillery shelling), so it is possible to clear away enemy mines by bombarding them. Also, engineer-type units can dismantle mines, and there are several types of units that can detect them without walking over them.Abilities  Your first Riflemen Squads will have no combat abilities at all. However, up to three such abilities can be unlocked by purchasing the Global Upgrades available at the American Barracks. They expand the Riflemen Squad's combat options beyond basic infantry-to-infantry firefights, and enable them to contend against a variety of targets. Like all other American Infantry units, the Riflemen Squad can convert ambient buildings into Forward Barracks.Throw Grenade  When the Throw Grenade ability is activated, select any point on the ground. The Riflemen Squad will move to within 15 meters of that point, whereby one of the squad members will pull out a Mk.2 \"Pineapple\" Hand Grenade and lob it at the target spot. 1.2 seconds after the grenade hits the target, it will explode with a damage output of 60 - enough to kill an infantryman. The radius of the explosion is 4.5 meters, though the 60-point maximum damage is inflicted only on targets on top of the grenade itself. Other targets receive diminishing damage, down to only 20 points at the outer radius. Still, there is good likelihood to instantly kill any already-injured infantryman caught within the blast radius regardless of how far away he is. Due to the time it takes to throw the grenade, and the time it takes for it to detonate, this weapon is primarily useful against stationary targets, including infantry behind cover and inside buildings. Weapon Teams are especially susceptible to this attack, since they cannot quickly get away. In fact, this is one of the best ways to get rid of an enemy MG42 Heavy Machine Gun Team. Note that grenades do cause damage to vehicles, and have some (small) chance of destroying a vehicle's secondary weapon (if it has one) or damage its mobility. However, actual damage is negligible to vehicles, and significantly reduced against enemy armor. It's usually better to restrict the use of grenades to infantry targets only.Throw Sticky Bomb  When this ability is activated, select any enemy vehicle. The Riflemen Squad will move to within 14 meters of that vehicle, and throw an explosive device at it. The explosive, wrapped in cloth and covered with a sticky material, will remain attached to the vehicle until detonation. The fuse on the Sticky Bomb lasts 4 seconds from the moment it hits the target vehicle. When it runs out, the bomb will explode with a force of 100-150 damage points, directed entirely into the vehicle itself. Penetration is usually guaranteed, unless the vehicle is equipped with special Armor Skirts, in which case the bomb has only a 75% basic chance to penetrate the armor. In addition to straightforward damage, the bomb is almost guaranteed to damage the target vehicle's engine or render it completely immobile. Light vehicles might be destroyed outright, regardless of how much health they have left. The use of Sticky Bombs allows Riflemen Squads to assist in destroying enemy vehicles. By rendering vehicles motionless, it can also make them easy targets for other units, especially anti-tank units who can now fire at the target at their leisure. Note that once the Riflemen Squad reaches Veterancy level 2, the range of this bomb is increased to 20 meters. In other words, the squad only needs to get within 20 meters of the target vehicle in order to throw this weapon (instead of the default 14 meters). When in command of a large number of riflemen and they use the ability all at once they can penetrate even the \"vastly superior German Armor e.g the Panzer IV or even a King Tiger. Note that sticky bombs have a 100% accuarcy: once the bomb is thrown, it will go to stick to the vehicle objective, and no matter what the vehicle tries to do, the sticky bomb will find its way to the vehicle (making sometimes some very akward animations where a bomb flies in a curved direction). The only way for a vehicle to avoid being hit is to maintain enough distance from the Riflemen Squad so that they can't throw a sticky bomb.Suppression Fire  When activated, the Suppression Fire ability acts to significantly boost the suppressive potential of all the squad's weapons - primarily the BAR's, as it is the most rapid-firing weapon this team usually holds. This ability acts in two stages: For the first 7.5 seconds after the ability is activated, the amount of Suppression inflicted by each shot from this team's weapons is increased by a factor of 4 (i.e. 4 times as strong as normal). For the next 7.5 seconds, suppression is again quadrupled, giving a total of x16 the suppressive potential of the team's weapons. This will surely be enough to suppress any enemy infantry target that is not inside \u00a0Structural Cover. Firing rate is also doubled for the entire duration of the effect (15 seconds), meaning that the team fires twice as many bullets as it normally does. The soldiers still need to reload after the same number of bullets though, and reloading is not accelerated. The down-side is that throughout the entire 15 seconds, the team's accuracy with each weapon is reduced to 30% of its original value, meaning that most bullets will miss. However, thanks to the doubled firing rate, this does not amount to a significant reduction of damage, so it is still quite possible to destroy or at least severely damage the enemy squad while attempting to suppress it. This ability is extremely useful for performing \"Fire-And-Maneuver\" tactics: one Riflemen Squad suppresses the enemy unit(s), while another squad moves around to flank and destroy them from a different angle while they are suppressed. Always remember that units inside \u00a0Structural Cover are immune to Suppression.Upgrade to Barracks  When a Riflemen Squad enters a neutral structure that's inside captured and connected territory, this ability appears in that structure's menu. Activating this ability begins a 30-second upgrade period, at the end of which the building will be converted into a Forward Barracks. A Forward Barracks has two functions: reinforcing infantry, and constructing new units. Reinforcement here works the same as it does at the American Headquarters: any infantry units which have lost one or more men can move to within 25 meters of the Forward Barracks, and will be able to replace any lost men for a nominal cost. Unit production is possible here as well. Initially, the Forward Barracks can only produce new Engineer Squads. As more American base structures are constructed back at the HQ Territory, new production options will become enabled at the Forward Barracks: These units cost the same amount of resources as they do when produced from their appropriate base structures. They will appear next to the Forward Barracks when production is completed. Note that all unit production at a Forward Barracks is suspended if the sector it's in ever falls into enemy hands. You must recapture the sector to re-enable unit production. Also note that converting a structure into a Forward Barracks changes its ownership to American. The enemy cannot Garrison this structure with infantry. In fact, enemy infantry will be able to \"un-convert\" the structure back to a neutral structure, given time and opportunity, so you will need to protect your Forward Barracks from this possibility.Veterancy  As an American unit, the Riflemen Squad can gain three levels of Veterancy. Each level brings its own specific benefits, increasing the unit's combat potential and/or survivability.Accumulation  Like all other American units, the Riflemen Squad obtains Veterancy points by killing enemy units. It receives 100% of the experience value of each unit it kills. Once it has accumulated a sufficient number of Veterancy points, it will automatically advance to the next level, gaining the related bonuses immediately. American units do not share Veterancy points with one another. To receive points, the unit must personally kill an enemy unit.Bonuses  At each Veterancy level, the Riflemen Squad gains a specific set of bonuses as listed below. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. With the above Veterancy bonuses, the squad becomes significantly more valuable as a combat unit, capable of surviving far longer in combat and delivering much more accurate firepower - especially when coupled with the Browning Automatic Rifles weapon package. The cost of reinforcing a Veteran unit does not change, it combines these strong traits with constant reinforcements to become one of the best infantry units available.Tactics  Pinpointing specific strategies for the Riflemen Squad is difficult, as this unit is supposed to perform a myriad of different roles on the battlefield. Curiously enough, this isn't through a plethora of different abilities (like the Panzer Grenadiers) or through useful upgrades (like the Infantry Section), but rather through sheer overwhelming availability: Riflemen Squads are just cheap to build and cheap to replace, outnumbering the enemy and putting constant pressure on his positions. Therefore, at each stage of the battle, the Riflemen Squad is going to serve very different purposes, work with different units, and perform different activities. If straightforward analysis of the situation fails, you can always default to just sending masses of these infantrymen into combat and hoping they come out victorious.The Riflemen Platoon  A single Riflemen Squad may outnumber the enemy, but it is not sufficiently powerful to stand up to most enemy squads once they've acquired a few abilities, especially MG42 Heavy Machine Gun Teams and other anti-infantry units. To address this problem, consider pairing your Riflemen Squads into platoons: teams of two Riflemen Squads working together. This enables the use of \"Fire-And-Maneuver\" tactics, combined with the massive firepower of two infantry squads (12 men, if they fire all at the same time, they have to potential of doing 120 points of damage at the same time). One squad is charged with engaging and holding the enemy: they take cover, and begin firing their weapons at the enemy force to keep them busy. Meanwhile, the other squad maneuvers to a flanking position, opening fire at the enemy from a different angle - preferably one where the enemy does not receive protection from cover. This two-punch move is very effective against most enemy units, and can even be useful against machine gun fire - assuming the fire team has somewhere to hide. Again, casualties are to be expected, but then this unit is very cheap to reinforce, so don't take them too seriously. A Riflemen Platoon is less effective than a platoon made up of Panzer Grenadiers or other Axis infantry units, because it consists of only two squads, and hence is less flexible than a platoon consisting of three or even four squads. However, each squad contains 6 men, and thus is less likely to get completely wiped out while performing these maneuvers. Even if it is destroyed, replacing an entire squad is much cheaper for the Americans than it is for the Axis factions.Platoon Support Weapons  Naturally, adding support Weapon Teams produced by the Weapons Support Center can significantly increase the potential of a Riflemen Platoon. First and foremost of these is the Heavy Machine Gun Team, which serves as the stationary element in the \"Fire-And-Maneuver\" tactic. It can actually suppress the enemy in short order, allowing the Riflemen to flank very easily. A Mortar Team can also provide good support for a platoon - preferably two platoons at the same time (thanks to its great range). Once an enemy is suppressed, or forced to seek shelter in a building, they become an excellent target for the mortar. Additionally, smoke grenades can be used, what will greatly icrease safety of the Riflemen during performing maneuvers, and allow them to flank enemy positions relatively easily. Sometimes, seemingly \"harmless\" smoke grenades combined with Riflemen platoon may achieve more devastating results than normal mortar bombardment. Later on, other units can also work in support of a Riflemen Platoon, especially the M3 Halftrack (providing reinforcement, and able to ferry an entire platoon from one location to the next) and the M8 Greyhound (providing anti-vehicle firepower). Still, the basis of American infantry strategy all revolves around that basic platoon, with all other units supporting it. This persists until the introduction of the M4 Sherman tank, which (for some companies at least) then becomes the focal point of any attack.Early-Game Tasks  At the start of the battle, most players will use their first Engineer Squad to immediately construct a Barracks and begin creating Riflemen Squads, which they will use to capture sectors. The alternate approach would be to use Engineer Squads (producing a few extra ones from the American Headquarters) for this task, conserving resources. There are two main advantages in going for Riflemen Squads immediately: They capture sectors quicker (50% quicker in fact), and are much more likely to survive confrontations with enemy units once contact is made. However, Riflemen Squads cannot effectively hold sectors against enemies without support from Engineer Squad-built Defensive Structures. So although initial encounters may be favourable, reliance on Riflemen Squads alone may easily lead to losing some sectors in subsequent enemy attacks. Naturally, this is less of a problem for the Infantry Company, which can enable basic defensive construction for Riflemen Squads. With help from defensive structures and other support units soon to enter the field, Riflemen Squads can be very effective at defending your occupied territories well into the mid game. You can use down-times to place Observation Posts on the most valuable or vulnerable sectors - if you don't have enough Engineer Squads to take care of this task. Remember that Riflemen Squad reinforcements are cheap, but they need to maintain strong presence along the front lines, and so can't keep retreating every time a few men die. To solve this problem, construct at least one Forward Barracks close to the most vulnerable areas along your defensive lines, and pull Riflemen Squads there for reinforcement. Do not order them to \"retreat\", unless they are about to be destroyed, or else they'll just run all the way back to your HQ territory. Depending on your proficiency with infantry tactics, you may be able to construct Riflemen Platoons (see above) to actually take the fight into enemy territory. However, expect serious casualties unless you can provide ample support with other units - especially Heavy Machine Gun Teams.Mid-Game Tasks  With a more solid defensive line and a wide variety of units to support them, Riflemen Squads can now lay back and defend American territory against enemy incursions. It is often best to keep the infantry behind the defensive line, so that they can rush in with great numbers and \"save the day\". At other times, especially in sectors where a strong defensive line has yet to be constructed, Riflemen Squads should be placed behind Sand Bags at the front, to delay the enemy while other units move in to assist. Don't worry about losing Riflemen, and moreover don't worry about losing sectors either. In fact, it's sometimes better to entice an enemy to enter and capture a sector, only to surround and destroy him with a quick counter-attack. Attacks on enemy territory should be more difficult at this stage, because the enemy will be defending with powerful units - usually ones that can easily oppose even large groups of Riflemen. If you have good, well-rounded groups, supported by Weapon Teams and support vehicles, you can make small advances, but don't expect too much. Alternatively, it may be a better idea to make quick, sudden land grabs with one or two squads - just go on, take a territory, and come back out as soon as possible to resume defense. Unless the enemy is quick to react, the Riflemen Squad can at least neutralize a sector in short order, thanks to their 50% faster capture speed.Late-Game Tasks  Once a Tank Depot has been built, and tanks are beginning to roll off the production line, the role of Riflemen Squads is somewhat diminished. Instead of being the center of attack and defense groups, they are now themselves support units for the armor. Due to their low cost and ample numbers, Riflemen Squads are expected to lead assault columns. They'll be the ones making first-contact with the enemy, revealing enemy units and force compositions so that the tanks can array themselves appropriately before charging in. Most importantly, the infantry are tasked with shutting down anti-tank units and gun crews before the (expensive) tanks come into their firing range. Again, expect losses among the infantry, but they are expendable. Further, using Sticky Bombs, Riflemen can cripple enemy vehicles by damaging or even destroying their engines, especially effective against late game Axis tanks, which tend to be slow to begin with. In large groups, Riflemen can even threaten the most powerful Axis vehicles by throwing Sticky Bombs en masse, though this will cost a large amount of munitions. Again, note that for the Infantry Company, reliance on Riflemen Squads is usually warranted well into the late game. Instead of accompanying armor, the Riflemen are coupled with Ranger Squads, M4 Crocodile Shermans and M3 Halftracks to form a powerful fighting squad. Again, Riflemen are meant to take fire for the other units, buying them time to make flanking maneuvers. Reinforce at the Halftrack and keep pushing ahead.Weaknesses  Riflemen Squads have some of the weakest infantrymen in the game. Like all other infantry, they are vulnerable to pretty much any weapon, but especially any suppressive fire weapons like Machine Guns. Mortars pose a threat to infantry in cover, as do flamethrowers. The only weapon that has trouble at killing Riflemen would be an anti-tank gun, though even these are sometimes accurate enough to just snipe out your infantry one-by-one. However, as stated repeatedly during this article, Riflemen are some of the cheapest infantry available to any faction. They are expendable, and should be treated as such. That doesn't mean throwing them right into the chaos and letting God sort them out, but rather that you should count on reinforcing them after the battle, rather than saving every man. Don't retreat until you're about to lose a squad. Keep the Riflemen between the enemy and your other units - which are invariably more valuable than the Riflemen themselves.Quotes  When selected:                 After completed reinforcing: When issued with move order:         When Constructing Structures: When issued halt order:      When entering a building: When selected in combat: Quotes about capturing: When capturing abadoned heavy weapon: When wounded and under fire:                    When wounded and issued with attack order:    After destroying enemy unit: After destroying enemy unit, when wounded: When issued with attack vehicle order: When ordered to build passive defenses:      When pinned: When planting mines: Selected, when wounded:   While throwing sticky bomb: When activating suppressing fire, not in battle: Other:Trivia  In the first tutorial mission sergeant of the Rifleman Squad will use a M1 Thompson instead of a M1 Carbine.Vehicles  This category includes all articles about Vehicle units. A \"Vehicle\" is any unit that is mobile thanks to having an engine. Vehicles are further sub-categorized based on several factors, including the thickness of their Armor, as well as the types of obstacles they can drive through unimpeded.Jagdpanther  The Jagdpanzer V \"Jagdpanther\", or Jagdpanther Tank, is a unique heavy tank-destroyer fielded by the Panzer Elite Tank Destroyer Tactics company in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. The Jagdpanther is one of the most powerful units in the game. It carries a powerful anti-tank cannon mounted on a Panther chassis capable of easily piercing any Allied armor, front or rear, and causing massive damage. Only a single Jagdpanther can be deployed, after which the ability to summon it disappears.Overview  With the Tank Destroyer Tactics doctrine, the Panzer Elite can call in their most powerful weapon: the Jagdpanther (Lit. \"Hunting Panther\") Heavy Tank Destroyer. While it can only be called in once per battle, this single tank can change the balance of power with one swift stroke. To call in a Jagdpanther, the Panzer Elite player must first purchase the Jagdpanther Tank Destroyer Command Upgrade from the Tank Destroyer Tactics Command Tree. This unlocks a Command Ability called Jagdpanther, which will call in a single Jagdpanther tank when used. The ability costs 500\u00a0500 and 12\u00a012 to use. However, it will reduce your income by approximately -100\u00a0-100 for the next 5 minutes (or until the tank is destroyed, whichever comes first). All told, this tank costs about 1050 manpower total, but this is a small price to pay for such a powerful unit. Once a Jagdpanther has been called in, the Command Ability disappears for the remainder of the battle; you cannot call in a second Jagdpanther. This is similar to the Wehrmacht's ability to call in a King Tiger - if it's lost, you'll never get another one. There are several additional parallels between the Jagdpanther and King Tiger, as the two vehicles are very similar. The Jagdpanther is essentially a Panther tank that has been extensively modified. Firstly, the tank's main cannon has been replaced with an 8.8\u00a0cm PaK 43 Anti-Tank Cannon - a considerably stronger weapon that can easily pierce the front armor of any Allied tank, including the M26 Pershing. It also causes massive damage, almost twice as much as a normal tank's gun. Additionally, the Jagdpanther is fitted with thick, sloping armor. From the front, the Jagdpanther has the thickest armor of any vehicle, and can only be reliably pierced by the heaviest Allied anti-tank guns like the 17 Pounder AT Gun. It is therefore better armored at the front than a King Tiger. Coupled with the tank's massive 1600\u00a01,600 Maximum Health, it is one of the most survivable units available to any faction. The sides and rear of the tank are sadly less well-armored, and can be pierced by most tank guns, but again the high Maximum Health means other tanks would still take a while to destroy this juggernaut. The Jagdpanther is also quite fast for a tank of its size. A powerful engine can accelerate the tank to 5\u00a0m/s, slightly faster than most medium tanks. However, the tank is slow to accelerate to that speed, especially when it has to make a lot of turns. Furthermore, the turning speed of a Jagdpanther is poor, and this is very important to consider. The primary drawback of the Jagdpanther is that it has no turret. For the additional armor, the tank had to sacrifice its turret, having its gun mounted directly into the sloping hull. This means that the Jagdpanther can only attack targets directly in front of it, and the entire vehicle must turn to engage targets at different directions. This is very important because, as mentioned above, the vehicle's rear armor is significantly weaker than its front, making this tank easily-flankable. It must always be supported by anti-infantry units and/or faster tank-destroyers to protect it against flanking maneuvers. The Jagdpanther is used as the centerpiece in a massive assault. A large group of tanks headed by a Jagdpanther is all but unstoppable, as very few vehicles or even emplacements can stand up against it for long. This must be the Panzer Elite player's decisive punch, ramming through enemy defenses and quickly capitalizing on the tactical advantage to wipe the enemy off the map. Note that when fielding a Jagdpanther, the Bergetiger Repair and Recovery Vehicle becomes your second-most-important unit: Not only is it tasked with repairing the hulk during battle, but it can also bring the tank back to working condition if it is ever destroyed. This is the only way to get a \"Second chance\" with the Jagdpanther, since only one can be called-in per battle. As long as you can protect the Jagdpanther wreck from destruction, the Bergetiger can repeatedly restore it to working condition each time. However, also note that each time the Jagdpanther is revived this way, it will initiate a new period of reduced manpower income (-100\u00a0-100) lasting 5 minutes or until the tank is destroyed again. This is effectively the same as buying a new Jagdpanther (which is not actually possible without Bergetiger restoration).Weapons  The Jagdpanther is equipped with one of the best Anti-Tank cannons in the game, an 8.8\u00a0cm PaK 43. This weapon is mounted directly into the hull, and can only fire forwards. Additionally, the Jagdpanther has a token 7.92mm MG42 Light Machine Gun installed at the front of the hull. This can be used to kill infantry, though it is not an impressive weapon in any respect.8.8 cm PaK 43 Anti-Tank Cannon  The main gun on a Jagdpanther is an 8.8\u00a0cm (88mm) PaK 43 Anti-Tank Cannon - one of the best such cannons available to any unit. This is almost exactly the same weapon installed on a King Tiger - and that means serious business. Each shell fired by the PaK 43 delivers 165 points of damage to its target. With a blast radius of 1.5 meters, it will effectively damage anything it hits and as far as Penetration is concerned, the PaK 43 can reliably pierce through any armor in the game. It has an 75% basic chance of going through an M26 Pershing's front armor, the heaviest armor available to the Allies. Although penetration is reduced with increased distance from the target, this reduction is not enough to diminish the danger posed by this weapon to enemy vehicles. The PaK 43 fires one shell every ~ 8 seconds - surprisingly fast for a cannon of this size. For comparison, the Sherman Firefly fires once every 8.5 seconds - unless supported by a Cromwell Command Tank, and doesn't deliver nearly as much firepower. Unfortunately, the gun is considerably less accurate against infantrymen. It can still snipe an infantryman once in a while, but with a small blast radius it's unlikely to handle infantry very well. The only real downside to the PaK 43 installed on a Jagdpanther (as opposed to one installed on a King Tiger) is the lack of a turret. The gun can only traverse in an angle of 22 degrees to the left of right of the tank's current heading, meaning that it cannot turn to engage targets in other directions: the entire tank must (slowly) rotate itself towards new targets, thereby potentially exposing its weaker rear armor to other targets.MG42 Light Machine Gun  The Jagdpanther is also equipped with a 7.92mm MG42 Light Machine Gun, installed at the front of the hull. This is a relic from the Panther chassis on which this tank is built. The MG42 LMG is a standard weapon installed on many Axis vehicles, and has different properties depending on the vehicle and the installed position. Unfortunately, the MG42 installed on a Jagdpanther is a relatively weak weapon, and not very useful for the tank itself. This weapon fires in 15-30 bullet bursts, and inflicts 6 points of damage per hit. It is primarily used for killing infantry. Like the tank's primary weapon, it cannot swivel to attack enemies behind the tank. The MG42 can also be used to suppress enemy infantry, though this would take considerable prolonged firing.Veterancy  Like all other Panzer Elite units, the Jagdpanther can attain 3 levels of Veterancy, by accumulating experience points from the killing of enemy units. As it gains levels, its performance will increase proportionally.Accumulation  Like all other Panzer Elite units, the Jagdpanther uses the Panzer Elite Shared Veterancy system to accumulate Veterancy points. In this system, units share experience from their kills with each other, within a certain radius. Each kill the Jagdpanther makes will grant it 100% of the experience value of the killed unit. In addition, it will pass 50% of that value to any Panzer Elite units within 35 meters of itself. Vicariously, the Jagdpanther receives 50% of the experience value of kills made by other Panzer Elite units within 35 meters.Bonuses  Every time the Jagdpanther gains a level, you'll be asked to choose which Veterancy Upgrade you wish to apply to it - either a Defensive bonus or an Offensive bonus, but not both. You can choose a different bonus at each Veterancy level, if you want. The bonuses described below are specific to each level. Due to the way they are applied on top of each other, when computed together (see below) they may or may not add up as you may expect. When these bonuses are computed together with each other as well as the unit's basic statistics, the results at each level are as follows: * Click the button at the top-right corner to view the entire table. Selecting Veterancy bonuses for the Jagdpanther is a very important choice, since you will only have one unit and whatever you choose will last until it is destroyed. As with most other vehicles, the choice is very tough: either increase the vehicle's speed and toughness via Defensive Bonuses to ensure its survival, or increase its firing speed, accuracy and penetration to kill enemy tanks faster - the choice is always based on personal preference. Whatever you choose, like most other Panzer Elite vehicles, it's usually best to at least take the first level in Defensive Bonuses, because it has the most effect and increases the vehicle's chance to reach higher veterancy levels alive. One important thing to note is that when the vehicle is destroyed and recovered by a Bergetiger, it will return to Veterancy Level 0. This will allow you to change the previously-selected bonuses to fit a new situation. Of course, don't count on this happening - you never know if your Bergetiger will be able to successfully revive the wreck before the enemy destroys it.Tactics  The introduction of a Jagdpanther to the battlefield changes the entire balance of power. It is a critical moment in the Panzer Elite Tank Destroyer Tactics company's battle plan, and you must be well prepared to capitalize on your advantage with maximum efficiency. This generally means building up a sutiable support force for the tank, to be able to protect it from flanking maneuvers and powerful enemy units. Good intelligence (gathered via reconnaissance of the enemy's positions) will reveal the best point at which to deliver a decisive armored punch to the enemy, destroying a large number of his units to gain the upper hand. Once this is accomplished, waste no more time - wipe your enemy out immediately! One extremely important hint to remember is this: when the Jagdpanther enters combat, the most important unit other than itself is a Bergetiger Repair and Recovery Vehicle, which is tasked solely with repairing the Jagdpanther, protecting it from damage when necessary, and recovering its wreck if it is ever destroyed. This cannot be stressed strongly enough, since you cannot summon a second Jagdpanther once the first one has been called in to the battle.Armored Punch  The primary tactic involving a Jagdpanther, and for many players the only tactic, is the use of a powerful armored force to deliver a decisive blow to the enemy - one that will cripple him so thoroughly that he will not be able to resist any move against his base. To do so, you must first construct an armored force that is capable of supporting the Jagdpanther in its assault. The best units to accompany a Jagdpanther are those that can \"fill in\" the gaps in its capabilities, as well as protect its vulnerable flanks.There is no allied tank that can match the jagdpanther one on oneThe \"Panther Pack\"  One of the most deadly of Jagdpanther-related tactics is the creation of a \"Panther pack\": a Jagdpanther escorted by 2 Panther tanks. These three tanks pack maneuver together as one, to increase mutual protection and combined firepower. The pack could either be used as a breakthrough armoured punch, or as a heavy tank reinforcement to prevent an enemy breakthrough. The pack will utterly cripple all armour encountered: even the heavy M26 Pershing and (if you play the Eastern Front mod) the IS-2 will not stand a chance against these three tanks. Additionally, as they are armed with up to seven machine guns (assuming that both Panthers are at least at Veterancy Level 2), they are also potentially devastating against enemy Infantry.Repair and Recovery  The single most important unit in your army after the Jagdpanther is created would be the Bergetiger Repair and Recovery Vehicle. Though expensive, this is your only method to ensure that the loss of the Jagdpanther is either delayed or completely prevented. This is extremely important, because you only get one Jagdpanther per battle. The Bergetiger drives directly behind the Jagdpanther at all times, and is tasked only with repairing this tank. If you want to repair other vehicles as well, get a second Bergetiger - but always keep the first one for Jagdpanther support! You can repair the Jagdpanther continuously during battle - but make sure the Bergetiger is behind the Jagdpanther as it does so, to avoid being hit by enemy fire. The two units are vulnerable to artillery when riding in tandem like this, so keep an eye out for smoke signals or large explosions, and get the Bergetiger out of there if you must. If the Jagdpanther is destroyed, immediately surround its wreck with your other tanks to protect it. Make sure you do not crush the wreck by mistake while doing so!!! Once the wreck is protected from fire, you can drive the Bergetiger up and begin recovering the Jagdpanther. This may take some time - upwards of 1 minute - but if you allow the wreck to be crushed or destroyed by enemy fire, you'll have lost your only Jagdpanther permanently. Remember that the Bergetiger is a tough vehicle in its own right, being essentially an unarmed Tiger tank. If the Jagdpanther is close to being destroyed, consider driving the Bergetiger in front of it to physically protect the Jagdpanther as it withdraws from combat. You are better off losing a replaceable Bergetiger than an irreplaceable Jagdpanther! Hopefully, if you have enough additional tanks in support, you won't have to lose either of them. Remember to repair the Jagdpanther immediately once it is out of the battle zone.Weaknesses  Being one of the two toughest units in the game, there is little that poses a direct threat to a Jagdpanther. Even powerful Anti-Tank cannons that can pierce its front armor will take upwards of 10 shots to destroy the tank - by which time it can easily destroy the sources of fire. If it hits mines then it's at a heavy disadvantage because it won't be able to turn the body of the vehicle quickly enough, meaning you can use infantry squads with AT weapons to finish it off by targeting the flanks. Nonetheless, remember that the Jagdpanther's rear armor is weaker than its front. Almost all enemy tanks can pierce the Jagdpanther's rear armor reliably. This is compounded by the fact that a Jagdpanther's main cannon can only fire forward, which means that the tank must turn its entire hull to engage targets behind it, thereby exposing its rear to other units. Since the Jagdpanther has a very slow turning speed, it is very easy to flank. Protect its flanks and rear with other units at all times! Finally, the Jagdpanther's real worst enemy are mines. These can often cause damage to the engine or treads of the vehicle, rendering it immobile. When crippled this way, the tank cannot turn its cannon or front armor to protect itself, making it extremely vulnerable to flanking moves. Again - protect the flanks, scout ahead for mines, and keep a Bergetiger close by to repair any damage. One thing which most Axis commanders forget to take into account that even in the face of overwhelming numbers even the vastly superior Jagdpanther can only take so much of a beating before being destroyed.Quotes  When under attack: Unit selection when under attack: On unit selection: On move order: On attack order: When attacking a Sherman Firefly: When confirmed a kill:Stormtrooper Squad  The Stormtrooper Squad is a 4-man infantry unit fielded by the Wehrmacht Blitzkrieg Doctrine in Company of Heroes. Initially armed for infantry combat, they can be equipped with advanced anti-tank and anti-infantry weapons, which enables them to cause chaos in enemy territory. They are one of only two infantry squads in game which can use the camouflage ability.Overview  Stormtrooper Squads are one of the main elite soldiers that are made up of Waffen SS troopers called in by the Wehrmacht and can be used if an Axis Commander chooses the Blitzkrieg Doctrine. The Stormtroopers are assault based infantry, able to be used aggressively when attacking other infantry units. Stormtroopers are highly effective in groups from about 4 squads of stormtroopers when used aggressively. When called in, they are equipped with Kar98 bolt-action rifles, but they can be upgraded with StG44 assault rifles, making them highly effective against enemy infantry at medium to short range. They can also be upgraded with Panzerschrecks to take advantage of their reduced suppression against enemy armor. Additionally they can use a bundled grenade to eliminate clusters of infantry and emplacements. Stormtroopers are heavy infantry, able to take more punishment and less suppression compared to other infantry units. Stormtroopers also have the camouflage ability, allowing them to scout and sneak past enemy positions for ambush or reconnaissance purposes. Their ruggedness and variety of abilities and upgrades make them an excellent tank support unit, able to fight alongside armor, aggressively repelling anti-tank units. Their abilities also make them effective if fighting with other infantry units, especially Grenadier Squads, due to the wide-array of upgrades available to Grenadiers, making them able to overwhelm other Infantry units.Weapons  The Stormtrooper Squad is an elite infantry unit. Although their basic armament consists of only bolt-action rifles (excluding special abilities), they can have access to the best Wehrmacht equipment if the correct upgrades are purchased. This enables them to stay versatile, or be especially effective against specific group of units.Karabiner 98k  Initially, stormtroopers wield Karabiner 98k's, standard bolt-action rifles. They are well trained and are very dangerous anti-infantry unit even with their basic weapons. This rifle can fire five times before the weapon needs to be reloaded. Each bullet, which hits the target, inflicts 15 points of damage. Fire rate and accuracy are also solid. The interval between shells is about one second, which gives a very high damage output. At the maximum range, 35 meters, each bullet has a 45% chance to hit the target. At the normal engagement range, 20 meters, this value is equal to 65%. As with most small-arms, this weapon is less accurate when the squad is moving. For the best effect they should stand still when firing.STG44 Assault Rifle  The STG44 Sturmgewehr, famously known as the \"StG 44\", is the world's first assault rifle. Firing rapidly from a 30-round magazine, this weapon is superior to all Sub Machine Guns featured in the game, and is by far the best close-combat weapon available. STG44s fire in quick, 5-10 round bursts. Compared to the American M1 Thompson, they are quicker in both firing rate and reloading speed, more accurate (especially at close distances, where only 1 in every 10 bullets is a miss), and cause 7 points of damage per bullet compared to the Thompson's 5. The STG44 is even more stable than a regular SMG when the unit is moving, allowing it to remain accurate during a fast charge. In other words, any infantry unit caught in short-range of the STG44-wielding Stormtroopers will be destroyed very rapidly.Panzerschreck  The Panzerschreck is an anti-tank launcher wielded by infantry. It is available for Stormtroopers if the proper upgrade has been purchased. This is one of the best anti-tank weapons which can be used by infantry. Each Panzerschreck warhead inflict 120 points of damage per hit. Only one rocket can be fired before the weapon needs to be reloaded, which takes about eight seconds. The Panzerschreck isn't good as a long range weapon. At the maximum range of 35 meters, each rocket has only a 35% chance to reach the target. If the target is closer, the weapon will be more likely to hit the target, but then the squad will be exposed to more enemy fire. Panzerschrecks have no problem with armor penetration. The warhead is strong enough to damage most enemy tanks. However, this weapon may be sometimes insufficient against heavier targets like the M26 Pershing (45\u00a0% chance for penetration), or Churchill (52%).Abilities  The Stormtrooper Squad is a special infantry unit and has many combat abilities. The most iSTGortant is Assault Camouflage. Another one is Bundled Grenade, which is useful against infantry garrisoned in buildings and enemy fortifications to some extent. Using the Assault Grenades ability is also possible for this unit if the proper upgrade from the command tree has been unlocked. Like other infantry units, the Stormtrooper Squad can use Medical Kits and turn neutral structures into Forward Headquarters.Assault Camouflage  After activation of this ability, Stormtroopers will camouflage themselves. They will not be visible to the enemy, unless they are very close to an enemy unit. Note however, that some units have ability to detect camouflaged units from farther away. While camouflaged, the unit's speed is reduced by half. In order to avoid the enemy's attention, the squad can hold fire and will not attack nearby enemy units. This is especially useful for when you want to wait for a good opportunity, in order to strike at a valuable asset.Bundled Grenade  When the Bundled Grenade ability is activated, select any point on the ground. The Stormtrooper Squad will move to within 21 meters of that point, whereby one of the squad members will pull out a bundle of M24 Grenades and lob it at the targeted spot. 1.1 seconds later, the bundle will explode with the massive damage output of 85. The radius of the explosion is quite high for a grenade and is equal to 6.5 meter. Maximum damage output is inflicted only on the target on top of the grenade itself. Other targets receive smaller, but still noticeable amount of damage of about 40 to 20 points. The explosion is strong enough to destroy a whole infantry squad - garrisoned or on the open ground. Using the camouflage ability will grant a surprise effect and will increase the potential of this ability greatly.Medical Kit  After activation of this ability, the Stormtrooper Squad starts to recover health. This ability can be used in every place in friendly territory. However, after escalation to battle phase, a better version of this ability, the Field Medical Kit become available. Then, infantry squads will be able to heal themselves even in enemy territory. Each soldier of the squad recovers health in speed of 72\u00a072 points per minute. There is however one drawback: after activation the squad's speed will be reduced for 18 seconds. This should be taken under consideration while choosing a moment of activation.\u00a0Upgrade to Forward Headquarters  When a Stortrooper Squad enters a neutral structure that's inside captured and connected territory, this ability appears in that structure's menu. Activating this ability begins a 30-second upgrade period, at the end of which the building will be converted into a Forward Headquarters. A Forward Headquarters has two functions: reinforcing infantry, and constructing new units. Reinforcement here works the same as it does at the Wehrmacht Headquarters: any infantry units which have lost one or more men can move to within 25 meters of the Forward Headquarters, and will be able to replace any lost men for a nominal cost. Unit production is possible here as well. Initially, the Forward Headquarters can only produce new Pioneer Squads and Volksgrenadier Squads. As more Wehrmacht base structures are constructed back at the HQ Territory, new production options will become enabled at the Forward Headquarters: These units cost the same amount of resources as they do when produced from their appropriate base structures. They will appear next to the Forward Headquarters when production is completed. Note that all unit production at a Forward Headquarters is suspended if the sector it's in ever falls into enemy hands. You must recapture the sector to re-enable unit production. Also note that converting a structure into a Forward Headquarters changes its ownership to Wehrmacht. The enemy cannot Garrison this structure with infantry. In fact, enemy infantry will be able to \"un-convert\" the structure back to a neutral structure, given time and opportunity, so you will need to protect your Forward Headquarters from this possibility.Upgrades RPzB 54 Panzerschreck  Stormtrooper Squad can be equipped with Panzerschreck Anti-tank launcher. This upgrade enables them fighting with enemy vehicles and tanks. Up to 2 such weapons can be deployed per each Squad, which enables effective fight with enemy vehicles. Note however, that such equipped infantry unit will be almost completely helpless in fighting against enemy infantry. Stormtrooper Squad equipped with this weapon can be excellent tank-hunting unit. Especially if the camouflage ability is used correctly.STG44 Sturmgewehr(Assault Rifles)  Thanks to this upgrade, the Stormtrooper Squad can receive up to 4 STG44 Assault Rifles (2 STG44 Assault Rifles for 75 munitions). This upgrade greatly increases their anti infantry firepower. This weapon is effective at all ranges, but is extremely useful in close distance. In such situations, the Stormtrooper Squad will win in almost every engagement. Just as in Panzerschreck case, using camouflage ability will grant surprise effect and increase usefulness of this weapon radically. Squad can be upgraded two times and it is possible to equip whole unit with these weapons, in consequence creating excellent anti-infantry squad. Note however, that they will not be able to defend themselves against enemy vehicles. Equiping a squad with two STG44 and one Panzerschreck is a wise choice.Veterancy  Stormtrooper Squad is an infantry unit and gains veterancy through infantry veterancy upgrades at the KaSTGfkraft Center. If a whole squad is lost, a new one will still have those obtained upgrades. In their case, veterancy improves only their survivability and defensive capabilities. These bonuses are cumulative to each other.Description  While not the most elite of Axis troops, their dogged determination and access to the best equipment make them a force to be reckoned with. Their STG44 assault rifles, with more controllable automatic fire and mobility, give the Stormtroopers a decided advantage in close-range combat. Stormtroopers are only available as a support option for the Axis Blitzkrieg Doctrine, costing two CPs. Many Blitzkrieg doctrine players build stormtroopers instead of grenadiers due to better quality of the stormtrooper and the access to STG44s.Weaknesses  Although they are highly trained, like other Axis Infantry they are small in number. They are also an expensive unit, taking up 8 population cap for a squad of 4 infantry. They can easily be overwhelmed by larger squad size counterparts such as Riflemen Squads and Ranger Squads. They also, like all infantry, are vulnerable to enfilade, sniper and artillery fire. When they are using camouflage abilities, their movement speed is reduced, and their ability to take cover is hindered by this. Also keep this mind; they are infantry, so they will do nothing against enemy armor (except light vehicles) unless they are upgraded with the proper equipment. Stormtroopers are also one of the worst units in the game while using Kar98s, almost as bad as Volksgrenadiers. They can accurately shoot while moving, a talent no other unit with bolt action rifles possess, but otherwise are considerably better with either (expensive) upgrade.Quotes  On unit selection: When on the move: When under attack: On capturing order: On weapon upgrade: On kill report:   When issued with attack order: When the unit dies:Trivia Knight's Cross Holders  The Knight's Cross Holders are elite heavy Infantry fielded by the Wehrmarcht in Company of Heroes, produced from the Panzer Command.Game Info  The \"Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross\"(Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes, or simply known as Ritterkreuz) was a level of the Iron Cross. The Knight's Cross was the second highest military order of the Third Reich, second only to the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (which was only given to one person, Hermann G\u00f6ring) It was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery and successful military leadership during World War II. Receiving the Knight's Cross was among the highest honours and was only awarded to the bravest, toughest and most battle hardened infantry in the Wehrmacht Arms Force. The Knight's Cross Holders (often shortened to Knight's Cross or KCH) are a largely ahistorical unit made up for Company of Heroes, with no true real life counterpart- unsurprisingly, the ranks of officer that would wear the uniform the squad is depicted in would very rarely fight on the front lines, though certainly they could be abstracted to represent the absolute elite in any given German infantry unit. In game, they come in a 3-man squad, armed with StG 44s. This makes their use simple and obvious- they are an effective Anti-Infantry squad, able to quickly and decisively deal with any Allied infantry unit in almost any situation, outside of full frontal assaults on HMGs. In addition, these units are very difficult to kill, boasting high HP and Heroic armor. These combined factors mean that the only regular Allied infantry unit able to even put up a fair fight against the Knight's Cross Holders are the Commandos, who, even then, will still be usually unable to deal with a veteran squad effectively. This is all balanced out by the armor-heavy nature of the late game. Wehrmacht players are very unlikely to have built a Panzer Command before Allied forces have access to armored vehicles outside of particularly one-sided battles. Therefore, most matches involving them will see them simply supporting tanks or assaulting support weapons rather than Infantry-versus-Infantry encounters, outside of against American commanders making heavy use of Rangers or Airborne. Though somewhat outclassed by the Ostwind in a purely anti-Infantry role, the Knight's Cross Holders are far better Anti-Infantry escorts to Tanks, given their lower cost (especially the total lack of Fuel cost) and lack of vulnerability to Anti-Tank Guns and Tank Destroyers. Notably, Knight's Cross Holders are able to be build at a Forward Headquarters. The ability to quickly produce a super effective Anti-Infantry squad so close to the battle the moment the Panzer Command is completed can come in handy in many situations.Abilities  The Knight's Cross Holders have two Combat abilities- Assault Grenades, identical to the ability bestowed by the Blitzkrieg Doctine, and Fire Panzerfaust, which requires the first level of Veterancy. Knight's Cross Holders can also use Medical Kits and turn neutral buildings into Forward Headquarters.Assault Grenades  This ability causes the Knight's Cross Holders to break suppression and close in on enemy Infantry or Support Weapons while throwing several low-damage Stun grenades at the target, causing enemy Infantry hit to move far more slowly. As of the most recent patch, these Grenades are lethal, but in the hands of Knight's Cross Holders, it's far more likely that the enemy will die to the StG-44 or retreat before the Grenades do the job. The main use of this ability is to quickly close on a low-damage suppressing weapon, usually either a MG squad or a squad or group of BAR equipped Riflemen or Bren equipped Infantry Sections. The Grenades are also generally useful against Infantry in cover, as they'll squirm out of it after getting hit. This ability has no interaction with the Assault Grenadiers upgrade from the Blitzkrieg doctrine- it does not require it, nor does it get any benefit or change in any way because of it.Fire Panzerfaust  When this ability is activated, the Knight's Cross Holders Squad will advance to within 30 meters of the targeted enemy vehicle, and launch a single Panzerfaust Anti-Tank Warhead at that vehicle. The warhead has 100% accuracy against any vehicle, and has no problem penetrating any kind of armor. While the explosion has a radius of 3 meters, it will deliver the vast majority of the damage at the point of impact. The basic damage delivered by the weapon is 75 points of damage - enough to kill an infantryman, but not do much damage to a tank. Fortunately, the game multiplies this by 2.25, to a final value of 168 points of damage, whenever an any tank or other heavily-armored vehicle is hit. Even M3 Halftracks and M8 Greyhounds receive extra damage, though not as much. The Panzerfaust won't destroy a tank (unless it's significantly damaged already), so it's mainly used when the Knight's Cross Holders Squad is flanking a target that's already under attack by another unit from another direction, or to simply whittle away at a vehicle spending extended time in a fight. However, any Armored Cars, Halftracks, or Light Tanks will take good damage from the weapon, typically being destroyed in 2 hits, making this ability an acceptable method of countering them. This ability allows Knight's Cross Holders Squads to act as anti-tank infantry when necessary. Although this ability has a high munitions cost, the trade-off is that the team doesn't need to lug around an anti-tank weapon which would diminish its anti-infantry capabilities. Though the Panzerfaust can be targeted at enemy Infantry, this ability is of little value aside from potentially destroying Sandbags or other heavy cover. Infantry in the open will only very rarely be hit by this ability.Field Medical Kit  After activation of this ability, the Knight's Cross Holders' squad starts to recover health. Since this squad cannot be produced before the Battle Phase, they can only use the Field Medical Kit in legitimate gameplay, which allows them to heal themselves in Friendly, Neutral, and Enemy sectors. Each soldier of the squad recovers 72\u00a072 health points per minute. There is, however, one drawback: upon activation, the squad's speed will be reduced for 18 seconds. This should be taken under consideration when choosing the moment of activation. Intelligent use of this ability can make this already tough unit even stronger- especially in conjunction with the Assault Grenades ability, which naturally speeds up the unit, essentially balancing out the speed malus.Upgrade to Forward Headquarters  When Knight's Cross Holders enter a neutral structure that's inside captured and connected territory, this ability appears in that structure's menu. Activating this ability begins a 30-second upgrade period, at the end of which the building will be converted into a Forward Headquarters. The Forward HQ can produce and reinforce Infantry as a standard base building would be able to. Unless you have skipped the construction of or lost a base building, you will be able to construct any of the following units at this point: These units cost the same amount of resources as they do when produced from their appropriate base structures. They will appear next to the Forward Headquarters when production is completed. Note that all unit production at a Forward Headquarters is suspended if the sector it's in ever falls into enemy hands. You must recapture the sector to re-enable unit production. However, the building itself is marked as owned by the Wehrmacht, requiring the enemy to either capture the building in the same manner as a strategic point, or demolish the HQ outright.Veterancy  Knight's Cross Holders are classified as infantry unit and gain veterancy through infantry veterancy upgrades, available at the Kampfkraft Center. These bonuses effect both newly produced units and those on the field. Generally, you shouldn't field Knight's Cross Holders that don't have at least the first rank of Veterancy- if you don't either already have that level nor are you planning on immediately getting it, save for an Ostwind instead. With the second and third ranks the damage reduction number is low but 5% reduction on a unit that already takes very little damage is surprisingly useful, and further the 20% health bonus makes the unit an outright monster, able to withstand ludicrous punishment- surviving Sniper shots and even direct hits from the cannons of the Greyhound and Staghound. However, if you haven't leveled your Veterancy by this point in the game, you may be better off just getting Tank Veterancy instead.Tips Weaknesses  Knight's Cross Holders are the ultimate Anti-Infantry unit surpassed by few units or even vehicles in the game, however, they are of little value against enemy vehicles with even basic armor. The Panzerfaust is okay but no replacement for a Panzerschrek or AT gun, and likewise, anti-infantry armored units like the Quad .50 Halftrack, Crocodile Tanks, or the AVRE will quickly make short work of the squad without even costing terribly much more than the Knight's Cross Holders themselves. In addition, Artillery pieces larger than Mortars will have no issue taking the Knight's Cross Holders out. Knight's Cross Holders are also high value targets for both Veterancy and Company Commander XP. A poorly placed squad caught out and killed, especially one without the additional bonuses from Veterancy, could lead to an American commander able to produce a Pershing faster than expected- or worse yet, provide a Pershing with a free level of Veterancy.Quotes  When selected: When issued with move order in battle: When wounded, in battle: Other:Sherman Firefly  The Sherman Firefly is a Medium Tank fielded by the British Army in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. It is essentially an M4 Sherman tank with its main cannon replaced by a massive 17 Pounder Anti-Tank gun. With good armor and a powerful punch, this is the British army's primary anti-tank offensive weapon, counterpart to the defensive 17 Pounder AT Gun emplacements.Overview  The last unit to become available to a British company is the Sherman Firefly. A tribute to British engineering, this is basically an American M4 Sherman tank, whose main 75mm cannon has been replaced with a massive 17 Pounder Anti-Tank gun. This is the same cannon that is installed in British 17 Pounder AT Gun emplacements. This turns a Sherman from a general-purpose medium tank into a very effective tank killer. The Sherman Firefly is constructed from the Armor Command Truck for the cost of 450\u00a0450, 100\u00a0100, making it the most expensive British unit. It also consumes 10\u00a010, a very large amount for a tank, meaning that only a few can be fielded simultaneously. To construct a Sherman Firefly, the British must first produce a Cromwell Command Tank. The relationship between the Firefly and Command Tank is of paramount importance. The Sherman Firefly carries as much armor as a regular American M4 Sherman. There are several small differences between these two tanks, but the primary difference is still the main cannon. An M4 Sherman, even when outfitted with the M1A1C 76mm Cannon, has nowhere near the penetrating power of the awesome 17-Pounder AT Gun. This cannon allows the Sherman Firefly to engage enemy tanks - frontally - or even snipe them off from an impressively long distance. The Sherman hull also makes the Sherman Firefly one of the most well-armored tanks - short of the massive German Tigers and King Tigers. In tank battles, the Firefly is usually expected to win one-on-one encounters with any armored vehicle up to its own size - including enemy Panzer IVs. When encountering heavier tanks like the Panther or Tiger, the fight is more evenly matched. A team of Fireflies can surround and subdue such tanks with, at worst, acceptable losses. Tactically, the Sherman Firefly provides the holding force for all British armored assaults: it engages the enemy head on, blasting it away and soaking up damage, while other units maneuver to outflank the enemy. Alternately, Sherman Fireflies can take advantage of their long firing range to snipe at enemy targets from afar, using other units as forward spotters. This allows them to act defensively as well as offensively, filling in for lost or threatened 17 Pounder AT Guns.Weapons  The Sherman Firefly's primary weapon is the powerful 17 Pounder AT Gun. It packs a powerful punch, though is normally slow to reload. Additionally, the tank has two Light Machine Guns installed: an M1919A4 coaxial Light Machine Gun, and a .50 Browning M2 Medium Machine Gun on the hull. These are used to suppress enemy troops and damage light vehicles.17 Pounder AT Gun  Instead of the normal M3 75mm Cannon installed on a normal M4 Sherman, the Sherman Firefly has a 17 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun. This is by and large the same weapon you'll find in a British 17 Pounder AT Gun emplacement, with a few key differences. The 17 Pounder AT Gun inflicts 125 points of damage, with superior Penetration against virtually all vehicle armor. It may even penetrate the front armor of a King Tiger, though some shots will still glance off. Nonetheless, it will inflict serious damage to any tank, and significantly more-so against side or rear armor. Unfortunately it is not as accurate as the emplacement's 17 Pounder, except against smaller vehicles. Due to a small explosion radius, it can kill Infantry only with well-placed shots. The main drawback of the 17 Pounder is its slow reload time. Against targets within 35 meters (basic sight-range), the cannon reloads only once every 8.5 seconds, allowing enemies time to fire back or flee. This is reduced considerably (to about 5.5 seconds) against targets beyond sight-range. This gun does have one significantly powerful advantage: its range. The weapon has a range of 55 meters. This is over 50% further than the tank's basic sight-range, and at least 7.5 meters further than any other tank gun's range (with the Panther coming second at 47.5 meters). Its range is, however, five meters shorter than that of the Panzer Elite's Marder III Tank Hunter, whose PaK 40 can hit targets as far as 60 meters away. It can essentially bombard far-away targets at leisure, when aided by an advance spotter or other type of reconnaissance. Read more below about the special relationship between the Sherman Firefly and the Cromwell Command Tank to learn just how effective this tank can be.... M1919A4 Light Machine Guns  The Sherman Firefly has two Light Machine Guns installed. One of these is an M1919A4, which is mounted coaxially on the turret. Hence, will fire only at targets the main gun is pointing towards. The other is mounted on the front of the hull. It too will fire forward, but only in the direction the hull is pointing at.Abilities  The Sherman Firefly lacks any innate abilities. However like any other British tank, it is capable of utilizing the Hull Down Position ability, which acquired through the Royal Engineers Support Command Tree.Hull Down Position  Once the \"Hull Down\" ability has been purchased on the Royal Engineers Support Field Improvements chart, it becomes available for any Sherman Fireflies until the end of the mission. To activate this ability, simply click it. The tank becomes immobile as sand bags barricades are erected all around it. The tank can continue firing while this is being accomplished. Once the process is complete (9 seconds), the tank will have traded its mobility for increased defense. The tank's armor is increased by 25%, and it takes only 75% damage from any source. To release the Sherman Firefly from Hull Down Position, simply click the button again. This is only possible once the tank has been fully entrenched - you cannot stop the entrenching process halfway-through. As soon as the button is clicked, the tank is released immediately from the sandbags (which disappear) and may drive off at once.Upgrades  Like most other British tanks, the Sherman Firefly may be upgraded with a Tank Crew Commander to increase its sight-range. This is a cheap and fast upgrade that can be installed at any time, and so should be installed when possible.Tank Crew Commander  When this upgrade is complete, the top hatch of the Sherman Firefly will open, and a crewman will pop his head out to look around. This commander increases the sight-range of the tank to exactly 45 meters, from its original 35. The sight-range increase effectively allows the tank to survey enemy troop positions without being detected (since most units and emplacements in the game have a sight-range of only 35 meters). Since it barely costs anything, this upgrade should be installed on all tanks for added situational awareness. It also allows the Sherman Firefly to perform reconnaissance if required. Note that the Sherman Firefly arguably benefits from this ability more than any other tank in the game, since its primary weapon can easily reach 45 meters. In fact, it can fire to 55 meters - and can actually be made to see that far thanks to the bonuses given by a Cromwell Command Tank. At that range, it can engage any enemy vehicle from outside their own range.Cromwell Command Tank Support  The presence of a Cromwell Command Tank in the vicinity will increase the performance of all tanks in three ways: Increasing their sight-range, increasing the range of their main cannon, and decreasing the time required to reload the main cannon. The Sherman Firefly is unique in this respect for three reasons: As a result, a nearby Cromwell Command Tank increases the Sherman Firefly's potential immensely. It can fire much faster, thus having a better damage output, and can engage targets that are so far away they can't possibly fire back. You can bombard enemy positions repeatedly to weaken them before driving in to secure the point.Tactics  Although the Cromwell Tank serves as the primary component in the British armored strike force, it is the Sherman Firefly that delivers the anti-tank firepower required to contend with the heavily armed German panzers. The Cromwell's main 75mm Cannon may pierce through the rear armor of medium tanks, but it has little chance against a Panther or Tiger. This is where the Sherman Firefly's 17 Pounder AT Gun comes into play. Sherman Fireflies are used in an assault to take out anything with even a little armor on it. Normally, they do not even need to flank the enemy, and can simply strike it repeatedly head-on. However, due to a relative lack of Anti-Infantry capabilities, an unsupported Sherman Firefly can quickly turn into a dead Sherman Firefly. For the most part, this support is provided both by Cromwell Tanks and Infantry if at all possible, and will always include a Cromwell Command Tank to supply massive bonuses to the Sherman Firefly's combat capabilities.On the Offensive  A typically good British Armored Offensive will include at least two Cromwell Tanks, a Cromwell Command Tank, and at least one Sherman Firefly. The Shermans tend to stay a little behind the front of the assault, partly because their cannons have a massive range and can therefore hit targets well ahead of the advancing column. Once the enemy position is reached, the Cromwell Tanks will generally move off to flank the target in either direction, using their Flank Speed ability to zoom past the enemy. At this point it's usually the Sherman Firefly's job to take over the center of the advance, and frontally engage the enemy and keep them busy. While it does so, the Firefly will rain death on any vehicle, emplacement or armored unit in sight, buying time for the Cromwells or even Infantry to outflank and destroy the remaining enemy units. Keep in mind that the Sherman Firefly is not a heavy tank. Its armor is the same as that of a M4 Sherman, so it can only take so much damage even to front armor before being destroyed - and its side and rear are significantly less armored. Make sure to use other units to protect the Fireflies. If you have the Hull Down Position ability available, this is a good time to use it, turning the Firefly into an anti-tank emplacement by protecting its sides from damage. If player picks Royal Engineers doctrine, deploy some Churchill Crocodile for Anti-Infantry unit and place them on the killzone where your Firefly need protection against Infantry. While the Crocs are shooing the Infantry off with its flamethrower, the Firefly can aid the Crocs by taking out enemy tanks.Tank Sniper  The Firefly has the longest-ranged tank-mounted cannon in the game, at 55 meters. With a nearby Cromwell Command Tank, this range is increased to a whopping 60 meters: almost twice the sight-range of a normal unit. In addition, the Tank Crew Commander upgrade as well as the bonuses from the Cromwell Command Tank can increase the Sherman Firefly's sight-range up to 55 meters. In addition, the near 100% penetration and very high damage the Sherman Firefly does to tanks allows it to kill most tanks in only a few shots. 2 Fireflies can easily kill any combination of axis tanks provided that they kite them and keep themselves at a respectable range. Due to\u00a0these combined abilities, the Sherman Firefly is sometimes referred to as the \"Sniper Tank\". It can perch in front of open terrain, and fire any target that moves within its line of sight. Enemies will not be able to see the Firefly until it fires, since their sight ranges will be considerably shorter. Additionally, since very few units are be able to fire back at the Firefly from this distance, it is often able to remain safely out-of-range even after firing reveals its position. Since sitting still exposes the Firefly to artillery, many players will often patrol their defensive line with Sherman Fireflies\u00a0accompanied by a Cromwell Command Tank. In this way,\u00a0they are able to utilize the Firefly's long-range defensive capabilities while also remaining mobile enough to avoid artillery fire.Weaknesses  Being built on a Sherman chassis, the Sherman Firefly is just a medium tank. Anti-Tank cannons can pierce its front armor quite easily, and its rear armor is even weaker than that. In a confrontation with a heavy tank, expect to lose at least one Firefly while other tanks finish the enemy off. The only real way to prevent this is to put the Sherman Firefly into Hull Down Position (assuming it's available), strengthening its armor and sides. However it then becomes vulnerable to artillery. Overall, the Sherman Firefly needs to kill enemies at a distance whenever it can, capitalizing on its superior range. The biggest threat to the Sherman Firefly comes from Panzerschreck-wielding Infantry. They are virtually immune to the Firefly's main gun, while having the ability to kill a Firefly in just 4-5 shots. It's very important for the British player to ensure that he has units capable of dealing with those enemy Infantry units, especially since it's very common for Axis players to make large quantities of Panzerschreck-equipped Infantry.Historical Data  During World War II, the United States agreed to lend-lease its mass-produced M4 Sherman tanks to its allies. The British Commonwealth was one of these allies and used these tanks extensively during the course of the conflict. British-sold Shermans were given new designations; they were given roman numbers headed by 'Mark' (Type) according to their original designations where the first variant would be Mark One, and so on. Here, the main British Sherman variants went from Mk. I (M4) to Mk. V (M4A4). The British preferred the M4A4 type. As the Sherman was designed as an Infantry support tank and thus lacked the firepower necessary to engage the increasingly up-armored German tanks, the Sherman was up-gunned in 1944 with the Ordnance Quick Firing 17 Pounder, a very effective gun known to have a devastating effect on armor. This configuration (officially known as Sherman IC or VC) was capable of penetrating the frontal armour of a Tiger I out to 2500m, and the front turret of the Tiger II at 1100m when firing Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot (APDS) ammunition, a feat only matched by High Velocity Armour-Piercing (HVAP) ammunition fired from the 8.8cm KwK 43 mounted on the Tiger II, Jagdpanther, Elefant and Nashorn. The larger shells of the new gun necessitated the removal of the bow machine gun and crewman for additional ammunition storage. Retaining that weapon is an inaccuracy in CoH. The 'Firefly' nickname came from the bright muzzle flash of the 17 Pdr. when it was fired. The muzzle flash was so bright that it could temporarily blind the gunner and tank commander. Occasionally tanks equipped with 17 Pounders were called 'Mayfly' tanks, but were not as common as 'Firefly'. Sherman Fireflies were extremely effective against German armor; they were also the only British (and Western-allied) tank at the time that can defeat the fearsome Tigers and Panthers at standard ranges. Due to this danger, Fireflies became priority targets for German tankers and artillerymen and some Firefly crewmen even camouflaged their longer gun barrel by painting it to blend with the surroundings so as not to be singled out. The M10 based 17pdr SP \"Achilles\" was sometimes also nicknamed \"Firefly\".References  An article about this unit in real life can be found here.Trivia  In real life, the firelfy did not have the hull mounted machine gun.Ranger Squad  The Ranger Squad is a 6-man elite heavy-infantry unit fielded by the American Infantry Company in Company of Heroes. The strength of the unit comes primarily from its equipment: It carries two M9 Bazooka anti-tank launchers on creation, and can then be further upgraded with M1 Thompson SMGs to add powerful close-combat anti-infantry capabilities; it is the only squad in the game which carries both dedicated anti-tank and anti-infantry weapons by default. The unit also has two useful combat abilities, and is significantly more survivable than other infantry units.Overview  The American Infantry Company augments infantry-based warfare in several ways, but perhaps the most significant one is the introduction of the Ranger Squad. This elite squad is initially a powerful anti-tank infantry unit, but can be transformed into one of the best infantry squads in the entire game - owing mostly to its superior equipment and terrific defensive bonuses. The Ranger Squad is called in to the field using the Call in Rangers ability, which is unlocked when the Rangers Command Upgrade is purchased from the Infantry Company Command Tree. Each use of this ability costs 400\u00a0400, 6\u00a06, making this a very expensive unit in American terms (compare it to the 6-man Riflemen Squad, costing only 270\u00a0270). You must select a destination rally point for the unit; it will automatically travel there upon entering the battlefield. The most obvious strength of the Ranger Squad when it first enters the field is its equipment. Two of the men are equipped by default with M9 Bazooka Anti-Tank Launchers. These powerful weapons are very dangerous to enemy tanks and other vehicles, especially when firing at a target's rear armor from close range. The remaining 4 squad members are armed with 3 M1 Garand rifles and 1 M1 Carbine Rifle, all useful for long-range combat against enemy infantry units. Although the Ranger Squad can pick up a wide array of other weapons, it can alternatively be upgraded with a set of 4 M1 Thompson SMGs - powerful close-range weapons which can be used to wipe an entire enemy infantry squad within seconds. This gives the Ranger Squad the unique combination of anti-infantry and anti-tank capabilities, making it one of the most versatile, and most dangerous infantry units on the field. The squad's combat abilities are equally useful. With the Mk2 Grenades Global Upgrade purchased at the Barracks, the unit can throw a single fragmentation grenade to kill massed enemy infantry - especially enemy Weapon Teams - with little effort. The Fire-Up ability, available by default, allows this unit to completely ignore all Suppression effects for a short duration, enabling it to run straight into enemy enfilading fire to grenade the source of that fire or just wipe it out with the Thompson SMGs if those are available. In addition to all this, the unit is classified as \"Riflemen Elite Infantry\", which in game terms translates into being harder to hit with almost any weapon. Couple this with 65\u00a065 per man (10\u00a010 more than Riflemen), and you get a unit that just won't die even under heavy fire. Finally, like most other infantry units, the Ranger Squad can capture Strategic Points. They do so 25% faster than the normal capture rate - not as fast as Riflemen, but faster than most other capture units. The only real drawback is the unit's reinforcement cost. Each fallen Ranger costs 45\u00a045 to replace, a hefty sum compared to other American infantry units. Nonetheless, when this unit is used properly, casualties are usually minimal at worst. Thanks to their versatility, survivability and self-sufficiency, Ranger Squads are quite capable of holding their own in most one-on-one combat situations. In large groups, however, these units are nigh unstoppable by anything except high explosive munitions or specialized anti-infantry weapons. Ranger Squads also work well with pretty much any American vehicle, preferring to flank the enemy target while another unit keeps it busy, and then going in for a rapid kill.Weapons  The Ranger Squad has a widely varied and interesting weapon loadout. It is initially armed with no less than three different types of weapons: Like most infantry units, the Ranger Squad can pick up abandoned weapons from the battlefield to fill up its 4 Open Weapon Slots, or man an abandoned Team Weapon. Alternatively, it is possible to equip the unit with up to 4 M1 Thompson Sub-Machine Guns (depending on how many Open Weapon Slots it has at the time). These are powerful close-range weapons that can kill infantry very rapidly. They replace the M1 Garands and/or M1 Carbine, trading in mediocre long-range capabilities for excellent close-range capabilities.M9 Bazooka  The M9 Bazooka is a shoulder-fired anti-tank launcher, and the trademark of the Ranger Squad. Firing a medium-caliber high-explosive warhead, this inaccurate weapon is nonetheless quite dangerous to enemy armor when fired from a proper flanking position. The M9 Bazooka warhead delivers a punch of 75 damage points to enemy targets. The damage is delivered primarily to whatever target is directly hit by the warhead. This damage output is increased when hitting most Axis vehicles, especially tanks. A Panzer IV, for instance, will suffer 120 damage points per hit. Penetration values against front armor are sadly lacking (45% to pierce a Panzer IV's front armor), which means that this weapon should always be used against a target's rear armor if possible. If a flanking position is achieved, penetration is practically guaranteed against any Axis vehicle. The warhead only delivers 15% of its final damage potential if it is deflected. Accuracy is another problem for this weapon. At a range of 17 meters, the weapon only has a 60% basic chance of hitting its target. This dramatically increases as you get closer, giving 100% base hit chance at 8 meters. As a result, the Ranger Squad often has to get very close to its target to make every shot count. As with all anti-tank weapons, accuracy against infantry units is abysmal, and it is unlikely to hit enemy infantry even at very close range. Finally, this weapon takes about 8 seconds to reload after every shot. With two weapons in the squad, this still means one shot per every 4 seconds, a generally good firing rate. Again, you'll want to get close and behind the target to make every shot count. The maximum range of this weapon is 35 meters - the unit's own sight-range. Do not attempt to attack a target at this range though - the M9 Bazooka is terribly inaccurate at this distance, even against large targets. Note:  When an infantryman holding an M9 Bazooka is killed, and there is no other squad-member available to pick the weapon up, there is a 25% chance of the weapon being dropped and becoming abandoned. Other infantry squads (friendly or enemy) can pick this weapon up if they have at least 1 Open Weapon Slot..30 Cal M1 Garand  The .30 Cal M1 Garand is a fairly standard semi-automatic weapon. A basic Ranger Squad carries 3 of these rifles. This slow-firing weapon is designed to kill infantry at relatively close ranges: about 10\u201320 meters, where accuracy is still somewhat lacking. Each shot hitting the target delivers 10 points of damage, so it would take about 6-7 hits to kill an enemy infantryman. The firing rate of this weapon leaves something to be desired, with ~2.5 seconds between each bullet. When compared to the standard Axis combat rifle, the Kar 98k, the M1 Garand is almost identical - except for the significantly lower rate of fire, odd because the Kar 98k is a bolt-action rifle and should've been the slower of the two. As a result, Ranger Squads are not expected to win firefights without sufficiently outnumbering their enemy..30 Cal M1 Carbine  The .30 Cal M1 Carbine (no actual relation to the M1 Garand, above), is a \"short\" magazine-fed semi-automatic rifle. One member of the Ranger Squad, the team sergeant, carries one of these by default. The M1 Carbine is less accurate at long range than the M1 Garand, but makes up for this with a slightly higher firing rate and the fact that it doesn't need to be reloaded as often. This weapon also suffers a much smaller accuracy penalty while the squad is moving (the smallest penalty of all infantry weapons, actually). This gives it a slight advantage at close and medium range, where it can unload more bullets into the enemy. Unfortunately, the damage output of this weapon is also somewhat lower..45 ACP M1 Thompson Sub-Machine Gun  The famous M1 Thompson, or \"Tommy Gun\" as it was known in the 1930s, is a powerful short-range automatic weapon firing rapidly from a box magazine. Though inaccurate at long range, its fast firing rate can utterly destroy an enemy infantry unit close-up, especially when several are used simultaneously. Up to four of these weapons are given to the Ranger Squad upon purchase of the Thompson SMG upgrade package, depending on how many Open Weapon Slots the squad had when it was purchased. The Tommy Gun is meant to be used at a range of about 10 meters or less. At this range, each bullet has about a 75% chance of hitting its target. This may not sound like much, until you consider that this weapon fires 15-bullet bursts. With each hit inflicting 5 points of damage, the weapon can be said to dish out 55 points of damage per burst; enough to kill an infantryman outright. Note that the burst lasts only 1.5 seconds - very fast indeed. At long range, of course, this weapon is very weak. Each bullet has only about 20% chance to hit its target at the \"normal\" infantry engagement range of 20 meters. This increases the number of bursts required to kill an enemy infantryman to 4 or 5. The maximum range of the Tommy Gun is 35 meters. At this range the weapon is all but useless. The weapon also has to be reloaded frequently due to its small magazine and high rate of fire. After every two or three bursts, the Ranger will take about 3.3 seconds to reload his weapon. This is not terribly important when charging in for a kill, with all Tommy Guns blazing at once, but does discourage protracted firefights at medium or long range. Nonetheless, the bottom line is that when the Ranger Squad closes in on its target, that target will be destroyed very rapidly. Very few infantry units (panzer grenadiers with MP44 and Knight's cross holders will however defeat rangers) will survive this onslaught, especially since the Rangers themselves are considerably hardier than most enemy infantry to begin with.Abilities  The Ranger Squad possesses two combat abilities, both closely related to the close-combat nature of this unit. The Fire-Up ability allows the unit to ignore Suppression effects in order to close the distance with a rapid-firing enemy group. The Throw Grenade ability, unlocked through a Global Upgrade at the Barracks, allows the unit to kill a nearby Weapon Team crew or bunched-up infantry with haste. Like all other American Infantry units, the Ranger Squad can convert ambient buildings into Forward Barracks.Throw Grenade  When the Throw Grenade ability is activated, select any point on the ground. The Ranger Squad will move to within 15 meters of that point, whereby one of the squad members will pull out a Mk.2 \"Pineapple\" Hand Grenade and lob it at the target spot. 1.2 seconds after the grenade hits the target, it will explode with a damage output of 60 - enough to kill an infantryman. The radius of the explosion is 4.5 meters, though the 60-point maximum damage is inflicted only on targets on top of the grenade itself. Other targets receive diminishing damage, down to only 20 points at the outer radius. Still, there is good likelihood to instantly kill any already-injured infantryman caught within the blast radius regardless of how far away he is. Due to the time it takes to throw the grenade, and the time it takes for it to detonate, this weapon is primarily useful against stationary targets, including infantry behind cover and inside buildings. Weapon Teams are especially susceptible to this attack, since they cannot quickly get away. In fact, this is one of the best ways to get rid of an enemy MG42 Heavy Machine Gun Team. Note that grenades do cause damage to vehicles, and have some (small) chance of destroying a vehicle's secondary weapon (if it has one) or damage its mobility. However, actual damage is negligible to vehicles, and significantly reduced against enemy armor. It's usually better to restrict the use of grenades to infantry targets only.Fire-Up  When this ability is activated, all Suppression effects are removed from the Ranger Squad immediately, returning it to normal combat state. For the next 15 seconds, the squad is completely immune to suppression fire, regardless of how heavy it is. The squad continues to receive damage, but won't become suppressed or pinned down. In addition, the squad-members will move at running speed regardless of the terrain, nearby explosions, etcetera, for the duration of this effect. Use this ability primarily to break suppression on the unit, allowing it to fire back at its enemies. More importantly, use it to give you a short window in which you can charge at an enemy position and take it out. This is especially useful when the unit is armed with M1 Thompson SMGs, as closing the distance is imperative to the successful use of these weapons. This ability is invaluable in taking out MG42 Heavy Machine Gun Teams and other similar anti-infantry units. Of course, since this provides no actual protection from damage, expect one or more rangers to die during such a frontal assault - but it's better than retreating to base or losing the entire team due to heavy suppression fire. The unit will be marked with overhead icons while this effect is in progress, as well as white lights strobing underneath the team-members. This allows you to spot your \"Fired-Up\" team easily, and tell at a glance when this effect is over. However, this ability has its drawbacks. After 15 seconds, squad suffers from several negative penalties. For next 10 seconds, Ranger squad will move much slower. Weapon reload will be longer by 50%. Fire rate of whole unit will also suffer, because each weapon will fire slower by 50%. This fact should be taken under consideration, while using this ability. Ranger squad should have time for safe retreat from enemy sight, after executed action.Upgrade to Barracks  When an Ranger Squad enters a neutral structure that's inside captured and connected territory, this ability appears in that structure's menu. Activating this ability begins a 30-second upgrade period, at the end of which the building will be converted into a Forward Barracks. A Forward Barracks has two functions: reinforcing infantry, and constructing new units. Reinforcement here works the same as it does at the American Headquarters: any infantry units which have lost one or more men can move to within 25 meters of the Forward Barracks, and will be able to replace any lost men for a nominal cost. Unit production is possible here as well. Initially, the Forward Barracks can only produce new Engineer Squads. As more American base structures are constructed back at the HQ Territory, new production options will become enabled at the Forward Barracks: These units cost the same amount of resources as they do when produced from their appropriate base structures. They will appear next to the Forward Barracks when production is completed. Note that all unit production at a Forward Barracks is suspended if the sector it's in ever falls into enemy hands. You must recapture the sector to re-enable unit production. Also note that converting a structure into a Forward Barracks changes its ownership to American. The enemy cannot Garrison this structure with infantry. In fact, enemy infantry will be able to \"un-convert\" the structure back to a neutral structure, given time and opportunity, so you will need to protect your Forward Barracks from this possibility.Upgrades  The Ranger Squad is initially an anti-tank unit, but has the option to enhance its abilities at anti-infantry combat with the Thompson SMG upgrade. This very-expensive upgrade is almost essential to maximize the unit's potential - assuming you can afford it.Thompson SMG  When this upgrade is purchased, the team is equipped with up to 4 M1 Thompson Sub-Machine Guns (\"Tommy Guns\"). They will replace the basic M1 Garand and M1 Carbine rifles this unit carries by default, as appropriate. The Tommy Gun is a great close-range weapon, capable of killing an infantryman with a single burst at a range of about 8 meters. A unit with four of these weapons can utterly wipe out another Infantry squad or Weapon Team in a few seconds, provided it can get close enough to utilize this weapon properly. The Tommy Gun is almost useless at normal infantry engagement range (20 meters) or beyond. Note that the number of Tommy Guns given to the unit corresponds to the number of Open Weapon Slots available at the time the upgrade is purchased. If the unit has fewer than 4 slots available, it will receive fewer than 4 Thompson SMGs as appropriate - one SMG per available Weapon Slot.Veterancy  As an American unit, the Ranger Squad can gain three levels of Veterancy. Each level brings its own specific benefits, increasing the unit's combat potential and/or survivability.Accumulation  Like all other American units, the Ranger Squad obtains Veterancy points by killing enemy units. It receives 100% of the experience value of each unit it kills. Once it has accumulated a sufficient number of Veterancy points, it will automatically advance to the next level, gaining the related bonuses immediately. American units do not share Veterancy points with one another. To receive points, the unit must personally kill an enemy unit.Bonuses  At each Veterancy level, the Ranger Squad gains a specific set of bonuses as listed below. These bonuses are cumulative with each other.Tactics  American infantry is often the focal point of all strategies during the early and middle portions of the battle. Supported by heavy weapons and medium vehicles, they throw themselves at the enemy to cause as much destruction as they can before having to be withdrawn for reinforcement. Most companies will then switch over to reliance on tanks or other heavy weapons for the remainder of the game. Tanks are harder to destroy and carry heavier firepower than infantry, so this choice is usually easy to make. The Infantry Company, however, has an entirely different option in its disposal: the use of Ranger Squads as heavy assault units, with tanks acting in support. There are several advantages to the use of infantry as forward troops, but the Ranger Squad is perhaps the single most suitable unit for this role. They make excellent flanking troops that can knock out an enemy vehicle quite easily, and are inherently difficult to kill thanks to their large squad size and innate defensive bonuses. Enemy tanks will usually have difficulty killing infantry on a large scale, so a concentrated attack on an enemy armor force with Rangers can wipe it out much easier than a tank assault would. With their Thompson SMG upgrade, the Rangers will also have little to fear from enemy infantry units and Weapon Teams. As long as it can get close enough, the Ranger Squad can wipe these enemies out very rapidly. For this reason, Rangers often operate in large platoons, surrounding the enemy and destroying any asset he may have. Other units meanwhile draw fire away from the Rangers.Anti-Tank Maneuvers  The primary purpose of the Ranger Squad is to destroy enemy vehicles and tanks, using its M9 Bazooka launchers. These launchers are very inaccurate at long range, and have rather poor Penetration against frontal tank armor. Therefore, the unit needs to get close behind the target in order to destroy it. The best way to do so is to occupy the enemy from the front while the Ranger Squad makes its way to the flanking position behind the target. M4 Sherman tanks and/or M4 Crocodile Shermans are best suited for this task, as they can take a lot of fire and often seem like the most important threat to the enemy. As soon as the Ranger Squad is in position, it begins unleashing rockets into the target's rear quarters. It should take only a few shots to destroy a Panzer IV if it doesn't drive away immediately. Smaller vehicles may be destroyed much faster than this. Again, Ranger Squads often operate in groups of 2 or 3 simultaneously, speeding up the destruction of enemy units significantly. Three groups flanking a Tiger tank will destroy it very quickly, and most tanks have little they can do against this sort of attack except retreat as quickly as possible. To facilitate flanking maneuvers, consider using an M3 Halftrack or two to transport your Ranger Squads into their position. Remember to withdraw the halftrack as soon as it has deposited the troops behind the target, to avoid being destroyed by it.Anti-Infantry Maneuvers  The Ranger Squad is initially not a very good anti-infantry unit, equipped only with 4 mid-range rifles that would take a while to kill the enemy. However, when the Thompson SMG upgrade is purchased, this unit becomes one of the best infantry killers in the game. Like the M9 Bazooka, the Thompson SMG is highly inaccurate at long-range, which means the squad has to close in with the enemy unit in order to make the kill. Flanking maneuvers are best for this, with another unit (preferably expendable Riflemen) drawing enemy fire and attention while the Ranger Squad makes its way along the flanks. Remember that Riflemen armed with Browning Automatic Rifles can suppress the enemy squad using their combat abilities, allowing the Ranger Squad to make an easy charge. Alternately, the Ranger Squad can utilize the Fire-Up ability to charge straight into the enemy position, completely ignoring all Suppression effects on the way there. This allows a single Ranger Squad to eliminate an enemy infantry team easily in a one-on-one encounter. You only need to get within about 8 meters of the target to reach full effectiveness, at which point it will take no more than 2 seconds or so to wipe out an entire enemy team. If you can cover the distance quickly enough, you can probably erase an MG42 Heavy Machine Gun Team before it can kill any of your Rangers. If you can't get close enough, always remember the Mk2 Grenades. These are especially useful against enemy heavy weapon squads. Of course, if you're close enough to throw a grenade, it's best to keep charging in afterwards to kill anyone else left standing.Ranger Platoons  Ranger Squads work very well in large groups, thanks to their versatility. Each squad in the group can engage a single target, be it an enemy vehicle or infantry unit. Two or more squads can band together to take out a tank - even a heavy tank like a Tiger or King Tiger. Always keep your platoon flexible and spread out. Each squad needs to hit a different target if possible, but remain close enough to support the other squads. Few enemy groups will be able to fend off such an assault. Do not bunch the squads up if you can possibly avoid it. A single mortar shell, mine or artillery strike could kill all your elite infantrymen and knock you way back financially.Weaknesses  The Ranger Squad possesses the \"Elite\" Infantry Type, and as a result gains a small amount of resistance to most weapons. Nonetheless, it is still an Infantry Squad, and therefore susceptible to damage and death by virtually all kinds of weapons available in the game. Tank cannons and Anti-Tank guns are really the only weapons that are not accurate enough to kill Rangers at any reasonable rate. Artillery, mortars, Mines and flamethrowers present the gravest threat to the unit, and of course Sniper-fire is always a danger. Unfortunately, the same \"Elite\" Infantry Type (that otherwise increases the unit's survivability) also acts to increase its vulnerability to flamethrower-damage. It also allows enemy Snipers to kill Rangers with ease, even when the Rangers are in full retreat! Fortunately, the Ranger Squad is less susceptible to Suppression fire than most other infantry units thanks to its ability to Fire-Up. Nonetheless, the game files reveal that this unit otherwise receives more suppression effects than other units, so judicial use of Fire-Up may be required often. Do not expose this unit to prolonged fire-fights with enemy infantry. They are too expensive to wage a battle of attrition, and may easily lose that battle if the enemy is equipped with any serious small-arms. This is especially true when Thompson SMGs are installed, as they are very weak at medium and long range. Always close in for the kill - or retreat altogether. Also, remember that even through the squad has the M9 Bazookas equiped, a Ranger Squad should never be considered an anti-tank infantry. The terrible penetration values and accuarcy, mean that this weapon wont be capable of destroying an enemy tank even at close range, if fired from the front. If the squad is not gonna be used to flank the enemy tanks, then using them to fire at enemy armor is a waste of time altogheter. Even worst, it will expose them to suffer casualties, and the huge cost of reinforcements means that they should never be used in combat unless they are gonna be effective. Finally, note again that the weakest aspect of the Ranger Squad is its reinforcement cost. Each soldier you lose would cost 45\u00a045 to replace, making these soldiers some of the most expensive infantry in the game (on par with Panzer Grenadiers). Make every effort to keep them safe.Quotes  On unit selection\u00a0: On halt order\u00a0: On SMG upgrade order\u00a0: On throw grenade order\u00a0: On fire-up order\u00a0: On move order\u00a0: On attack order\u00a0: On field gun capture order\u00a0: On exit order\u00a0: On under-attack report\u00a0: On troop reinforcement complete report\u00a0:Trivia Panther  The Panther is a heavy vehicle unit used by the Axis featured in Company of Heroes and Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. In Company of Heroes, the model of Panther and Panther (Panzer Elite) is Ausf. A.Overview  The Panther or Panzerkampfwagen V is one of the best tanks on the battlefield. This tank was originally designed in response to the Soviet T-34 Medium Tanks of the Eastern Front. The Panther also saw combat during the Invasion of Normandy. But did not live up to their billing when first introduced in July 1943, during the battle of Kursk...as they were constantly breaking down on the battlefield and only 10 out 200 were still combat capable The Panther is armed with the 75mm KwK 42 L/70 high-velocity gun capable of destroying most Allied tanks during the war. But the true strength of the tank is the 100mm frontal armor with a 55-degree slope with the turret covered with 120mm thick cast mantlet, providing reasonable protection against the most tank and anti-tank fire. It is a highly mobile and agile tank, able to move around the battlefield quickly and overcome most resistance with little trouble. A superb tank and is balanced in terms of firepower, mobility, and protection. The 75 KwK 42 L/70 Gun can knock out all but the heaviest Allied vehicles with minimal effort. The Panther is also armed with an MG 42 to engage infantry and light vehicles. \u00a0Infantry support such as VolksGrenadiers, Grenadier Squad, Stormtrooper Squad, and Panzer Grenadier is necessary for the Panther to be used with maximum effectiveness. Access to Blitzkrieg Doctrine with Blitzkrieg assault abilities or Tank Destroyer Tactics with armor-piercing rounds will allow the Panther to increase its combat performance to its maximum. The Panther tank itself is aware of its surrounding and will warn the Axis Commander of incoming off-map artillery strikes, though it will also react on the British Royal Commandos Support tactic ability Decoy Artillery. It is heavy enough to crush enemy Tank Traps as described in Defensive Structure. The Panther is used by both the Wehrmacht and Panzer Elite. The overall large-scale usage of this tank coupled with its high rate of success after fixing initial difficulties has earned the Panther the reputation as one of, if not the, best tanks of the entire war. It should also be noted that although the Panther is primarily a tank destroyer, its accurate cannon allows it to engage infantry on a similar level to the Panzer IV. While lacking explosive power, the Panther is highly accurate and can snipe infantry fairly well, making it an often superior option to almost every Axis tank save the heavy ones.Weapons 75mm Kwk 42 L/70  The Panther's main weapon is the 75mm Kwk 42 L/70, one of the most powerful tank guns ever fitted into a rotating turret in World War II. Each hit deals 137.5 health, with a reload time of only 7 seconds.\u00a0Its maximum range is 47.5 meters, 12.5 meters longer than the vehicle's sight range. The weapon's short reload time and high armor penetration leaves it with very few downsides. There is no opposing vehicle that can deflect the shells of the Panther, save the M26 Pershing\u2014the heaviest armor available for the Allies. Even so, the shells will still penetrate the Pershing 60% of the time.\u00a0 The Panther's cannon is very accurate at any range.\u00a0At short and medium range (10 and 35 meters, respectively)\u00a0every shell will strike the target. At distance greater than 35 meters, there is some accuracy loss, with a 15% chance for each projectile to miss. Note, however, that accuracy is further degraded when the vehicle is moving. Because the Panther's cannon fires solid armor-piercing shells (technically \"shot\"), only direct hits will cause damage. As a result, although any hit will immediately kill an infantryman, it is not a particularly effective weapon against infantry overall. There is 60% chance to hit a stationary infantryman, 50% if the squad is moving.7.92 mm Maschinengewehr 34  The Panther's secondary weapon is the predecessor of the feared Maschinengewehr 42. The 7.92 mm Maschinengewehr 32, it is one of the most powerful machine guns in World War II. It fires bursts of 15-25 bullets, with each bullet capable of dealing up to 6 damage. There is a 3-4 second cooling-off/reload interval between bursts.Tips Veterancy  Panthers receives veterancy through researching tank veterancy upgrades, available at the Kampfkraft Center. Every vehicle, which is already on the battlefield or will be built, receive proper upgrades. These bonuses are cumulative to each other:Description  Arguably the most well-rounded tank of World War II, the Panther is a ferocious beast combining heavy firepower, thick armor, and exceptional mobility. The 75mm KwK 42 gun can penetrate even the thickest armor, while the heavy front-mounted armor provides significant protection from enemy fire. Still, modest side and rear armor leaves the Panther vulnerable to flank attacks.Weaknesses  Although powerful, the Panther is an expensive unit to deploy and is thus valuable to its commander. Allied Commanders that face the Wehrmacht will usually not see the Panther until late in the game as many Axis Commanders prefer building the cheaper and more reliable Panzer IV or StuG IV. Panthers are usually used very cautiously by their commander because the resource loss from losing a Panther is often crippling. Despite its fearsome reputation the Panther is a medium tank and as such large amounts of anti-tank and tank fire from tanks such as the M10 Tank Destroyer and the Sherman Firefly can knock it out. Infantry with light AT weapons such as the PIAT, Sticky Bombs, Recoiless Rifle, and Bazooka can also be effective against the Panther tanks as they lack the HE (High Explosive) rounds that are effective against Infantry, leaving defense to a top mounted and front mounted MG 42 against such attacks. Since the Panther tanks are heavily armored at the front, advice for Allied Commander is not to go toe-to-toe with them; instead flank them and attack their side and rear armor to cripple the beast and exploit the thinner armor. For Axis Commanders, the support of other panzers and infantry is necessary to allow the Panther to perform at its best on the battlefield and prevent the Allies from taking advantage of the weaker side and rear armor.\u00a0\u00a0Support the Panther with a Bergetiger or Pioneer Squad for repairs. If Blitzkrieg doctrine has been chosen, Stormtrooper squads upgraded with StG44 assault rifles are particularly effective at protecting them from AT equipped infantry.Panther Variants  The Panther tank is also the base tank chassis of the Jagdpanther tank destroyer, and was armed with the more powerful 88mm main gun at the expense of having a turretless chassis.  There is also a stationary variant of the Panther, dubbed the Pantherturm, meaning 'panther tower' in German. Essentially, it is a bunker with, instead of a roof, has the turret of a Panther. It only appears operational in the campaign, and can be repaired after being destroyed to be controlled by the player.Quotes  When damaged and under fire:Panzer IV  If you were looking for the Panzer Elite's version of this vehicle, see Panzer IV Infantry Support Tank. For the Company of Heroes II tank, see Panzer IV Medium Tank. Panzer IV is a medium vehicle unit featured in Company of Heroes, Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor, where it is the standard Medium Tank of the Wehrmacht.History  The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Inventory Designation Sd.Kfz 161), shortened to the PzKpfw IV or simply Panzer IV, was created in 1936. The concept was born from the theories of Heinz Guderian, who called for a Universal Tank, which became the Panzer III, accompanied by an Infantry Support Tank, which was the Panzer IV. It was armed with a cheap, plentiful, short 75mm howitzer (not meant for use against enemy tanks) and designed to be as cheap and easy to build as possible. While in its Infantry Support Tank incarnation, the Panzer IV proved to be a moderate success, after early issues mostly surrounding its armor were addressed. However, after shocking encounters with the T-34 on the Eastern Front, which were resistant to the existing 37mm cannons of the Panzer III as well as the upgraded 50mm model, it was decided that a Tank carrying the equivalent of the PaK 40 AT gun was necessary to take on this threat. When the Panzer III proved unsuitable for this modification, it was discovered that the Panzer IV's turret- already holding a 75mm gun, after all- could use the gun, so long as a counterweight was present on the opposite side of the turret. With very few changes to the rest of the design, the Panzer IV quickly took over the \"Universal Panzer\" role, and served with the Wehrmacht until the end of the war, becoming their 2nd most common tank overall. The model present in Company of Heroes is most likely the Panzer IV Ausf\u00fchrung (or Ausf., meaning Variant) H, the last model of it designed as a main-line tank and the most common variant present in the invasion of Normandy.Overview  In Company of Heroes, the Panzer IV is a Medium Tank available from the Panzer Command after upgrade to the Battle Phase. It is armed with the 75mm Kwk 40 L/48 gun high velocity gun, and mounted MG 34 machine guns in the hull and turret. As with its allied counterparts, the Sherman and Cromwell, the Panzer IV is a balanced, all-rounder design with a focus on firepower, armor, and mobility. Its proven and reliable chassis is the basis of many variants- including the Ostwind and Wirbelwind Flakpanzers. The Panzer IV's main gun will make short work of any light vehicles, including Armored Cars and Light Tanks, often killing them in just one shot. Enemy Tank Destroyers and Medium Tanks will prove to be more challenging foes, able to challenge the Panzer IV on nearly equal terms, making positioning and veterancy an important part of using this tank. While not a purely Infantry Support-based vehicle like its Panzer Elite ancestor, it still has a very good degree of chemistry with Infantry. Grenadiers or Stormtroopers  will help deal with enemy Anti-Tank Guns as well as Infantry with their small arms, and can adopt the Panzerschrek to assist the Panzer IV in tank vs. tank battles, while the Panzer IV can clear out occupied buildings, enemy Machine Guns, and Anti-Infantry weapons like the Bofors. It is also recommended to support your Panzer IV with a Pioneer Squad equipped with Minesweepers, to repair the vehicle when necessary as well as prevent unnecessary damage from enemy Mines. Just like every other unit in the Wehrmacht, the Panzer IV can be upgraded with Veterancy from the Kampfkraft Centre. The first level of Veterancy lowers all received damage by 15%, giving the vehicle a large advantage over enemy Tanks in particular, as well as making sure that an encounter with an enemy AT Gun will not be quite as deadly. The second (activating the MG34 on the Turret) and third (adding thin Sch\u00fcrzen armor plating on the sides and turret) both help it deal with Infantry- the MG offensively against them, and the Sch\u00fcrzen giving it protection from Infantry AT weapons. Also, with the Blitzkrieg Doctrine, using the Blitzkrieg Assault ability will increase its reloading speed and movement speed for a short duration. In addition, it can also crush infantry beneath its treads while this power is active.Weapons 75mm KwK 40 L/48  The Panzer IV's main weapon is the 75mm Kwk 40 L/48, a variant of the PaK 40 Anti-Tank Gun specifically designed for use in turrets. A shot from this weapon will do up to 87.5 health worth of damage, with a short reload time of 5 seconds. As with most German guns, the big focus is on accuracy and penetration, and the KwK 40 has no shortage of either- except against Infantry, where a lower accuracy and lack of High Explosive rounds make it just an average weapon.7.92 mm Maschinengewehr 34  The Panzer IV's secondary weapon is the direct predecessor of the feared Maschinengewehr 42, the Maschinengewehr 34. As a weapon to deal with Infantry, it has no use against enemy Tanks, but every single hit from this weapon drains up to 6 health on an unarmored target. The MG will fire 15-25 rounds before reloading for 3-4 seconds. While reliable, the MG34 seen on the Panzer IV is not a fantastic weapon, and for real Anti-Infantry power, it is recommended to pair a Panzer IV up with Infantry- the Knight's Cross Holders being particularly well suited to this job- or an Ostwind.Tips Veterancy  The Panzer IV is classified as a heavy vehicle, and gains veterancy through researching Tank veterancy upgrades available at the Kampfkraft Center. These bonuses are cumulative and effect both new and existing units. A commander using a strategy involving even minor use of the Panzer IV would be well advised getting at least the first level of Veterancy, to give it an edge over enemy Tanks in combat. The second and third levels are most useful in dealing with a lot of enemy Infantry-based Anti Tank weapons, but are not as essential unless you plan on making heavy use of this vehicle.Tactics  The Panzer IV's multitude of strengths make it useful for nearly any situation on the battlefield. When supported well, few Allied units will be able to touch it alone- therefore, your priority with the Panzer IV, especially if you do not yet have or outright plan to build any heavier tanks, is to make sure it is alone as seldom as possible. Other units are needed to help deal with enemy Anti-Tank Guns, as well as deal with Rangers, Sappers or Commandos with PIATs, or any Allied infantry armed with dropped AT weapons. The Panzer IV will be able to deal with almost anything else.Weaknesses  Though the Panzer IV's main gun and mobility are quite good, its Armor isn't quite as good as the more expensive Wehrmacht tanks or even its Allied counterparts, only really being average. Anti-Tank guns will quickly put the vehicle out of action, especially the British 17 Pounder, which outranges the Panzer IV's main gun and does considerable damage to the vehicle, while not taking particularly much damage from the Panzer itself. If the enemy captures a Flak 36, any Panzer IV in its range will be in dire straits- so Wehrmacht commanders must make sure this doesn't happen, and if it does, take it out with Infantry or Artillery quickly. In addition, while a good match for the M10 Tank Destroyer as well as the Allied contemporary Medium Tanks, the 76mm Gun upgrade for the Sherman or a tank commander with a Cromwell will make both very threatening, especially to a non-veteran Panzer IV. Sherman Fireflies and the M26 Pershing will make short work of the Panzer IV in any 1v1 scenario, so make sure to have Panthers or Tigers ready to fight these vehicles.M10 Tank Destroyer  The M10 Tank Destroyer, nicknamed \"Wolverine\" by the British, is an anti-tank vehicle fielded by the American army in Company of Heroes. Clad in good medium armor and sporting a large armor-piercing cannon, the M10 Tank Destroyer uses its surprising speed to flank and destroy enemy tanks. Though less sturdy than an M4 Sherman, it is still a medium tank capable of withstanding some firepower, and is better than the Sherman at knocking enemy tanks out, especially by attacking their rear armor. M10 Tank Destroyers can provide a mobile anti-vehicle defense, but are better used making powerful offensive strikes against the enemy as part of an armored assault group.Overview  With the construction of the Tank Depot in the late stages of the game, the Americans gain access to three different tanks to facilitate their final offensive operations - each with its own unique specialty in combat. The M10 Tank Destroyer represents the decidedly anti-vehicle end of the spectrum, providing a fast mobile gun platform designed to flank and destroy enemy tanks. The M10 Tank Destroyer is constructed at the Tank Depot for the cost of 300\u00a0300, 55\u00a055, 6\u00a06, making it one of the cheapest medium tanks in the game. The tank is based on an M4 Sherman's chassis, but with a considerably-modified turret: open-topped and sporting a very large 3-inch (76mm) cannon, firing armor-piercing shells. Due to the changes made to its turret, the M10 Tank Destroyer is significantly different from an M4 Sherman tank. On the up-side, the vehicle is lighter and thus faster, capable of outrunning and outmaneuvering enemy tanks - and even lighter vehicles - with great ease. The turret itself also rotates rather quickly, further making flanking maneuvers simpler to accomplish. On the down-side, this open-topped turret lacks the heavy armor on the M4 Sherman's turret, making the vehicle about twice as vulnerable to enemy anti-tank fire. The M10 Tank Destroyer can provide a very good anti-tank defensive patrol for the late mid game, or even earlier if a rush for the Tank Depot has been made. However, the M10 Tank Destroyer only truly shines during offensive operations, where it provides the anti-tank firepower lacking in regular M4 Shermans. M10 Wolverines and M4 Shermans are expected to work in very well-coordinated groups, with each tank having its own specific role. The M10's role in this is to flank enemy tanks while they are busy engaging a Sherman, and attack their weaker rear armor.Weapons  The M10 Tank Destroyer relies on one single weapon: its M7 3-inch Anti-Tank Cannon, installed in a free-rotating turret. This is an accurate, fast-firing weapon, though relatively weak compared to other Anti-Tank guns in the game.M7 3-inch Anti-Tank Cannon  The M7 is a long-barreled cannon, firing armor-piercing 76mm shells. Installed on the M10 Tank Destroyer's light, fast-rotating turret, its greatest benefit is the vehicle on which it is installed, which can bring it quickly to a good firing position on the enemy's flanks or rear. Although penetration of frontal armor is possible(with lesser chances), it is not advised to attack enemy tank frontally, because M10 Tank Destroyer in most cases won't be able to survive fire exchange. The M7 AT Cannon has great accuracy, capable of reliably hitting most targets at up to 45 meters of range - short for an Anti-Tank gun, but still useful in most tank battles. Each shell hitting its target will deliver a basic 112.5 points of damage. The gun has a damage bonus against several Axis tanks, including the Panzer IV, Panther, Tiger and King Tiger. Unfortunately it causes reduced damage to Hetzers. Penetration is almost guaranteed against most medium tanks, but to make the most out of this cannon it's advised to fire at the enemy's rear armor, where penetration is absolutely guaranteed against any vehicle. After all, the M10 Tank Destroyer is built almost entirely for this purpose. But due to the thin armor plate of the wolverine it cannot get the job fully done despite its penetration values against German tanks. Due to the armor-piercing nature of the shells, their blast radius is very small, rarely causing damage to anything but the struck target. Accuracy also suffers greatly against infantry, though the cannon still stands some chance of sniping exposed infantrymen at most ranges. Nonetheless, this is not an anti-infantry cannon by far. Finally, one of this weapon's greatest qualities is its speed - both firing speed and rotation speed. The M7 AT Cannon will fire one shell every 4.2 seconds, considered fast for an anti-tank weapon. If it manages to flank an enemy tank, it may even survive an exchange of shells thanks to this. Furthermore, the turret in which this weapon is installed rotates rather quickly, so the vehicle can easily slip into a flanking position and begin blasting away its enemy's rear armor with haste. It may even be able to run circles around a slower tank, keeping its own turret trained on the enemy while the enemy's turret struggles to keep up.Veterancy  As an American unit, the M10 Tank Destroyer can gain three levels of Veterancy. Each level brings its own specific benefits, increasing the unit's combat potential and/or survivability.Accumulation  Like all other American units, the M10 Tank Destroyer obtains Veterancy points by killing enemy units. It receives 100% of the experience value of each unit it kills. Once it has accumulated a sufficient number of Veterancy points, it will automatically advance to the next level, gaining the related bonuses immediately. American units do not share Veterancy points with one another. To receive points, the unit must personally kill an enemy unit.Bonuses  At each Veterancy level, the M10 Tank Destroyer gains a specific set of bonuses as listed below. These bonuses are cumulative with each other.Tactics  The M10 Tank Destroyer strikes an interesting balance in the wide array of Tanks, Tank Destroyers and Anti-Tank guns available to all the different factions. Instead of excelling in firepower (like stationary AT guns, e.g. the 17 Pounder AT Gun or 88mm Flak 36 AT/AA), or sporting heavy armor (like the Jagdpanther tank), it combines these traits together into a single, more \"general-purpose\" vehicle. As a tank, about as well-armored as a Cromwell, it is relatively well-protected and can easily throw itself into combat without worrying too much about being destroyed. It is possible to use the M10 as a stop-gap anti-tank vehicle, before an up-gunned M4 Sherman can be fielded. As an anti-tank cannon, it sports a powerful gun that poses a serious danger to other tanks. Its speed allows it to react to dynamic combat situations with ease, outflank enemy units with surprising agility, and retreat when things go sour. On its own, the M10 Tank Destroyer can only hunt other, smaller vehicles than itself. It cannot stand up to an enemy tank alone. So on offensive maneuvers, the M10 Tank Destroyer relies on heavier vehicles like the M4 Sherman to engage the enemy and soak up their firepower, while the M10 Tank Destroyer charges into a flanking position to quickly destroy the enemy from the rear. Defensively, the tank is somewhat useful as a mobile Anti-Tank gun - capable of holding back enemy armored assaults when properly supported.Defensive Anti-Tank Warfare  Given its speed and powerful cannon, the M10 Tank Destroyer is a great unit for providing mobile defensive patrols against enemy vehicles. It can quickly react to any armored assault or vehicle infiltrations along your defensive lines. Keep your M10 Tank Destroyer(s) moving slightly behind your front lines. Make sure they are spread out well enough so that each M10 can quickly reach a firing position to rain down fire on enemy armor. The M10 must work closely with your defending infantry and Machine Gun Emplacements, as they will take care of enemy infantry while the M10 takes care of vehicles. The anti-infantry units will also keep enemy troops from flanking and destroying the M10, as it has no weapons to defend itself against such units. If the enemy assault is considerable in size, consider pulling in several M10 Tank Destroyers to fend them off. If you have more than two such units, use the extra ones to flank around the enemy and trap them in a pincer. Remember that the M10 doesn't have excessive range, and has to come pretty close to the enemy in order to fire. This puts it at risk, so flanking maneuvers are often easier to perform than a frontal defense.In the Armored Corps  For most American players, the late-game assault group is comprised of several M4 Shermans accompanied by M10 Tank Destroyers. Together, these two units make up the American Armored Core. They interact very well with one another during combat actions, and are considered very difficult to stop. During offensive maneuvers, the M4 Shermans take the lead, with the M10 Tank Destroyers driving along their flanks, possibly supported by a second layer of lighter flanking vehicles like the M8 Greyhounds or M45 Quadmounts. When the M4 Shermans make contact with the enemy, assess the strength and composition of the enemy force quickly. If enemy tanks are involved, the Shermans' job is to establish a frontal engagement with the enemy, keeping them busy while the M10s make a flanking maneuver to attack the enemy from behind. Two M10s flanking an enemy tank together will usually destroy it rapidly - hopefully before that target can cause any significant damage to the M4 Sherman engaging it from the front. If you need to buy extra time, use the Sherman's Defensive Smoke Screen to confuse the enemy and make his shots inaccurate. Do not engage enemy tanks from the front using a single M10 Tank Destroyer. While it can survive a few shots from an enemy tank's cannon, it is not well-armored enough to win such a face-to-face confrontation. The only exception is when several M10 Tank Destroyers are engaging the same target from the front, in which case there's still some chance they might be able to destroy the enemy before it gets one of them. Again, if at all possible, always try to move one or more M10 Tank Destroyers to a flanking position to increase their Penetration chance. Keep alert, and withdraw your M10s if they are in any danger of being destroyed.M10 Tank Destroyer vs. M1 57mm AT Gun  The two primary anti-tank cannons available to the Americans are the 57mm AT Gun and the M10 Tank Destroyer. They are very different from one another in combat properties and useful tactics. The 57mm AT Gun is very vulnerable, being basically just an infantry unit. Slow to turn and move, it is largely incapable of flanking enemy units, let alone participate in heavy combat. Nonetheless, it has impressive range, a powerful punch, and a low consumption of Population Cap\u00a0Population Cap points. On the other hand, the M10 Tank Destroyer is a fast vehicle, clad in armor, and easily capable of flanking and destroying enemy vehicles as part of a concentrated assault. Its gun, however, is weaker and has a shorter range. The unit also consumes twice as many Population Cap\u00a0Population Cap points as the 57mm AT Gun. Some players contend that a fast-moving, armor-clad Tank Destroyer is preferable to the slow and vulnerable AT Gun. They argue that a single M10 Tank Destroyer can pretty much \"fill in\" for two 57mm AT Guns, making the difference in Population Cap\u00a0Population Cap consumption moot. Other players will argue that fielding more 57mm AT Guns provides more deadly firepower, and that using the long-range firepower support of these cannons is preferable to risking an expensive M10 in flanking maneuvers. The truth is that it's really up to personal taste and playing style. Your choice of Command Trees, the types of other units you have on the field, and the strength of your defensive line are usually very important factors in deciding whether to rely on one unit or the other, or to mix the two unit types into your arsenal. Nonetheless, one thing can be said for sure: on defense, the 57mm AT Gun is often superior. On offense, the M10 Tank Destroyer often has the upper hand.Weaknesses  The M10 Tank Destroyer is not a well-armored tank. While its armor will occasionally deflect enemy tank or anti-tank fire, it is not nearly as survivable as an M4 Sherman, and cannot directly contend with enemy armor on its own. It will only take three or at most four shots from an Anti-Tank cannon to destroy the vehicle. Nonetheless, the M10 Tank Destroyer is still a tank, which means that it does not suffer damage from small-arms fire or even machine-gun fire. This allows it to drive straight into infantry combat impeded, if this will give it a good flanking position against some enemy vehicle. It can also stand up to mortar fire quite well, and cannot be burned by flamethrowers, despite its open-top turret. As such, it could be used as an interim, temporary tank to be replaced by Shermans when they can be called. Enemy anti-tank infantry, however, are a different matter. These do pose a serious threat to the M10 Tank Destroyer, for one critical reason: it has no weapons to use against them. The M10's only weapon, its M7 3-inch gun, is not accurate enough to kill infantry at any reasonable speed. It will be overwhelmed and destroyed with haste if another unit cannot be brought in quickly for support, or the M10 retreated to safety.Quotes  When assembled, in battle:Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad  The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad is a 4-man elite Infantry unit fielded by the Panzer Elite Luftwaffe Tactics company in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. Although technically a paratrooper unit, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads are not air-dropped into combat: they have already infiltrated the battlefield and can reveal themselves when called for at virtually any position on the map. Their capabilities allow them to engage almost any type of target, and they can be further upgraded with superior FG42 assault rifles to decimate enemy infantry at various ranges. They are very expensive, but are also some of the best infantry units in the game.Overview  With the Luftwaffe Tactics doctrine, the Panzer Elite receive help from the German air-force, and by extension from the Luftwaffe's Airborne Infantry Division. These German paratroopers, known as Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (translated literally as parachuted hunters, more commonly in English as parachute light infantry), are some of the toughest and best-trained infantrymen available in the entire game. Not only that, but they possess an impressive variety of abilities that allow them to work almost entirely independently of other units. Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads can be called to the field as soon as the Luftwaffe Tactics: Fallschirmjager Infiltration Command Upgrade has been purchased. The Command Ability it unlocks, also called \"Fallschirmjager Infiltration\", costs 420\u00a0420, 4\u00a04 to activate, and provides one of the most unique ways of introducing a unit to the battlefield. If this Command Ability is targeted on any neutral or friendly building that has room for at least 4 men, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad will appear from within that building. It doesn't matter where the building is - it can even be inside enemy territory - as long as it has enough room to fit a Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad. If any other target is selected (i.e. anything that doesn't match the aforementioned description), the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad will instead appear at the Panzer Elite map entry point (usually not far from the Panzer Elite Headquarters) and will automatically travel to the selected destination. Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads are initially equipped with Kar98k Bolt-Action Rifles, which enable them to do combat with enemy infantry at long and mid range quite effectively. One squad member, a unit sergeant, is equipped with an MP44 Assault Rifle, though this rifle actually behaves as an \"enhanced\" version of the regular Kar98k. Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads may be upgraded with four FG42 Assault Rifles, which are excellent automatic weapons capable of killing enemies at almost any infantry-engagement range. Additionally, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads possess several abilities that allow them to engage other types of targets beside infantry. They can fire a Panzerfaust Anti-Tank warhead, which can do some serious damage to enemy vehicles. They can also throw a large Anti Building Incendiary Device which will do significant damage over time to buildings and especially any infantry garrisoned inside. Finally, they can Sprint like Panzer Grenadiers straight into enemy Suppression-fire, once several Global Upgrades have been purchased at the various Panzer Elite base structures. Another interesting innate ability these infantrymen possess is an automatically-activated camouflage property, which allows the unit to hide from enemy eyes. It is triggered whenever the unit stands still behind any kind of cover, and the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads can fire several shots at unsuspecting enemies before their position is revealed. This allows them to infiltrate enemy territory, set up ambushes, or even escape unattentive enemies. Finally, as elite infantry, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads receive innate protection from several weapons in the game, making them harder to hit and/or giving them a damage reduction against specific weapons. This makes them one of the toughest infantry units in the game, especially when upgraded with Veterancy bonuses. The use of a Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can vary depending on circumstances and strategy, but they are overall best used for surprise attacks and ambushes against enemy units. In a larger combat force, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can perform devastating flank attacks, or even charge straight into an enemy position to eliminate them.Weapons Karabiner 98 Kurz  This bolt-action rifle, though called \"short\" (Kurz), is nonetheless the standard long-range weapon of the Wehrmacht (and vicariously, the Panzer Elite). Among other standard long-range rifles in the game, the Kar98k is one of the best. Compared to the American M1 Garand, the Kar98k is both significantly faster and more accurate. The weapon inflicts 12 points of damage per shot, taking about 5 shots to kill an enemy infantryman. At a medium range (17 meters) every second shot will hit an exposed infantry unit, giving a total kill rate that is quite remarkable for a long-range weapon. This decreases to one hit per every 3 shots at the weapon's maximum range of 35 meters (sight-range). Even shots that fail to hit have some effect, as this weapon is relatively good at suppressing enemy infantry. Like all other small-arms, this rifle is largely useless against armored vehicles and structures. Additionally, at close range it will easily be outdone by Light Machine Guns and Sub Machine Guns.MP44 Sturmgewehr  The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad leader is clearly seen holding an MP44 Sturmgewehr assault rifle. However, for all other intents and purposes, this is in fact a Kar98k bolt-action rifle, identical to the one described above except for a longer delay between shots.FG42 Assault Rifle  The FG42 is a magazine-loaded automatic weapon, an evolutionary step between Light Machine Guns (such as the MG42 LMG) and actual Assault Rifles (such as the MP44), designed specifically for use by Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads. This weapon is one of the best infantry-carried rifles in the game, and can only be directly compared to the American Browning Automatic Rifle. Both are weapons that excel at almost any engagement distance, whether long-range combat or up-close and personal. The FG42 fires in fast, 3-8 bullet bursts, stopping for 1.5\u20132 seconds between each burst. At normal infantry engagement distance (about 15-25 tiles) it is not very accurate, but the high rate of fire easily compensates for this. Each bullet inflicts 7 points of damage if it hits - more than most automatic infantry weapons. As a result, it'll take about 2-4 bursts to kill an infantryman during ranged combat - much faster than most infantry weapons. At close range, this weapon speeds up remarkably, and is much more accurate to boot. A Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad equipped with these weapons can easily wipe out an enemy squad if they can close the distance. At longer range, the weapon is unlikely to deliver much Suppression, though an entire 4-man squad firing these simultaneously can achieve some results in protracted combat.Abilities  Although the range of their special abilities is not as wide as that of Panzer Grenadiers, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad's abilities are designed to allow them to tackle virtually any type of target they encounter. This makes them a truly versatile infantry unit, capable of adapting to various combat situations. They can attack enemy vehicles with a Panzerfaust Disposable Anti-Tank warhead, and attack buildings and infantry inside buildings with a long-burning Incendiary Device. Additionally, like other Panzer Elite Infantry, they can set up Reinforcement Points near the front lines, and can eventually Sprint past Suppression fire once several Global Upgrades have been purchased from the various Panzer Elite base structures.Fire Panzerfaust  When this ability is activated, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad will advance to within 30 meters of the targeted enemy vehicle, and launch a single Panzerfaust Anti-Tank Warhead at that vehicle. The warhead has 100% accuracy against any vehicle, and has no problem penetrating any kind of armor. While the explosion has a radius of 3 meters, it will deliver the vast majority of the damage at the point of impact. The basic damage delivered by the weapon is 75 points of damage - enough to kill an infantryman, but not do much damage to a tank. Fortunately, the game multiplies this by 2.25, to a final value of 168 points of damage, whenever an any tank or other heavily-armored vehicle is hit. Even M3 Halftracks and M8 Greyhounds receive extra damage, though not as much. The Panzerfaust won't destroy a tank (unless it's significantly damaged already), so it's mainly used when the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad is flanking a target that's already under attack by another unit from another direction. Two Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads firing at the same medium-vehicle (like a Stuart Light Tank) can destroy it outright though. This ability allows Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads to act as anti-tank infantry when necessary. Although this ability has a high munitions cost, the trade-off is that the team doesn't need to lug around an anti-tank weapon which would diminish its anti-infantry capabilities.Anti Building Incendiary Device  When this ability is activated, select any ground target. The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad will move to within 8 meters of the target, and then lob a large incendiary explosive at it. The explosive goes off immediately once it impacts with the target. The initial explosion looks impressive, but actually does almost no damage. Instead, it sprays a flammable liquid over a 6-meter radius around the impact, and ignites it. Enemy infantry within the first 4 meters will receive about 6 points of damage per second while they are inside the fire. This diminishes to a little less than 1 point per second at the maximum range (6 meters) from the impact point. Soldiers that leave the fire zone do not receive any further damage unless they move back in for any reason. The fire will burn for a period of between 90 and 120 seconds, causing damage the entire time to any unit remaining inside. For this reason, the best targets for this weapon are units that cannot easily get away - especially Weapon Teams (Machine Gun teams, Mortars, Anti-Tank guns) and infantry inside buildings. If the enemy does not react quickly enough to pull his men out, he may lose an entire squad within up to about 10\u201320 seconds of the explosion. Since the fire continues to burn for such a long time, it can cause massive damage to a building - especially weapon emplacements. Most Defensive Structure will suffer a total of about 500 points of damage from a single such device! Ambient buildings and base structures are slightly less vulnerable, but will suffer damage nonetheless. Even after the target of the incendiary device has died or escaped, the raging fire will continue to deny the location to the enemy. You can therefore use it to dissuade the enemy from entering a building, block passage through a narrow road, or even throw this at a Strategic Point to make sure the enemy can't capture it for a while.Upgrade to Reinforce Point  This ability is available whenever a Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad enters a neutral structure situated inside friendly territory connected to your supply lines. It appears in the structure's own abilities menu. To activate the ability, simply click it. After 30 seconds, the building will be converted to a Reinforcement Point. Nazi flags will be hung from the sides, and a large Panzer Elite emblem will float above it. This conversion is permanent until the structure is destroyed, though it can be \"un-done\" by enemy infantry. The primary benefit of a Reinforcement Point is that any Axis Infantry unit within 25 meters of the building can be reinforced, in the same manner as infantry units near your own base structures. An additional benefit is that enemy infantry cannot garrison this structure, since it now belongs to the Panzer Elite. An additional bonus can be unlocked by the Defensive Operation Global Upgrade, purchased at the Panzer Elite Headquarters. With this upgrade, the Reinforcement Point will automatically heal any infantry within its reinforcement radius. Enemy infantry can \"un-convert\" a Reinforcement Point back to a neutral building. This process takes 30 seconds. Enemy vehicles can attack the structure and potentially destroy it. This ability allows Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads to create a forward outpost to which they can withdraw to replenish lost men (and heal injuries, if this ability is unlocked). This saves a lot of time sending troops back to home base for reinforcements.Sprint  The Sprint ability is one of the last abilities to become unlocked for the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad, if for no other reason than the fact it requires 6 Global Upgrades to be purchased from the various Panzer Elite base structures. When Sprint is activated, for a period of 15 seconds the unit will receive only 50% Suppression from any source. In addition, it will not react to large explosions (where normally the soldiers would hit the ground or escape the explosive radius), and the soldiers will run at full speed regardless of terrain constraints or group formation. Use these 15 seconds to either run past or directly into a source of suppressive fire, like an enemy Machine Gun. While the soldiers are not made vulnerable to incoming fire, they'll be able to reach cover or assault the suppressing unit in short order, lessening the casualties they would otherwise sustain. This ability can also be used to withdraw to a safer position without having to hit the \"retreat\" button.Upgrades  The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can take only one upgrade, but it is a very useful one: FG42 Assault Rifles. With this upgrade they become utterly deadly to enemy infantry at almost all engagement ranges.FG42 Assault Rifle  When this upgrade is purchased, it will add 4x FG42 Assault Rifles to the squad's inventory. Any squad member still carrying his standard Karabiner 98k (or the \"pseudo\" MP44) will therefore now use an FG42 instead. If the squad has picked up a 1-slot weapon prior to purchasing this upgrade, it will retain that weapon on one of the soldiers. The FG42s turn this into one of the best anti-infantry squads in the game. They can kill enemies at almost any range, including long-range combat and short-range engagements. They will only lose out to a larger SMG-equipped squad, and then only some of the time. Note that it is impossible to drop FG42s, so there is no danger that the enemy will capture these awesome weapons. When a Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad with this upgrade is reinforced, the new squad-members will be carrying an FG42 by default.Automatic Camouflage  The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad possess an interesting innate ability to camouflage themselves. Unlike other camouflage-capable units, this ability is automatically activated and deactivated based on the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad's activities, and cannot be manually controlled. Camouflage kicks in whenever any of the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad members is in \u00a0Light Cover or \u00a0Heavy Cover, and is not moving. That individual soldier will become camouflaged within 5 seconds of stopping at the appropriate cover. Once camouflaged, the soldier can fire 4 shots (or bursts) before becoming visible. Once the first shot is fired, he gains a +25% accuracy and damage bonus for 5 seconds (including for that first shot). The camouflaged soldier will also become visible if the enemy unit comes close enough to detect him, like any other camouflaged unit. Note that this camouflage is applied to each soldier in the squad individually. So, for example, if only two members of the squad are in cover when the team stops moving, only those two will become camouflaged; the other two will remain visible. Note that firing in and of itself does not disable camouflage. If the soldier does not move away from his position, he'll regain camouflage repeatedly every few seconds. To an enemy unit, it may seem as though the Fallschirmj\u00e4gers are \"fading in and out of existence\", disappearing and reappearing repeatedly. While one or more squadmembers are camouflaged, it is possible to toggle the unit's automatic target selection off. This prevents the unit from firing at any enemies - unless the squad comes under attack or is discovered by enemies in close proximity. Finally, do not rely on this ability to keep the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad invisible. Even when stationary, soldiers often change direction to look behind them every now and then, and this will break camouflage momentarily. This is possibly an oversight by the developers, and makes it harder to keep the squad hidden. For tactical applications of this ability, read the Tactics section below.Veterancy  Like all other Panzer Elite units, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can attain 3 levels of Veterancy, by accumulating experience points from the killing of enemy units. As it gains levels, its performance will increase proportionally.Accumulation  The Panzer Grenadiers use the Panzer Elite Shared Veterancy system to accumulate Veterancy points. In this system, units share experience from their kills with each other, within a certain radius. Each kill the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad makes will grant it 100% of the experience value of the killed unit. In addition, it will pass 50% of that value to any Panzer Elite units within 35 meters of itself. Vicariously, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad receives 50% of the experience value of kills made by other Panzer Elite units within 35 meters.Bonuses  Every time the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad gain a level, you'll be asked to choose which Veterancy Upgrade you wish to apply to them - either a Defensive bonus or an Offensive bonus, but not both. You can choose a different bonus at each Veterancy level, if you want. The bonuses described below are specific to each level. Due to the way they are applied on top of each other, when computed together (see below) they may or may not add up as you may expect. When these bonuses are computed together with each other as well as the unit's basic statistics, the results at each level are as follows: *Click button at top right corner to expand.Tactics  The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad is a basic, though capable, commando unit. The ability to suddenly \"appear\" behind enemy lines allows it to deliver one sudden surprise-attack, whether on its own or in support of a larger offensive. Using its camouflage, it may even be able to set up an ambush of enemy units. These tactics tie in well with the fact that Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can easily engage any other unit type, especially once the FG42 Assault Rifle upgrade has been purchased. Nonetheless, unlike British Commandos, once the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad is on the map, it's going to have more trouble infiltrating enemy territory again. It is then usually attached to a Panzer Grenadier platoon, where it can do a lot of good in virtually any role, or it can attempt to use camouflage to re-enter enemy territory - though this is much more risky than it sounds.Insertion  Fallschrimjager Infiltration is a unique way of putting a unit behind enemy lines. All you need is to locate a structure that can contain the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad in its entirety, and select that as your target for infiltration. This can be tricky, given that some structures may look like they might be able to fit a squad, but actually do not. In particular, ruins of buildings may sometimes look like damaged buildings, but while a damaged building is a suitable target for infiltration, a ruined building is not. Remember that selecting an \"invalid\" target will cause your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad to appear next to your base, rather than at the target... You may want to determine what target you want your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad to hit with its first attack, before activating the infiltration ability. That way, you can select a building closer to that target. Remember that a deep insertion behind enemy lines will leave your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad isolated until it can make its way back. Still, the automatic camouflage may enable your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad to remain undetected for long periods of time, unlike other Commando units that need to constantly keep moving to avoid being destroyed. Once the squad is spawned, you have two options: You can try finding heavy cover, preferably in some out-of-the-way spot, so that your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can remain camouflaged and wait until you can select a proper target for them. Otherwise, make sure to move them to their target immediately. In any case do not just spawn the unit and forget about it - the squad won't become camouflaged unless it can find cover.Flanking Assault  The most straightfoward use for a Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad is to provide flanking firepower against an enemy position, in support of a larger attack force coming from your own territory. Firstly, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads can be used to wipe out enemy infantry, whether out in the open or (with Incendiary Devices) inside buildings. The most lucrative targets are enemy Weapon Teams, such as mobile Anti-Tank guns or Heavy Machine Guns, which might otherwise impede the attack. The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can approach these quickly from behind and knock them out - Weapon Teams usually need to reposition to confront enemies coming from behind them, so you have time to kill them first. Another good use is anti-tank work. While your force is engaging a tank or other heavy vehicle from the front, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad appears behind it and unleashes a Panzerfaust into its rear armor. Once it's done, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad may wish to retreat quickly, or select another target, as it can only fire a single Panzerfaust every 20 seconds. You can also use this unit to sneak up on an enemy weapon emplacement, particularly Machine Gun Nests, static artillery or Anti-Tank guns - emplacements that cannot turn around to attack the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad. Throw an incendiary device at the emplacement and get out of there. The fire should be sufficient to destroy the emplacement in short order. For best results, do this before your main attack force makes contact with the enemy, and delay your attack until the emplacement is destroyed or about to be destroyed. Your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad can continue to attack the emplacement after they've thrown the device, but are usually better off retreating into the Fog of War and hiding to avoid enemy retaliation.Ambush  Using their automatic camouflage, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads can perform spectacular ambushes on enemy units, especially when two or three of these squads are used in unison. To do so, put each squad in \u00a0Light Cover or \u00a0Heavy Cover near a road or other passageway sometimes used by the enemy. Ambushes along main routes are not recommended - you don't want to run into a column of tanks, just one unit at a time if possible. Once the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad is camouflaged behind their cover, make sure to toggle its automatic target selection using the Cease Fire button. This will ensure that the ambush does not occur prematurely. When a light-enough target passes close by, toggle Cease Fire off. Your Fallschirmj\u00e4gers will begin firing at the enemy unit from the safety of cover, and may get a few shots off before they even lose their camouflage. If the enemy unit is sufficiently light, it may be destroyed by the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad before it can even react. This works best against enemy infantry of course, but can also be used against vehicles - especially when you're using more than one Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads, and when applying Panzerfaust attacks as appropriate. Once the ambush is over, don't leave your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad where it is: Staying in one spot would lead the enemy right to you, so you want to get out of there quickly. Find a cover position further away, and remain camouflaged until the enemy stops looking for you. At that point, if your Fallschirmj\u00e4gers are still healthy, you can perform another ambush - sometimes even in the same spot as before. Remember not to fire on an enemy unit until you're sure it is alone. Trying to ambush a large enemy force is suicidal - only strike when the odds are in your favour.Re-insertion  Unlike British Commandos, the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads do not have the advantage of knowing where the enemy is at any given time. This makes it harder for them to re-enter enemy territory. However, the Fallschirmj\u00e4gers' advantage is their camouflage ability, which can sometimes be used to move them slowly and carefully back into infiltration positions. It's risky, but when done properly you can get the unit to perform another deep strike. To do this, you need a Kettenkrad. The Luftwaffe Tactics Command Tree upgrades these automatically with the ability to camouflage themselves at will - this Kettenkrad will serve as the \"eyes and ears\" for the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad, scouting ahead of it to make sure it does not run into enemy units while changing positions. You may want to perform some reconnaissance with the Kettenkrad along the enemy lines first - to discover the weakest defensive point. If no part of the enemy line is vulnerable (which can sometimes happen with the British, who like to build impregnable lines), you may have a problem. Otherwise, once the undefended spot is located, get the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad and the Kettenkrad near that point. Have the Kettenkrad scout ahead, to get some awareness of enemy movement. When the coast is clear, rush your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad to cover inside enemy territory and wait until they are camouflaged. Use the Kettenkrad to scout the area some more, waiting for the coast to be clear again, and then move the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad to another cover position deeper in enemy territory. Repeat this process until the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad is at its destination. You can then retreat the Kettenkrad or keep it around to help you coordinate attacks. If you are ever in doubt that the coast is clear, don't move. It takes 5 seconds for Fallschirmj\u00e4gers to become camouflaged once in cover, so any movement between cover points should be done only when there is no risk. Move quickly, and always in short bounds - long runs between cover points will get you killed. Also always remember that each member of the squad must be in cover when the unit stops. Otherwise, any member that is not in cover will not become camouflaged, compromising the entire team's safety. Also remember to select Cease-Fire whenever the squad is fully camouflaged! This maneuver is extremely risky. It may take a lot of practice until you learn how to do this properly. At first, try doing this only as a prelude to a flank attack on the enemy's front lines, or for an ambush close to your own territory. As you get better, you may be able to get your Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad deep enough to perform incendiary strikes against the enemy's own base!Weaknesses  Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squads may be elite infantry, but they are still infantry. This makes them vulnerable to virtually any weapon in the game. The biggest threats, as always, are artillery strikes and other high explosives, which can kill a team instantly if accurate enough. Flamethrowers and Heavy Machine Guns are also quite dangerous, as are anti-aircraft guns. Against enemy infantry, a Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Squad outfitted with FG42 Assault Rifles will tend to win - unless the enemy outnumbers you significantly. Also watch out for SMG-equipped infantry - keep them away from you, and your FG42s will make short work of them.Quotes  On unit selection while hiding\u00a0: On unit selection while exposed\u00a0: On unit selection when under attack: On move order\u00a0: On attack order\u00a0: On attack order when suffering individual casualties: When encountering an MG nest: On veterancy 'Veteran' achieved\u00a0: On weapon upgrade:Picking up a Panzershreck  Falls have specialzed lines when they carry a Panzershreck.

The real life Volksgrenadiers of the Wehrmacht were all centered around veterans from divisions destroyed in the invasions of Normandy and Russia. Though properly equipped, the Volksgrenadier squad seems to lack any men with real combat experience, and in fact, share many infamous traits of the Volkssturm, such as being made up of troops unfit for combat and being all-around untrained, being a roughly equal counterpart to the American Rifleman. Oddly enough, while Company of Heroes is assumed to take place in the time that the Wehrmacht was so low in supplies that Volks had to usually provide their own uniform, the Volksgrenadier in the game all wear standard-issue Wehrmacht uniform (M42/M43 feldbluse, keilhosen (service trousers) and M43 cap).Game Info  Volksgrenadier Squads are the most basic Infantry unit of the Wehrmacht. They are produced in the Wehrmacht Quarters, available with no HQ upgrades, and consist of 5 men. As a low-cost, low-efficiency unit, they are best used for protecting support weapons, capturing points, and recrewing- especially after Grenadiers take their place as a real frontline unit. Early game, Volksgrenadiers are a unit of extremes- with their default weapons, they should be kept at as long a distance from enemy units as they can fire from. In a longer-range firefight, a Volksgrenadier unit will typically defeat his Rifleman counterparts and trade blows equally with the Infantry Sections, if they're unsupported. You can also harass Engineer Squads from far out of their firing range- a good way to protect your points early on. When upgraded with MP40s, Volksgrenadiers become a devastating early-game assault force, especially in combination with the Blitzkrieg Doctrine's Assault Grenades. At this point in the game, Volksgrenadiers are most useful for rushing down longer-range units like Snipers, Sections, or Sappers. However, later-game Allied infantry such as Rangers with Thompsons and Commandos, or even Rifles and Sections armed with LMGs, will devastate MP40-armed Volksgrenadiers. Later game, you might want to avoid the MP40 upgrade outright in favor of picking up a better, longer-ranged or anti-tank weapon. In the Mid-game and later, Volksgrenadiers should become much more of a supporting unit. If they see combat at all, it should never be alone. At this point, their only real combat use is some extra strength supporting a better Infantry unit, or as a supporting unit for a tank. If there are any Volks left on the field at this point, however, they're much better suited for capturing and crewing than anything else.Weapons  When a Volksgrenedier squad is created, four soldiers are created with Kar98Ks; the fifth soldier carries a Sturmgewehr 44.Production Barbed Wire Sand Bags Abilities  The Volksgrenadier Squad has one combat ability - \"Panzerfaust\". Of course, as other Wehrmacht infantry units, they can use the Medical Kit. Furthermore, as every infantry unit that can garrison structures, and can turn neutral buildings into Forward Headquarters.Medical Kit  After activation of this ability, soldiers start to recover health. This ability can be used in every place in friendly territory. However, after escalation to battle phase, a better version of this ability, the Field Medical Kit, become available. Then infantry squads will be able to heal themselves even in enemy territory; useful for the offensive commander. Each soldier of the squad recovers health at a speed of 72\u00a072 points per minute. There is however one drawback: from activation the squad's speed will be reduced for 18 seconds. This should be taken under consideration while choosing the moment of activation.Fire Panzerfaust  When this ability is activated, the Volksgrenadier Squad will advance to within 30 meters of the targeted enemy vehicle, and launch a single Panzerfaust Anti-Tank Warhead at that vehicle. The warhead has 100% accuracy against any vehicle, and has no problem penetrating any kind of armour. While the explosion has a radius of 3 meters, it will deliver the vast majority of the damage at the point of impact. The basic damage delivered by the weapon is 75 points of damage - enough to kill an infantryman, but not do much damage to a tank. Fortunately, the game multiplies this by 2.25, to a final value of 168 points of damage, whenever an enemy tank or other heavily-armored vehicle is hit. Even M3 Halftracks and M8 Greyhounds receive extra damage, though not as much. The Panzerfaust won't destroy a tank (unless it's significantly damaged already), so it's mainly used when the Volksgrenadier Squad is flanking a target that's already under attack from another unit from another direction. Two Volksgrenadier Squads firing at the same medium-vehicle (like a Stuart Light Tank) can destroy it outright. This ability allows Volksgrenadier Squads to act as anti-tank infantry when necessary. Although this ability has a high munitions cost, the trade-off is that the team doesn't need to lug around an anti-tank weapon which would diminish its anti-infantry capabilities.\u00a0Upgrade to Forward Headquarters Upgrades  Volksgrenadiers can be upgraded with MP40s to improve their antipersonnel abilities at close range.MP-40 Sub-machine Gun Veterancy  Like other Wehrmacht units, Volksgrenadiers gain veterancy through infantry veterancy upgrades available at the Kampfkraft Center. If a whole squad is lost, a new one will still have those obtained upgrades. In their case, veterancy improves only their survivability and defensive capabilities. These bonuses are cumulative to each other. It is worth noting (although this has nothing to do with their veterancy), that when Wehrmacht enters into skirmish phase, their capturing speed is increased by 25%.Description  Cobbled together from a diverse background of German cultures, the Volksgrenadiers have the reputation of being dangerous even in the face of adversity. While effective at close range with their MP40 sub machine guns, the Volksgrenadiers possess the ability to utilize panzerfaust anti-tank weapons. These light and disposable armaments are a deadly means of combating Allied armour.Tips Weaknesses  Although large in numbers, Volksgrenadier Squads are not as combat effective as their Allied counterpart. Riflemen Squads upgraded with the BAR Automatic Rifles can defeat them easily, as such most Allied commanders immediately get the BAR to keep Volks down. As they received little training, they are also lack morale. They can be pinned down from heavy fire such as machine guns more quickly than the highly trained Grenadiers. However, Volksgrenadiers do NOT lose defence from being suppressed and pinned unlike other infantry. Like other infantry, the Volksgrenadier Squads are fairly vulnerable to any form of attack unless under heavy cover.Combat History(Campaign)  The first encounter with Volksgrenadier Squad in the US Campaign is during the first mission-Omaha Beach. Although large in numbers, they were unable to stop Able Company from clearing the beach head. When two of their 88mm Flak 36s were destroyed by Able Company, the Volksgrenadier Squads, along with other infantry retreated. For the British, during the mission D-Day +1, 3rd Battalion(Boudica's Boys) launched an armour offensive to take the town Authie. 12th SS Panzer Division's Volksgrenadier Squads along with Grenadier Squads tried to hold the line and attempt to push the 3rd Battalion back using their infamous panzer such as the Marder III, StuG IV assault gun and the Panzer IV. Combined with tanks, infantry and the 25 Pounder Gun Howitzer artillery, 3rd Battalion was able to defeat the 12th SS Panzer Division and secure the town of Authie. In the Panzer Elite campaign, Kampfgruppe Lehr was training newly formed Volksgrenadier Squads when suddenly a massive airborne assault took place. All of the Volksgrenadier Squads in that mission place themselves onto the 20mm Flak 38 or the 88mm Flak 36 to shoot down Allies fighter bombers and prevent any British Airborne troops from pushing out of Wolfhenze. They are used as gun crew instead of regular infantry. Volksgrenadier Squads, despite having poor combat performance, make plenty of appearances in most scenarios in the game. In one scenario on CoH Opposing Fronts, a Volksgrenadier tries to calm his squad member from stress by giving him a puffof his 'ciggy', only to be brought down by an instant gunfight. In the end, instead of a Volksgrenadier, a Commando picks it up, smokes it and says \"This Hun Ciggy isn't half bad!\" which indicates the Commandos had killed the stationed Volksgrenadiers. They also make plenty of appearances in the heat of combat, from manning the anti-aircraft gun to attacking Dog Company during the mission of the Red Ball Express.Quotes  When assembled: When selected: When wounded and selected: When given move order: When wounded and given move order: When given halt order: When given retreat order: When given attack move order.: When entering a building: When entering a building, in combat: When leaving a building: When leaving a building, in combat: When ordered to move for a long distances: When under attack: Under attack, when wounded: When selected, in combat: When given retreat order, in combat: When given attack order, in combat: When given attack order on vehicles: When encountering specific units: When reinforced back to full strength: When selected multiple times: When upgraded with MP40:88mm Flak 36 AT/AA  88mm Flak 36 or Flak 88 is an Axis Defensive Structure featured in Company of Heroes and Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. It provides direct anti-vehicle and general medium artillery unit fire.Game Info  88mm Flak 36 or 88mm Flugabwehr-Kanone 36 is an anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery gun fielded by both the Wehrmacht and Panzer Elite for heavy defenses.Wehrmacht  Constructed by the Pioneer Squad once Axis Commander chooses the Defensive Doctrine.Panzer Elite  Constructed by the Luftwaffe Ground Force once Axis Commander chooses the Luftwaffe Tactics.Overview  Designed as an anti-aircraft weapon in the 1920s, the FlaK 36 model was brought into use as a multi-purpose field gun by the German Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). It later developed its fearsome reputation during the early stages of WW II, especially at the Battle of France and in the service of the German Afrika Korps. The 88mm FlaK possessed high muzzle velocity, as it was initially developed for anti-aircraft use. However, the 88mm FlaK mount was designed such that it was not restricted to this role: the barrel could be depressed below horizontal, unlike most other AA weapons, and sights suitable for direct fire were included as part of the weapon. Later, armour-piercing (AP - actually APC) rounds were developed as well and issued alongside the standard HE rounds. As such, the 88mm FlaK served equally well as an AA gun, AT gun and a field artillery piece. Particularly in the AT role, the high muzzle velocity and large calibre allowed the gun to penetrate thick enemy armour at a tremendous range with chilling accuracy. Allied forces learned to fear this do-everything field piece. In Company of Heroes, the 88mm Flak 36 can only be used in its direct-fire role against ground targets (it also automatically engages aircraft), therefore losing its use as an artillery piece. In spite of this, it's a truly devastating emplacement when set up correctly. Generally no unit is safe from the Flak 36, unless it is taken quickly, from close range and preferably from behind. Against infantry and buildings, the cannon deploys HE shells to devastating effect. Squads may be slain by a single shot and most structures will quickly fall under the withering fire of the FlaK 36.Strengths  The gun's range and calibre should always be respected outmost, as it is one of the longest firing weapons in the game, especially if the gun is being spotted for by another unit; its range and power will decimate any would be attackers. Each shell delivers a massive 225 points of damage on impact - easily one of the highest damage values among all weapons, roughly in the same category as heavy artillery shells. Most vehicles and light tanks will be destroyed in one or two shots; heavier tanks will be soon knocked out before they can come in range, and fire upon the gun. Penetration values for this weapon are all but perfect. At a range of 30 meters (just below sight-range) it has a 90% chance to pierce the front armor of an M26 Pershing, the heaviest Allied vehicle. Needless to say, at this range it will also pierce the front armor on an M4 Sherman with absolute precision. The chance of penetration drops with range, reaching 45% against the Pershing at 75 meters, and 22.5% at 100 meters. This gun has a maximum fire-range of 100 meters - the longest range of any direct-fire weapon. Naturally, the gun's sight-range is much lower (35 meters, like most other units), so it must utilize forward spotters in order to acquire such far-away targets. The gun is also accurate enough to actually hit its targets at this distance, with a 100% base accuracy against almost all vehicles at up to 75 meters, dropping to 90% at 100 meters. In other words, it will be able to snipe at tanks parked almost 1/4 of the map's length away from its position. Tanks entering the 75-meter zone around the cannon should expect to be hit and penetrated by the weapon. Even infantry are also extremely vulnerable to the large area of effect of the shell's explosion. Initially, the gun had a reasonably-high chance to hit infantry at most ranges; this was reduced considerably in one patch and then some more in another. Still, the 2-meter blast radius ensures some damage to infantry hiding behind cover - if the gun manages to hit that cover. A good tactic with this gun is to place one or even several at the end of a chokepoint (such as a long narrow road or a bridge) and have a camouflaged sniper spotting for the gun at the other end of the point. It is also advised to have infantry protect the gun in case something manages to make it through by luck, If applied correctly, this strategy can wreak a lot of havoc upon enemy commanders.Veterancy  The Flak 88 is a crewed weapon, it gains veterancy through researching Vehicle Veterancy Upgrades, available at the Kampfkraft Center. Each cannon battery, which is already on the battlefield, or will be built, receive proper upgrades. It is worth noting, that this is a support weapon, and if it has been decrewed, and remanned again, it will retrieve the upgrades. These bonuses are cumulative to each other:Weaknesses  As the Flak has a slow rate of fire and turn speed, any would be attack is advised to use this to their advantage when taking the gun out. If you have no other choice, keep your units spread out and use flame or explosives to de-crew the gun quickly. Try to use any hills or buildings to your advantage as this gun is a direct-fire unit and therefore can be outflanked or avoided by using said terrain. Sniping is considered the best method of de-crewing the Flak 88, as (said before) the unit's slow rate of fire and turning, can be easily exploited by the sniper. If the sniper is not shooting from a direction the cannon is facing in, the cannon will not be able to turn to face the threat before the sniper re-cloaks. An American paratrooper squad, landed directly on the Flak 88, is also an effective method of decrewing the gun. The gun will not fire at the paratroopers until they land, giving you time to run around the gun while the paratroopers fire. \u00a0As an added bonus, the crew can then man the gun and reinforce their own squad on the fly. An alternative strategy is to throw a satchel upon landing and retreating before the gun can turn to meet them.Other information  If you do manage to de-crew the gun, either scuttle it or crew it yourself and turn it on the Axis player foolish enough to abandon it. The last thing you want to see is the flak cannon you disabled minutes ago, with a fresh crew on it, spitting more shells at you. It should be noted that when the one of the crew members die the guns rate of fire is decreased due to overtaxing the efforts of the crew and after the second member is killed the third will dismount and die on his own.Grenadier Squad  The Grenadier Squad is a heavy infantry squad, fielded by Wehrmacht in Company of Heroes. It is a standard Infantry squad produced in the Krieg Barracks or formed from casualties treated in an Aid Station.Overview  The Grenadiers are the standard Infantry of the German army, some of the best trained and equipped troops in the world. By this point, these troops are mostly veterans from the last few years of the war, with new recruits levied since 1943 generally pressed into service without the harsh training regimens the Grenadiers once faced. This is true in Company of Heroes as well: It becomes very quickly apparent that Volksgrenadiers are nothing more than a stopgap for this unit. Though slightly more expensive than their Tier 1 counterparts, the Grenadiers are superior in every way but squad size, being a flexible, tough, general-use squad for almost any purpose. It can be reasonably assumed that with these factors in mind, you will see the Grenadiers in almost every battle involving the Wehrmacht. Most of the strengths of the Grenadiers revolve around their upgrades. With 2 weapon slots, Grenadiers have the option to take the Anti-Tank Panzerschreck or Anti-Infantry MG42, both dramatically increasing their performance on the field for these roles. Effective use of this squad relies on these upgrades, particularly with regards to distribution.Weapons  By default, the Grenadier Squad is equipped with 1 StG-44 (the commander version with worse performance than the full-auto version) and 3 Karabiner 98 kurz rifles. Two of the rifles are replaced upon weapon upgrades.Karabiner 98k  As the standard infantry of the German army, it is no surprise that the Grenadiers start with the standard rifle, the Karabiner 98 kurz, and use the weapon more effectively than any other soldier. Being a Bolt-Action Rifle, the K98's bolt must be cycled after every shot. It uses 5 round clips, which are quickly reloaded when expended. Each connecting shot inflicts 15 points of damage. The interval between shots is about one second resulting in considerable damage output. At maximum range, 35 meters, each bullet has 45% chance to hit the target. At normal engagement range, 20 meters, this chance increases to 65%. This makes the Grenadier's K98 one of the most accurate guns in the game, and only outclassed by sniper rifles in long-ranged combat. Like most weapons, the Kar98k suffers from a high accuracy penalty when fired on the move. It is recommended to only move the Grenadier Squad during firefights if evasion or cover are required.MG42 Light Machine Gun  One of the two Upgrade-based weapons, the LMG variant of the MG42 (using a bipod and magazine rather than tripod and belt) gives the Grenadier squad substantial automatic firepower, though less than the heavier tripod-mounted version in terms of rounds per minute and suppression. This weapon fires 15-30 bullets per burst, with a 3-3.5 second interval between each burst. After seven or eight bursts, the weapon needs to be reloaded, which takes about 7 seconds. Each hit inflicts 5 points of damage. The nature of the weapon means that it has lower accuracy than a Rifle, with around 40% at most ranges, making up for this in sheer volume of fire- this will ultimately do more damage per second than the K98 will at all by the very maximum range of the weapon. Unfortunately, the MG cannot be fired on the move, rendering it far better on defense or when supported by other more mobile close-combat units. When an Grenadier with MG42 is killed, there is a 30% chance of the weapon being dropped and becoming abandoned. Other infantry squads (including enemies) with sufficient weapon slots can then pick this weapon up.Panzerschreck  The Panzerschreck, an Anti-Tank Rocket Laucnher, is the alternative to the MG42, made to deal with vehicles rather than Infantry. A Panzerschreck warhead inflicts 120 points of damage per hit, needing to be reloaded after every shot. It has only average accuracy- at 35 meters, each rocket has only 35% chance to reach the targe, increasing at short range. In terms of penetration, the Panzerschreck will consistently be able to pierce the armor of all Allied vehicles save the M26 Pershing (45\u00a0% chance for penetration), or Churchill (52%). It is worth noting that a Panzerschreck is almost useless against Infantry, with the low splash radius and rate of fire reducing its role in Infantry combat to attacking troops in buildings or structures or demolishing heavy cover. When an Grenadier with Panzerschreck is killed, there is a 30% chance of the weapon being dropped and becoming abandoned. Other infantry squads (including enemies) with free weapon slots can pick it up.Production  Grenadier Squad can construct basic field defenses, allowing them to build infantry choke points and fighting positions.Barbed Wire  Barbed Wire consists of thick metal wires littered with spikes sharp enough to pierce human flesh. In-game, Infantry squads will make no attempt to go through wire and will simply attempt to go around it like they would with standard obstacles found commonly in the maps. This lets you prevent enemy Infantry from taking certain paths, useful for slowing their movement, forcing them to pass defenses, or entirely restricting their access to certain parts of the map- keeping in mind that your own infantry are also not allowed to move through. It is moderately resistant to firepower itself, though will not stop bullets from passing through either side. Most vehicles can simply run over wire, destroying it instantly. Enemy Engineers and friendly Pioneers can dismantle Barbed Wire outright. While Barbed Wire is an important tool for a Wehrmacht commander, keep in mind it's usually better to construct it with less directly valuable units like Volksgrenadiers or Pioneers.Sand Bags  Sand Bags are man-made cover for infantry. Infantry units behind sand-bags are in \u00a0Heavy Cover, making them less vulnerable to direct damage and Suppression. They are also slightly less vulnerable to explosives and artillery fire compared to troops in the open. Like Barbed Wire, Sand-Bags also act as infantry obstacles. They give passing-by enemy infantry units a good place to take cover as they move, and therefore are not as effective in preventing movements as Wire, though it has the advantage of not being able to be cut by Engineers or Pioneers. Given the nature of Grenadiers, they work well with sandbags- as long-range and generally static units, they can generally deal with enemies before they themselves can come close enough to the sandbags to benefit. They also allow them to survive against enemy armored vehicles longer to do more damage with Panzerschrecks, if applicable. However, once again, it is better to have a less important unit do the duties of their construction- though Grenadiers will be able to build them or assist in their construction in a pinch.Abilities  The Grenadier Squad has only one combat ability \"Throw Grenade\". Of course, just like other Wehrmacht infantry units or weapon teams, they can use Medical Kits and can convert garrisoned buildings into Forward Headquarters.Medical Kit  After activating this ability, the Grenadier Squad starts to recover health. This ability can always be used in friendly territory- however, after escalation to battle phase, a better version of this ability, the Field Medical Kit become available, allowing infantry squads to heal anywhere on the map. Each soldier of the squad recovers health at 72\u00a072 points per minute. There is one drawback: From activation squad's speed will be reduced for 18 seconds. With such a small squad but expensive per man (75 manpower per member), it is important to keep their health high as often as possible.Throw Grenade  After the Throw Grenade ability is activated and aimed, the Grenadier Squad will attempt to move towards the target. Once one of the squad members is within 25 meters, he will pull out a M24 Grenade and lob it at the target spot. If the target is already within that range, the closest squad member will throw it. The grenade is not perfectly precise, but will land nearly exactly where the ability was targeted every time. 1.2 seconds after the grenade hits the ground, it will explode with a damage output of 40. The radius of the explosion is 4.5 meters, though the damage quickly falls off outside of the center. Infantry in buildings take additional damage, even if they weren't physically near the grenade as it went off. The Grenade is a good weapon for Infantry, though its slow timer means it works better against static targets- especially Weapon Teams, which are unlikely to be able to move in time. Grenades do respectable damage to light vehicles in the rare occasion they hit them- though only small damage against armored targets. Grenadiers should use their Grenades very liberally- they are cheap and unlikely to do damage to friendly targets given their low blast radius. There is almost always room for at least one good grenade in an Infantry vs. Infantry encounter.\u00a0Upgrade to Forward Headquarters  When a Grenadier Squad enters a neutral structure inside captured and connected territory, this ability becomes available in the structure's menu. Activating this ability begins a 30-second upgrade period, at the end of which the building will be converted into a Forward Headquarters. A forward HQ can reinforce and produce units just like an HQ structure, based on the buildings a Wehrmacht player has constructed so far, seen on this table: These units cost the same amount of resources as they do when produced from their corresponding base structures. They will appear next to the Forward Headquarters when production is completed. A Forward HQ must be in friendly territory to continue operation, though if an enemy captures the sector it's in, it is still marked as a Wehrmacht building, and must be either \"uncaptured\" or demolished.Upgrades MG42 Light Machine Gun  Grenadiers can be upgraded with this advanced anti-infantry weapon if they have at least one open weapon slot. This upgrade is drastically increases their anti-infantry capabilities, but their mobility is slightly decreased. Up to two such weapons can be deployed for each grenadier squad. Any Grenadier unit expecting to face serious Infantry resistance should invest in an MG42- with 2 being a good option for a purely defensive squad or in battles where you will be facing multiple special infantry units like Rangers or Commandos.RPzB 54 Panzerschreck  Grenadiers will be equipped with the RPzB 54 Panzerschreck anti-tank launcher if they have an open weapon slot, giving the Grenadier Squad the ability to fight enemy armor though sacrificing some Infantry fighting potential to do so. Each squad can be equipped with up to two of these weapons. Any Grenadier squad expecting to see enemy vehicles at any point should be fitted with a Panzerschreck, as a Grenadier Squad has no ability to defend against Tanks or Armored Cars otherwise. This not only makes them more self-sustaining, it also allows them to play a part in Tank vs. Tank fights. Equipping 2 is a good way to have an Infantry-based Anti-Tank squad more suited for offense, as opposed to the slower, more defensive PaK 38.Veterancy  Grenadiers gain veterancy through infantry veterancy upgrades at the Kampfkraft Center. These upgrades are cumulative, and effect both existing and newly created units. While an unupgraded Grenadier squad will be able to match most early-game Allied units, higher Veterancy allows them to stay relevant later on in the game, particularly in the late, where better armor and 20% bonus health will allow them to survive long enough in Tank battles to fire off Panzerschreck rounds or deal with supporting Enemy infantry.Tips Weaknesses  Grenadiers are tougher than the average soldier, but are still made of flesh and blood. The traditional weapons strong against Infantry are strong against the Grenadiers- Fire, Snipers, or any sort of artillery. Snipers in particular are a constant danger- given the Grenadier Squad's small size, a single soldier brought down to a Sniper is a 25% reduction in combat efficiency, and unless dealt with or retreated, a Sniper can kill a Grenadier Squad outright in short order. In addition, while the Panzerschrecks are good weapons against vehicles, most specifically anti-Infantry vehicles such as the M3 Halftrack with the Quad MG upgrade or the Stuart with Canister Shot can severely damage or even outright kill a Grenadier Squad before they can even fire a single shot off. In addition, Grenadiers kit out with two of the same upgrade are easy prey for the opposite enemy- basic, unupgraded Riflemen will usually beat Grenadiers with 2 Panzerschrecks in a fight and a squad with dual MG42s cannot even touch a heavier vehicle- they're even less threatening than Volksgrenadiers, who at least have a Panzerfaust to fall back on. These squads are large investments in and of themselves- 300 Manpower for a new squad, and 150 munitions to get it properly kit out means that a loss of a single Grenadier squad can be a major disaster for a Wehrmacht player. Seal the deal when you can- even losing a basic Infantry squad or a vehicle can be worth it if it takes out the Grenadiers in the process.Quotes  When given a move order in battle: When under attack: When selected in battle: When facing suppressive fire: After recovering from suppression: When leaving a building: When badly wounded: While receiving upgrades: Receiving upgrades in battle: While encountering specific units: When pinned: When issued with retreat order: While leaving production building, which is under attack: Selected, when suppressed:Panzer Grenadiers  The Panzer Grenadiers squad is the core Infantry unit fielded by the Panzer Elite in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. A small unit of 3 men, it is initially both very expensive and very vulnerable. However, the number of available Global and Local Upgrades for improving the effectiveness of this infantry squad is truly staggering, and by the time they are all researched the Panzer Grenadiers become one of the best infantry units in the game, and can specialize in anti-infantry or anti-vehicle combat as well. They are excellent in large groups, and are often used in support of (or supported by) the various Panzer Elite vehicles.Overview  The Panzer Elite army is unique among other factions in that it fields a large variety of vehicles, but only one type of infantry. These are the Panzer Grenadiers, a squad of elite soldiers who alone must simultaneously fill all the infantry roles in their army. They are the core infantry unit, the engineers, the tank busters and assault riflemen... whatever must be done at any given moment. Initially, the Panzer Grenadiers are a 3-man unit, fielded from the Panzer Elite Headquarters for the price of 255\u00a0255, 3\u00a03. They are outfitted with Kar98k bolt-operated rifles, which have good accuracy at long range but an abysmally slow reloading speed. With only 3 men per squad, a single squad of Panzer Grenadiers is no match for the average core infantry fielded by other factions. As the primary engineers of the Panzer Elite force, Panzer Grenadiers are responsible for constructing all four Panzer Elite Base Structures. They also have the ability to repair vehicles and structures, which they do at a significantly-reduced speed compared to normal engineering units. Furthermore, while they can capture Strategic Points, they do so at only 75% speed of other infantry units, making them unsuitable for early expansion. That task is often relegated to the fast-moving Panzer Elite scout vehicles. Nonetheless, each Base Structure the Panzer Grenadiers build has at least one Global Upgrade that enhances the effectiveness and versatility of the squad. Among other things, it is possible to unlock no less than 3 different combat abilities, 2 weapon upgrade packages, increase the size of the squad to 4 men, and apply a large number of interesting bonuses to increase the performance of all Panzer Grenadier squads. Additional combat abilities and construction options may become available through the purchase of Tactical Doctrine Command Upgrades. By the end of the upgrading process, a squad of Panzer Grenadiers will have become one of the best core infantry units in the game - and in large groups they are even individually deadlier. Panzer Grenadiers also accumulate Veterancy like all other Panzer Elite units, and benefit quite a lot from each level they receive. A Panzer Grenadier squad with full veterancy can often destroy a basic infantry unit twice their size. Furthermore, the game also allows purchase of pre-upgraded Panzer Grenadier squads called the Tank Buster Heavy Infantry and Assault Grenadier Heavy Infantry. These are variants of the basic Panzer Grenadiers that come with a weapon upgrade already installed, costing 105\u00a0105 more than the basic unit but removing the need to purchase a 75\u00a075 upgrade which takes 30 seconds to install. They are otherwise the same as any other Panzer Grenadier unit. These variants are purchased directly from the appropriate base structures. On the battlefield, Panzer Grenadiers are used in many different ways depending on their selected weapon package (or lack thereof). They often accompany vehicles, or are supported by vehicles, especially Infantry Halftracks which allow them to move around faster and reinforce out in the field. Panzer Grenadiers can also create stationary Reinforcement Points by converting neutral buildings into outposts. Tactically, Panzer Grenadiers like to swarm their targets, rather than fighting face-to-face. Panzer Elite armies that focus on Panzer Grenadiers will tend to create large groups of them, splitting the group up as a combat situation evolves to present more targets coming from more directions, thus using the small size of these units to their advantage.Weapon Upgrades  On top of their wide variety of combat abilities, the Panzer Grenadiers can specialize further by acquiring one of three weapons upgrade packages. The first upgrade, the Gewehr 43 Package, is available to any new Panzer Grenadiers squad, and enables the squad to serve as a fire team for pinning down enemy troops. The other two upgrades, MP44 Sturmgewehr and Panzerschreck, only become available when the player acquires specific base buildings and/or Global Upgrades, and provide anti-infantry and anti-tank specialization, respectively. A squad of Panzer Grenadiers may only purchase one of these upgrades, at which point it becomes permanent until the unit is destroyed. There is also an alternative method to purchase a Panzer Grenadiers squad with an upgrade already installed. See more on this below.Gewehr 43 Package  This upgrade is available from the start of the game. When installed, it will add two Scoped Gewehr 43 long-range rifles to the unit's equipment, replacing two of the Kar98k rifles the squad carries by default. These long-range weapons are slightly more accurate than the default weapons, and since there are only two of them the performance of the squad is not significantly increased. Still, this cements the Panzer Grenadiers squad as a long-range anti-infantry unit. More importantly however, this upgrade unlocks the Suppressive Volley Fire ability for the unit. It can use this ability to quickly suppress any enemy infantry unit, forming the \"fire\" part in the \"Fire and Maneuver\" tactic by pinning down the enemy while other units (preferably MP44-equipped Grenadiers) moves in to destroy the pinned enemies. Note that after (or before) this upgrade is selected, the unit can still pick up one more abandoned weapon with an Open Weapon Slot requirement of 1. It's best to seek out an LMG to increase the squad's long-range performance, if you can find one.MP44 Sturmgewehr (Assault Rifles)  This upgrade becomes available once a Panzer-J\u00e4ger Kommand structure has been built. When installed, it will add four MP44 Sturmgewehr assault rifles, better known as \"StG 44\", replacing all of the unit's default Kar98k rifles. Although four MP44s are added, the fourth weapon will only appear once squad sizes are increased. With this awesome assault rifle, the unit becomes extremely useful against other infantry squads in close-range combat. Coupled with high Veterancy and other performance-enhancing upgrades purchased at the various Panzer Elite base structures, these MP44-equipped Panzer Grenadiers can easily wipe out any other infantry unit in the game simply by rapidly closing the distance with them. At close-range, the Panzer Grenadiers will almost always come out victorious. There is an alternative to acquiring this type of squad without paying for this upgrade: recruit a unit of Assault Grenadier Heavy Infantry from the Panzer-J\u00e4ger Kommand structure. This creates a unit of Panzer Grenadiers with the MP44 Sturmgewehr upgrade already installed - though it costs 105\u00a0105 more. Note that this upgrade leaves you with one Open Weapon Slot. However, picking up an additional weapon after purchasing this upgrade will get you nothing - it will not appear on any of the men. However, if you pick up a 1-slot weapon before purchasing this upgrade, you'll get to keep it (with the rest of the men receiving MP44s). Again, an LMG is the most suitable choice, if you can find one.Panzerschreck  This upgrade becomes available once the Kampfgruppe Kompanie Upgrade has been purchased at the Kampfgruppe Kompanie. When installed, it will add a single Panzerschreck anti-tank launcher to the squad, replacing one of the default Kar98k rifles. This accurate and hard-hitting anti-tank launcher can easily take out enemy light vehicles, and a few shots will destroy a medium vehicle. Additionally, it has a fairly good chance to penetrate a tank's front armor, not to mention the sides or rear. With a few Panzerschreck-equipped Grenadiers surrounding an enemy tank, it will quickly be destroyed. There is an alternative to acquiring this type of squad without paying for this upgrade: recruit a unit of Tank Buster Heavy Infantry from the Kampfgruppe Kompanie structure. This creates a unit of Panzer Grenadiers with the Panzerschreck upgrade already installed - though it costs 105\u00a0105 more. This upgrade only takes up 4 weapon slots, so you can pick up an additional 1-slot weapon before or after acquiring this upgrade. A second launcher, if you can find one, would usually do best. Note that if you take the Tank Destroyer Tactics: Double Infantry AT Efforts Command Upgrade, the Panzerschreck upgrade changes a little. If you have 5 weapon slots available, the upgrade will add two Panzerschreck launchers to your team, taking up all 5 of those slots. If the unit is already holding some 1-slot weapon, only one Panzerschreck will appear.Production  As the Panzer Elite's only basic infantry unit, the Panzer Grenadiers are responsible for all base construction. They can build 4 different types of structures, all of which must be placed within your HQ Territory. Initially, only two of these structures are available; as soon as one is built, all four structures become available. With the Scorched Earth Tactics doctrine, Panzer Grenadiers gain the ability to construct very resistant Road Blocks to prevent enemy movement, as well as the Barbed Wire.Logistik Kompanie Kampfgruppe Kompanie Panzer-J\u00e4ger Kommand Panzer-Support Kommand Road Blocks Barbed Wire Abilities  Panzer Grenadiers are by far the unit with the most Special Abilities available in the entire game. Initially having no abilities other than Rudimentary Repair and Convert to Reinforce Point, they begin acquiring abilities as more and more Global Upgrades are purchased from the various Panzer Elite base structures. Additional abilities are acquired from Tactical Doctrine Command Upgrades, and one ability becomes available thanks to the Gewehr 43 Package upgrade. Once all available infantry-related upgrades have been purchased from the various base structures, the Sprint ability will also become unlocked.Rudimentary Repair  By default, all Panzer Grenadiers and their derivatives squads can conduct repair on friendly vehicles and structures. To do so, either click the ability button and select the target to be repaired, or right-click on the target directly. The Panzer Grenadiers will move to close proximity and begin to repair the target. This continues until the target reaches 100% health, is destroyed, or moves sufficiently far away from the Panzer Grenadiers to discontinue the action automatically. Rudimentary Repair is a very slow repair ability compared to that of other engineering units. The Panzer Grenadiers will repair 2.25 points of damage per second, less than half as fast as an Engineer Squad or Pioneer Squad, making them (together with the Kettenkrad) the slowest repair unit in the game. While they are repairing, the Panzer Grenadiers are three times more vulnerable to damage. Therefore, if you must make repairs during combat, try to retreat the damaged vehicle away from the fighting before administering repairs. Also note that during repairs, your Manpower income is decreased by about -5\u00a0-5 per minute, a negligible amount overall, unless performing repairs on many vehicles simultaneously. This ability allows Panzer Grenadiers to repair the Panzer Elite vehicle fleet. Since they usually accompany other vehicles into combat, once the fighting is over they can start repairing all surviving vehicles in preparation for the next attack. It is often best to keep one or more Panzer Grenadiers on an Infantry Halftrack so that they can reach damaged vehicles at the front lines quickly, though a Kettenkrad will perform the same function with just 1\u00a01 consumed.Advanced Repair  Once the Kampfgruppe Kompanie's Advanced Repair Global Upgrade has been purchased, this ability will replace the Rudimentary Repair ability on all Panzer Grenadier units and their derivatives. Functioning the same way as Rudimentary Repair (see above), Advanced Repair is simply faster - much faster. The Panzer Grenadiers will repair 6.8 damage points per second, making them almost 40% faster than an Engineer Squad or Pioneer Squad! Remember that while repairs are underway, the Panzer Grenadiers are 3 times more vulnerable to damage. With this ability, Panzer Grenadiers can quickly return your vehicle fleet to combat readiness after a fight, in lieu of Kettenkrads or a Bergetiger Repair and Recovery Vehicle. This makes them useful both during combat and after it.Upgrade to Reinforcement Point Throw Incendiary Grenade  When this ability is activated, select a ground target. The Panzer Grenadiers will move to within 21 meters of the target, and then lob a single incendiary grenade at it. The grenade detonates with a force of 10-15 damage points, barely enough to hurt an infantryman. However, it will spray a burning substance in an area of 5 meters around the impact site, which will inflict continuous damage over a period of about 15 seconds. It takes about 10 seconds to kill an infantryman if he stays inside the radius of the fire. Incendiary grenades are useful against Weapon Teams and Infantry in buildings, since these can't get away from the flames very quickly. While they can also damage structures and vehicles, incendiary grenades are not terribly useful against such targets. Due to the long cooldown time of this ability, it's recommended to escort your Panzer Grenadiers with a Munitions Halftrack, which will cut that cooldown time to mere seconds. The same effect is bestowed inside your HQ Territory once the Defensive Operations Global Upgrade has been purchased at the Panzer Elite Headquarters.Throw Anti Tank Grenade  When this ability is activated, select a ground target. The Panzer Grenadiers will move to within 20 meters of the target, and then lob a single anti-tank grenade at it. The Anti-Tank grenade explodes with concentrated force, causing between 100 and 150 points of damage to whatever it hit. Due to the contained nature of the explosion, it will only cause damage within a small radius - preferably to an enemy vehicle. This explosion has a 100% chance of penetrating the armor of the struck target. This makes it a very useful weapon to lob at enemy tanks, even though it would take several of these grenades to destroy a tank. With several Panzer Grenadiers throwing Anti-Tank Grenades at an enemy tank, it is sure to be destroyed or at least heavily damaged. Unfortunately, the small explosive radius means that the Anti-Tank Grenade is not useful against buildings, and rarely against infantry in the open. Due to the long cooldown time of this ability, it's recommended to escort your Panzer Grenadiers with a Munitions Halftrack, which will cut that cooldown time to mere seconds. The same effect is bestowed inside your HQ Territory once the Defensive Operations Global Upgrade has been purchased at the Panzer Elite Headquarters.Throw Two Anti Tank Grenades  This ability is identical to the Throw Anti Tank Grenade ability, except when this one is used, two grenades will be thrown at the target, one after the other. This increases the damage potential of the ability from 100-150 damage points to 200-300 damage points. This means that two or three uses of this ability are enough to take down the average medium tank. The only caveat is that it requires the tank to be holding still, since it takes more time to throw two grenades than just one. Fortunately, this ability also costs the same amount of Munitions as Throw Anti Tank Grenade, meaning that nothing is lost by obtaining this ability. Due to the long cooldown time of this ability, it's recommended to escort your Panzer Grenadiers with a Munitions Halftrack, which will cut that cooldown time to mere seconds. The same effect is bestowed inside your HQ Territory once the Defensive Operations Global Upgrade has been purchased at the Panzer Elite Headquarters.Suppressive Volley Fire  When activating Suppressive Volley Fire, select a target enemy Infantry unit. Your Panzer Grenadiers will move to within 35 meters of the target unit, and open fire at it with their weapons. Once this occurs, for a period of 5 seconds the target unit will receive a -2\u00a0m/s penalty to its movement speed, forcing it to move very slowly if at all. Additionally, the Panzer Grenadiers receive a set of modifications to their combat statistics for a period of 15 seconds: As a result, the target unit will be unable to return fire or move away to cover. This naturally works best when the target unit is in the open, and not in cover or garrisoned inside a building (where it receives protection from suppression). You can capitalize on this by moving another unit to flank the target and destroy it (MP44-equipped Grenadiers or Assault Grenadier Heavy Infantry work best for that). This is called \"Fire and Maneuver\", and is one of the most basic infantry tactics in real world infantry combat. Mortar Halftrack can also be used, as it's great against stationary targets. Due to the long cooldown time of this ability, it's recommended to escort your Panzer Grenadiers with a Munitions Halftrack, which will cut that cooldown time to mere seconds. The same effect is bestowed inside your HQ Territory once the Defensive Operations Global Upgrade has been purchased at the Panzer Elite Headquarters.Sprint  The Sprint ability is one of the last abilities to become unlocked for the Panzer Grenadiers, if for no other reason than the fact it requires 6 Global Upgrades to be purchased from the various Panzer Elite base structures. When Sprint is activated, for a period of 15 seconds the unit will receive only 50% Suppression from any source. In addition, it will not react to large explosions (where normally the soldiers would hit the ground or escape the explosive radius), and the soldiers will run at full speed regardless of terrain constraints or group formation. Use these 15 seconds to either run past or directly into a source of suppressive fire, like an enemy Machine Gun. While the soldiers are not made vulnerable to incoming fire, they'll be able to reach cover or assault the suppressing unit in short order, lessening the casualties they would otherwise sustain. This ability can also be used to withdraw to a safer position without having to hit the \"retreat\" button. Note:  If you are gonna use Sprint to charge against a source of suppresive fire, take in consideration that Sprint does not make the Panzer Grenadiers squad completely inmune to Suppression. Although the ability reduces the Suppression the squad recieves by 50%, if the source of Suppression is not quickly eliminated, or the Panzer Grenadiers squad stops reciving fire from such source, they will eventually be suppressed once again.Booby Traps (Basic)  When the Booby Traps (Basic) ability is activated, select a target neutral building. The Panzer Grenadiers will enter the building, and set up two packs of explosives rigged to a booby trap. This process takes about 10 seconds to complete. They will then exit the building automatically. A bomb icon will appear over the building, and be visible to all Axis players, but not Allied ones. If at any time an enemy infantry unit enters the building to garrison it, a message will notify all players than a Booby Trap has been triggered. Each of the explosive devices rigged to the trap will explode within 2\u20136 seconds of this message (each explosive gets its own random delay time). The explosive charges are rather small - with a 6 meter radius, but causing only 60 damage - just powerful enough to kill an average infantryman. Therefore, each bomb will usually kill one or two enemy soldiers standing close together inside the building - if there are that many. The bombs will do almost no damage to the structure itself. A building can be rigged repeatedly every time it becomes neutral. Note that the cooldown time is so short, it's likely that the ability will be available again as soon as you're done installing the explosives. You can wire a whole row of buildings in about a minute.Booby Traps (Advanced)  This ability will replace the Booby Traps (Basic) ability once unlocked. It functions almost exactly the same as the basic ability, with one important difference: You may now booby trap friendly or neutral Strategic Points. These booby traps will detonate whenever an enemy unit attempts to capture the wired point. Friendly units will not trigger the explosives. This ability uses the same explosive devices for Strategic Points as it uses for buildings. It will generally kill at least a few of the soldiers attempting to capture the point. The increased installation and cooldown times are negligible in most cases, though they may make booby-trapping an entire set of buildings take more time. Once this ability is enabled, your Panzer Grenadiers can spread out through your territory to booby trap all sector points you control. You may even use Infantry Halftracks to get them to neutral strategic points closer to the enemy's base, and booby trap those. By killing enemy infantry so early in the game, and denying points to the enemy, you can earn a significant early advantage.Scorched Earth  When the Scorched Earth ability is activated, select a neutral or friendly Strategic Point. Your Panzer Grenadiers will move to that point, and when they reach it they will blow it up. As a result, the sector becomes permanently neutral, providing resources to no one. Some enemy engineering units (including the Panzer Grenadiers themselves) can undo the effect of the Scorched Earth ability, by approaching the target point and repairing it. However, it takes 40 seconds to return the Strategic Point to a workable state, and then more time has to be spent to actually capture it. There are several uses for this ability. Firstly, if your infantry needs to withdraw from a sector, you can Scorch the point to make sure the enemy can't easily take it, while you organize a counter-offensive. You can also do this pre-emptively, creating a \"no man's land\" between yourself and the enemy's front lines, or disabling a high-value resource point to prevent the enemy from benefitting from it. This sort of strategic engineering fits very well with overall Panzer Elite operations. Just make sure you don't scorch too many points - you do need some resources, after all. There's an interesting combination you can attempt, between this and the Booby Traps (Advanced) ability. You can render a point neutral, then quickly booby trap it before retreating. When the enemy sends his units to \"un-scorch\" the point, they will be killed by the trap, further prolonging the effort required by the enemy to restore and re-take the point. You may even get the chance to booby trap the point again before the enemy sends another unit to repair it. Note that scorching and booby-trapping can take in excess of 20 seconds to complete - it should not be attempted during battle.Other Global Upgrade Effects  Alongside all the abilities and upgrades unlocked for the Panzer Grenadiers through Global Upgrades purchased from base structures, the Grenadiers also receive several passive bonuses. These are meant to slowly improve the effectiveness of the Grenadiers, turning them from one of the weakest infantry units in the game to one of the strongest. This section covers the various Global Upgrades that grant these bonuses.Logistik Kompanie: Increase Squad Sizes  This is perhaps the most important Global Upgrade for the Panzer Grenadiers, and becomes available very early on. This Global Upgrade increases the Maximum Squad Size of all Panzer Grenadier squads and their variants. Instead of 3 men per team, they may now contain 4 men per team, which means a 33% increase in their combat effectiveness - not to mention the survivability of these squads. New Panzer Grenadier squads will come with 4 men by default. The price of purchasing a squad does not change at all, still costing 255\u00a0255 per squad (360\u00a0360 for specialist squads). The Population Cap requirement, however, is increased to 4\u00a04 per team. Existing 3-man Panzer Grenadier teams do not automatically receive a 4th man, only the potential to reach 4 men. In other words, they must be reinforced by moving them to a Reinforcement Point, Infantry Halftrack or any other reinforcing structure, and paying the normal 45\u00a045, 1\u00a01 to add the extra man. With this upgrade, Panzer Grenadier squads can remain in combat longer before having to retreat to avoid being destroyed. They have 33% more firepower too. Furthermore, thanks to the per-man bonus radiated by the Group Zeal upgrade (see below), that upgrade is significantly more useful now. If you're going to base your strategy around the use of Panzer Grenadiers, consider getting this upgrade as early as possible.Kampfgruppe Kompanie: Field Craft  As mentioned earlier, the Panzer Grenadiers are capping Strategic Points at 0.75 speed of what is normal. Therefore, rushing your Grenadiers out to the field to capture points quickly may be problematic. Not only will it take them more time, but also means they need to remain vulnerable for longer periods while capturing. The Field Craft Global Upgrade solves this issue to some degree. It increases the sector capture rate of Panzer Grenadiers to 125\u00a0% of the normal infantry capture rate, which is decent. Furthermore, Field Craft grants Panzer Grenadiers the important passive ability of detecting Mines. Whenever a Panzer Grenadier unit stands still for 3 seconds, it will gain a mine detection radius of 10 meters around itself. This enables it to detect nearby minefields. As soon as the unit begins to move, the ability disappears. Note that the ability does not work for Panzer Grenadiers garrisoned inside buildings or vehicles. This Global Upgrade is useful early on if you wish to concentrate on Panzer Grenadiers instead of Kettenkrads or Scout Cars for the task of quickly capturing territory - though both vehicles usually handle this task better. With the mine detection ability, the Grenadiers can periodically perform reconnaissance of enemy positions and major roads, to detect any minefields that may impede an advance.Panzer-J\u00e4ger Kommand: Group Zeal  The Group Zeal is a unique Global Upgrade, which is applied individually to each and every member of a Panzer Grenadier squad. When this upgrade is purchased, each infantryman will radiate a \"Group Zeal\" aura in a radius of 10 meters around himself. This aura augments the combat performance of every infantryman within the radius by a small amount. Each soldier within the Group Zeal radius gains the following bonuses: Again, these bonuses are radiated by each individual grenadier, and apply to each individual grenadier within the radius. The bonuses are cumulative with each other, so a single infantryman receives the same bonus from each and every other infantryman within a 10-meter radius. Examples: Note that some diminishing returns are involved, i.e. the more Group Zeal bonuses an infantryman receives, the less effective each bonus is, though by a very small amount. With this bonus, large groups of infantry become significantly more survivable, so using your infantry in concentrations becomes quite advisable. However, this is a double-edged sword, because a large group of infantry is also very vulnerable to artillery shelling, which can easily wipe many of them out. Nonetheless, even a single squad of Grenadiers enjoys this bonus, as explained above, so there is little reason to avoid grabbing this upgrade.Panzer-Support Kommand: Veteran Sergeant  This is a very straightforward upgrade that is immediately applied to all your Panzer Grenadier squads once purchased. It gives your squads the following bonuses: The Suppression bonus should be pretty self-explanatory: it allows Panzer Grenadier squads to endure more suppressive fire before entering \"Suppressed\" or \"Pinned-Down\" state. Therefore they should have an easier time assaulting enemy Weapon Teams (especially Machine Guns) to kill them with MP44s or grenades - whatever's available. The Veterancy bonus is also quite important, because it shortens the amount of combat the squad needs to do in order to attain the massive bonuses granted by the higher Veterancy levels. A squad reaching Veterancy level 3 is extremely potent, and thus more survivable. Additionally, this bonus means that the loss of a veteran Panzer Grenadier squad (a common occurrence due to their small size) is a little less woeful because a new unit won't take as long to reach the same Veterancy level. This upgrade becomes available later in the battle, since it is purchased from the Panzer-Support Kommand. Nonetheless, aiming to acquire it as early as possible may be a great boon, allowing you to create awesome veteran Panzer Grenadier squads at a time when enemy units are struggling to field anything larger than a halftrack. Even later, when tanks are on the field, suppression-resistant Veteran Panzer Grenadiers are still quite fearsome - especially Tank Buster Heavy Infantry or Panzerschreck-equipped Grenadier squads...Veterancy  Like all other Panzer Elite units, the Panzer Grenadiers squad can attain 3 levels of Veterancy, by accumulating experience points from the killing of enemy units. As it gains levels, its performance will increase proportionally.Accumulation  The Panzer Grenadiers use the Panzer Elite Shared Veterancy system to accumulate Veterancy points. In this system, units share experience from their kills with each other, within a certain radius. Each kill the Panzer Grenadiers squad makes will grant it 100% of the experience value of the killed unit. In addition, it will pass 50% of that value to any Panzer Elite units within 35 meters of itself. Vicariously, the Panzer Grenadiers receive 50% of the experience value of kills made by other Panzer Elite units within 35 meters.Bonuses  Every time the Panzer Grenadiers gain a level, you'll be asked to choose which Veterancy Upgrade you wish to apply to them - either a Defensive bonus or an Offensive bonus, but not both. You can choose a different bonus at each Veterancy level, if you want. The bonuses described below are specific to each level. Due to the way they are applied on top of each other, when computed together (see below) they may or may not add up as you may expect. When these bonuses are computed together with each other as well as the unit's basic statistics, the results at each level are as follows: *Click button at top right corner to expand.Tactics  The Panzer Grenadiers are the core infantry unit of the Panzer Elite force. Unlike other armies' core infantry, the Panzer Grenadiers are pretty much the only infantry unit you can recruit (barring Luftwaffe Tactics infantry), which means they need to be able to handle all tasks often relegated several different infantry units in other armies. As a result, each Panzer Grenadier squad is expected to be able to perform a wide variety of tasks. They must build base structures, repair damaged vehicles, capture sectors and defend them, and assault enemy positions alone or with armor support. To this end, Panzer Grenadiers are one of the most versatile infantry units in the entire game, and possess so many abilities that you may have had to scroll for 10 seconds just to get to this section of the article. Furthermore, with each Weapons Upgrade you can give the Panzer Grenadiers, their function and application becomes very different. A Gewehr 43 squad is used very differently from a Tank Buster Heavy Infantry squad. What this means is that any discussion of how to use Panzer Grenadiers can take forever - describing each variation of the unit and when to use any of the 11 special abilities that this squad can perform (not to mention construction...). Therefore, there is no point to attempt such a discussion here. Instead, this tactical section describes how Panzer Grenadiers work as a group, and how they are used together with infantry. Read the various portions of the article above to learn more about special upgrades and abilities.The Panzer Grenadier Platoon  One important difference between Panzer Grenadiers and other core infantry units is the size. Panzer Grenadiers are initially 3-man teams, and there's more to this numerical statistic than may seem obvious. But this doesn't necessarily mean that a Panzer Grenadier squad would always be outnumbered by its enemies. Instead, Panzer Grenadiers are best used when they are grouped together into Platoons. A Platoon is a group of two or more (preferably more) squads of Panzer Grenadiers. Instead of roaming the map alone, they are grouped together, move together, and fight together. The mentality behind this is that when they are treated as a single unit, two squads of Panzer Grenadiers cost about as much as another army's Elite Infantry unit (like a Ranger Squad or Commandos), have as many men, but have the \"ability\" to split up into two smaller groups when needed. Together the two squads can stand up to other core infantry units, but when necessary they can use this \"splitting\" to provide fire from two different angles, or use basic infantry tactics called \"Fire and Maneuver\" (explained below). This approach to the use of Panzer Grenadiers is further supported by the fact that later on, Panzer Grenadiers receive additional bonuses simply for being close together (an ability called \"Group Zeal\"). Also, when squad sizes are increased from 3 to 4 men per team, the cost of each Panzer Grenadiers squad does not change, resulting in 33% larger platoons with no cost-related drawbacks. By grouping your infantry squads together, you can also keep them all supported simultaneously - by attaching a Munitions Halftrack and/or Infantry Halftrack to the group. Munitions Halftracks will follow the platoon using their \"Maintain Supply Range\" ability, enabling your Panzer Grenadiers to recharge their grenade attacks much more often, and thus increasing overall offensive strength. The Infantry Halftrack provides the infantry with the ability to reinforce even during a battle, increasing the survivability of each squad within the platoon.Fire and Maneuver  This is a basic infantry tactic that the Panzer Grenadiers are exceptionally useful for. When a platoon makes contact with the enemy, one of the squads begins engaging the enemy from behind cover at long range. This squad is called the \"Fire Team\". The use of a Gewehr 43 team's Suppressive Volley Fire is especially recommended. An LMG-equipped squad is also terrific for this role, assuming you can find any LMGs lying around. Once this starts, the other squad in the platoon can maneuver around the enemy unit, and attack it from a different angle - preferably one in which the enemy cannot hide. This is the \"Assault Team\", and for this role you'd want an MP44-equipped squad, though again LMGs seem to work fine too. What happens is that the enemy unit, suppressed by the Fire Team, dives for cover and becomes unable to escape or return fire properly. The Assault Team can then safely flank its position, and quickly wipe it out. While \"Fire and Maneuver\" can be executed by any two infantry squads, the advantage here is that you're using only two small squads with (relatively) minimal resource cost to get the same result that would otherwise require two expensive 5-man or 6-man squads. That is especially true thanks to the weapons available to your Panzer Grenadiers, since both the Gewehr 43 and MP44 are almost entirely designed to perform this maneuver. It shouldn't be surprising that due to the evolution of the MP44 design into all modern Assault Rifles, \"Fire and Maneuver\" is the most fundamental infantry tactic used by modern armies as well. It's a quick \"one-two punch\", and can easily allow a Panzer Grenadier platoon to take out infantry units much stronger than itself. Note that the same tactic can be used against vehicles, provided you have a Panzerschreck (instead of MP44s) for the assault team. Try to get in real close with the target vehicle, to avoid missing with the Panzerschreck. Always remember the Incendiary Grenades and Anti Tank Grenades, if you have them. Use these to handle unexpected problems during the assault, such as the enemy retreating into a building.Weaknesses  Although they start out as a pretty basic infantry unit, with average weapons and statistics, the Panzer Grenadiers eventually become one of the best - if not the best - infantrymen in the game. However, the Panzer Grenadier squad has one lingering problem: it's small. A 6-man unit, for example a Riflemen Squad or Commandos, that loses three men in combat can retreat to base and reinforce those men, without losing any upgrades or accumulated veterancy. A 3-man team however cannot afford to lose three men, as it will be destroyed, losing everything it has acquired up to that point. Therefore, while they may be fierce fighters, the loss of a Panzer Grenadiers squad is more frequent - especially when confronted against anti-infantry weapons or large explosive shells. As a result, Panzer Grenadiers can be considered more vulnerable to all weapons that infantry normally fear. As a result, whenever a man or two are lost, the team needs to withdraw from combat immediately to avoid being destroyed. Also, remember that Panzer Grenadiers have no counter-measure against Suppression after it has already been accumulated. They can use Sprint to avoid receiving suppression, but that's only useful as for prevention rather than treatment. If a squad is suppressed or pinned down, it may be better to retreat than lose the unit.Variants  This article refers to the Panzer Grenadiers as both the core infantry unit of the Panzer Elite, and as the only infantry unit they can field apart from special Command Tree abilities. And yet as you play the Panzer Elite, you may notice that there are actually two other infantry units you can produce: the Tank Buster Heavy Infantry and the Assault Grenadier Heavy Infantry units. The reason these are treated as \"nonexistent\" as far as this article is concerned is because both units are simply different ways to get the same result as an upgraded unit of Panzer Grenadiers, costing more Manpower but less Munitions and time. For example, a unit of Panzer Grenadiers with the Panzerschreck weapon upgrade is for all intents and purposes identical to a unit of Tank Buster Heavy Infantry in terms of combat performance, weapons, etcetera. Once created, the only discernible difference between these two units (other than the name) are the uniforms they wear, with the Tank Buster Heavy Infantry in a slightly less visible brown outfit. The same goes for Assault Grenadier Heavy Infantry and a Panzer Grenadier unit with the MP44 upgrade. Why do these \"separate\" units exist, then? The reason is the difference in resource costs. Remember that it costs 75\u00a075 to acquire the MP44 or Panzerschreck upgrade for a unit of Panzer Grenadiers. It also takes 30 seconds to install this upgrade. In contrast, both \"heavy infantry\" units come with the weapons upgrades already installed, saving time and valuable resources. In return, you must pay more Manpower to recruit a Heavy Infantry squad. They cost 360\u00a0360 each, compared to the Panzer Grenadier 255\u00a0255 - a 105\u00a0105 difference. It's up to circumstances to determine whether spending more Manpower is worth saving Munitions and time. The end result is virtually identical, right down to special abilities, veterancy, and bonuses acquired from Global Upgrades. Everything in this article referring to Panzer Grenadiers can therefore be construed to refer to Heavy Infantry units as well.Quotes  On troop creation\u00a0: On unit selection\u00a0: On halt order\u00a0: On move order\u00a0: On attack move\u00a0: On garrison order\u00a0: On withdraw order\u00a0: On vehicle mount order\u00a0: On vehicle dismount order\u00a0: On attack order\u00a0: On kill report\u00a0: On retreat order\u00a0: On construction order\u00a0: On construction order\u00a0: On repair order\u00a0: On repair complete report\u00a0: On booby trap order\u00a0: On booby trap complete report\u00a0: On scorch order\u00a0: On throw incendiary grenade order\u00a0: On throw anti tank grenade order\u00a0: On sprint order\u00a0: On weapon upgrade order\u00a0: On weapon upgrade complete report\u00a0: On capture order\u00a0: On capture complete report\u00a0: On veterancy upgrade order\u00a0: On underattack report\u00a0: On pinned report\u00a0: On reinforcement complete report\u00a0: When encountering specific units: When raining: On repetitive unit selection:Commandos  Commandos, or the Commando Squad, are a 6-man Elite Infantry unit fielded by the British army in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. This unit can be created behind enemy lines, and is one of the strongest close-combat infantry units in the game. It is used for disrupting enemy tactics and assaulting enemy positions, and has a significant number of special abilities to aid it with this task.Overview  After the withdrawal of the British Army from the European mainland in 1940, and the beginning of the Battle of Britain, British military command began looking for a way to attack the Axis on their own territory. The result was the creation of independent Commando units, which were inserted in various ways into German-Occupied Europe to carry out raids and sabotage missions on enemy assets. Army Commandos were highly-trained, and wore a red beret to distinguish them from the rank and file. The British Commandos in Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts are 6-man Infantry squads with superior fighting capabilities and a plethora of useful abilities. They are available only to the Royal Commandos Support company, and require the Glider-Borne Commandos upgrade. Commandos are not produced by any of the British Command Trucks. Instead, the player must first land a Commando Glider on the map for the price of 560\u00a0560 (more than twice as expensive as an american riflemen squad). This glider will produce one unit of Commandos automatically, and can produce more of these for 510\u00a0510, 6\u00a06 if the sector it's in is ever connected directly to your HQ Territory. Commandos are Elite Infantry, armed initially with Silenced Mk.II Sten Sub-Machine Guns (though they can pick up abandoned weapons). This gives them superiority in almost all one-on-one infantry combat situations, especially if the Commandos can get in close and personal. Often landed behind enemy lines, Commandos have several powerful abilities that allow them to cause significant damage to enemy assets, then disappear into the fog of war to avoid enemy counter-attacks. They can work entirely on their own, disrupting enemy movement and harassing their rear positions. In larger groups (or coupled with other airborne assets) they can be used to assault weak points in the enemy's defenses, or as a surprise flanking force to assist a British main-armored advance. Foremost of their special abilities is the use of smoke grenades to cover the Commandos' retreat: it allows them to disappear almost instantaneously (with the bonus of temporary camouflage), giving the unit time to freely flank an enemy or to disengage from combat entirely. Commandos can also throw grenades, and can plant powerful manually-triggered demolition charges. Like other British Infantry units, Commandos can also construct Slit Trenches to defend themselves. Given the right Command Upgrade, they can also set up Detectors for Radio Triangulation deep inside enemy territory, in order to monitor enemy unit movement. This also allows the Commandos to know which areas to avoid, and easily slip between enemy patrols. Given all this, a Commando unit can easily survive prolonged periods of time behind enemy territory. If the situation permits, several units of Commandos and other similar units can band together to perform very powerful strikes at the enemy's rear, disappear into the shadows, regroup, and repeat as necessary.Weapons  A squad of Commandos is initially armed with 6 Silenced Mk.II Sten Sub-Machine-Guns. These are good close-combat weapons, and the squad's numeric superiority often allows it to wipe out enemy infantry if it can get close enough.Silenced Mk.II Sten Sub-Machine-Gun  This is a relatively poor SMG in terms of speed, with the Commandos taking longer breaks between their bursts than most other SMG-equipped infantry. It can fire 5-7 bursts of 10 bullets before reloading, which requires 3-4 seconds. In addition, each burst lasts 1.25-1.75 seconds. It is average in all other respects. This weapon has a maximum range of 35 meters. However, it suffers a severe loss in accuracy at longer ranges; it has a 75% chance of hitting enemies that are less than 8 meters away, dropping to a 20% percent chance of hitting targets 8+ meters away, and further dropping to a 10% chance of hitting targets 17+ meters away. In addition, each bullet that hits the target inflicts 5 points of damage per hit. Naturally, in close-combat these weapons are still quite fearsome, and a team of 6 men firing long bursts with these weapons at point-blank range will easily take out any infantry squad. The trick, therefore, is to get close enough to the enemy infantry often by using the environment around them or by using special abilities like the commandos concealing smoke ability.Abilities  Commandos have a set of very useful abilities at their disposal. Most important is the ability to pop a smoke grenade, which causes the Commandos to suddenly disappear, allowing them to change their position or disengage. Commandos can also throw hand grenades, and can install powerful explosives to be used either defensively or offensively as required. Commandos can also construct Slit Trenches to use for their own protection. If a certain Command Upgrade is unlocked, they can also build Detectors for Radio Triangulation. Finally, like all other British Infantry, the Commandos can retreat to the Captain's position. However, since they are usually placed behind enemy lines, this is tantamount to suicide in most cases.Withdraw to Captain's Position  Like all other British infantry, once a Captain is recruited, the Commandos can retreat to his current position at any time. As with the normal \"Retreat\" ability common to all Infantry, once this ability is activated the Commandos will leave the player's control and set a direct course for the Captain. The retreat will break any Suppression effects the Commandos may be suffering at the time. Retreating to the Captain's position can save the Commandos from death in battle. The advantage in retreating to the Captain's position is that the Captain is usually closer to the front lines than the Headquarters Command Truck. Once the Commandos reaches the Captain, they'll be on safer ground thanks to the Captain's command bonus as well. Note that since Commandos are usually placed behind enemy lines, using this option may get them killed as they try to run through those lines back towards the Captain. Commandos usually prefer to disengage from combat by using the Concealing Smoke ability instead, which basically removes all suppression effects and turns them invisible for a short duration - allowing an organized retreat rather than a mad run for friendly territory.Build Defensive Structures  Commandos can initially construct a Slit Trench, which will provide them with cover for defending themselves or their Commando Glider from enemy attacks. Once the proper Command Upgrade is unlocked, they can also set up a Detector for Radio Triangulation, in order to monitor enemy movement.Throw Grenade  When the Throw Grenade ability is activated, select a point on the ground. The Commandos will advance to within 20 meters of that point, and then throw a Mk.2 Pineapple Grenade at it. After a delay of about 1 second from the moment it hits the ground, the grenade will explode with sufficient force to kill most infantry within its blast radius, or cause some damage to very-light vehicles. The explosion radius of a Pineapple Grenade is 4.5 meters. It will cause maximum damage (60 points) within 1.5 meters, and then the damage tapers off towards the edges of the blast area. 60 damage is enough to kill most infantrymen. Unfortunately, the explosion is virtually useless against anything larger than a Motorcycle. The best use for this ability is to quickly take out or severely damage an opposing infantry unit, or to remove a Weapon Team threat (especially an HMG squad) with a single blow. Since the Commandos are adept at close-combat, they will usually be sufficiently close to their target to lob a grenade at it anyway, and can then finish the job with their SMGs. Note: While this ability is cooling down, you cannot use Concealing Smoke.Commando Demolition Charges  When this ability is activated, select a point on the ground. The Commandos will move to that point, and take about 7 seconds installing a large demolition charge there. During this time, they are slightly more vulnerable to enemy fire. Once the process is complete, an icon will appear above the demolition charge with the words \"Detonate me!\" emblazoned over it. The Commandos squad will quickly retreat to within 10 meters of the charge. You may click the icon at any time, causing the charge to detonate in a huge explosion. This explosion causes 200 points of damage to anything within an 8-meter radius, then tapering off to about 30 points of damage to objects up to 12 meters away. The large explosion will easily take out infantry, and can damage both vehicles and tanks. It is most potent against buildings, to which it will cause double or even triple damage. Commando Demolition Charges can be used during a raid to quickly destroy an enemy structure or emplacement. They are also excellent for defensive use, as player-activated mines. If you set up several of these within about 10 meters of each other, blowing up one of them will trigger a chain-reaction that will blow them all up. This leads to destruction in a massive area, and can be used very effectively to ambush large tank convoys. A particularly nasty (but effective) strategy would be to plant Demolition Charges on almost every Strategic Point you can reach, denying your opponent the chance to capture your territory and killing any units that attempt to do so. Though the charges can be detected by certain units, most enemies would already be within the blast radius when they spot the charge, and would be as good as dead if you detonate it immediately. Remember to pull your commandos back before detonating the charge. Although they automatically retreat some distance after planting the explosives, you may need to manually ensure that they are sufficiently distant. Note:  A Commando Demolition Charge has its own sight-range of about 10 meters, revealing a small area of the Fog of War. This means that a charge left behind in enemy territory can actually provide some scouting for you! Unfortunately for the Britishers, an applied CDC is clearly visible for the enemy to spot and to avoid. There are even no mine detectors needed.Concealing Smoke  When Concealing Smoke is activated, a smoke grenade will immediately pop over the units' current position. This smoke immediately clears all Suppression effects from the unit, and renders it invisible (camouflaged) for a period of 5 seconds. During this time, the unit can disengage freely from combat, either to execute an organized withdrawal or to relocate to a better position. For those first 5 seconds, the unit can move away freely without the enemy knowing which direction it was headed in. Of course, if it moves forward it may be detected by the enemy anyway (camouflage disabled), so it is often best to back up instead. Then, once camouflage is over, the unit should be well behind the smoke, allowing it to move without fear of being shot thanks to the smoke cover. The smoke itself will last for a total of 15 seconds - easily enough time to retreat back into the Fog of War. Concealing Smoke is a very powerful alternative to a full Retreat. It breaks suppression, puts the unit out of harm's way for a few moments, and leaves it completely under your control while it does so, achieving all the benefits of the retreat without any of the downsides. Use Concealing Smoke whenever disengaging from the enemy, for instance after completing a Commando raid, or in case enemy units have counter-attacked with superior firepower and/or vehicles. Another very good use for Concealing Smoke is to buy time for the unit to relocate in the middle of a battle. For example, the soldiers can rush to cover, enter a building, or even move around to flank the enemy from another angle. Finally, it is always a good idea to pop some smoke when planting a Commando Demolition Charge during battle. It will protect the unit from harm, and conceal their activity from enemy eyes. The tactical use of this ability is explained in more detail further down this article. Note: While this ability is cooling down, you cannot use Throw Grenade.Tactics  Commandos are your primary infiltration unit. They become available first (amongst all other Commando units, at least), and often make up the bulk of the Commando force. While on raids, Commandos will usually take up one of two roles: either flanking enemy infantry and weapon crews to destroy them, or planting demolition charges. In the first capacity, Commandos use their close-combat skills to annihilate enemy infantry units. Due to numerical superiority (6-man team) combined with good short-range SMGs, the Commandos will almost always take out another infantry unit in one-on-one combat, as long as they can close the distance quickly. The best way to get this done is to move around obstacles, garrison a building overlooking the enemy unit, or use Concealing Smoke to disappear and move closer (preferably from another angle, to avoid breaking camouflage too soon). Grenades can also be thrown against enemy HMG crews or other Weapon Teams to take them out quickly, and will work against regular infantry in most situations as well. In the second capacity, the Commandos' Demolition Charges are quite powerful both as anti-building weaponry (capable of obliterating a building, or at least the infantry inside, with one explosion) or as a mine to be detonated when an enemy unit foolishly moves close to the bomb. They can therefore be used to quickly destroy a garrisoned position, or to destroy enemy reinforcements as they rush in to attack the commando group. Commandos can pick up various weapons abandoned by enemies to augment their abilities. The best choice seems to be PIAT launchers, Bazookas or Panzershrecks (whatever is available), as they are the only true weapon it has against vehicles. Brens and other LMGs will augment the Commandos' ability to suppress enemy soldiers or perform long-range fighting. For a more thorough explanation about the use of Commando forces behind enemy lines, refer to the Commando Tactics article.Weaknesses  Although highly trained and heavily armed, Commandos are still classified as light Infantry. They can be suppressed by enfilade fire from heavy machine guns, are vulnerable to artillery strikes and small arms fire, and will not stand up to medium or heavy vehicles. It's best to avoid direct combat with the Commandos, using only flank attacks and subterfuge whenever possible, or otherwise attack only in large groups with varied weaponry. Long-range firefights with enemy infantry should also be avoided. Your Commandos are best close-up and personal, so make sure to run straight at the source of fire in order to take it out - assuming there's no possible flanking move you can try. Use either cover or Concealing Smoke if you want to cross the distance without casualties. Also remember that you are unlikely to reinforce any dead Commandos unless they can reach one of your Command Trucks, which isn't likely to happen early on, especially since Commandos are usually behind enemy lines and cannot easily make it back to your territory. This is less of a problem later, once an HQ Glider has been landed behind enemy lines. Still, a wounded unit of Commandos is very vulnerable, so consider keeping it out of the fight or finding a weak spot in the enemy lines and \"retreating\" right through it.Other Commando Teams  Commandos are a basic unit of 6 infantrymen with Sten SMGs, produced from a Commando Glider. Specializing in anti-infantry tactics and demolitions, they can only perform basic attacks against enemy infantry or emplacements, and would require support units to perform more complex attacks. These support units come in the form of Support Commando Teams, which are spawned from the HQ Glider. To call in this glider, you need the Royal Commandos Support: Glider Headquarters Command Upgrade. A Support Commando Team is a three-man infantry unit equipped with one of three different support weapons: Each of these teams retains the distinctive Commando ability of Concealing Smoke, which allows them to maneuver or retreat into the Fog of War like a \"regular\" Commando team, though they give up the other commando abilities. PIAT Commandos also retain the ability to plant Commando Demolition Charges. None of these teams may throw grenades. The squad members not tasked with carrying the team's unique weapons will carry Sten SMGs as normal for Commandos. Note that there is a big difference between these glider-bought teams and the ones that result when a team of regular Commandos captures the respective weapons:Quotes  In a joking tone: When selected, under fire: Moving under fire: After clicking on them numerous times:", "Battlefield Heroes Wiki": "Battlefield Heroes Wiki Clothes  Clothing are cosmetic items equip-able by all heroes.

They are used to reduce the enemies health to 0. Once this happens, the enemy must respawn, usually at the closest flag to the battle. Weaponry is class-based with all classes being able to wield exclusive weapons while some classes share weapons with another class. Weapons are bought from the store and equipped from the Equip screen. The weaponry in BF:H is different to many modern day shooters, fire-fights last longer and weapons like sniper rifles and knifes are not nearly as damaging as in other games. The same applies to all the other weaponry. This is to lengthen firefights and to take away one-hit kill aspects to help with game balance. All weapons of the Battlefield Heroes are listed below, some may not be available in the store or restricted to Funds.Primary Weapons  You can equip only two primary weapons at a time, so choose wisely! Dual setups may suit better depending on your Ability loadout, but commonly you get one for short and one for long range. Beginners may rely on moderate range weapons. If you like weapons, you'll love weapons!Weapon Sets Black Market Weapon History  All started with the Standard Weapons based on World War 2 weaponry, but there haven't been any range variety for Sniper Rifles, Pistols, Sub-Machine Guns, Shotguns and Machine Guns. Later on came the short and long range versions for these ones, which used same meshes but different stats and sounds. The second extension started with the introduction of the Dapper Weapons in the Heroes Of The Fall update. It seemed that they weren't that popular, so these First Tier reskins weren't available at all ranges. To increase the sale on this kind of items the Second Tier Weapons should give a minor, but real advantage in-game (such as larger magazines or greater critical hit chances) not just the look. As you know they are called Super and Uber Weapons and were introduced during the freeloader whipe called Winter Armistice along with the VP price increases. The level requirement was removed in autumn 2011. The Bad Company 2 Weapons were released several months later and were essentially Tier Two skinned weapons or \"Stylish Ubers\" as one school of thought would put it. The only minor difference is that the BC2 weapons were completely new models rather than simple reskins. In this cross-promotion they were limited to a sniper rifle, a sub-machine gun and a machine gun. Another couple of sets were released around mid-May 2010 which are collectively known as the Black Market Weapons. This third lot of Tier One weapons came out for Royals under the name \"Pilfered Standard\" Royal Weapons and \"Pilfered Stylish\" Royal Weapons, and are essentially the basic weapons and Dapper weapons of the opposing National Army. At some point after the V2 Vengeance / Midnight Mayhem update, some of the Royal Army's basic weapons came up for sale in National stores. These Royal basic weapons were soon followed by the Royals other First Tier weapons series, the Dapper Weapons, and vice versa with the National Army's Tier One weapons available to the Royal Army. Collectively these weapons sets, Royal and National, were known as the Pilfered and Stolen Weapons. At the start of June in 2010, Football Fiesta was announced bringing with it the Golden Weapons which were essentially gold reskined Bad Company 2 Weapons. These Tier Two weapons were only available to players who took part and didn't appear in stores. The late games of the Football Fiesta also brought Pilfered/Stolen Super and BC2 Weapons. To repeat the success of the BC 2 cross-promotion (which gave the highest incomes since very long time), they tried the same procedure with the new released Medal Of Honor. New Clothing with a \"Tier 1\" prefix (Set 1, Set 2) went along \"Tier 1\" weapons with the opposing range of the Bad Company 2 Weapons. With the new scoped Winter Weapons introduced early Christmas 2010 the players got the possibility to enjoy Heroes in some kind of first person perspective. The well known primary weapons of each class recieved a moderate modern reskinned Tier Two version. The scopes give no real ingame advantage because during zoom the spread is nerfed to a higher value. Late Spring 2011 3 complete new weapon sets were brought to the battlefield. The Punk Weapons include Grenade Launchers, modern Shotguns and modern Pistols. The two last named weren't just simple reskins this time, but have complete new stats and behaviour. Also new is that these aren't availible for VP to raise the Battlefunds attractiveness, although they have different stats. Balance alert: May 2011 again two BF [Now Funds]\u00a0only Pirate Pistols were thrown on the battlefield. Not only that they're doing more damage on long range in opposite to their describution, but being availible to Gunners as well. Additionally they weren't tested on the PTE, so it is probable that they will be balanced in the future. Halloween 2011 another weapon celebrated it's release: Machetes which are slow Knives with splash damage were buffed very soon after those who spent Battlefunds\u00a0[Now Funds]\u00a0on this weapon and cried for compensation. Short time later as kind of gap filler between Halloween and Christmas the return of Ninjas and Samurais was coupled with the Rising Sun Weapons setting the spotlight on new RPGs beside new Katanas. As mentioned before, Christmas 2011 brought up completly new weapon behaviours, reminding X-mas history 2009 which hopefully won't repeat this year. Alternate Fire Weapons are suprisingly pretty balanced, although they fall out completely from the classic weapon type assignment. We'll see how this develops... 2012 started with tank harassment: Mayhem Weapons mainly focus at destroying vehicles and burns out the campers out of their seat. The rifle shoots through thickest steel, the wielding tool does the same on close range while the missiles track down enemy planes. The successful Mayhem Weapons were then followed by the new Sniper rifles, known as the Scientists Weapons. However, these rifles were reskins of the\u00a0Slow sniper rifles. For first time in Battlefield Heroes history, blue fire effect were introduced to the game. After the Mayhem Weapons, a new class of weapons was introduced as the Robotic Weapons. The Machineguns, had a slow firing rate but had the special ability to hold 2 fire modes. The main firing mode, is the slow firing rate but exceptional accuracy to it. The 2nd special mode is the Quick-Fire mode and can be used by right clicking and holding the mouse down. The 2nd mode fires insanely fast, but chews up ammo quickly. The Submachineguns namely Destroyer Drone's Kommandant and Brass Bender's Chopper, are similar to the moderate range submachineguns, but have a higher rate of fire. It also has a special abilty to fire a push beam that deals at least 1-30 damage depending on the range.\u00a0 Robotic Weapons werent that much sucess, but new line of weaponry was incoming. Space weapons were introduced, including Eraser Ray and Omega Beamer, new machine gun tools for Gunners (It has got unique ablilities of mid-range specializing and extreme fire rate, and an fire rate wich can fend off enemies quickly, the only minus of this weapon was the fact that the ammo have gone extremely fast), Plasma 45 and Space-Night Special, new Soldier space weaponry (High Fire-rate SMG's with specialization of Mid-Range, and Alternate fire wich despite the description, works best at Close Range) and finnaly Commando's Orbital Punch and Stellar Strike (space fists wich works the same way as uber knive). The accuracy of Laser MG combined with Frenzy Fire of level 5 caused Forums to be overwhelmed by hate, as well it's style of laser weapons became hated. When Space mission ended, cowboy weapons were intoduced. Reskins of Mid-Range Pistol, Long Range Shotgun and Slow Sniper Rifle were all Wild-West themed, and packed with cowboyish feel and models. And what's not to like: They even sound like cowboy weapons. Cowboys crawled back into Wild West and another reskins arrived, this time Sport Heroes!Sources  The weapon guide by M1k3ol was very helpfull to keep overview. The stats are directly from the files and 100% up-to-date including client version 1.45. With the exception that some weapons rate of fire are tweaked such as the short range mg, gamefiles display 900 rpm but in real game it is only capable of 600 rpm. In some cases you do right by multiply by 2/3. (M1k3ol's note: RPM is a game's engine constant, not exactly a \"In Real Life\" representation, in other words, it's a game's RPM which won't represent a stopwatch test). So, weapon's RPMs are correct for the game standards and shoud be taken just as the weapon shooting speed, not an exact number of rounds shot. The Information on the weapons Range and Rate of Fire is available on \"www.battlefieldheroes.com\", where it can be found by hovering the mouse pointer over the weapons icons with the green exclamation marks. These can be found on for example the hero profile pages.Commando  The commando is a class that's invisible, and has a sniper rifle, knifes and/or pistols they are good at precision aim and being sneaky. they take skill and are annoying to play against. Starting HP: 80Soldier  Leading the battle, helping his friends, Brave and strategic,\u00a0the fight never ends... Soldier in Launch Trailer  The Soldier Class is a well-rounded player. His starting skill is Combat Medicine, which allows him to restore his own health as well as his teammate's health to a slight degree. They can also get Burning Bullets, which set targets hit on fire, and Sixth Sense to see an enemy\u2019s outline through obstacles. The soldier's main weapon is the Sub-Machine Guns. The other weapons they can wield are Pistols and Shotguns. Soldiers start with a Shotgun and a medium range SMG, but they are also able to buy Pistols to clear out enemies at long range. Due to that they have the option to choose which type of gameplay they use. They also have the an item called Dr. Ned's needle/Dr. Siegfried's Syringe that allows them to heal their teammates and give them some extra HP. But if they use it on Comandos they will get a bright yellow glow and will be visible to the enemy. Starting HP: 110Tactics  The soldier is the only class that isn't able to run faster than their normal speed without a gunners help. They are at their best in mid-ranged combat, so use Blasting Strike to blow away any enemy infantry getting too close and empty a clip full of burning bullets on enemies while they are in midair. Soldiers are most lethal in groups, especially with other soldiers (where they maximize the use of the combat medicine skill along with extra firepower from ally soldiers) they can also keep up at the same pace with each other so it's easy to move around as a group. Soldiers embody the concept of teamwork.Anti-Tank  Although the Soldier class may not be an Anti-Tank class, it can be put to good use as one if enountered by a tank. Sticky TNT is a power efficient way to eliminate tanks, but due to the fact the it tends to slide off the tank rather than stick, it may not be a very popular choice. Some Soldiers prefer the Grenade over the TNT because the Grenade can damage both vehicles and other infantry. When used against a tank, never throw it straight at the tank, because it will just bounce off. Either throw it on the ground where the tank will roll over it and cause damage underneath, or throw it at the wheels to make the tank suck up the Grenade and deal damage. A correctly thrown grenade can cause anywhere between 19-25 damage, give or take. To maximize the amount of damage done to tanks, a Soldier will want explosive related products. An expert Soldier Tank Hunter will equip the Grenade, Grenade Spam, and the MGL 140 (Nationals) or M32 MGL (Royals). Blasting Strike may be used if one desires to have it in case of an impending tank smash, and widgets such as Bruce's Firebomb (Royals), Sly's Super Bomb(Nationals), and the winter versions, can also be used for producing 70-90 damage per explosion, depending on the position of the bomb and the tank. When attacked by a tank with these widgets, weapons, and abilities, it is smart to use the grenades at a constant stream under the tank. The bombs may also be used as a trap, or in CQB's where the tank may not escape. Use Blasting Strike if you are about to be tank smashed or if in a closed area where the tank can tip over. If the enemy exits the tank, feel free to take it and kill him with it, but be wary of if the enemy is a Gunner and may kill you with his Tank Buster.Shotgun Soldiers  Shotgun Soldiers, occasionally called 'Skirmishers', are a unique breed of Soldier that forfeit the use of Sub-Machine Guns (and, by proxy, the use of Burning Bullets) in favor of close-range combat, utilizing a Shotgun as a Primary weapon, and a pistol as their reserve. After Heroes Of The Fall and the subsequent 'nerfing' of Grenade Spam and the Soldier on the whole, Skirmisher Soldiers are becoming increasingly rare. Skirmishers favor tight maps with lots of blind spots, where they can minimize enemy advantages, avoid snipers and Gunners, and get the drop on their targets. In many ways, a Skirmisher plays like a PK (Pistol/Knife) Commando. Without the use of Burning Bullets, Skirmishers redistribute their points into the remaining skills, primarily Combat Medicine and Sixth Sense. Sixth Sense temporarily removes the disadvantage of being in close-quarters maps, allowing him to see enemy troops through walls. Combat Medicine not only supports the tougher squadmates, but allows the player to bounce back from an attack that went badly.Trivia Gunner  The gunner is the tanker class. He has the most hp and the biggest weapons. Gunners' main weapons are Light Machine Guns and Anti tank weapons such as the tank buster. Starting HP: 150Ranks  Prestige Ranks were introduced during the Heroes Of The Fall update. They are based damage dealt by the player during play. They follow the general order of military titles with private through to general followed by the roman numeral pertaining to their number rank.What are Prestige Ranks and how do they work?  Once your hero has progressed beyond level 10 - by decimating your enemy you start gathering Rank points, which in turn will impress the top-brass and move you onward toward your next rank. As you get promoted from rank to rank, a title will appear below your name for all to see. As this can be somewhat hard to see while fighting for your life, we also added it to your hero's profile page. Also, now your rank shows on the left hand side of your screen, so you don't have to look on your profile. Ranks are earned by damaging your enemy, there are no special requirements for ranks, except for the fact that you must be level 10. Each rank is earned after you have dealt 1600 hit to enemies. The first rank you will receive is the rank of \"Private\", you will work your way through the ranks until you reach the rank of \"General\", but it doesn't stop there. Once you have reach the rank \"General\" and finish this rank you get the rank of \"Private II\" and you will work through that stage until \"General II\", this continues until you get to \"General C\". It is rumored that shotguns and machine guns ranks up much faster, as they fire more bullets faster than other weapons. It's true because the rank is based of the numbers of hit you doing, every 1600 hits, you rank up.More ranks  Quote: Thisassthere This information was given when prestige ranks were released: Why do we stop at 13? Is there ever going to be done anything with the rest?Sources Maps Released Maps  BFHeroes has recently been revived (again) by fans of the game. You can join the discord group and play the game right here: https://discord.gg/GqxxgBjSeaside Skirmish  This vehicle map features six basic areas. The Royal and National backbases, farm, hillside-farm, village and the high grounded lighthouse as tutorial starting point. In between farm and bases, a large open terrain with the small town in the center of it can be found. The town, can be recognized by the large Lighthouse. Seaside Skirmish is disliked by many people. There are many 'Anti Seaside Skirmish' groups found on the Battlefield Heroes Official Forums. The most annoying factor of the map would be the large open area, and the fact Snipers can snipe the entire village. Another thing which annoys a lot of people is the amount of so called 'tank noobs', who basically rule the open areas.Buccaneer Bay  A vehicle map featuring a wrecked pirate ship in the middle of a beach overlooked by a small town. This map has many rocky, hard-to-reach cliffs which are ideal for snipers who favor camping. The battles mostly take place at the shipwreck due to the somewhat spacious area surrounding it.Victory Village  The first infantry-only map introduced into Battlefield Heroes, Victory Village features a church tower which can be accessed by a ladder at the back of the church. Although the church roof and tower has a good view it lacks the essential quality of being quiet and out of the way. There are a lot of homes and other structures making this map a good fun urban map. There will always be a struggle to capture the Roadblock.Coastal Clash  The second infantry-only map released, Coastal Clash features a large Windmill, and two centre points which are rushed at the start of every game. A bridge is also a key factor to this map.Riverside Rush  Although it is the third infantry-only map, it is the first map with the distinction of not having any Jeeps. Riverside Rush has two empty canals which run the length of the map. In addition to this, Riverside Rush does not have a clear signature object. Riverside Rush has canals and Town-like settings. It was known in PTE under the codename \"hOLOCAUST,\"Sunset Showdown  A map that was released on December 17th, 2009, the final day of the infamous Winter Armistice (that was predicted by many). This map features more vehicles than any of the other maps, only 3 capture points instead of the traditional 4, and it's signature feature is the church tower (Similar to the one in Victory Village) that stands in the center of the map. It is also a good sniping point, so there will always be a struggle to capture the center flag, as it is relatively close to the other 2 capture points. It was known in PTE as \"Mayhem.\"Midnight Mayhem  An infantry-only map which can be played in V2 Vengeance mode. It was released on April 18th, 2010. V2 Vengence mode is similar to the King of the Hill mode in other games. The map is timed with a 5:00 Timer for both teams. Whoever can keep the Rocket captured longer, the timer will eventually go to zero, ending the game.Alpine Assault  Originally known in the PTE as \"Woodlands\", this is the first ever to have tanks but not planes. It has four capture points and follows the standard 'Conquest' game-type. It takes place in a dense pine forest or plantation and a saw-mill.It has two points roughly around the same position on the map which are normally hotly contested.Wicked Wake  It's a converted map from older Battlefield games and orientates on Wake Island. The rushing sea and palm trees create an unique holiday flair, not holding Royals and Nationals off capturing the airfield.Perilous Port  Originally called \"Royal Rumble\" in the PTE, the map was released in October 2011 as a halloween-themed infantry map. It has only 3 capture points and takes place in a harbor (or \"port\"). Perilous Port is the only map wich features Halloween props during halloween period.Lunar Landing  Set on the moon, Lunar Landing takes place in a messy landing zone of National and Royal spacecraft. This is the first map to feature alternative gravity, with increased jump height and slowed fallspeed. There is neither fall damage nor parachutes. This is also the only map lacking water.Fortress Frenzy  A map set in the mountains with a medieval theme, featuring a castle next to a small town. The whole area is on a sepearate island within a river and can be accessed by three bridges per faction side. That location is the origin of the earlier codename \"River\". It, like Sunset Showdown and Perilous Port, only has 3 capture points.Inland Invasion  This map is unique, in both style, vehicles and system of playing. At first, Royals have 100 tickets, while Nationals only 75. Also, at start of round, Nationals have every flag captured, while Royals must capture them. Royals, can also ride boats, wich is making them only faction-specific vehicle in game. Royals must capture first two points, in order to unlock next, and then capture the unlocked flag, to unlock other and so on, and so on. After capturing all flags, Nationals cannot respawn, so Royals must kill all Nationals, before they will lose tickets. Locked flag, is indicated by Padlock. This map is also the only map with all vehicles in-game. It was added in 17th of September, along with Veteran Heroes bundles. There is now a midnight version where the roles are reversed with nationals attacking and royals defending. Battle Field Heroes will and always be remembered as a child hood game to all. R.I.P Battle Field Heroes. Sadly Club Penguins stayed and the took away Battle Field Heroes, its all Club Penguins fault. Hopefully are childhood game Battle Field Heroes will return.Unreleased Maps Fork  A very unfinished map which appeared in the PTE files in spring 2010 along side Lowlands. Later it was stated to be dropped in favor of improving Lowlands. Alongside with Lowlands this map was merged together to create Alpine Assault.Lowlands  Another unfinished map, featuring a small city with windmill and a train station, the trademark part of map. Un-textured model of two Gunners could be found near windmill. Alongside with Fork this map was merged together to create Alpine Assault.National Army The National Army  The National Army is one of the two playable factions in Battlefield Heroes and is inspired by Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union.Sniper Rifles  The sniper rifle is a weapon that be wielded exclusively by Commandos. It has the best accuracy of any weapon in the game and can take down almost anything, including Jeeps and Planes when used in conjunction with Piercing Shot, a commando ability which increases the sniper rifles power greatly. The disadvantages to Rifles include problems like, cripplingly inaccuracy without the scope (\"40\" in deviation stat out of scope), often to the point where shots fired will be nearly perpendicular to the rifle itself. This inaccuracy makes Rifles more or less useless for any other purpose besides sniping. Also, use of the scope, which makes the rifle pin-point accurate, forces the player into a first-person perspective view of the scope's cross-hairs, limiting his peripheral vision and making him an easy target for an ambush, as well as reducing the moving speed of the player while scoping. All the snipers have very high accuracy\u00a0but have different firing speeds and recoil. The Bad Company 2 snipers are not the same as the Medal of Honor weapons; the SVD and M95 are slow, and the SV98 and M21 are fast snipers with less recoil but lower damage.Medium Rifles Super/Uber  These snipers are the middle ground between the others, but has less recoil and fires very quickly compared to the slow rifles, although not getting near the fast rifles speed and recoil. The power also increases when hitting the head. The damage for this gun is between 5-24 (no headshot damage included). The sniper is used for the less well-aimed. This type of rifle is least popular among players, although a rising movement is \"quick-scoping\" when a player gets relatively close to the enemy, and with Piercing Shot at 5, quickly kills him (reccommended for the uber/super version).Fast Rifles Super/Uber  This sniper rifles themselves hasn't much recoil, but the damage isn't very strong alone. It can range to 5-23 (no headshot damage included). There are 8 rounds in these snipers (6 for the non-uber/super ones) and they are very reliable. Piercing Shot is highly recommended for effective killing.Slow Rifles Super/Uber  The powerful headshot snipers. The damage isn't that great hitting anywhere else in the body and there is a lot of recoil to this gun. But if you aim correctly and hit the head you could get a very strong hit. This type of sniper ranges from 5-40 (no headshot damage included). This sniper is the most popular snipers around. Piercing Shot is once again high recommended as a damage booster.Anti-Material Rifles  Having a 1 bullet in clip, paired with slow reloading, it's not a big deal. Unless you know, that this gun's damage is Very high! It can shoot around (22-43, no head-shot damage included) but, with 5 level Piercing Shot, it can kill a full health commando in 1 shot (due to damage being lower on smaller ranges, the enemy commando has to be far away for the damage to exceed 80-85, to make SURE that the person dies. In larger maps, in proper positions, it is possible to exceed 90 damage per headshot, taking down commandos with Sarge's Stamina Boost as well). Another great advantage is it's ability to damage tanks, which is especially useful against organized teams. (Doesn't 1 hit anymore)Trivia Royal Army  The Royal Army is one of the factions of Battlefield Heroes. They had peace with the Nationals until the Olimpics, where the Royals accused the Nationals of cheating in the cycling department. Then, the Nationals mocked the Royal's Monarch, especifically his mustache. All of this caused a war between both factions.\u00a0Super and Uber Weapons  The \"Super\" Royal and \"Uber\" National series of weapons are what are known as the first Second Tier Weapons. This means that they perform better than \"Tier One\" basic weapons and cost much more in valor points. These weapons are available for any characters. Look for the differences between the tier stats on the overview page of each weapon type. There was much controversy with the introduction of these Second Tier Weapons because Valor Points skyrocketed, making it hard to afford even a single \"Tier One\" weapon let alone afford an \"Uber\" or \"Super\" one. At the same time, Battlefunds dropped significantly, meaning a player could buy the unlimited versions relatively cheaply in real world money. One need only look through the outrage on the Battlefield Heroes forums to see the effect of this on a game that supposedly gave no advantages to paying players.Trivia  Royal weapons National weaponsLevels  Currently, level 30 is the maximum level in Battlefield Heroes. Players earn experience from play by damaging other players or vehicles, healing teammates, capturing flags or rockets and marking targets.Level System  This overview shows how many XP are need to reach the next level and how many Hero Points the hero will have after each Level in total: A hero can still earn XP after level 30 to get prestige ranks. Prestige Rank can continue to increase until General C (C=100).Bundles/Savage Heroes  The fourth and most likely last part of the Summer Of Heroes Campaign.Royal Royal Cruel Spoils of War  Cruel Spoils of War can contain rare pieces of the Cruel Barbarian Set as well as pieces of the old unreleased Grondolf's Barbarian Set!National National Brutal Spoils of War  Brutal Spoils of War contains a rare piece of the Brutal Ravager Set!Trivia Weblinks References Machine Guns  With a machine gun you fuck up everyone. You make people cry with it! You want that stuff? Maybe you are playing vs a 12 year old and he wants to commit suicide? You dumb fuck.The Cheeser / The Backscratcher  These are the most commonly used variants of Machine Guns. They have a high-rate of fire and can deal good damage at their intended range: very close/right next to the enemy.Tier 1 Elite M249 / Specialist's Tier 1 PKM  Reskins of the Super Cheeser and the Uber Backscratcher. Much more expensive, but has a better look if you don't like the Super/Uber machine gun designs.Max's Magnified MG / Dylan's Destructive Duplex  A short range machine gun, it is capable of shooting a burst of 3 miniature grenades that are the size of small fireworks at an enemy by pressing the secondary fire button (Right Click). These miniature grenades are capable of damaging tanks, planes and infantry with great effectiveness, and deal a lot of damage. (20-30s and even 40s) This weapon, however, is handicapped with a lower than usual ammo count for a light machine gun, sporting 100 rounds as a trade off for the secondary fire. It also deals significantly less damage than a normal short range MG, so if you want to have a chance at doing well with this instead of a normal short range MG, a decent level of Frenzy Fire (3+) is recommended. There is a recharge time of about 3 seconds before you can fire the grenades again. Shooting at vehicles or at walls with the grenade launcher will cause the explosives to stick.Maxwell's Machinegun / Rudi's Ridiculous  This is the standard variant of Machine Gun the player begins with. They provide reasonable damage over all ranges, with a moderate rate of fire and damage per bullet. Players can hold their ground using this gun, while also being able to mow down retreating targets.Scoped Arctic M249 / Scoped Arctic PKM  Reskins of the moderate range machine guns, however, has a zoom-in alternate fire to get a better view of your targets.Omega Beamer / Eraser Ray  A high rate of fire LMG with the ability to employ a short beam of focused energy to fend off anyone who dares come close. These weapons have very high accuracy, and fire slightly faster than the short range Machine Guns. They are best at moderate range, but are seen as overpowered weapons when used with a high level of Frenzy fire, as gunners using them with this ability are very hard to beat due to the high healing rate,The Anchor Drop / The Landmaker  Reskins of the moderate range Super/Uber machine guns, but have added recoil that must be controlled during fights, BUT also adds a higher critical hit chance to the weapon.Bernie's Bone Chewer / Wolfgang's Wonderful  Long range machine guns deal large amounts of damage over medium and long ranges. They have a capacity of 120 rounds, and fire slower than the other machine guns.M249 / PKM  Reskins of the long range machine guns. More expensive, but if you want to spice up your hero's look, or if you don't like how the Supers/Ubers look, these are definitely an option.Brass-Bender's Battle Arm / Destroyer Drones Demolisher  A unique type of MG for gunners. Replacing the forearms of the gunners using them, these MGs are unique for the fact that they have two firing modes. The primary fire mode resembles the LR Machine Guns, firing slowly and best at long range, while the secondary fire is completely new, firing bullets at a blazing rate that is even faster than the short range MGs. However, these MGs deal significantly less damage per bullet when comparing it's primary fire to the long range MGs, and it's secondary fire to the short range MGs. This weapon provides a good challenge to use for those looking for something new or different, but they are not recommended for higher-level use, as they are easily beaten by other MGs.Royal Repeater / National No-End Crossbow  Reskins of the Long Range Machine Guns. Can be useful when ambushing enemies due to its quiet firing sound, and it may take enemies a second to find where you are shooting from because of it.Underworld Relic / Cryptic Hex  They have only 60 ammo, less than Bernies Bonechewer / Wolfgangs Wonderful and even Alternate fire MG's, but a bigger damage output due to shooting two bullets at once. This balances the weapon to shoot exactly 120 Bullets. Additional to that, the weapons have a bullet drop which is quite similar to the Commando's bows' and unique crosshair.Trivia Bundles/Wasteland Heroes  This update caused Vehicle Mayhem, literally. From 25th January 2012 on the streets will be dangerous like never before. The first peaces could be recieved via Claw, short time later the bundles below (without rares) were put in the store. The chance of getting unlimited items randomly in The Claw has been to low in common opinion and so Spare Parts Supply Drops were added in the Hot Deals on 3rd February. Not all of the special items are contained in the drop. On the same day Fashion Victim Awards returned, it's still running to find the best fashioned wasteland hero. All Mayhem Weapons are now out, they all are anti-vehicle orientated.Trivia Weblinks Abilities  Abilities are an integral part to Battlefield Heroes gameplay. They assist the player in enhancing some aspect of their character. They are characterized as being often ridiculous in nature though they are key to outmaneuvering the enemy forces. They boost the players performance and are usually limited in duration, followed by a cooldown in which the ability remains inactive until the period is over. Abilities are class specific and listed below:Abilities and Progression  One of the defining features of Battlefield Heroes that sets it apart from other Battlefield titles is it's extensive range of upgradable abilities. These abilities add an RPG element to the game and rewards diligent players. This obvious strategic advantage is offset by BFH's skill-based match-making system. The abilities temporarily grant players various performance enhancements ranging from the capability to see through walls to shrouding them over a certain range. Abilites increases the depth of stratergy behind gameplay more than giving the player power, as the player is matched against people with the same number of available Hero Points.Unlocking and Upgrading Abilities  Abilities can be increased in power by upgrading them from the main-menu on the abilities screen using their Hero Points. Upgrading is as simple as clicking on the ability's icon to increase it by one point. The maximum level attainable for an ability is level 5. Upgrading can enhance a number of different elements of an ability. It can increase it's effectiveness, increases its duration, decrease it's cooldown period or increase it's effective range or a combination of various aspects. At any time the player may click the reset points button to decrease all their points bar their starting ability (which is reduced to 1 point) to 0 points. The player may then respend their hero points. Abilities can only be equipped when they are at least level one. They can then be equipped into the player's equipment bar.Categories  They are generally split into 3 main categories, with many abilities overlapping categories:Weapon Enhancing and Explosives:  Weapon enhancing abilities may increase the damage output, accuracy or give the weapon a damage over time feature. Explosives give a large damage output in a quick burst of time and are used for suprise attacks on players often being able to be manipulated out of the line of fire. These abilities are highly versatile and are useful to players of all skill levels. Examples of weapon enhancing abilities include: Burning Bullets, Poisoned Blade, Frenzy Fire and Piercing Shot. Examples of explosives include: Grenade Spam, Troop Trap and Explosive Keg.Evasive and Inhibiting:  Evasive abilities grant the player a movement or health advantage, this is essential for flanking enemies, dodging fire and reaching objectives efficiently. These include: Leg It, Stealth and Elixir, Hero Shield, Combat Medicine. Inhibiting abilities inhibit or reveal the enemies movements and actions, this makes enemies easier to hit, easier to counter and easier to escape from. These include: Blasting Strike, Explosive Keg, Sixth Sense, I Eats Grenades and Mark Target.Team Assisting:  Though all abilities assist the player, and in due course the team, some abilities are particularly useful in providing team mates an extra boost to get them to the objective in greater strength. These abilities are often the most important abilities for the class. These include: Combat Medicine, Leg it, Hero Shield, Mark Target and Explosive Keg.Sub-Machine Guns  The most tactically manuverable weapon available, sub-machine guns can deal with almost any job except tanks and planes. Sub-Machine Guns are only available to Soldiers.Tommy's Typewriter / Rudolf's Rescue  This type of Sub-Machine Gun is almost all purpose and the most popular type of SMG that you can buy. It can do a good amount of damage to an enemy at close and even medium range. This gun also has the largest cartridge capacity among Sub-Machine Guns and can help anyone in a difficult sitiuation. It shoots very fast, but is not as accurate as the other Sub-Machine Guns. Nonetheless, it still has decent accuracy for medium range, but it isn't very good at long ranges and can be quite ineffective unless the user has a good level of Burning Bullets to compensate for some of the missed shots.M16 / AK-74  Identical with the Tommy's Super Typewriter/Rudolf's Uber Rescue, so the tactics match one to one. A new skin and sound spice it up.M16-203 Battle Rifle / AK74-30 Battle Rifle  They are the first weapon set out of the Alternate Fire Weapons released during Christmas 2011. Most notable thing is the 3 round burst, high spread and recoil. The damage output is good enough to get fast kills on short range, but it's completely useless on longer ranges. Even with Burning Bullets you won't deal notable damage as it takes much longer to get a first hit and set any enemy on fire. The three round burst makes it even harder to focus on multiple enemies and use Burning Bullets on all of them.Carlsson's Crossbow / Albert's Arbalest  Crossbows that fire in 3 shot bursts with decent accuracy if you can control the recoil, just like the Battle Rifles. Its unique look alone is it worth to drop the battle rifle if you won't miss the single grenade.Charlie's Chopper / The Kommandant  Soldiers of both Factions start out with a default SMG at level 1; Charlie's Chopper for the Royals and The Kommandant for the Nationals. These guns provide a reasonable DPM, over all ranges but are particularly useful at medium ranges, which can be tricky to calculate. Note that you should face short range weapons at semi-long range only to avoid own health loss. The weapon can deal fire in sharp bursts with a tight bullet spread, however, the gun is limited by its rather small magazine. Paired with the weapon's reasonable rate of fire and reload time, this results in a considerable amount of time being spent reloading.Scoped SOF M16 / Scoped SOF AK-74  The behave the same way as Charlie's Super Chopper and The Uber Kommandant but have a scope view which you can access with the right mouse button. Unfortunately the deviation on zoom rises in opposite to a scope's purpose. The stats look bugged, but EAsy never state if this will be fixed or is intended.Brass-Bender's Chopper / Destroyer Drone's Kommandant  The Brass-Bender's Chopper and Destroy Drone's Kommandant are two of the newest weapons released to Battlefield Heroes. The weapons are Moderate/Moderate for range and rate of fire,but I belive from experince its Rate of Fire(ROF) is short.Does have a secondary fire used to damage infantry and to launch them into the air. The alternate fire, is not deal unless you will aim. It deals most damage at Mid-Range, and it takes a long time to fire, due to needeed charge. Each shot, consumes 5 ammo. The Destroyer Drone's Kommandant is a robot style SMG that behaves like the default SMG but has a new fire mode that will exerggartly burst your enemys to dust in case you hit.Space-night Special / Plasma Forty-Five  A medium range laser SMG with the ability to charge up a powerful laser shot to deal damage to targets at long range. Fitting very well to the Astronaut sets. Actually, these are no so seen in-game, beacose of unpopularity of Mid-range SMG's. Also, the beam isn't a big deal, unless you can aim right.Side Feeder / Lucky Sprayer  Same as The Uber Komandant/Charlie's Super Chopper, but with higer critical hit chance and rate of fire, well as recoil, smiliar to the recoil of Battle-rifle.Greg's Greasy Gun / The Wacky Machine Gun  These long range guns fire high damaging rounds. They are very accurate with most bullets following a tight bullet spread around the centre on the cursor. This paired with the slow firing rate means the fire/hit rate of this weapon is statistically high, though the slower rate of fire reduces its DPM. But once an enemy is too close, their power is reduced to barely anything because of the large damage fall-off. The capacity is moderate with 25 rounds, but you don't really need a very large magazine.Tier 1 Elite M16 / Specialist's Tier 1 AK-74  In fact the same weapons like the Greg's Super Greasy Gun and The Uber Wacky Machine Gun apart from the modern skin and sound.Surreal Super Rifle \u00a0/\u00a0Unrealistic Uber Rifle  long range rifle and heavy bomb launcherBundles/Martial Arts & Pirate  These are the suits going along with the BFH Store OpeningRoyal  Broken BundleNational  Neither image no bundle link available.Trivia Classes  Battlefield Heroes is a class based shooter. Like all class-based shooters, it offers a selection of different controllable players. Each class offers different advantages and disadvantages. Battlefield Heroes differs from most other class-based shooters in that there is a strong RPG element as class choice is permanent. Rather than players being able to select a new class on respawn or on game end, the player continues to gain experience with their class or \"hero\" and unlock access to new abilities and weapons.Choosing your class  Class selection begins with Hero Creation, during which you first choose the Faction you want your hero to fight for followed by the Class you want to select. Once chosen, the hero becomes locked onto your account. Initially you may only make 3 heroes per account, but you may make more through purchasing additional hero slots. There are three different classes available to both Factions. They are the Soldier, Commando and Gunner each of whom carry a specific play style. The classes compliment each other when playing as a team and are often punishing to the players when many of one type are used on the same team. The classes match-up against each other in different ways with different loadouts, and as such, there is deep strategy in one on one matchups.Gunner  The Frontline Offensive/Anti-Tank class. He can use machine guns with large amounts of ammo and has a shield that will buff him and nearby teammates from enemy bullets for up to 60 points of additional health. Gunners are the only class that can use Tank Busters, which are medium/long-ranged rocket launchers that excel against Tanks and Jeeps.Soldier  The Support/Medic class that can heal teammates, throw Grenades and use Sub-Machine Guns. Some of their more useful abilities include Burning Bullets, hard-hitting incendiary rounds which set the target on fire, and Blasting Strike, a strange power akin to an explosion which sends nearby infantry and vehicles flying.Commando  The Sniper/Ambush class that can snipe enemies from a long distances aided by the Piercing Shot ability. In addition to this the commando can use Stealth (invisibility) and Knives in surprise attacks from behind to great success. Some Commandos prefer Pistols over Knives or Sniper Rifles. He can also mark enemies, making them easier to kill.Trivia  In total you can level up six different game characters. Three Classes for each of the two Factions.Fourth Class  At this point in time (october 2013), It's quite improbable that a new class will be introduced to the game, since it has been stated by the developers in several threads on the official forum that they're currently not working and not planning the introduction of more classes into the game, and that the main balance is tweaking and re-balancing the 3 main ones.Bundles/Scientists  Those were the new Bundles from 15th February 2012 on. Mad Scientists on both sides, national and royal, are in a race to get to the moon. Pocket Jeeps, spoiled as failed invention in the trailer were later successfully put in the store. A Redeem Code for 10 uses was given out earlier via the newsletter. During this update the first two Scientist Weapons (Sniper Rifles) were released, the rest followed along the matching Robot sets.Trivia Weblinks References Golden Weapons  The Golden Weapons were released at the start of June 2010 as part of the Football Fiesta and were essentially reskins of the Bad Company 2 Weapons. The Golden weapons couldn't actually be bought in the stores. But during the Football Fiesta these weapons were instead acquired by guessing the winner of the World Cup and Europe Cup and buying their facepaint in advance. During Euro 2012 new Golden Guns (which were reskins of some Super and Uber Weapons) were released by guessing the right winner of the Euro 2012 and buying their Jersey in advance. In the summer of 2013 even more Golden Guns were added from which most of were released as Top Up gifts, and then were put into Premium Store, while the rest is unreleased for unkown reasons. The Football Fiesta is back and you can get Golden Guns on 2014.These are the Stolen/Pilfered versions of the Gold Guns that were released in 2010.Trivia  Please add all Trivia which isn't directly related with the golden skin to the original Bad Company 2 Weapons.Bundles/Flyday Heroes  Dr. Pepper Sets April-Juni 2010 The second quarter 2010 they were following the Cliffhanger and Alpiner Sets.

This game was the first US-released Legend of Heroes game since Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes for the TurboGrafx-16.

Avin asks about Eimille only to hear that he doesn't know. Lemuras tells him that there will be a grave situation if he knew about her existence. He tells Avin to deliver a letter to someone in Ourt Village. There, he learns about his home. After getting the letter, someone chases him. That person is Mile. He gets a red marble and then goes back. Sage Lemuras tells him of the Festival of Nepthys, the town deity. Avin joins Mile in finding the two charms and throws them into the pond going the Nepthys' shrine to grant the wish. Avin wishes to see his sister again.

The title has a completely new setting, new characters and even a new game system from previous \"Kiseki\" games. It is also the first game in the Kiseki series to drop the \"Legend of Heroes\" title.Story  In the vast oceans of the Sciencia Seas lies countless islands. The game takes place at the center of the sea, Remnant Island; where shooting stars and ruins continually fall from the skies. For how long this phenomenon has been happening, mysterious stones called \"Star Fragments\" keep piling up on the island near the ruins. By shining a light on them in a certain way, people can see the phantom world of \"Lost Heaven\". On the Isles of Remnant lives Nayuta Herschel, an amateur astronomer who lives on the island with his sister and best friend, Signa. They lived peacefully practicing their sword skills while raised by the happiness of the island's population. But Nayuta dreams of discovering what lies beyond the ocean's frontier to learn the mysteries of the Lost Heaven, the beautiful images seen within the Star Fragments. One day, a mysterious tower ruins landed in the ocean near the island. Nayuta and Signa wanted to investigate the tower where they discovered an unconscious fairy-like girl and appeared before them an elder man accompanied by a masked swordsman. Thus Nayuta's adventures have just begun...Characters Development  According to Falcom, the game was designed towards an entirely unique approach combining both Action and Story RPG elements from both the \"Kiseki\" and \"Ys\" games. Supposed to run on the same engine as \"Ys Seven\", with low-poly characters replacing the Kiseki 2D sprites while the graphics and stage designs compensate for the low resolution. The main distinction other than the \"gears\" theme from the Kiseki games are the substantial variations of the levels from the seasonal changes. The stages are more complex in design and graphical perspective but balanced by the variations of alternating between combat and platforming controls while the story outlines. The battles utilize Nayuta's advantage of his sword skills, accompanied by Nori's seasonal. As the game progresses, Nayuta can learn more \"Gear Arts\" from Master Orbus according to his performance from the number of awarded stars after clearing a stage. Noi, however gains new spells for every high-ranking monster she destroys. While inheriting the controls from the \"Ys\" games, the game makes Nayuta's more basic and maneuverable to balance with the available equipment. The game itself is a mix of traditional elements from previous published franchises with excellent soundtrack courtesy of Sound Team JDK.Notes/Trivia The Legend of Heroes III: Song of the Ocean  The Legend of Heroes III: Song of the Ocean, known as Eiy\u016b Densetsu V Umi no Oriuta (\u82f1\u96c4\u4f1d\u8aacV \u6d77\u306e\u6abb\u6b4c, Eiy\u016b Densetsu Faibu Umi no Oriuta, lit. \"The Legend of Heroes V: A Cagesong of the Ocean\") in Japan, is a computer role-playing game originally developed by Nihon Falcom Corporation.

Even Josette and Kyle notice that it's not like him at all to hijack an airship and demand the ransom from the Queen, and it began after meeting with mysterious guys. The Capuas are eventually defeated and caught by the Brights because of this, and are imprisoned in Leiston Fortress. Later, they become participants in the Grand Arena as a condition to get released from the prison if they win, unfortunately they lose to participants from The Intelligence Division. It is when Josette starts to have a crush on Joshua. By the end of the game, Cassius says that the Capuas escape from the prison during the later coup d'etat.Trails in the Sky SC  The Capua Sky Pirates cooperates with Joshua to help him fighting Ouroboros, and Joshua helps them to get back their airship located in Nebel Valley from the Liberl Army. Josette is often worried about Joshua and makes a promise to him to come back safely if he succeeds with his plan to defeat Ouroboros. She's disappointed when Joshua decides to work together with Estelle again, but jokingly tells him to come back to The Sky Pirates anytime he wants to if he doesn't have feelings for Estelle anymore. After Ouroboros' plan to absorb orbment energies from all areas in Liberl succeeds, The Mountain Lion which flies around The Liberl Ark suddenly doesn't work and falls down to the surface of The Liberl Ark. All Capua members except Josette are imprisoned by Ouroboros' soldiers in The Battleship Glorious. Estelle and the others, who later arrive to The Liberl Ark by using The Arseille, save Josette from the enemies around the airship. She eventually joins the party to rescue the other Capua members from The Glorious. After getting rescued, Kyle tells Estelle and co to accept Josette as a helper while he and the other crews cooperate with The Arseille to help repairing their airship. From this point, Josette becomes a playable character until the end of the game. At the end of the game, the Capua family is pardoned by the Queen who also help to pay their debt. Instead of returning to the world of high society, they decide to start running an air-transportation company, shipping goods in need of fast delivery across the world, with Josette as the company's manager.Trails in the Sky the 3rd  Josette is a fourth character to be summoned in Phantasma and becomes a full playable character. She's often seen together with Kloe, and the two of them become friends. The Sun Door 1 shows The Capuas doing their job as an air transportation company, and more details about why they lost their wealth and status back then. This door also has a shooting mini game where The Mountain Lion must shoot Ouroboros' flying enemies who attack the airship under Gilbert's order.Battle  As a character, Josette is really rather all around below average. Wielding an Orbment gun in combat, she's neither that good physically nor any good magically. The good point is that some of her skills are pretty useful, including a super move that hits everyone and the ability to steal items, and later on a pretty solid normal AOE move as well, and the ability to lower enemy defense. In SC EVO (and potentially the 3rd EVO), she get buffed a bit as her Crafts and S-Crafts get additional debuff effects. Her S-Craft now added Defense and Art Defense debuff if enemies survive on hit, allowing other party members (mainly Joshua on SC) to deal more damage as follow up Arts/S-Crafts.Nayuta Herschel  Nayuta Herschel is the lead protagonist of Nayuta no Kiseki.

It is the primary setting of the Trails in the Sky trilogy.History  Ten years before Trails in the Sky, Liberl was the target of a large-scale invasion by the Erebonian Empire, also known as the Hundred Days War. Peace has been returned by Queen Alicia von Auslese where she established a \"Non-Agression Pact\" between Liberl, Calvard and Erebonia. During the events of Trails in the Sky, junior bracers, Estelle and Joshua Bright are traveling throughout every region of Liberl promote their ranks. While finishing countless quests, they came the conspiracy of a coup d'etat lead by Colonel Alan Richard, one of their father's most trusted subordinates in the Royal Army. It was eventually discovered that the coup was a cover for Richard to enter the Aureole Ruins underneath Grancel Castle, and unseals the Aureole, a powerful and sacred artifact throughout Zemurian legend. In Trails In the Sky SC, the secret society named Ouroboros revealed themselves as the true masterminds behind the coup. They ramped up their operations in Liberl after the first stage back at the Ruins was successfully commenced.Setting  The Liberl Kingdom has control over five main cities: Rolent, Bose, Ruan, Zeiss and Grancel. Liberl is on the western half of the Zemuria Continent. It is flanked by the Erebonian Empire on the north and the Calvard Republic on the east. A diverse country in which culture is bursting, Liberl has both industrial and rural landmarks. It is rich in Septium and thus has superior technological resources for exportation. Each region of Liberl has its own specialty and trade. Rolent specializes in the supplying of timber and mining, Bose relies on tradings with the Erebonian Empire, Ruan focuses on tourism (before, it was fishing), Zeiss specializes in orbments and mechanics, and Grancel is the political capital.Military  Liberl maintains a small army of infantry, patrol ships and airships. Despite Liberl's advantage in orbment technology, the country still cannout outmatch Erebonia nor Calvard in numbers. Instead, Liberl's military relies on seizing the technological advantage to defeat their foes. With two superpowers sharing its borders, Liberl's infantry constantly train to fight scenarios where they're outnumbered. The country invests on its fleet of airships, divided into attack, scout, and transport ships. While the number of available airships isn't mentioned, General Morgan briefly mentioned in the run-up to Operation: Dragon Capture that involves 12 airships (2/5 of the current Liberl air fleet). Within Liberl, two major military centers exist.Regions  The Kingdom is split into five regions, each with its regional capital.Politics  Although a kingdom, Liberl is currently under the leadership of Queen Alicia II. The court is more or less comprised of dozens of nobles, some managing each aspect of the country. In each of the regions of Liberl (save for Grancel), the mayor acts as the governor of the entire province aside from the city. Zeiss, however, is unique as the chief of the Zeiss Central Factory is effectively the mayor for that region. Due to sharing borders with two superpowers, Liberl maintains its pacifism through diplomacy. Grancel houses both the Erebonian and Calvard embassies as the country's means of political communication. Following the Hundred Days War, the country has tried to maintain stable relations between the two superpowers, most especially Erebonia, lest it risks another bloody war.Culture  In the series chronology, Liberl appears as the first country to embrace multiculturalism between the different regions regarding varieties of fashion, food, entertainment, and festivities. Every year since Queen Alicia II's birth, the kingdom gathers for Queen's Birthday Celebration Festival held in Grancel.Education  In Liberl, most children and youths attend Sunday School or other private institutions until they reach 16 years of age as the minimum age for employment.Trivia Nihon Falcom Corporation  Nihon Falcom Corporation (\u65e5\u672c\u30d5\u30a1\u30eb\u30b3\u30e0\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, Nihon Falcom Kabushiki Kaisha) is a Japanese video game company.

Nonetheless, the little cat jumped off from the cart, Avin then jumped from the cart too trying to get the cat. Bellias and his followers arrived and Avin was apparently in trouble. He was saved by Sage Gawaine, but had to separate from his sister Eimelle since Octum's Apostles had already blocked the path leading to the monster cart. Avin was eventually taken to Sage Lemuras safely. After waking up from Sage Lemuras house, Avin was depressed to realize that Eimelle was not with him. He became a cold and wordless boy, until he met another child called Mile from Ourt Village. The two did not start all nicely, as Avin rejected Mile's friendship thinking of only Eimelle in his head. Mile was troubled by Avin's thoughts, and learned Avin's past from Sage Lemuras. The sage encouraged Mile and that they would eventually become closest of friends. At an annual festival of Ourt Village, every villagers could make a wish by dropping a hidden charm to the pond. It is believed that a wish will be granted if the charm falls to the center of this mysterious pond. Avin made his attempt, but failed. As he was saddened by this accident, Mile threw his charm and it successfully reached the center. Mile then made a wish that Avin and his sister would be able to reunite, which moved and enlightened Avin. The two became the best of friends since then.Journey to reunite with Eimelle  <to be added>Fighting style  In battle, Avin uses swords and is able to cast offensive Black Magic.

He is the main protagonist of Trail in the Sky The 3rd In truth, he is the Fifth Dominion of the Grailsritter.Background  Kevin grew up alongside his mother whom he adored more so his father, who he rarely saw. Kids would make fun of him for his accent, which he developed from his mom, and that would lead to Kevin beating them up. Kevin loved his mother more than anything in the world. However, she became his fear and demise. Kevin's dad developed a different family and left both Kevin and his mother behind. The departure of her husband made Kevin's mother's mental health spiral downwards, for she was not very stable before. One day, Kevin woke up to his mother crying over him, apologizing to him, and strangling him. She told him she had failed as a mother but if they went out together, they could finally be at peace. Kevin feared what his mother was doing him and herself and wrestled free from her hold. He ran barefoot through the snow, running far away from his home. Hours later, Kevin returned, expecting his mother to welcome him with open arms, thinking she would go back to her normal self after time. Though when he opened the door, his mother was lying in a pool of blood, knife in hand. His mother's suicide broke him to the point where he had completely given up on the world. Kevin didn't care what happened to him anymore. He was alone. That was until Rufina and Ries Argent found the little boy in the alleyway.Joining the Gralsritter  After being found by the Argent sisters, Kevin grew up with them in Aster Orphanage, run by the Septian Church. Years passed peacefully with the trio until Rufina became a Knight of the church and left Kevin and Ries at the orphanage to pursue her training. When Kevin got a bit older, he followed in Rufina's footsteps and became a Knight as well. Rufina was Kevin's combat teacher and Ein was his superior. One day, Kevin and Rufina were going to meet up together after not seeing one another due to missions. Rufina called him saying her train would be coming later than planned so he could do whatever he wanted until she arrived. After hanging up, Kevin got a message from a fellow member. Aster Orphanage was taken over by Jaegers. Ries, who was still at the orphanage, was taken hostage. Kevin didn't wait for Rufina to arrive, he was afraid that when she did, it would be too late. Kevin broke into his old home and easily wiped out the surrounding Jaegers. However, Ries was nowhere to be found. He scavenged the area until he found her ribbon lying in front of a wall. He realized there was a passageway and opened it, scaling down the stairs to find Ries. Kevin reached the end and found a Jaeger holding an unconscious Ries and an ancient artifact. The Jaeger proceeded to drop the girl and grab the artifact on the pedestal, The Spear of Loa. The Jaeger turned into a monster that Kevin desperately protected Ries from. It was too strong. Kevin couldn't match its strength. It then aimed for Ries while he was holding a wound. The fear of losing Ries triggered Kevin's stigma to awaken and The Spear of Loa manifested at his hands. He reduced the monster to an unrecognizable pile of flesh when Rufina finally caught up. Kevin's sanity was taken over by his stigma, causing him to lose control of his power, he was aiming at Ries. Rufina did the only thing she could do, she threw herself in front of her sister. The Spear of Loa pierced her countless times. Kevin finally came to his senses when Rufina was holding him in her arms, smiling. Rufina protected both Kevin and Ries by giving her life. Kevin had always blamed himself for his mother's and Rufina's death.  Unlocking his stigma, Kevin was promoted to the 5th Dominion of the Gralsritter and his face becoming known as, \"The Heretic Hunter.\"Trivia Creha Rem Ordin  Creha is a mysterious character found in Nayuta no Kiseki.

With encouragement from her fellow classmates and words of a certain slacker who was formerly the student council president, Kloe was able to live her life freely becoming the school's fencing champion while visiting the Mercia Orphanage and attending to the orphans during free-time. She eventually gains much support from the school's council and staff, especially with Jill Ridonor, Headmaster Collins, and the Orphanage's matrons before Teresa's husband passed away.Role in the Games  Trails in the Sky FC Chapter 2 - Madrigal of the White Magnolia Klaudia first appears in the second chapter of the game.

Dalmore then sets his monstrous pets on the group, but they are successfully defeated. Seeing that he is at a loss, Dalmore pulls out the \"Chronos Rod\" which can freeze time and freezes everyone in the room.

She debuted in Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun as the boss of round 3 she is one of the game's toughest bosses. Misuzu is generally depicted as being somewhat outside the law, but she doesn't seem to hold any grudge against Kunio and allies with him on occasion.Appearances Shin Nekketsu K\u014dha: Kunio-tachi no Banka  She returns in Shin Nekketsu K\u014dha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, along with Shinji and Sabu. Kunio and friends first encounter her at a pachinko hall where she was playing. After losing her money from playing, she decided to fight them since she felt irritated and wanted to let off some steam. After she was defeated, she left the scene with contentment much to the bewilderment of the heroes. She later appears at Sabu's villa after Sabu hires her as bodyguard and fights Kunio and Riki once more. After yet another defeat, she warns them about the self-destruct system in the villa.Kunio no Nekketsu Dodgeball Densetsu  Misuzu makes yet another appearance in Kunio no Nekketsu Dodgeball Densetsu  as a playable character. Again, she is along with Shinji and Sabu. She is one of the characters that can be selected as captain and is considered to be a speed type character. Her Power Shots are \"Hyakkan Love\" (she charges at her target with the ball on her chest) and \"Sexy in the Sky\" (she throws the ball in the air and spikes it downward at her target with her chest). Her Super Shot is the \"Dynamtie Hip\" (her teammates propel her while she is standing on the ball, planning to hit her target hip first). Her initial teammates are Gonzou and Kiyoshi. Misuzu is voiced by Hisao Egawa.River City Super Sports Challenge ~All Stars Special~  Misuzu leads a bonus team of girls from Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun and Shin Nekketsu K\u014dha: Kunio-tachi no Banka. While the game's Story Mode mentions her leading Taiyo Academy and participating in the tournament, they never actually appear as opponents; however, her team is playable outside of Story Mode. In this game, Misuzu has a unique attack in the form of a slow slap; it is very powerful but at the cost of possibly aiding opponents onto higher ground.River City Ransom: Underground  There are two instances of Misuzu in this game. One of the River City High School teachers is named Mrs. Kim, the same name Misuzu had in Renegade, though she has the exact same design as Misuzu. The other Misuzu is found in the Ocean Heights dojo and is named Suzu. Misuzu has appeared in the end of the game when she was having a date with .Trivia References Kunio-Kun Wiki HOT-BLOODED WELCOME!  Welcome to the Kunio-Kun Wiki. The Kunio-kun franchise was created by Techn\u014ds Japan Corp. and has more than 30 games. The first game of the franchise, Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun (released as Renegade in North America) was Techn\u014ds' first big hit. The series would become more popular on the Famicom thanks to Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari and Downtown Nekketsu K\u014dshinkyoku: Soreyuke Daiund\u014dkai (the former was localized in North America as River City Ransom on the NES, an influential cult classic). Veteran Techn\u014ds staff continue to work on the series in a new company, Million Co., Ltd, which is now owned by Arc System Works. The series original creator, Yoshihisa Kishimoto, is also involved in the creation of current games. Though a popular series in Japan, the Kunio-kun series remains a niche franchise in North America. There are multiple reasons for these: the attempt to sell the games to the western market, which required alterations to the games and the fact that Techn\u014ds was unable to publish most of their own games (River City Ransom and Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge were the only Kunio-kun games they published). The series does have a cult following in some parts of Asia, Europe and North America. Localizations of Kunio-kun games by Techn\u014ds include Renegade, Super Dodge Ball (these two being the only two arcade games in the series), River City Ransom (Street Gangs in Europe), Nintendo World Cup, Double Dragon II (for the Game Boy, was originally going to be released as The Renegades by Techn\u014ds before Acclaim got the rights to publish the game) and Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge. The Neo Geo version of Super Dodge Ball was the last game released by Techn\u014ds in the west which fully used the Kunio-kun characters without making alterations (Nintendo World Cup did use Kunio as a character for the Japan Team). After Arc System Works purchased the rights to release the series, they started using the Kunio-kun characters and settings in the western market under the River City brand for the purpose of recognition (there are some exceptions, in River City: Tokyo Rumble, some characters use the names they were given in River City Ransom while others use their names from the Kunio-kun series). The latest releases in the Kunio-kun series have been River City: Rival Showdown on the Nintendo 3DS, River City Melee: Battle Royal Special on PlayStation 4 and PC and River City Ransom: Underground on PC.The Kunio-kun series  Prior to the release of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun Special, the Kunio-kun franchise was split into three sub-series: With the release of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun Special, Yoshihisa Kishimoto, Million Co., Ltd and Arc System Works have decided to fuse all three sub-series into a single new series.

The game was released on April 25, 1989 in Japan for the Family Computer and was the first game that Techn\u014ds Japan made exclusively for the console market, preceding Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun and Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu (both were also released on the Famicom, but were released for arcades first). The game was published in North America by American Techn\u014ds, Inc., their U.S. subsidiary and released on January 1990, where it was re-titled River City Ransom. This version made changes to the plot and graphics in a similar way to Renegade (the localization of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun) in order to make the game palatable for the western market. This version of the game was also released as Street Gangs in PAL regions. The game was designed by Mitsuhiro Yoshida and Hiroyuki Sekimoto as a Double Dragon game that parents and their children could play together, so it plays similarly to the NES version of that game. The game has role-playing elements and a non-linear progression, characters have stats that are increased by purchasing items using money from fallen foes and they are free to explore the game's open world. Players can also purchase books in shops in order to grant fighting techniques to their characters, such as Riki's trademark Mach Punch. Speaking of Riki, this is the first game in the series in which Kunio and Riki join forces, as the two have been enemies in the previous two games. After this game, Riki would often appear in other Kunio-kun games as the second player character. The game was highly successful in Japan. The graphical look of the game was used in subsequent Kunio-kun games by the company on the system (such as the sequels of Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu). The game was not as successful in North America or the PAL regions, but its unique gameplay and sense of humor turned the game into a cult classic, which inspired parallel works such as Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game. The game was ported by Sharp to the Sharp X68000 on April 1990 and was developed by SPS. This version of the game has a number of additions, such as new areas, enemies, more colorful graphics and also displays three enemies at once instead of two, among other additions. It was also ported to the PC-Engine Super CD-ROM\u00b2 by Naxat Soft on December 24, 1993 and developed by KID. It has arranged redbook audio, enhanced graphics and fully voiced dialogue. A remake of the game was released for the Game Boy Advance on March 5, 2004 developed by Million Co, Ltd. and published by Atlus in Japan as Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari EX. It was released in North America on May 26, 2004 as River City Ransom EX.Story  Several months after Kunio defeated Sabu and rescued Hiroshi, brothers Ry\u016bichi and Ry\u016bji Hattori transfer to Reihou Academy. Within a few months, the brothers take control of the neighboring high schools using powerful fighting techniques, striking fear as the \"Double Dragon Brothers\". Riki, the banch\u014d of Hanazono High School has no interest in the brothers or what they have been doing. But one day his girlfriend Mami goes missing and he receives a challenge from the academy. Enraged, Riki decides to make his way to the academy alone, but finds Kunio waiting for him outside his school. Kunio wants to help Riki rescue his girlfriend and he begrudgingly agrees.Gameplay  Up to two players can play through the game together in two separate modes, one with friendly-fire (2P Play A) and one without it (2P Play B). Either player can play as Kunio or Riki, who play in exactly the same way. In a single player game the player can choose to play as either character, which changes the in-game dialogue (dialogue in a two-player game will prioritize the first player). The game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Difficult. Easy will decrease the stats of each enemy and boss by 16 and Difficult will increase their stats by 16. The speed of the in-game text can also be modified. Pressing the Select button at the mode select screen allows players to rename their character. The game's style of progression is that of a role-playing game. The game has no actual stages, instead the player is able to travel in an open world in a sandbox manner around nine different areas. In most of these areas, Kunio and Riki will be attacked by rival school gangs. They are identified by their colors, different AI fighting patterns and the money they drop. The farther the player moves from the starting area (Hanazono High School and the neighboring Hanazono Town and Shopping District) the tougher enemies become. Each gang has nine enemies which are distinguished by their faces and stats (each enemy represents a different stat). The objective of the game is to reach Reihou Academy (River City High in the western versions of the game), rescue Mami and defeat her kidnappers. Players are free to do as they wish during the game, but until they defeat the Shitenn\u014d (\u56db\u5929\u738b \"Four Heavenly Kings\") of Reihou (The Zombies in the western versions of the game) they will be unable to gain access to the academy. Since the player can go wherever he wants, it is possible to skip combat by running away from enemies into another screen. In some areas, only four enemies will appear and when they are defeated a boss will appear. When enemies and bosses are defeated they will drop money that the player can use at shops. Bosses can also be fought multiple times.Pause Menu  Pressing the Start button at any time during the game will bring up a menu with different items. Additionally, at any time during gameplay pressing the Select button will toggle between the character's current stamina and their money at the top of the screen:Money  The money the player collects can be used in various shops to purchase consumable items to increase their health and stats. Some of the consumable items can be carried on the player's inventory for latter use. Other shops allow players to purchase shoes which they can equip to increase their stats. Finally, players can purchase books at some shops that will teach their characters a variety of fighting techniques. Should Kunio and Riki be defeated and they don't have enough stamina or willpower, they will be sent to the nearest shopping district with half of their money (if two players are playing together and one dies, the other player will re-appear with half of their money once the player who is still alive enters another screen).Stats  Kunio and Riki's fighting power can be increased by using consumable items to raise their stats. There are stats for punches and kicks, weapons, their speed and strength and their stamina. These stats can be permanently raised until they cap and this is required to even the odds against stronger gangs. All stats start at 15 by default and max out at 63 with the exception of Stamina and Max Power, which start at 63 and max out at 127.Controls & Moves  Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari plays exactly like Double Dragon. The A button is used to punch and the B button to kick. Characters jump when both buttons are pressed at the same time. Players can run by tapping either left or right on the directional pad twice line in Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun and players can jump and attack while running. The A button is used to pick up weapons and enemies from the ground and the B button is used to throw whatever the character is currently carrying. Enemies are stunned and become groggy when attacked multiple times. Characters can then hit them with an uppercut or high kick to knock them down. The player is able to learn additional moves by purchasing books in some of the shops. Upon purchase, the books appear in the player's inventory and have to be equipped:Weapons  During the game, the player will find various weapons and objects in some areas. They can be used by the player and enemies: Additionally, fallen enemies can be used as weapons. Characters can attack weapons thrown at them to stop them from hitting them.Areas  During the game the player is able to traverse the game's open world as they wish. Some of the areas they can access are shopping districts where they can purchase items. Reihou Academy can only be accessed once the player defeats the Shitenn\u014d of Reihou and G\u014dda:Characters  The game has a huge cast of characters. Each gang member is identified in the game, along with the playable characters, the bosses and the supporting characters. All characters are addressed by their surnames with the exception of Kunio, Riki, Mami, Ry\u016bichi and Ry\u016bji.Playable Characters Supporting Characters Opposing High Schools  During the game, the player will be attacked by different high schools. In the Famicom and PC Engine version of the game they will be attacked by two enemies at a time, while in the X68000 version three enemies will attack at the same time. There are nine enemies in each gang. The gangs that appear in each area appear at random, though the farther the player gets from the game's starting area the stronger the gang will be. It is possible to arrive at an area and find no gang patrolling it.Bosses  In some areas of the game, the player has to defeat only four enemies on each gang. Once the final money is collected, a boss will appear in the area. Some areas will already have a boss ready to fight. Some bosses will only show up after other bosses are defeated.Localization  The game was released in North America as River City Ransom on 1990 in January by American Techn\u014ds, Inc. (one of the two Kunio-kun games they published, the other one being Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge). This version of the game made graphical alterations to the game, such as having each character wear a t-shirt and jeans instead of the gakuran (the Japanese school uniform). Because of this change, Riki (now Ryan) has white jeans to go with his blue shirt, while the rest of the characters have blue jeans. The plot is changed slightly, the antagonist (Slick) sends a ransom letter to both Alex and Ryan, mentioning how he has control of the city with his gang of students and evil bosses and kidnapped Ryan's girlfriend. The letter also asks for some demands to be met, yet none are listed. Characters, areas and shops also had their names changed. The game's music was not altered in any way. This version of the game was released in PAL regions on 1991 by Infogrames Entertainment, named Street Gangs.Regional Differences  The Techn\u014ds Japan screen in Street Gangs is different from the original and River City Ransom. In the Japanese version, the game has two different two player modes: A, which enables friendly-fire, and B which doesn't have it. The Western versions have a single 2 player mode which is the one that enables friendly-fire by default. The Japanese version has three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Difficult. The Western version only have two difficulty settings: Novice and Advanced. Novice is the Normal difficulty from the Japanese version and Advanced is the Difficult setting. The plot of the Japanese version shows a conversation between Kunio and Riki and some narration. In the Western versions this conversation is replaced with a ransom letter written by Slick (which is found by Ryan) which mentions his gang of evil bosses and Cindy's kidnapping. The letter makes no demands, but warns Alex not to get involved. The title screen is also changed. In Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, the game takes place in Japan and the playable characters, enemies and bosses are high school students, so they wear gakuran (Japanese school uniforms). These school uniforms only had one color palette (Kunio's gakuranis white and Riki's blue). In the Western versions the sprites were altered, replacing the school uniforms with t-shirts and jeans. All characters retained the color of their uniforms from the Japanese version in their shirts, while their jeans are colored blue. Because Ryan's shirt is blue, he was given white jeans. The sprites of the female characters were unaltered. The Western versions also added a new sprite in the shopping district, a kid that walks around the shopping area along with the girls. Additionally, areas of the game were altered to remove all Japanese characters. In the Japanese version, the many shops in the game have generic names such as coffee shop, bakery, book store, drug store, etc. The Western versions gave each of the stores their own unique names. Additionally, all items and techniques were renamed. For techniques, the names from Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari are on the left, while the ones used in River City Ransom and Street Gangs are found on the right. All characters were renamed in the Western versions of the game. The enemy gangs each represented a high school in the Japanese version, but the Western versions names each gang after a different theme, such as the Frat Guys and the Home Boys. Hanazono High School was changed to Cross Town High, while Reihou Academy is changed River City High. The passwords in the Japanese version were written in the style of haiku (a very short form of Japanese poetry). The first line used five (5) characters, the second line used seven (7) and the final third line used five characters. The passwords in this version saved the player's money and their stats only (except for their maximum amount of stamina). Everything else except defeated bosses was saved with the Turbo File. In the Western versions, the passwords still use three lines but they are longer, with eleven (11) characters for each line. The passwords in these versions of the game save the player's stats, their money, what they have in their inventory and the bosses they have defeated.Ports X68000  Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari was ported to the Sharp X68000, a Japanese computer platform, and released in April 1990. This version of the game, which was developed by SPS and published by Sharp, features several enhancements to the Famicom original, such as displaying three enemy characters on-screen instead of just two, slightly more colorful graphics, an expanded game world, and new items and special techniques for the player (including some that were only used by certain enemy characters in the Famicom version, such as the headbutt and the whirlwind kick). The new locations includes several new shops (such as a dojo) and the schools of each enemy gang, each featuring two new bosses. In addition to the player's regular stats, the player also has individual stats for all the special techniques their character has acquired. The more frequently a special move is used to finish off enemies, the stronger that particular move becomes. Unlike the Famicom version, the X68000 does not feature adjustable difficulty settings. The player can save and load their progress in one of ten save files provided by the game itself.PC Engine CD  The PC Engine Super CD-ROM\u00b2 version of Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, released on December 24, 1993, was published by Naxat Soft and developed by KID, the same team that did the PC Engine versions of Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball (Super Dodge Ball), Double Dragon II: The Revenge, and Downtown Nekketsu K\u014dshinkyoku. This version features enhanced graphics, an arranged redbook soundtrack and fully voiced characters, with the voices of Kunio and Riki performed by Ry\u014d Horikawa and Nobutoshi Canna respectively. The player's progress is saved in this version on the PC Engine's backup memory. The rest of the game is almost identical to the Famicom version.Re-releases  The Famicom version of the game was released for the Wii Virtual Console on October 23, 2007 by Arc System Works in Japan. Arc System Works also released Street Gangs in Australia and Europe for the Wii Virtual Console on February 21, 2008. Aksys Games released River City Ransom on the Wii Virtual Console on April 21, 2008. The Japanese version of the game was released in South Korea on May 26, 2008 by Windysoft. These versions of the game were then released on the 3DS Virtual Console. The Japanese version was released on November 28, 2012, the PAL version was released in Australia and Europe on July 25, 2013 and the North American version was released on November 14, 2013. Finally, the games were released on the WiiU Virtual Console as well. The PAL version was released first in Australia and Europe on April 23, 2015. The Japanese version was released next on August 5, 2015 and finally the North American version was released on October 1, 2015. The PAL and Japanese releases were handled by Arc System Works while the North American releases were done by Aksys Games. The Famicom version is also featured in the Nintendo 3DS compilation Kunio-kun Nekketsu Complete: Famicom Hen, released on December 8, 2016 only in Japan. It will also be made available in another compilation: Kunio-kun: The World Classics Collection, which will be released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows (via Steam). This compilation will also include River City Ransom and will be released in Japan in 2018.Remakes and Sequels  Downtown Nekketsu K\u014dshinkyoku: Soreyuke Daiund\u014dkai is the game's direct sequel canon wise. Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari was the beginning of the Downtown Nekketsu sub-series (Though Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun is part of this game's storyline, it is not considered a part of these sub-series). Bikkuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku! Harukanaru Kin Medal and Downtown Nekketsu Baseball Monogatari: Yaky\u016b de Sh\u014dbu da! Kunio-kun are also part of the canon of this sub-series (Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen'in Sh\u016bg\u014d is part of this sub-series as well, but doesn't have a plot). The game's systems and \"play it your way\" ideas where expanded further in a sequel: Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki da yo Zen'in Sh\u016bg\u014d!. This game is also part of the Downtown Nekketsu sub-series. In 2002, Armen Casarjian (a QA tester for Atari at the time) applied for the expired trademark for River City Ransom, which was accepted in the following six months. Though this didn't give him the rights to the game's assets, he had the right to use the game's name, so he created a development company, Realize Games, to create a sequel to the original game. While the game was in development, Casarjian attended E3 in 2003 and learned that Atlus was going to release Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari EX in North America as River City Ransom EX. Out of respect for Million Co., Ltd., which was made of former staff from Techn\u014ds Japan, Casarjian and Realize Games cancelled their sequel. The Game Boy Advance version of the game, titled Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari EX in Japan and River City Ransom EX in America, was released in 2004. This remake was developed by Million Co., Ltd and published by Atlus. The most notable change from the original version (for example, cooperative mode was removed, etc.). A sequel to the original game was announced in March 18, 2011, called Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari 2 (\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3\u71b1\u8840\u7269\u8a9e2). It was being developed by Miracle Kidz for a Japanese release on WiiWare in 2011. The game would also be released as an online PC game in 2012. Though planned for release in 2012, the game was put on hold indefinitely (and likely cancelled) that same year . A second remake was released in 2016 for the Nintendo 3DS. Titled Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari SP (\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3\u71b1\u8840\u7269\u8a9eSP \"Tale of Downtown Nekketsu Special\"), it was localized in North America and Europe in 2017 as River City: Rival Showdown. It tells the same story from the original game from Kunio's point of view in a span of three days. In April 2013, Conatus Creative Inc. acquired the license to make a sequel for River City Ransom from Million Co., Ltd. This official sequel, River City Ransom: Underground, was funded successfully through Kickstarter on September 2013, with 5,179 backers pledging CA$ 217,643. Development had then started and in 2015, Arc System Works purchased the rights to all of the Techn\u014ds Japan Corp. intellectual properties (including River City Ransom). Regardless, the first development preview of the game was released in December 2015 and the game went gold in August 2016. A beta was released to all backers on January 2017 and the game was finally released in the following month.Codes & Secrets Easter Egg  Players can find an Easter egg in the localized versions of the game by accessing the Status screen. With the second controller, the player holds Left and presses Select and Right at the same time on player one's controller.

It was the fourth game in the Kunio-kun series released for the system and was developed by Almanic. Directed by Yoshihisa Kishimoto, this game follows the same themes and settings established in his previous works in the series: Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun and Shodai Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun and thus ignores the events and characters in Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari. Like in Shodai, characters from the Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu sub-series are used, with some alterations. This game takes place at some point after the Famicom version of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun but before Shodai Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun (Kunio is in his second year of high school in all three of these games, but in Shodai, Kunio is in his final months of his sophomore year and is about to become a senior. In Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, Kunio is in his third year of high school).Development  Almanic was comprised of former employees from Techn\u014ds Japan Corp., this is the only Super Famicom game in the series that was not developed by Techn\u014ds internally. Noriyuki Tomiyama was the game's producer (he previously worked on the arcade version of Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu and the Famicom version of Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu: Soccer Hen). Yoshihisa Kishimoto (the designer and director of the original game in the series) directed the game after previously directing Shodai Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun. The late Michiya Hirasawa (sound programmer in previous games in the series including the Famicom versions of Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu and Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari) was the game's programmer. Kazunaka Yamane, the composer for the arcade version of Double Dragon, composed the game's music. Hiro Yokokura, who was the scenario writer for the adventure game Mamono Hunter Y\u014dko: Makai kara no Tenk\u014dsei (released on the PC Engine) wrote the scenario for the game.Story  Kunio and Riki are imprisoned on a juvenile correction facility in Nerima after the two are convicted of a hit and run. After spending a night in cell 218, the next morning the duo are visited by Hiroshi, Kunio's friend and classmate from Nekketsu High School. He informs the two of strange events happening inside the school and around the area, including the fact that people have seen Kunio around even though he is locked up in prison. Kunio and Riki claim their innocence and are well aware that they have been framed for a crime that they didn't commit. With the help of their new friends from cell 218, Kunio and Riki make their escape from prison to find out who framed them and clear their name.Characters Playable Characters Supporting Characters Antagonists Passwords  Passwords in this game have four digits. The first and third digits determine the current stage, the second digit is used for bike stages and the final digit is used to determine the game's difficulty. Bike stage passwords require that the first and third digits be zeroes. Normal difficulty is determined by placing even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) in the final digit while Easy difficult uses odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Easy difficult cannot be used with passwords that start from the conversation with Sabu and the stages that follow, the game will instead return the player to the mode select screen since the game from that point must be played in Normal difficulty.Trivia External Links References Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun  Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun (\u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093, \"Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio\") is the inaugural title of the Kunio-kun series, a beat 'em-up game released for the arcades in 1986, developed and published by Techn\u014ds Japan Corp.. It was published by Taito for the western market as Renegade (which made changes to all of the sprites and backgrounds). Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun is the technological predecessor to Double Dragon, which was created by Kunio-kun's designer and director: Yoshihisa Kishimoto (after the success of Kunio-kun, Techn\u014ds Japan wanted a sequel which used two simultaneous players and to avoid making regional and graphical changes, Kishimoto created Double Dragon, inspired by his love of Bruce Lee and his film Enter the Dragon). Kunio-kun introduced 4-directional-control and enemies that could take multiple hits. It is considered one of the most influential titles in the video game industry and many consider it the first beat 'em up ever made (The first beat 'em up was Irem's Kung-Fu Master). The game was ported to the Famicom on April 17, 1987, the first game Techn\u014ds Japan made for consoles. The localization for the NES for the western market was also published by Taito and named Renegade. In what would become a trend by Techn\u014ds, the console version differs significantly from the arcade version in order to increase the length of the game.Development  The game was designed and directed by Yoshihisa Kishimoto with a small team in four months. Kishimoto was inspired on his high school years, where he was a rebel and got into constant fights and his love and admiration for Bruce Lee and his films. Konami's Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun (Mikie in North America) inspired the game's name, while the eponymous character is named after the former president of Techn\u014ds Japan, Kunio Taki. Kazuo Sawa composed the game's music.Gameplay  The player assumes control of the titular character, Kunio-kun (or just Kunio). After a rival school gang,  b\u014ds\u014dzoku, a girl school gang and the yakuza attack his friend Hiroshi, Kunio gives chase in order to take revenge. In the Famicom version, the Hiroshi is instead kidnapped and Kunio has to rescue him. Kunio-kun is played with a joystick and three buttons, two which are used to attack and the other to jump (the Famicom only has two buttons, so the player has to press both buttons at the same time to jump). Kunio's attack with each button will depend on the direction he is facing. If he is facing right and presses the right button (A button on the Famicom) he will punch, while pressing the left button (B on the Famicom) will have him throw a kick behind him. These are reversed when Kunio is facing left (this control scheme would later be featured in Double Dragon II: The Revenge). Kunio can throw multiple punches if the button is pressed repeatedly, but they have a shorter reach and while the kick has a longer reach, it comes out slower and can leave him open to attack if missed. Kunio also has more moves at his disposal:Arcade version  The player has to beat the boss of each round in order to advance to the next round. In each round, the player will be at the center of a small arena surrounded by enemies. After the player defeats three or four enemies, the boss will get involved in the fight. Defeating the boss will clear the round (undefeated enemies will disperse once the boss is defeated). There are a total of four rounds and when the player clears the final round, the game loops back to the first round after the ending. The player has three minutes to clear each round and if it runs out the player will lose a life (it's possible to defeat a boss and yet run out of time, at which point the player will still lose a life and have to defeat the boss again). Kunio has a single life, players can get another one by amassing a total of 30,000 points. Kunio will also lose a life if he is knocked down and has no health or if he happens to fall into any of the stage hazards in the first two rounds. In the final round, the enemies and the boss can kill Kunio in a single hit.Famicom version  Instead of being restricted to a small arena in each round, the game now has stages separated into areas. Kunio must defeat a number of enemies then proceed into a new area until he eventually reaches the boss. On stage 2, Kunio will take part in a motorcycle chase, where he is able to kick enemies off the road (using the A button). In the final stage, Kunio has to tackle a building labyrinth before he can face Sabu and rescue Hiroshi. The layout of the door maze depends on the difficulty level and some doors will take Kunio back to beginning of stage 3 (only on difficulty levels 2 and 3). The game has three difficulty levels. On higher difficulties, enemies have more health, bikers are faster and the final stage will have more enemies. The game will end once the player defeats the final boss instead of looping back to the first stage. Kunio has access to power-ups in this version of the game:Characters Main Characters Kunio  The player character, a sophomore (2nd year) student at Nekketsu High School. He befriends Hiroshi and after he sees him getting beaten up by thugs, he chases after them to take revenge. In the Famicom version, he happens to witness Hiroshi's kidnapping and gives chase.Hiroshi  A sophomore student at Nekketsu High School, Kunio's best friend and a honor student. For no particular reason, he is attacked by rival gangs (kidnapped in the Famicom version).Enemies  In each round/stage, Kunio faces off against a different rival gang. The gangs are composed of their boss and two different types of enemies, though Kunio will face about six of them at a time (the sole exception is the final stage in the Famicom version). The bosses are named in the arcade version, while the enemies are named in the instructional manual of the Famicom version:Shinjuku Station  The first round takes place in a train station in Shinjuku, where Kunio has to face a rival school: Hanazono High School. There is a stage hazard to the right of arena. In the Famicom version, Kunio has to continue fighting the rival students inside a train before he can face Riki one-on-one in another area of the station.Yokohama Port  On round 2, Kunio faces off against the b\u014ds\u014dzoku gang \"Yokohama Funky\" in a port in Yokohoma. There's a stage hazard to the left of the stage. In the arcade version, Kunio has face a group of bikers first before he is attacked by the on foot gang members. In the Famicom version, he fights the on foot gang members first, then is attacked by a group of bikers. After taking down the last one, he borrows his bike and fights more bikers during a chase, before facing Shinji, who parked alone in another area.Disco Store  Kunio will face off against a girl gang of students from the Taiy\u014d Academy. There are no stage hazards in the arena. In the Famicom version, after defeating the first group of enemies, Kunio will be given the option of entering one of two buildings. The left building allows Kunio to skip the fight with Misuzu, while the right building will have him face her one-on-one.Car Dealership  The final round in the arcade version takes place in a car dealership that is really a front for the Sanwakai, a crime organization. After defeating the enemies outside, Kunio will enter the office of the leadership and confront Sabu (who is flanked by more enemies). In the Famicom version, Kunio has to go through a maze of doors before he can confront Sabu, who he has to face one-on-one.Localization  Taito published the western version of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun, titled Renegade. It used the seventies film, The Warriors for inspiration and made multiple graphical changes. The sampled voices in the game were also changed to English, but the music was unchanged. In the arcade version, the player character, bosses and enemies are unnamed, but the player character and bosses are named in the NES version. The NES version, also published by Taito, makes further graphical changes to the game.Ports  Both versions of Renegade were ported to multiple platforms. Arcade ports are listed first in release order, followed by ports of the NES version: Imagine released a port of the arcade version of Renegade in Europe for the Amstrad CPC in 1987. Also in 1987, a port was released for the Commodore 64. The European version was published by Imagine while the North American version, which was released in a year later, was published by Taito. Both versions were developed by Imagine. A version for the ZX Spectrum was released in 1987 by Imagine in Europe, while Erbe Software, S.A. released this version in Spain that same year. A version for the DOS operating system was developed by Banana Development and published by Taito in North America and released in 1988. It received a disk re-release in 1989. A version of Renegade for the Amiga was released 1989. The American version was published by Taito American Corporation and the European version by Ocean Software, who also developed the game. The Atari ST port was released in 1988 and 1989 in Europe and North America respectively, developed Software Creations. The European version was published by Imagine while Taito published the North American version. In 1988, France Image Logiciel released a port of the game on the Thomson MO5, developed by Wise Owl Software and licensed by Ocean. It was only released in France. The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions were re-released in 1989 while the Amiga and Atari ST versions were re-released in 1992. A port of the NES version of Renegade was released for the Apple II in 1987 in North America, developed by NovaLogic and published by Taito. A version of Renegade was released for the Sega Master System in Europe and Australia in 1993, developed by Natsume and published by Sega (Tec Toy published the South American version, which was released in Brazil). It is similar to the NES version but it has enhanced graphics, cutscenes when the player loses a life and a new ending. The fighting pattern and attacks of the bosses is also changed, and one of the kung-fu women fought in the third stage fights with her bare hands, similarly to unarmed enemies.Regional Differences  Both versions of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun made multiple changes to the game's plot and graphics when the game was released in Western regions as Renegade.Arcade version  The title screen used in the Japanese version was completely changed for the western localization. There is no music in the title screen or attract mode for Renegade. A copyright for Taito American Corp. was added. At the end of the attract mode in the Japanese version, the game's rankings would appear on the very screen where the attract mode ends. In Renegade, a separate screen is used to display the rankings. When a coin is inserted in the machine in Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun a girl can be heard saying Ganbatte, ne (\u304c\u3093\u3070\u3063\u3066 \u306d\uff01 \"Do your best!\"). In Renegade, a man says \"Good luck, kid!\" when a coin is inserted. Additionally, all of the voice samples in the game were changed from Japanese to English. The Japanese version includes intermissions prior to each round which shows the enemies of the current round attacking Hiroshi before Kunio chases them off. Renegade doesn't have any intermission screens before each round and thus the game has no plot, but it does tell a player before each round if the first or second player is about to play each round. This is done even when the game is played by a single player. Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun has no indication even when the game is being played with a second player. In the Japanese version, the player's health shows Kunio's name. When the bosses get involved in the fight, their name is shown on their health meter as well. In Renegade, the player character is not named and neither are the bosses. All the in-game character sprites were changed, edited or replaced with new sprites. Hiroshi was replaced with a female character that appears during the game's ending waiting for the player character. Kunio and the enemies and bosses had their sprites edited, but the enemies and boss in the final level only had their palettes changed. Shinjuku station (the game's first round) was completely changed into a New York subway since the game doesn't take place in Japan. The subway is more detailed than the station. In the third and final round, all Japanese graphics were replaced with English text in Renegade. The Game Over screen (which says Owari, \u304a\u308f\u308a \"End\") was changed in Renegade, which literally translated the Japanese characters so instead of \"Game Over\", it says \"The End\". Kunio-kun has a name input screen for high scores separate from its high score screen. Renegade uses the same screen to show high scores for the input of initials. The Japanese version allows for a maximum of five characters while Renegade only allows three letters. Kunio-kun and Renegade have different music when entering a name or initials. The ranking screen of both games has no music (when all three letters are entered in Renegade, the music stops).NES version  The title screen went through the same changes that the arcade version did, with one addition: the Licensed by Nintendo of America Inc. copyright. This was shown in the title screen of all NES games that had Nintendo's seal of approval. After some time has passed on the title screen of the Japanese version an intro sequence showing Hiroshi's kidnapping will play, with Kunio chasing the kidnappers and shouting matee- (\u307e\u3066\u3048- \"Wait!\"). Renegade doesn't have an intro sequence. Just like in the arcade version, all character sprites were altered. Some characters retain a similar look from the arcade version, but the characters in the third stage where changed again. The enemies in round 3 from the arcade version of Renegade appeared to be from North America. The NES version of Renegade changes the enemies and the boss of stage 3 to Chinese women assassins wearing cheongsam. The Famicom version gave names to each of the game's enemies (the bosses were already named in the arcade version). Though the enemies are unnamed in Renegade, the bosses are now named. The player character is given the name Mr. K. while the first three bosses are renamed to Jack, Joel and Kim (Riki, Shinji and Misuzu respectively). Though Sabu's name is unchanged, his palette was edited both during gameplay and during his appearance after Mr. K loses a life. In the Japanese version, Kunio's name and the name of each boss is shown next to their health meter while in Renegade, 1P, 2P and EMY are used for each player and the stage boss due to character limits. The quotes said by each character in the Japanese version are the same as the voice samples the characters use when they defeat Kunio in the arcade version (Sabu is an exception since he didn't say anything in the arcade version). Kunio doesn't say the quote from the Famicom version in the arcade version. In the NES version of Renegade, the quotes used by the first three bosses are the same ones they say in the arcade version. Mr. K's quote is different from Kunio's. Sabu's quote in the NES version is the same one as Jack's. Interestingly, Sabu's quote in the Sega Master System version (where he is named Lucas) is different from the NES version. The first stage in the Famicom version of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun has a different colored sky depending on which difficulty level the game is being played (blue sky on Level 1, sunset on Level 2 and night on Level 3). Because the first stage of Renegade takes place in a subway the time of day is not visible. This is also true for the other two areas of the stage. The second stage also changes the color of the sky and it does so in both versions of the game since it wasn't altered at all in the Western version (outside of changing the boss' sprite and the enemies' palettes). In the third stage of Renegade, the Japanese signs were translated to English. Oddly, one of the signs got past Nintendo's censors, because it reads \"Beer\". The Famicom version of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun has an ending similar to the arcade version. In Renegade, the game goes straight to the credits after Sabu is defeated. Since both versions of the game have a proper Game Over screen, the Owari and The End screens used in the Game Over screen of the arcade versions is shown after the credits. The onigiri was changed to a hamburger in Renegade. The game's manual for the western version still shows the onigiri though.Re-releases  A port of the arcade version was released on the PlayStation 2 by Hamster on January 26, 2006, part of their Ore-tachi Gasen Zoku collections. Hamster re-released this version of the game for the PlayStation 4 on the PlayStation Store in 2014. This port was also released Asia, North America, Europe and Australia in 2015 as Renegade, which marks the first time that the arcade localization of the game is available on consoles. Hamster also released the PS4 version of Renegade in Japan, also in 2015. The Famicom version of the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 18, 2008 by Arc System Works, while the NES version (Renegade) was released on May 5, 2008 by Aksys Games. The Famicom version was re-released a second time on the 3DS Virtual Console while the NES version was re-released in Europe, Australia and North America and all were published by Arc System Works (released on April 3, 2013, February 20, 2014 and February 27, 2014 respectively, the European and Australian version were released on the same day). The Famicom version was re-released a third time on a Nintendo console on the Wii U Virtual Console, on January 15, 2014, while the NES version was re-released in North America on February 27, 2014 and in Europe and Australia on March 6, 2014. The Famicom version was also featured in the Nintendo 3DS compilation Kunio-kun Nekketsu Complete: Famicom Hen, released on December 8, 2016 only in Japan. It will also be made available in another compilation: Kunio-kun: The World Classics Collection, which will be released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows (via Steam). This compilation will also include Renegade and will be released in Japan in 2018.Remake  Arc System Works released and published Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun Special for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011 to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary. The game was developed by Avit-Niigata. The game includes an arcade mode which recreates the original arcade version using the graphic style of Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari with new gameplay features. The game's story mode acts as a reboot of the original game and to the franchise as a whole. A prequel centering on Kunio's rival Riki was also released, Riki Densetsu. This game also had a sequel, which was released to the western market as River City: Tokyo Rumble (released in Japan as Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-Kun SP: Rant\u014d Ky\u014ds\u014dkyoku, \u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093SP \u4e71\u95d8\u5354\u594f\u66f2 which roughly translates to \"Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio SP: Brawl Concerto\").Codes & Secrets  The Famicom and NES versions of the game has codes that allow the player to skip past the game's first stage. Two of these codes are available in Renegade's instruction manual:Legacy  As the first game in the Kunio-kun series, Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun would spawn numerous sequels and sub-series. The theme of revenge in this game and Renegade inspired future beat 'em ups such as Final Fight and Streets of Rage. Kishimoto was mandated to create a sequel to this game and to avoid making the graphical changes required for the localization, he created Double Dragon. Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari is a sequel to Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun, which Kishimoto produced but was designed by Mitsuhiro \"Yoshimitsu\" Yoshida and Hiroyuki \"Mokeke\" Sekimoto. They wanted to create a game similar to Double Dragon that children could play with a lot of freedom and thus, the game is a parody of Double Dragon with similar gameplay (and plot, a damsel is kidnapped), but exaggerated. The game's plot takes place months after the end of Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun, and the game was localized to the western market as River City Ransom in North American and Street Gangs in Europe, becoming a cult classic. Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun: Bangai Rant\u014d Hen is a direct sequel to Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun and shares the same theme of revenge as that game, but uses the graphical style of Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari (super deformed characters, known as 2.5D in Japan). Kishimoto would follow the original game with two sequels: Shodai Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun and Shin Nekketsu K\u014dha: Kunio-tachi no Banka. Both versions of Renegade were ported to multiple systems and the popularity of the arcade version led to the creation of sequels that diverted from the Kunio-kun franchise: Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter.Trivia External links References Heilman  Heilman (\u3078\u3044\u308b\u307e\u3093 Heiruman) is a fictional character in the Kunio-kun series. His first appearance was in Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu, where he threw a dodgeball at Kunio during the opening sequence of the Japanese arcade version. He is the captain of Team Iceland in Kunio's Dodgeball games (except for Ky\u014dteki! Dodge Soldier no Maki\u200b, and Super Dodge Ball for the Neo Geo). In addition to other dodgeball games, Heilman also appears in Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki da yo Zen'in Sh\u016bg\u014d!, River City Super Sports Challenge, River City Super Sports Challenge ~All Stars Special~ and River City Melee: Battle Royal Special.

Sawaguchi's first appearance is in Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, where he is the first boss that players face.Localized version Trivia Misako  Misako (\u307f\u3055\u3053) is a fictional character in Kunio-kun series. She first debuted in Nekketsu K\u014dk\u014d Dodgeball Bu: Soccer Hen and she is the manager of the school's Soccer Club. She is also a playable character and Kunio's partner in Kunio-tachi no Banka, and appeared shortly after in Kunio No Oden. She is also in Shin Nekketsu Koha Kunio Kun Special, present in the game's Story Mode. A trailer [1] released seemed to indicate that she would be playable in Battle Royal mode, as she was pictured in the part of the video that discusses that mode, but she is not. In \u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093SP \u4e71\u95d8\u5354\u594f\u66f2 (Auto-Translation: Renegade country-Kun SP Brawl Concerto), she again plays a role in the story mode along with her Banka partner, Kyouko, but neither is playable. Misako was one of the main characters in NOTTV's 2013 television adaptation of the Kunio series. She finally became a playable character again in the River City Super Sports Challenge: All Stars Special, as a member of Misuzu's team; alongside Kyouko and girls from the original Nekketsu Kouha Kunio Kun. She retains her spin-kick and somersault attack from Tachi No Banka, and also starts matches with a sword. In River City Melee: Battle Royal Special, she is once again a member of Misuzu's team. Misako, like many characters in the series, appears differently depending on the game. Most art, as well as her sprite appearance in Kunio No Oden and model in River City Soccer Hooligans, depict her as having medium-length blue hair, worn naturally and with a bow, but the 8-Bit sprites depict her as having black hair worn in a ponytail, with no noticeable bow. In Kunio Tachi No Banka and Daiundokai 3DS, she has blue hair but cut shorter and without a bow. Misako's combat-style is largely based around kicking, perhaps in relation to her interest in soccer. Three of her four special moves in Kunio Tachi No Banka utilize her lower-body; a flying knee, spin-kick, and mule kick; the remaining special is an aerial somersault. In one memorable scene, Kunio and Riki delegate to Misako the responsibility of torturing a boss to confession by kicking him in the groin.Nekketsu! Street Basket: Ganbare Dunk Heroes.  Nekketsu! Street Basket: Ganbare Dunk Heroes is a basketball game for the Family Computer, both developed and published by Techn\u014ds Japan released on December 17, 1993. This is final Kunio-kun game for Family Computer. The Super Famicom would become mainstream during this era while the Family Computer software was beginning to go out of circulation permanently. It was re-released for the Game Boy Advance on August 25, 2005 as the part of Kunio-kun Nekketsu Collection 1.Overview  In this game, starring Kunio, Riki, Godai (from Downtown Nekketsu series) and Johnny (from Bikkuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku). The player's home court is at Niagara Falls and players have their equipment improved after they win a game in \"Story mode.\" The U.S. Navy even appear as an opponent in this game. Every game is two-on-two with baskets being able to be broken by shots and slam dunks. Other opponents include New York (a team of hip hop-obsessed boys), Florida (a team of researchers at the Space Center), Texas (a team of countryside boys), Hawaii (stereotypical surfer team), San Francisco (a team of very powerful bodybuilders), and Las Vegas (a team of magicians).Opponents ", "Dungeon of the Endless Wiki": "Dungeon of the Endless Wiki ", "Toram Online Wiki": "Toram Online Wiki ", "Banjo-Kazooie Wiki": "Banjo-Kazooie Wiki Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts  Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts is the latest game in the Banjo-Kazooie series, taking place eight years after the events of Banjo-Tooie. It was announced at Microsoft's X06 in 2006 at Barcelona, Spain and was released on November 11, 2008. Before the name was finalized, the game was commonly referred to by fans as Banjo-Threeie. It is the first game published in the series that is unaffiliated with Nintendo, as it is exclusive to the Xbox 360. Many fans were disappointed with the game, as the gameplay features next to no relation to the original two games. In early 2009, L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges, a DLC for the game, was released for 400 Microsoft Points.Plot  Set eight years after the events of Banjo-Tooie, and due to Banjo and Kazooie's lack of adventures over the past few years, the duo have gained many pounds, and are now overweight and very unhealthy. When Banjo and Kazooie reunite with the decapitated head of Gruntilda, Banjo and Gruntilda compete to determine who is the true owner of Spiral Mountain. Banjo wishes to preserve his home while Gruntilda hatches an urban development scheme to replace the vegetated area with towers and malls. A new character named Lord of Games (also known as L.O.G.) attempts to settle the conflict between the two by devising a series of worlds and challenges. LOG transports the other characters to Showdown Town, his headquarters, and starts the contest. The winner would be set to own Spiral Mountain; the loser must endure eternal hardship working at L.O.G.'s game factory. While Banjo and Kazooie seek to win by completing the challenges, Grunty uses a slew of vehicles she presumably has built, as well as an army of mechanical Gruntbots to stop the duo from succeeding. After entering different game worlds created by L.O.G., Banjo and Kazooie collect the amount of Jiggies needed to return home. There, they will face Gruntilda to terminate this crazy adventure, but the witch will not be willing to lose. However, as usual, Grunty fails miserably and is forced to work in L.O.G.'s factory until the end of her days, as agreed at the beginning of the game. Gruntilda promises that she will launch her own game, since she has all the necessary tools.Gameplay  The game is not a traditional third-person platform game like the previous installments in the series, but instead utilizes vehicles to transport Banjo and Kazooie around the levels and complete challenges for Jiggies. According to Gregg Mayles about 20 percent of the game retains traditional platforming elements. There are however few \"moves\" for Banjo and Kazooie to use. The duo are limited to climbing, swimming, jumping and attacking with the Magic Wrench while other abilities, such as firing eggs have been mapped to vehicle parts instead.Vehicles  Vehicles play a prominent role in the game. The player can build them from over 100 components available, such as body panels, engines, wheels, wings, propellers, fuel and weapons. Vehicle presets are available as blueprints. Vehicles can be created when starting a challenge as well so as to make the perfect vehicle with which to win.Items  The game features six worlds (excluding Spiral Mountain) where the player can pick up Notes, Jiggies and T.T. Trophies. The notes are used quite differently from previous installments. They are the game's currency, used in Showdown Town. The notes can be used to buy vehicle parts, vehicle blueprints, hints, and even bribe the corrupt sheriff. In addition, there are three different types of notes: copper, silver and gold, which are worth one, five, and ten notes respectively. There 5,230 notes in the game. With L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges the player can get 120 more notes. The Jiggies have the same use as in previous games. When Banjo wins a Jiggy in a game world challenge, this puzzle piece is moved to that world's respective Jig-O-Vend in Showdown Town. Kazooie, using her Magic Wrench, collects the Jiggies from the machine and Banjo takes them to the Jiggy Bank in the middle of Showdown Town. There are a total of 131 Jiggies in the game. The T.T. Trophies are the most difficult items to get. Trophy Thomas, a super-competitive cheetah, is the 'best in all the challenges of the game' and is willing to challenge Banjo for those who can do it faster. Banjo must complete the proposed test in a time limit to get all the prizes available. Four trophies will get the player a Jiggy. In total, there are 92 Trophies in the game (but the player can get all the Jiggies with 91).Abilities  Almost all abilities learned in previous games will not be at Banjo and Kazooie's disposal for Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. This approach was first mentioned in the December 20 of Rare's Scribes column, which stated, \"Banjo and Kazooie haven't got many of the abilities that they used in previous games\".[8] The ability introduced in Banjo-Tooie to split up Banjo and Kazooie as separate playable characters will be unavailable in Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. A previous Scribe mentioned that they \"thought about using two different controllers\" to account for the new moves and all the old moves as well, but that a simpler system had been used for the game. It was eventually revealed that the approach involves using vehicles instead of the previous attack moves. According to Rare, the in-game explanation is that most of the older abilities were forgotten after eight years of not using them and L.O.G. did not allow the duo to remember them. The only abilities Banjo still has are the grip grab (no attack), swimming (Banjo only), climbing, and the single jump. The Magic Wrench is used as a new attack, for the platforming elements of the game. The player can disembark from a vehicle and explore the environment in a manner similar to that of the previous games. In a screenshot, Banjo and Kazooie are seen walking on a tightrope crossing a river.Multiplayer  The idea of multiplayer options was first discussed at the Rare Witch Project, where Mayles said that there would be multiplayer capability in the game unlike that found in Banjo-Tooie. He also noted that there would not be any first-person shooter sections in the traditional action-adventure game. It was later revealed that multiplayer will be purely vehicle-based where players will be able to take their custom built vehicles to Xbox Live and compete in online races and activities. An announcement stated that the game features a co-operative mode and offline multiplayer options. List of multiplayer games (by category):Race  Added with L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges:Characters Returning Characters New characters Worlds and Levels  Many levels have been introduced in Nuts & Bolts, many new, while some old levels from previous games being redesigned in a whole new way. There are 6 new levels (not including Showdown Town and Spiral Mountain). Each new world is split into 6 acts (\u00e0 la Sonic the Hedgehog series)\u00a0each with a number of Jiggies obtainable (L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges has no Jiggies to obtain, since they go to the picture). Like the other console games, the levels can be accessed from the hub world and themed music will play when neared. Each world has its own intro that plays when you enter the world for the first time.Easter Eggs  During the game, you will see a lot of things that are references to other Rare games, consoles, and gaming things such as:Sequel?  Gavin Price, multiplayer designer of Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, was also interviewed and expressed interest in developing a Banjo-Fourie for the Xbox 360, after the issue of Banjo-Threeie's release during November 14\u201318, 2008. To quote him: \"We are still thinking of a lot of other new features and I think we were told 'you going to do a sequel' then there would be a hell of a lot just new ideas.\" Filecchio Savior, the programmer, who has been with the original Banjo-Tooie team echoed: \"Yes, lots!\" Neil Harrison, lead technical artist, added: \"Yes there would be a lot of stuff we like to do.\" September 9 UPDATE: Rare senior animator Ellipse Miller said in an interview that \"Nuts & Bolts is like an introduction to what we could do. If we went and did some 'of us could push it. You can was accepted and people are so we can certainly push it in one direction much greater. This is like the opening of a new type of game I think.\" Rare lead technical artist Neill Harrison added that the team has a rare few \"crazy ideas\" for more Banjo mechanical work, and that will \"probably\" expand the concept of construction for future games. \"[Lead designer] Greg has had some crazy ideas [for the next game] ... I'll probably get in trouble if I mentioned them,\" added Harrison. \"I think if [Nuts & Bolts] was successful, we certainly had a load of ideas for what could be done with the same kind of concept but expand it out. So, what's next for Rare? Outside of the new Xbox 360 avatars, who are working on unannounced games. Schuneman Lee, director of manufacturing a rare, says: \"Usually it is probably in about four or five titles, so there is certainly some that we have not yet spoken. And some of those who perhaps never will, because Sometimes we try out ideas and do not always come out on the market, but there's a good few.\" Rare later hinted, in response to a question asked during one of their \"mini-scribes\" that a Banjo-Kazooie game would be made for the Nintendo 3DS with the pending title Banjo-3dsie. Though nothing about a new game in the series, much less any games at all being released for the 3DS, has been mentioned by Rare since. In 2012, composer Grant Kirkhope had revealed that Rare employees have been attempting to work with Unity for PC titles.\u00a0Their first work happened to be a Banjo-Kazooie styled minigame that they used for testing. When e-mailed by a fan about the project, Kirkhope stated that he had no idea how Unity worked and that, if the development team had figured out Unity's assets fully, a PC-Based Banjo-Kazooie game is may be a very likely in the future.\u00a0Also to note, is the fact that Rare itself has no involvement in the game, but instead Rare's employees are working independently to bring the game to life.\u00a0That game would later be announced as Yooka-Laylee, a spiritual successor scheduled for that was released in April of 2017. The team behind it has separated from Rare and formed the new company known as Playtonic Games. As of the release of Yooka-Laylee, no word has come of an original Banjo-Kazooie series game being made. With Rare lacking a heavy sum of its former employees and creative process, doubts of a true sequel to Nuts & Bolts began to arise. In 2016, Banjo-Kazooie, Tooie, and Nuts & Bolts were released along with 27 other titles in the Xbox One compilation title, Rare Replay. The compilation sold and performed well and fans hope that its success may reinvigorate interests in some of the franchises that haven't seen attention in a while.Trivia External links  Websites Videos OSTBanjo-Kazooie  Banjo-Kazooie is the first game in the Banjo-Kazooie series. It was developed by Rareware and released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64\u00a0and celebrated its 10th Anniversary in 2008. In this game, Banjo and his friend Kazooie must save Banjo's sister Tooty from the evil witch Gruntilda before she steals Tooty's beauty. The game was followed by a sequel called Banjo-Tooie in 2000.Plot Spoiler Warning  The Story, from the game manual: At last, the dirty green and blue smog was beginning to clear. Gruntilda stood at the topmost window of her Lair, grinning wickedly down on her latest world. \"Tiny creatures far below,\" she cackled, \"which of you'll be first to go?\" The witch rubbed her hands in glee at the prospect of putting her favorite invention to good use. It was her pride and joy: a machine that could suck the physical beauty from its victims for Gruntilda to absorb like a sponge! And it would certainly teach her cutesy sister Brentilda a lesson. How dare that interfering do-gooder inherit the family good looks and leave Gruntilda, well... slightly disadvantaged in that department? Hah! Not any more, gloated the witch, picking her nose smugly. Not any more. Turning back to the bubbling cauldron, Gruntilda began to cast the spell which would reassure her that she was, of course, the most wonderfully attractive creature in this bright new world... Meanwhile, Tooty was skipping home through the sunny green fields of Spiral Mountain. As she reached the garden gate, a pair of blurry eyes that could only belong to her good friend Bottles popped up from a nearby molehill. \"Morning Tooty,\" he blinked, uncorking himself from the hole. \"And what are your plans for this fine day?\" Tooty jumped up and down excitedly, remembering Banjo's promise. \"Oh!\", she squealed. \"When my lazy brother gets out of bed, we're going on an adventure! , an adventure usually means i get to \"play\" with all the characters in a \"nice.....\" way\" \"That's nice.\" Bottles squinted up into the sky. \"Hang on, isn't that your brother up there?\" Tooty turned, and saw an odd shape swooping down towards them of high speed. \"No, that can't be Banjo,\" she said, frowning. \"I wonder who it is...\". \"Sweeter than me? Prettier than me? Impossible!\" Gruntilda was so furious at the cauldron's words that she could barely control her broomstick, screeching with the treetops. \"As cute as me, you stupid pot? For her own sake, I hope she's not!\" The witch sped recklessly on until her target finally came into view: staring up at her from a field far below was the innocent young Honey Bear she'd seen in the depths of that treacherous cauldron. Gruntilda cackled. \"I need those looks far more than she, and finally perfect I shall be!\" she cried, and sent the broomstick into a steep dive. Kazooie popped out of the backpack as noise erupted just outside the window. \"Banjo!\" she squawked in alarm. \"Banjo, wake up!\" The Honey Bear groaned and pulled a pillow over his head. \"Aww, Kazooie, it's too early,\" come his muffled voice. \"This is no time to be lazy, furface!\" trilled the Breegull, swinging anxiously to and fro. \"We've got trouble!\" Banjo yawned, rolled over - and fell out of bed in surprise as Kazooie's struggles suddenly toppled both the backpack and its stand onto the floor with a crash. At the same time a sudden gust of wind blew open the curtains, and beneath the peals of manic laughter fading into the distance, Banjo heard the helpless cries of a voice he recognized... Tooty! The bear gulped, realising that this was definitely going to be one of those days. \"Uh, Kazooie, what are you doing down there?\" he said in confusion, grabbing the backpack as he bolted for the door. \"This is no time to be lazy - we've got trouble!\" The evil witch of Spiral Mountain, Gruntilda, is inside her lair, asking her cauldron Dingpot questions about who is the 'nicest and fairest of them all', to which Dingpot reluctantly answers, \"You are, mistress\". She gloats over her \"beauty\", until Dingpot finally breaks his 'silence' and tells the witch that Tooty, another inhabitant of Spiral Mountain, is actually the prettiest and the fairest of them all. Grunty reacts angrily and decides to kidnap Tooty in order to steal her beauty. She grabs her broom and sets off immediately. Meanwhile, Tooty is running around Spiral Mountain, when she is greeted by Bottles in front of Banjo's House. She eagerly tells Bottles that she is going on an adventure with her brother, Banjo. Inside the house, Banjo is sleeping soundly, with his breegull friend, Kazooie, sleeping in his backpack, which is hanging on a nearby coat rack. Tooty and Bottles are still talking, until Bottles spots Grunty in the distance, but confuses her for Banjo (due to his short-sightedness). Grunty immediately goes for Tooty, and a struggle ensues. Kazooie, eager for action and adventure, overhears the clamor outside as well as Bottles' cries for help and tries to wake Banjo up. Banjo and Kazooie leave their house, only to discover that Grunty has gone off and kidnapped Tooty! Bottles tells the bear and bird that they must venture to Gruntilda's Lair to rescue Tooty. Bottles offers to prepare the duo to fight Gruntilda by teaching them some basic moves and repairing the bridge leading to the lair's entrance. Banjo and Kazooie set off on an adventure into the lair to save Tooty. Once inside the lair, Banjo and Kazooie find a Jiggy, which is used to open and unlock levels around the lair by completing Jigsaw Puzzle pictures. They soon find a painting that fits their first Jiggy, opening the first level of the lair, Mumbo's Mountain. Banjo and Kazooie enter the first world and find that their quest is not as easy as they had anticipated. They discover that they need to rescue Jinjos imprisoned by Grunty throughout each of the worlds as well as collect Musical Notes, which are needed to open up Note Doors, to progress through the deeper areas of Gruntilda's Lair. They also meet Mumbo Jumbo, a skull-faced shaman who offers his services to the bear and bird by transforming the adventurers into different animals with new abilities. [1] The two continue progressing through the lair, gathering musical notes, Jiggies, and other collectibles along the way, as well as rescuing the Jinjos of each world. They also encounter Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles several times, who continue to help the heroes by transforming them and teaching them new moves, respectively. Banjo and Kazooie also get help from Gruntilda's nicer sister, Brentilda, who gossips interesting facts about her ugly sister. After successfully surviving through all nine worlds in her lair, Banjo and Kazooie eventually reach Gruntilda but are forced to play her quiz show, Grunty's Furnace Fun. Thanks to the information provided by Brentilda's gossips, Banjo and Kazooie win Grunty's game and save Tooty. With Tooty rescued, they return home and celebrate with a barbecue. However, Tooty reminds our heroes that Grunty had escaped shortly after the game show and was still at large, plotting her wicked schemes. Banjo and Kazooie make their way back up the lair until they finally reach the roof with a little help from Dingpot. On the roof, Gruntilda challenges them to a more direct confrontation and an epic battle ensues. But, with the help of the Jinjos they rescued in the various worlds of Gruntilda's Lair, Banjo and Kazooie defeat Gruntilda and ultimately knock her off her tower. She crashes into the ground, creating a crater of her shape, which is then covered by a large boulder that falls from the tower and traps her beneath it. Banjo and Kazooie finally take a well-deserved break at the beach, where the bear and bird and their friends anticipate a sequel, Banjo-Tooie. Meanwhile, Gruntilda, whose loyal minion Klungo is trying to rescue her, swears her revenge.Main Characters Worlds  There are nine main worlds, one overworld/hub world, one starter world and three worlds that were unfinished so were not featured in the game. This comes to a total of eleven worlds featured in Banjo-Kazooie.Starter World Hub World Main Worlds Game Reaction  Banjo-Kazooie was highly successful when it was released, selling nearly two million copies in the United States. It also received the following reviews:Banjo-Kazooie (Xbox Live Arcade)  Banjo-Kazooie was re-released on the Xbox 360 in late 2008. It currently costs 1200 Microsoft Points on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The game has also been inputted with various items that were originally found in Banjo-Kazooie and used in the new game Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. The game was updated with improved graphics and several new additional features:Awards  At the 1999 Interactive Achievement Awards, Banjo-Kazooie won in the Console Action/Adventure and Art Direction categories, and was nominated for Console Adventure Game of the Year and Game of the Year. In an episode of Reviews On The Run, Banjo-Kazooie was ranked number 1 on the list of the \"5 classic Rare games you should try\", beating out Sabre Wulf, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and Kameo: Elements of Power, which were also running for the same award.Music  The music from the game was composed by Grant Kirkhope. A CD Soundtrack was also available exclusively to Nintendo Power Subscribers and sold at Best Buy stores. Two additional tracks were included on the CD that Nintendo Power Subscribers received. During an interview with OC Remix, Kirkhope had stated that Banjo-Kazooie was his favourite work he ever composed, he even got teary eyed when he saw the follow up Banjo-Tooie again after ten years.Development from Dream: Land of Giants  After Rare scrapped the idea of Dream\u00a0(after Rare saw a early version of the 3D-Platformer pioneering game, Super Mario 64), they shifted their focus onto a 3D Platformer which is know as Banjo-Kazooie. Within the first week of changing their idea, they built the first \"recognisable Banjo-Kazooie level\" (It is inferred as 'Spiral Mountain' from this video). From this point, they developed the game into what it is today. They built a test level (Known as the 'Temple Test Level') for which they tested their mechanics. As well as this, the Talon Trot (possibly the most signature move in Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie) was not implemented until after the design of the levels (unless they did not add the variable which deduces if a slope needs Talon trot to be scaled).Trivia See also Gallery  See also: Banjo-Kazooie/Gallery \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Gruntilda Winkybunion  \u201cDingpot, Dingpot by the bench, who is the nicest looking wench?\u201d\n\u2014Gruntilda, Banjo-Kazooie Gruntilda Winkybunion (often called Grunty for short) is the main antagonist of the Banjo-Kazooie series. She is a wicked witch with magical spells that are capable of doing anything, even going as far as death. She also enjoys rhyming, which really annoys Grunty's three sisters, also they really dislike her rhymes. Grunty also keeps her spells in a book named Cheato, who doesn't enjoy Grunty's plan of becoming beautiful and decides to help Banjo and Kazooie. In Banjo-Kazooie, Grunty kidnaps Banjo's sister Tooty and plans to steal her beauty so she can be the most beautiful woman in all of Spiral Mountain. Two months later in Grunty's Revenge she inhabits a robotic form of herself called Mecha-Grunty, and plots to prevent Banjo and Kazooie from ever meeting. Two years later, in Banjo-Tooie her sisters Mingella and Blobbelda join her in an attempt to restore Grunty to her former body.Banjo-Kazooie  In the first game, Gruntilda played the role of the stereotypical \"evil witch\". She spoke only in rhymes and was known for being extremely vain, which is odd considering how ugly she appears. She has a bad habit of picking her nose, as seen in the Banjo-Kazooie intro cutscene. Like most witches, she uses a broomstick for transportation. When Dingpot revealed that Tooty, Banjo's sister, was the \"prettiest and fairest in the land\", Gruntilda became infuriated and kidnapped Tooty (however, the manual implies that Gruntilda was already planning on snatching a denizen from Spiral Mountain to steal their beauty to one-up her sister, Brentilda. According to the manual, she was actually deep-down glad that Tooty was prettier than her as it gave her an excuse to subject her as her first test specimen). She selfishly plotted to use a \"Beauty Transfer Machine\" to drain Tooty's youth and beauty and transfer it to her own ugly self, which would result in Grunty becoming pretty and thin and Tooty becoming ugly, fat and green. Banjo and his good friend Kazooie chased the witch through her massive lair, where she had created several worlds filled with her minions and various challenges to stop the duo. As the pair progressed, Gruntilda shouted rhyming taunts and various insults in an attempt to keep the pair away. But with the help from various sources, including her nicer sister Brentilda who told Banjo and Kazooie interesting secrets regarding Gruntilda, the bear and bird duo were able to complete the worlds and reach Grunty's last challenge before rescuing Tooty: a twisted game show called Grunty's Furnace Fun. After the duo won the game show, Gruntilda ran away and Banjo and Kazooie rescued Tooty. Later, the bear and bird journeyed to the roof of Gruntilda's Lair and faced off in a battle with Grunty.The Final Battle  Despite her comical nature, Gruntilda proved herself to be Banjo and Kazooie's strongest enemy. She spends most of the fight riding her broomstick. During the first phase, she flies down fast and tries to impale Banjo and Kazooie with the teeth on her broom. However, her broom starts to slow down after a few passes (two the first and second time around, three the third time around, and four the fourth time around), leaving her vulnerable to the Rat-a-tat Rap. After every successful attack from the player, Gruntilda will attack with an easily dodge-able fireball. After taking enough damage, she uses a homing spell. Kazooie can protect Banjo from this by using the Golden Feathers. After, she starts to hover in place and throw fireballs. In a rare moment, she displays some intelligence when doing this because if the player tries to run away from the fireballs before she fires, Gruntilda will throw them into the player's path. After throwing four fireballs, she will take a short pause (the pause shortens every time she moves from one part of the tower to the next), leaving her vulnerable to three\u00a0Eggs. After repeating this process four times, she uses another homing spell which once again will be destroyed if Kazooie uses a Golden Feather. Then, Gruntilda flies high into the air to avoid being shot at, but fortunately Bottles comes to the duo's aid and creates a Flight Pad for them to use. Banjo and Kazooie can hit Gruntilda at any time with the Beak Bomb but it's best to attack her when she's not moving (again, the time she's not moving will shorten every time she's hit). Try not to attack her from above, otherwise you risk falling off the tower to your doom. Every time she's hit, she'll throw fireballs at you (one after the first hit, two after the second, three after the third, and four after the fourth). After taking another four hits, Gruntilda will create a force field around her that Banjo and Kazooie cannot break through. At this point the Jinjos realize the two of them are in need of their help and intervene by creating four statues around the area. After three eggs are shot into the statues, a Jinjo will fly into the air like a missile and break through Gruntilda's barrier. The witch, however, doesn't remain idle during this time and will continue to attack the pair with fireballs. Unfortunately, Banjo and Kazooie cannot take cover behind the Jinjo statues as Gruntilda's attacks fly through them. After all four Jinjo missiles fire, Gruntilda's broomstick will break and she will fall to the edge of the tower. She is still standing, however, and her force field still renders her immune to any of Banjo and Kazooie's attacks. At this point a larger statue containing The Mighty Jinjonator appears. This statue has four holes that the player must shoot four eggs into each side. Like the smaller Jinjo statues, the statue provides no cover and Gruntilda's attacks will still pass through it. She is quite possibly at her most dangerous in this phase, partly because she will attack with several consecutive fireballs followed by a homing shot. After each homing shot she will take a short breather, allowing Banjo and Kazooie to shoot eggs into the holes. Once the Mighty Jinjonator is activated, he will attack Gruntilda and knock her off the tower. Gruntilda falls off the tower and crashes into the ground. Seconds later, a large falling rock traps her beneath, sealing her first defeat. Banjo, Kazooie and Tooty take a vacation to celebrate, during which Gruntilda's minion Klungo spends two years attempting to remove the enormous boulder and save Gruntilda. Unfortunately, she remained alive and vowed her revenge upon the pair one day.Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge  \u201cAlthough you've smashed my mecha-suit, don't think you've given me the boot. Now I've trapped you on my tower, I'll crush you with my ghostly power!\u201d\n\u2014Mecha-Grunty, Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge Two months have passed since Grunty was knocked off her tower in Banjo-Kazooie and she has been perfecting her plan for revenge ever since.  Klungo builds her a mechanical body, aptly called Mecha-Grunty, for her ghost to inhabit. Rather than fighting the duo as the main antagonist in a body of her own, she operates Mecha-Grunty and causes chaos by going twenty years back in time and kidnapping Kazooie. However, after Banjo's first battle with the robotic witch, Kazooie was freed and Mecha-Grunty fleed. Their next battle involved fighting her up above the lighthouse and taking out her mechanical parts one at a time. After her second defeat, Grunty had enough and wanted Klungo to upgrade her up to supreme strength and battle the duo in her lair when it was under construction. Facing them at the top of her lair, Mecha-Grunty charged at them, fired electric balls, ground pounded, and dropped airborne mines. Even with her body destroyed, she was not ready to give as she used her ghostly power to defeat the duo, which failed. She is beaten once more and returns to her body in the present, setting the events of Banjo-Tooie in motion.Banjo-Tooie  After two years had passed, Gruntilda was suddenly freed from her prison by the sudden appearance of her sisters Mingella and Blobbelda. Their evil spells levitate and destroy the rock that trapped Grunty and they discover that she had been degenerated into a skeleton. Furious at her new bony body, Gruntilda asked her sisters for help in restoring her. \"Mingy\" and \"Blobby\" had already planned for such an event, and the three prepared to leave Spiral Mountain. Before they did, when Mumbo had wandered out of Banjo's house to find the source of the ruckus caused when Mingella and Bloddelda entered with the Hag 1 digging machine, Grunty chased him and tried to kill him with magic spells. Seeing him enter Banjo's house, she prepares a bigger spell to destroy it and while Banjo, Kazooie and Mumbo escaped, Bottles stayed behind assuming Mumbo was lying and trying to win at their poker game, resulting in him being killed by the blast, which also ruined Banjo's house. After destroying Banjo's house, the trio of witches used the Hag 1 to reach Cauldron Keep on Isle o' Hags, where Mingella and Blobbelda revealed their B.O.B. machine. It was designed to suck the life out of anything captured in its beam; Gruntilda practiced this on King Jingaling for giving Banjo and Kazooie a Jiggy, reducing him to a zombie. It is also interesting to note that Gruntilda stopped speaking in rhyme at this point (her sisters found it \"annoying\"). Gruntilda then wanted to use B.O.B. on the whole island, but is informed that it will take time for it to charge up before that can happen. For the rest of the game, she stays in Cauldron Keep but will usually talk to Banjo and Kazooie whenever they enter a mini-game. They eventually meet her again in Cauldron Keep where she makes an attempt to destroy Banjo and Kazooie with another game show called Tower of Tragedy, this time competing against her two sisters in which the loser would have a 1-ton weight dropped on them. Her plan failed and she ended up killing her two sisters, but because of her temper, declares Banjo and Kazooie's win \"invalid due to the faulty scoring equipment\". Not sure of what to do next, Gruntilda takes Kazooie's advice to \"escape in a cowardly fashion like in Banjo-Kazooie\", and she tells the duo she'll be at the top of the tower, though she of course boasts she will win this time. Sure enough, Banjo and Kazooie found Gruntilda in the Hag 1 waiting for them at the top of Cauldron Keep. Although she had more success the last time she attacked Banjo and Kazooie (she killed two of her allies, but were brought back by reversing the B.O.B.), Gruntilda's revenge plans failed and was defeated yet again, reduced to nothing more than a talking skull. Later, Banjo, Kazooie, Humba Wumba and Jamjars use her head as a ball in a game of \"Kick Around\" and she loses one of her eyes (again) in the process. She swore that she would get her revenge in Banjo-Threeie. Gruntilda is also a playable character in the multiplayer games Targitzan's Temple Shootout, Ordnance Storage Shootout and Clinker's Cavern Shootout. In these games, Gruntilda is the tank character with her health at a whopping 16 honeycombs, enabling her to endure four Grenade Eggs; however, it comes at the cost of being the largest target and moving the slowest.Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts  Grunty continues her role as an antagonist in this game as well, and has taken up her annoying rhyming once more. She makes her way back to Spiral Mountain, even though she is still a skull (probably why it took her eight years to get there). A now fattened Banjo and Kazooie challenge her to another showdown, but the Lord of Games pauses the battle and states they shall fight in true Banjo-Kazooie style, by collecting random useless objects. A fat Banjo and bodiless Grunty start to collect the thousands of badges L.O.G. put in front of them, but soon grows impatient of a skull and a fat bear with a fat bird in his backpack running around. He restores Banjo and Kazooie to fighting fit shape and gives them a Magical Wrench, while giving Grunty a robotic form of her original body with a jar for her head and a cat named Piddles. The three characters go to Showdown Town, where Gruntilda tries to stop Banjo and Kazooie from earning Jiggies and returning to Spiral Mountain and fight her once more. She appears in all the levels of the game. In Showdown Town, she treats the time off she has from attempting to beat the heroes as a vacation.Nutty Acres  She appears in Act 3 and she is trying to steal the island's Loco Coco. She carries it away and Banjo must knock it out of her vehicle. This is not a difficult challenge as the coconut is not secured. Beating the challenge earns the bear and bird high grip wheels for the trolley in Showdown Town. Use the fulgore fist!LOGBOX 720  Grunty attempts to send Piddles to contaminate the glubber tank (forcing Bottles to shut down the LOGBOX 720) but first offers a race in Act 3. When Banjo wins, Grunty must stop her plan. Grunty races in the water and Banjo on land and the race is several laps long. The prize for this victory are the floaters and a small propeller. After she is defeated, go down the pink pool to find two passages, one containing notes and the other nothing.\u00a0Banjoland  The witch tries to cause a ruckus in the museum with her new bouncing vehicle in Act 4. Banjo must destroy it before she gets away. Freezing her is a good strategy because she is hard to hit. The part earned here is the spring so the trolley can jump.Most of the trapdoor towers can be reached!Jiggoseum  Grunty appears in two acts in this world. In Act 4, she flooded the stadium and Banjo must beat her challenge of knocking beach balls into the goal. Then he gets the scuba seat in Showdown Town. In Act 5, she tries to destroy the billiard balls with a laser, so Banjo must keep them safe. He gets a laser for his trolley if he wins.Terrarium of Terror  Grunty attempts to destroy the foliage in Act 5 with her invisible flying vehicle. Banjo destroys the UFO and earns a horn. If the invisibility device is destroyed first, the challenge is easier.The device is a chameleon. It is easy to defeat her if you purchase the Clockwork Kazooie part from Humba's ShopSpiral Mountain  Grunty's plan for Spiral Mountain is revealed. She plans to industrialize Spiral Mountain, turning it into Grunty Acres. Grunty unleashes her five strongest vehicles in her final challenge. The first is a monster truck that is very fast. Then she drives a boat in the lake. After that, she pilots another invisible vehicle, fortunately however, it cannot fly. Then she uses an immobile impenetrable fortress to attack. Finally, she pilots a very fast airborne broomstick. After this is defeated, Grunty tries to assault the heroes, but L.O.G. intervenes again and tells her she lost the challenge, Spiral Mountain and her freedom. As such, the witch is sent to work in the videogame factory, she is shown busily working in the factory while Piddles bosses her around, however, right before the game cuts to credits, she cackles and states it was a mistake to bring her here, plotting to create her own video game (implying that she intended to lose in order to gain access to LOG's factory, or perhaps realised after her loss that she could use this to her\u00a0advantage).Physical appearance  Gruntilda's overall appearance resembled a stereotypical witch, with green-colored skin, gold-colored eyes, and dark-colored hair as well as dark witch robes with lighter interiors, and a purple scarf with differing-shaded zebra patterns and matching stockings, and mary janes, as well as a witch's hat. She also was shown to be significantly obese, and had an immensely long chin and a similarly long nose (the latter also featuring prominent warts on them). Probably her most notable characteristic, however, is her asymmetric eyes, where her right eye is fairly normal, while her left eye is left in a perpetual squint. The exact reasons for her seeming obesity have conflicting accounts: Although she implies in one of her taunts in her lair that she became obese from overeating, her appearance in Banjo Tooie, where she was depicted as a liche, depicted her with largely the same overall shape and even prominently featured her ribcage on the outside, implying that she was actually \"big-boned.\" Her appearance in Banjo Tooie was largely similar, although with some differences. Aside from the most obvious difference where she is reduced to a skeleton, her robes are now blue and purple, instead of black and red, and overall appearing tattered (with her witch hat even being slightly bent). In Nuts & Bolts, thanks largely to the stipulation behind the Lord of Games' having them compete with each other, her \"body\" is composed of a glass tank containing her skull as well as a hose that presumably fed nutrients to the skull, a mechanical witch's hat up top, and her body from the shoulders down largely resembled her original appearance, only with the addition of a slight silk frill near the lower part, as well as her mary janes being replaced with elf shoes. The clothes also have some stitches attached to them. In the game over sequence for the original game, Gruntilda's appearance after swapping around her and Tootie's respective physical appearances has her being significantly slimmed down, being given a petite yet busty appearance, with her dress shrinking to a great extent, as well as her possessing dress shoes with no socks. Her hat and purple striped scarf vanish for some reason.\u00a0Her face also has her nose shrink down significantly, and her eyes are changed from yellow to red, with her eyes also being rendered symmetrical.Personality  Like the rest of the characters in the series, Gruntilda has a very comical personality and often breaks the 4th wall. While possessing high intelligence and a sarcastic wit, Gruntilda is very arrogant and overconfident, never expecting Banjo and Kazooie to overcome all the trials and challenges placed before them. However, even though she's comical, she is nonetheless very evil and has never shown any form of kindness or concern for anybody or anything, even her own sisters. She is shown to be very power hungry and sadistic, hurting others for simply having a carefree and kind nature and longing to rule over the Isle' of Hags. Aside from the plan she had to take Tooty's beauty away in the first game, her evil nature is also shown in her abuse of her minions throughout the game as well as her abductions of the Jinjos. In the first game, Gruntilda had a fairly typical witch personality with her goal of being the best looking and trying to stop Banjo and Kazooie from interfering with her evil plans. She is also shown to be responsible for the numerous misfortunes of the countless lands she seized control of and has spread much chaos and suffering with her army of monsters.\u00a0During her taunting of Banjo and Kazooie as they make their way through her lair, she says \"When I'm nice and slim once more, burgers, fries, and chips galore!\", implying that she is a glutton. During the second game, Gruntilda is overall much more evil and sadistic, though she is still just as comical. She is forced to stop rhyming (because her sisters won't help her get her body back if she doesn't stop) and actually murders several characters, including an entire family of ten Jinjos, and her own two sisters in cold blood after they failed to stop Banjo and Kazooie. Klungo himself would be viciously beaten and tortured by Gruntilda throughout the entirety of the game despite being her most loyal follower and planned to have him killed, but due to Klungo switching sides and deserting his sadistic boss, he avoids this grim fate.\u00a0 Her aim is also considerably more fiendish in that she wanted to use B.O.B. to suck the life from all of Isle O' Hags to restore her body, which would of left countless living creatures as undead entities devoid of any life or energy. Due to Banjo and Kazooie foiling her plans and burying her under a rock, she holds a strong grudge against them and has a hunger and appetitie for vengeance against them, which she greatly relishes in the final battle against the pair. Despite this, she takes them just as lightly as she did in the first game, presumably due to her having so much more technology and numbers on her side, leading to yet another defeat. She does ultimately have some degree of honor, however, as during her final battle in Tooie, she states that when giving them quiz questions during the various phases of attack right before the Hag 1 was permanently shut down, she'll go easy on Banjo and Kazooie if they answer her questions correctly, and kept her word when they did, using slow-moving spells. However, her angered reaction when learning that they answered a question correctly implies that she felt bound to honor her word whether she liked it or not. On a related note, she also seems to have some distaste for cheat codes, as inputting them too many times will have Gruntilda proceed to erase the save pak for the game while expressing disgust for Banjo doing such. In addition, despite her less than stellar hygene practices (notably picking her nose in the beginning of the original game), she ironically has some distaste for Banjo going through filth, as after Banjo went through Loggo the toilet in Mad Monster Mansion, she demanded that he wash his hands immediately, while expressing disbelief that Banjo actually went down there. Based on her attempt at denying that her last name was Winkybunion after she inadvertently admitted it was her last name and her demanding, despite planning to kill Banjo and Kazooie anyway, that they not tell anyone that was her last name or else she'll sue them, she did not like her last name at all. In Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, her rise to power prior to Banjo-Kazooie is explained while the villian herself is shown to display a considerably more evil and intelligent demeanor. Her plans include abducting Kazooie and going back in time to alter history to erase her defeat and regain control of the island and resume her original plans. The game shows that prior to Banjo-Kazooie, Gruntilda abducted the Jinjos, seized control of their home to construct her lair, enslaved others, and stole the Jiggies from Master Jiggywiggy to exert her control over the lands she took over. It is additionally shown that the witch built up her army into huge numbers by heavily recruiting other monsters and beasts from the island. Her main objective is to round up all bears and birds and eradicate them entirely to ensure Banjo and Kazooie never exist, thus changing history to where Gruntilda would've never been defeated and her rise to power remaining unopposed. Gruntilda's plans in this game took a much more strategic approach as her operations were laid out more carefully and she craved to have pure power and control. In addition, she also wanted to continue her original plans of obtaining beauty once Banjo and Kazooie were taken care of. In Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, she displays a high level of intelligence, as she built the Gruntbots who assist her and the vehicles she uses. Unlike previous games, Gruntilda does not value upgrading her personal appearance, as she seems quite fond of her new mechanical body, but to solely have Spiral Mountain once again in her grasp and become its ruler. She was also shown to at least be smart enough to use potential setbacks and turn them into victories on her part, as implied by her claiming she now has access to the resources to make her own game despite being forced to work at LOG's factory upon losing to Banjo and Kazooie.Powers and abilities  Being a witch, Gruntilda possesses a large amount of magical powers. She was shown casting fireballs, homing spells, and generating a forcefield that was invulnerable to all but the Jinjonator, the last of whom still needed some effort to knock her over. She also attempted to curse Banjo and Kazooie in the ending, although this failed at the last moment. In Grunty's Revenge, aside from using Mecha Grunty, she also was able to split her soul into three to confuse her opponents. In Banjo Tooie, her spells were also lethal enough to kill people upon contact. However, she was unable to practice magic in Nuts and Bolts as a stipulation for participating in Lord of Games' contest, similar to how Banjo and Kazooie were forbidden to use their abilities from the prior games, due to his insistence on making things \"fair.\" Besides her magical abilities, she also has a technological genius, as it was implied that the Beauty Transfer machine was developed by her, and in addition, she was shown piloting the Hag 1 (although it was implied that she frequently consulted a manual in that case), and had modified her podium in the Tower of Tragedy in the event that Banjo somehow won the game show as a means to escape. In addition, during Nuts & Bolts, because of the stipulation regarding their participating in Lord of Games' contest forcing her to not use her magic, she compensated for this by building various mechanical robots made in her image as well as various vehicles to fight Banjo and Kazooie with. She was also shown to have a knack for surviving situations that would have killed an ordinary person, including falling from a great height and being crushed by a boulder (which she not only survived, but she even attempted to lift the rock off her), her flesh being eaten away for two years, and even having virtually her entire body save for her head completely obliterated. She also has some ability to tamper with the save file as displayed if the player uses the sand castle too much where she will delete the entire save file.Quotes from Tower of Tragedy Endings of the rounds: Grunty's Nicknames  Kazooie (and to a lesser extent Banjo) has also called Gruntilda by several nicknames: Additionally, Brentilda indicates her nickname in Witch School was one of the following:Similarities to other witches  Gruntilda's personality and actions resemble those of evil witches and other characters in fictional works. Her reason for kidnapping Tooty for her beauty is similar to the Evil Queen's motives in the tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, and her first lines in the game were even a parody of the Queen's famous \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?\". Ironically, in the Walt Disney adaptation, the Witch falls to her doom and gets crushed by a boulder as does Gruntilda at the climax of the final battle from the first game (though unlike Gruntilda, the Queen does die). She also bears resemblance to the Wicked Witch of the West from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its adaptations. Finally, her use of a cauldron and her two wicked sisters, Mingella and Blobbelda, resemble the wicked witches from William Shakespeare's Macbeth.Trivia See also Other sisters Banjo-Tooie  Banjo-Tooie is the second game (third in time line) in the Banjo-Kazooie series and is the sequel to Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge (in time line). Development for the game started even before the original Banjo-Kazooie was released. The game was developed by Rareware and released for the Nintendo 64 on November 19, 2000 on Japan, and in USA in April 12, 2001 , and celebrated its 10th Anniversary on November 19, 2010. Banjo-Tooie takes place two years after Gruntilda was defeated by Banjo and Kazooie in the first game. In this game, Banjo and Kazooie have to stop Gruntilda's sisters, Mingella and Blobbelda, from restoring Gruntilda's body to its original form. This game introduced some darker elements to the series, such as the death of Bottles.Plot Intro  On a dark and stormy night, two years after Gruntilda's defeat, Klungo continues his ongoing two-year effort to free\u00a0 the witch from beneath the boulder that crushed her following the final battle with Banjo & Kazooie in the previous game.\u00a0Meanwhile, Banjo, Kazooie, Bottles, and Mumbo Jumbo are playing poker together at Banjo's house, with Kazooie constantly cheating, such as claiming Grunty's return so that she could steal some poker chips. Suddenly, Spiral Mountain experiences tremors like that of an earthquake, which disrupts Banjo and friends' game. The tremors were caused by a massive digging machine called the Hag 1, piloted by Grunty's sisters, Mingella and Blobbelda, who have come to rescue their sister. After the quake, Banjo says someone should go investigate. Kazooie claims to be too scared, so Mumbo bravely decides to go. Kazooie then reveals she was faking so she can steal some of his chips. When the witches arrive, Klungo expresses his grief of failing to save his mistress, but her sisters assure they got it covered. They use a spell to destroy the boulder trapping Grunty, but as she climbs out, they realize she has withered away to nothing but an animate skeleton with robes. Grunty is not pleased about being a walking corpse, but Mingella and Blobbelda reassures their sister that they have a plan to restore her body, and she must come with them back to their castle. Having witnessed Grunty's escape from the boulder, Mumbo bolts back to the house, but is seen by the witches. The skeletal Grunty runs after him, firing spells rapidly. Upon reaching the house, Mumbo rushes inside to warn Banjo, Kazooie and Bottles. Grunty then starts charging a powerful spell to destroy them all. Banjo & Kazooie see Gruntilda, and leave at once with Mumbo, but Bottles, believing it to be another trick, stays put and ends up getting obliterated along with the house. The witch sisters then leave Spiral Mountain in the Hag 1, heading for their castle, leaving behind some minions to destroy the area as well as Klungo. The next morning, Banjo, Kazooie and Mumbo observe the damaged state of Spiral Mountain and their house. They witness Bottles crawling out of the ruins, dying and becoming a ghost. Mumbo is outraged by this turn of events and swears revenge. He tells Banjo and Kazooie to go after the witch before leaving behind the duo. Kazooie is excited to have another chance to beat Grunty again, but Banjo worries that this new adventure will not be as easy as the last one.Adventure  The duo follow the Hag 1's tracks into a cave, encountering Klungo, who attempts to impede them. After defeating the dim servant, who leaves to be violently punished by Grunty, they continute following the Hag 1's trails, leading them through various areas of the Isle O' Hags, the island on which Spiral Mountain & Grunty's lair is located, and the game's hub world. They arrive in Jinjo Village, where the Hag 1 has also caused trouble, flattening the house of the grey Jinjo family (one of the ten families residing in the village), and killing them. Banjo and Kazooie continue on, to the Royal Jinjo Palace, where King Jingaling, resides. The ravaging of Hag 1 scared the jinjos off, and King Jingaling requests the duo's help in gathering them back in the village. He informs them of Master Jiggywiggy and the ancient order of the Crystal Jiggy, which is crucial to their quest. He then gives them a Jiggy to help them get started, and opens a secret passage to the Isle O' Hags. While Banjo & Kazooie stop to discuss the encounter, Gruntilda and her sisters have arrived at Cauldron Keep, their lair. Mingella and Blobbelda introduces the B.O.B., Big O' Blaster, which can suck the life force out of any living thing. They intend to store large amounts of life force in a tank, and have Grunty shower in it, restoring her old body. Grunty decides to steal King Jingaling's life-force, as he just helped Banjo and Kazooie, and decides to deal with the rest of the Isle later. A beam is fired, making Jingaling's golden palace dead as a rock, and turning Jingaling into a zombie. Grunty reassures her sisters that with Bottles dead and Jingaling zombified, Banjo has no hope of reaching Cauldron Keep in time. Banjo and Kazooie, still outside the palace, narrowly miss the beam, and realize that the situation is much more desperate then previously anticipated. They continue to Bottle's house, where his family are waiting for him. Kazooie has no problem telling the family about Bottle's death, but Banjo convinces her not to. Using the passageway King Jingaling opened, they make their way to the Isle O' Hags. The two soon find the (closed) entrance to the first level, Mayahem Temple, and Master Jiggywiggy's sacred temple. They learn that Jiggywiggy is a powerful sorcerer (with a Jiggy-shaped head), who will help them on their adventure by opening worlds, but they need to gather jiggies to prove themselves worthy. With the first Jiggy at hand, they can start, and Mayahem Temple is opened. On their journey they collect a total of 90 Jiggies, and receive help from old and new friends. They often stumble upon Mumbo's hut, where he agrees to go out and use his magic to solve puzzles and open passages for them. They also encounter Drill Sergeant Jamjars, Bottles' military brother, who agrees to teach the duo new attacks (if, of course, they can present the proper number of musical notes). They also meet Humba Wumba, a female shaman and Mumbo's arch-rival, who requests magical Glowbos in exchange for transforming Banjo and Kazooie into something else (thus taking on the role Mumbo had in Banjo-Kazooie).Final Showdown  Finally, the pair reaches Cauldron Keep. After facing her henchman Klungo for the last time, Grunty traps the duo in her \"Tower of Tragedy\" quiz, where where she asks a series of questions based on the Banjo's current adventure (much like in Grunty's Furnace Fun), but only ends up mercilessly killing off her sisters for losing. After surviving the lethal game show, they hurry upstairs to reverse the effects of B.O.B., thus reviving Bottles and Jingaling. They then rush to the top of the tower and face off against Grunty with both her magic and Hag 1 machine, as well as answer a few more questions. After the duo eventually disable the Hag 1, Grunty resorts to using her most powerful spell (likely the same one she used to destroy Banjo's house and kill Bottles (and maybe even the same one she tried to use as she fell from her lair in the first game)), but they shoot one last egg at her, causing the witch to drop her spell in the Hag-1. The explosion destroys the machine along with most of her weak, skeletal body, leaving her nothing more than a talking head. Banjo and Kazooie return to the Isle o' Hags to celebrate with their friends, including the now reformed Klungo, but they arrive too late as the party was already over. Kazooie then suggests a new fun idea: kicking around Grunty's head atop Cauldron Keep, much to their joy and her disgust. She vows to have her revenge in the game's sequel, \"Banjo-Threeie\"Differences in gameplay from Banjo-Kazooie Main Characters Worlds  Just like the previous game, there are nine worlds, one overworld/hub world, and one starter world. This comes to a total of eleven worlds in Banjo-TooieStarter World Hub World Main Worlds Reception  Banjo-Tooie was critically and commercially successful upon the time of its release. The scores were consistently very high, rivaling its predecessor Banjo-Kazooie. IGN praised the multiplayer system and its characters but criticized the graphics for framerate speed issues during certain points in the game. Banjo-Tooie was nominated for many awards - including a nomination for the \"Moving Images Award\" at the 2000 BAFTA award ceremony, and was also nominated for \"Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year\", \"Console Game of the Year\", and \"Game of the Year\" at the 2001 Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences awards.Banjo-Tooie (Xbox Live Arcade)  On April 29, 2009, Rare released an Xbox Live Arcade version of Banjo-Tooie. Just like Banjo-Kazooie, the XBLA version of Banjo-Tooie features minor graphical refinements as well as increased screen resolution. The \"original plan\" of including Stop 'N' Swop was also implemented, using the Stop 'N' Swop eggs for\u00a0Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. 4J Studios, the developer that worked on the Xbox Live Arcade version of the original N64 Banjo-Kazooie game, was commissioned by Rare for the new version of Banjo-Tooie. A trailer for Banjo-Tooie was added to the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 10. The video, entitled \"Happy Easter Banjo-Tooie\" shows more of the game's Stop 'N' Swop features with Heggy and the eggs. It was released with gamer pictures featuring the six eggs and ice key, including three new eggs: silver, brown, and orange. On April 11, a premium theme was also released.Trivia See also Click Clock Wood  \u00a0 Click Clock Wood is the ninth and final world accessed from Gruntilda's Lair in Banjo-Kazooie. Click Clock Wood is a deciduous forest level world which revolves around a very large tree that is positioned in the center of the level. The level is divided into four different seasons, in which various actions can alter how the world will turn out in the later seasons.Points of Interest Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Extra Honeycombs Witch Switch Mumbo Tokens Extra Lives Stop 'n' Swop Mini-games  -Zubba's Minigame (summer only)Characters Enemies Trivia Rusty Bucket Bay  Rusty Bucket Bay is the eighth world in Banjo-Kazooie. It consists of a cargo steamboat called The Rusty Bucket, its dangerous internal workings and rooms, and the polluted water and harbor that surrounds it. The entrance to this world is located on the seventh floor of Gruntilda's Lair, through an underwater passage. However, the water level is too low on the duo's first visit and requires the water level switch in the graveyard section of Gruntilda's Lair to be activated first. Its picture is located high above the entrance through a small alcove. This can be reached either by activating the second water switch in the same room or by swimming into the next room and finding another tunnel with a breakable grate. Both lead to the same area and the picture is behind a breakable grate. The picture requires 12 Jiggies to complete.\u00a0Points of Interest Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Extra Honeycombs Witch Switch Mumbo Tokens Extra Lives Stop 'n' Swop Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts  In Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, a ship that bears some resemblance to the Rusty Bucket can be seen floating across the ocean beyond Showdown Town.

It consists of a giant pollution-spewing factory and the area around it.\u00a0Given its name, it's possible that Gruntilda is its CEO. The entrance to the world is in the Quagmire, and is easily visible and accessible. One of Grunty Industries' signature frustrations is that, upon first entering the world, it appears impossible to enter the factory proper: the main entrance is closed, and all other entrances are out of reach. The key is the Train Switch concealed behind the access shed on the right side, which opens the Train Station inside Floor 1. Once the player takes Chuffy in from another world, they then have full access to the factory, though they must still press a pair of split-up switches to open the main entrance for later convenience.Points of Interest Moves Learned Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Empty Honeycombs Cheato Pages Treble Clef  On top of the factory entrance, use the flight pads (alternatively shoot a Clockwork Kazooie egg\u00a0while airborne), Kazooie's Glide move, jump from the top of the building (best you have the FALLBACK cheat before trying this), or\u00a0fire a Clockwork Kazooie egg from in front of the entrance (this is very tricky to get just right).Characters Enemies Trivia Jolly Roger's Lagoon  Jolly Roger's Lagoon is the fourth level in Banjo-Tooie. It is a pastoral seaside town that, according to signpost outside it, is a famous tourist resort and is \"fun for all the family\". As one would expect, the town overlooks a large, deep-looking lagoon. The town proprietor, Jolly Roger, also runs the local inn, and Captain Blubber runs a store that rents waveracers out to tourists. Other points of interest around town include Pawno's Emporium, a small gift shop, Turtle View Cave; where sightseers can see Tiptup and Tiptup Jr., and a heavily-polluted communal pool located beside Jolly's. At first glance, Jolly Roger's Lagoon is a very small area with only the several aforementioned buildings, the actual lagoon, and little else. However, with a little help from Mumbo, it is discovered that the bulk of this world lies hidden under the sea, unfolding into a glorious and treacherous vista called Atlantis. The entrance to Jolly Roger's Lagoon is a closed gate found on a lone peak on the Isle o' Hags' Cliff Top.Moves Learned Collectibles Jiggies Jamjar Locations Glowbos Jinjos Empty Honeycombs Cheato Pages Others Minigames Characters Enemies Points of Interest Shortcuts to Other Worlds Etymology  Jolly Roger's Lagoon is likely named after the Jolly Roger, a symbol of piracy. It may also be derived from Jolly Roger Bay, a location from Super Mario 64.Trivia Stop 'n' Swop  Of all the secrets and mysteries in the Banjo-Kazooie series, none are more tantalizing or more talked about than Stop 'n' Swop. More rumors have circulated about it than about the large doors at the top of Gruntilda's Lair, and although most of them - both the silly and the sensible - are false, there are some truths in the clutter. The mystery involves six brightly colored \"Mystery Eggs\" and a large key made of ice found in Banjo-Kazooie, and their alleged use in its sequel, Banjo-Tooie. To use Stop 'n' Swop items, one would have needed to own both Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Toole. One had to collect the eggs in Kazooie\u00a0then switch the game off and insert Tooie. Originally, the player would have had ten seconds to swap game cartridges, but due to revisions in the Nintendo 64 hardware, the time was reduced to only one second, and therefore, became impossible. It had also been revealed by the Rare team at E3 2008 that the version of Banjo-Kazooie released on the Xbox live arcade would implement the Stop 'n' Swop feature as it was originally intended; however, it would be used in correspondence to Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. As a player collects the Stop 'n' Swop items in the arcade version, they unlock rare vehicle parts in Nuts & Bolts, for example: the Ice Key grants flags that have the Union Jack on them. The crates are hidden around Showdown Town but will appear by a drawing of that certain item on a wall or roof. Another item unlocks Roysten and his fishbowl as a part (needed for the LOG Banjo). On January 2009, it was announced on the official Banjo-Kazooie website that the \"original plan\" of including Stop 'N' Swop would also be implemented in the Xbox Live Arcade release of Banjo-Tooie, which was released in April 2009.Banjo-Kazooie  At the end of Banjo-Kazooie, if all 100 Jiggies have been collected, Mumbo Jumbo will show the player three animated photographs which reveal the locations of two Mystery Eggs and the Ice Key, in locations that players may have noticed previously to be inaccessible. Members of The Rare Witch Project hacked the game, and discovered codes that can be entered on the Sandcastle floor in Treasure Trove Cove that will allow anyone to reach these treasures, as well as another four eggs not mentioned by Mumbo. Once the items are collected, a menu appears on the pause menu, at the very end past Click Clock Wood. It has never since been discovered what this menu is for, and indeed what it does. Be Aware: If using these codes on the Xbox Live Arcade version of Banjo-Kazooie, Bottles will confirm if you want to use the Cheat. If you Press A, all saving will be stopped and your score will not be posted on the Leaderboards anymore.Cyan Mystery Egg  The Cyan Mystery Egg is found in the cellar of Mad Monster Mansion, in a barrel marked \"1881\"; it is a reference to Atic Atac, one of Rare's first games. Before entering the code one should note that the barrel is sealed with an \"X\". When Banjo and Kazooie enter this barrel, there is also water where this egg nestles. The code is \"CHEAT DONT YOU GO AND TELL HER ABOUT THE SECRET IN HER CELLAR\".Pink Mystery Egg  The Pink Mystery Egg is found in Sharkfood Island, a small mark of land in Treasure Trove Cove that, upon entering the code, rises to turn out to be a cave. Mumbo reveals it after the game is finished with all 100 Jiggies. The code is \"CHEAT OUT OF THE SEA IT RISES TO REVEAL MORE SECRET PRIZES\".Blue Mystery Egg  The Blue Mystery Egg is found in Gobi's Valley, behind an unopenable door which Gobi sits by before leaving the desert. The egg can be found inside a sarcophagus in the proceeding room. Mumbo reveals it after the game is finished with all 100 Jiggies. The code \"CHEAT A DESERT DOOR OPENS WIDE ANCIENT SECRETS WAIT INSIDE\" opens the tomb door.Green Mystery Egg  The Green Mystery Egg is the second egg to be found in Mad Monster Mansion; there seems to be no discernable reason for this, though. The egg is found in the bathroom, on top of Loggo. The code is \"CHEAT AMIDST THE HAUNTED GLOOM A SECRET IN THE BATHROOM\".Red Mystery Egg  The Red Mystery Egg is found in the captain's quarters in Rusty Bucket Bay, accessed by breaking one of the windows. And here, this egg is rotating on the captain's bed. The code is \"CHEAT THIS SECRET YOULL BE GRABBIN IN THE CAPTAINS CABIN\".Yellow Mystery Egg  The Yellow Mystery Egg is found in Click Clock Wood in Nabnut's house in the winter season. To reach it, one must enter through the window. The code is \"CHEAT NOW BANJO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT ON NABNUTS TABLE\".Ice Key  The Ice Key is perhaps the most mysterious Stop 'n' Swop item, predominantly because it is the only item that can be seen during normal play. It is found in Wozza's cave, in a small alcove; if the player uses first person mode, they can see through the ice to see the key twirling, but there is no way to get in. However, typing in the following code removes the unbreakable ice wall. Mumbo reveals it after the game is finished with all 100 Jiggies. The code is \"CHEAT NOW YOU CAN SEE A NICE ICE KEY WHICH YOU CAN HAVE FOR FREE\".Banjo-Tooie  Even though Rare dropped the Stop 'n' Swop idea, they decided to add three of the Mystery Eggs and the Ice Key to Banjo-Tooie. Each of these items unlocked a secret in the game.Ice Key  In Banjo-Tooie, the Ice Key could be found in a cave around the sandy area of Jinjo Village. It unlocks a large Ice Vault that holds the Mega-Glowbo. The Mega-Glowbo can be used in Humba Wumba's wigwam at the entrance of Witchyworld to transform Kazooie into a Dragon.Pink Mystery Egg  The egg is in Spiral Mountain, in front of the mountain. By bringing it to Heggy in Wooded Hollow, Banjo will be able to use a new move.Blue Mystery Egg  It is behind the waterfall in Spiral Mountain. It unlocks the homing eggs cheat in the code chamber at Mayahem Temple.Yellow Mystery Egg  The egg is found in Heggy's House, but it must be hatched by Kazooie. It unlocks the Jinjo in Squackmatch multiplayer.Banjo-Tooie (XBLA)  Unlike the original Banjo-Tooie the Stop 'n' Swop items are not available in the game unless they were collected in Banjo-Kazooie (XBLA) in which case the player starts with the items already collected. (The SnS items will be available in Banjo-Kazooie once the player has a save file in Banjo-Tooie or Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts. This includes the Nuts and Bolts Demo.) Heggy will hatch all the eggs which will unlock the three awards from the original (Breegull Bash, Jinjo as a multiplayer character and Homing Eggs) along with a gamer pic, a Xbox theme and Stop 'n' Swop II. The Ice Key is still used to access the Mega-Glowbo. Upon completion of Stop 'n' Swop new blueprints will become available in Nuts & Bolts if the player has L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges.Trivia Mad Monster Mansion  Mad Monster Mansion is the seventh world Banjo and Kazooie visit in Banjo-Kazooie. The entrance to this world is located in the Graveyard section of Gruntilda's Lair; this area is past the \"Lava Room\" on the sixth floor of Gruntilda's Lair. Its picture is located on the seventh floor, specifically the third room you enter through underwater passages. The picture requires 10 Jiggies to complete.\u00a0Points of Interest Abilities Learned Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Extra Honeycombs Witch Switch Mumbo Tokens  Oddly, the Mumbo Tokens marked with (*) are treated by the game as the same Mumbo Token. So collecting one will cause the other to disappear. This essentially means there are a total of 116 Mumbo Tokens in the game, though only 115 are obtainable.

It's nature of incompleteness is also referenced by Bottles, as in one of the missions, you were supposed to complete the mansion exhibit by lifting the pieces with the wrench and placing them on the square shaped white patch. However, this was ultimately scrapped and an air race took its place instead. He even states that the delivery van that had mailed the parts had accidentally emptied them into Loggo and they went straight to the Cut For Deadlines Room.Banjoland Info  \"Spine-tingling area of Banjo-Kazooie where our heroes met Loggo, a dozing ghost called Napper and an organ-playing spectral hand named Motzand.

During Banjo-Kazooie, most of the game is set in this massive area. Within the lair itself, there are entrances to nine different worlds: Outside of these nine worlds, there are a number of different rooms and sub-areas. The hat on top of the lair is actually a tower, which ultimately leads to the roof where the final battle against Gruntilda takes place in Banjo-Kazooie. Unlike most main antagonists' lairs, Gruntilda's Lair actually serves as a hub world of the first game. When Banjo and Kazooie visit the lair again in Banjo-Tooie, the lair has been severely wrecked, as the entrance inside of the cave shaped like Gruntilda's face is blocked by rocks, and the players only use of visiting this area is visiting Cheato. During Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, the lair is inaccessible but visible from the outside in Spiral Mountain (probably to make you focus on L.O.G.'s and Grunty's Challenges).Points of Interest Maps  Please make one and upload it!

It is a rundown, decrepit theme park with broken, dangerous rides and other unwelcome attractions. It had such a bad safety record it was closed down some time ago. It is run by deranged and hostile employees that will attack anyone on sight, as well as perverse purveyors running the unsanitary food stands. Witchyworld also has strict constraints on taking out food off of the park's premises. Any food that Banjo and Kazooie try to sneak out of Witchyworld is immediately confiscated, unless a certain route is taken. The park is divided into four sections, not counting the entrance or Big Top; the Space Zone, the Haunted Zone, the Wild West Zone, and lastly another space-based zone called Area 51. Each \"Zone\" has different scenery and attractions. The Space Zone has the Saucer of Peril, Dodgem Dome, and the Star Spinner. The Wild West Zone has an inflatable bouncy castle called the Crazy Castle and the Cactus of Strength. Finally, the Haunted Zone has the Dive of Death, the Inferno, the train station, and a freak-show consisting of an \"Ancient Bearded Camel\", a \"Mighty Evil Dinosaur\", and a \"Weird Killer Alien\". However most of the rides are out of service, and require a jolt of electricity from Mumbo to jump start them. The entrance is a locked gate located in the Pine Grove. It was originally meant to be in Banjo-Kazooie, but was put on hold due to time delays. This area was also featured in Banjo-Pilot.Moves Learned Points of Interest Collectibles Jiggies Jamjars Locations Glowbos Jinjos Extra Honeycombs Cheato Pages Treble Clef  In a van door in the Space Zone to the right.Mini-games Characters Enemies Shortcuts to Other Worlds Trivia Hailfire Peaks  Hailfire Peaks is a world found in Banjo-Tooie where Banjo and Kazooie fight twin dragons, take part once again in the Kickball Tournament, and ice and fire are combined.Points of Interest Lava Side Icy Side Moves Learned Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Extra Honeycombs Cheato Pages  Treble ClefCharacters Fire Side Ice Side Enemies Fire Side Ice Side Shortcuts to other Worlds Trivia Mumbo Jumbo  Mumbo Jumbo, often referred to as just Mumbo, is a skull-faced shaman who appears in every game in the Banjo-Kazooie series. Mumbo may be related to a \"Witch Doctor\".Personality  Mumbo generally likes helping people out and has a very strong loyalty streak - he's never stopped being Banjo's friend, while he's been equally permanent as Humba Wumba's rival. Humba and Mumbo seem to dislike each other, as when you go into her Wigwam as Mumbo she kicks you out. English does not appear to be Mumbo Jumbo's first language; he always speaks in the third person and doesn't always refer to people by their name. For instance, he often refers to Banjo and Kazooie as \"bear\" and \"bird\" respectively. Mumbo has strong pride in his magic abilities and frequently praises himself when his spells go right. He also seems to have some sense of humor, as he occasionally makes jokes about what he transforms Banjo into.Abilities  In Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, Mumbo transforms the duo into various forms. While his spells must stay within a limited distance of the originating world, the transformations make Banjo completely incognito and allow him to explore otherwise inaccessible areas. In Banjo-Tooie, Mumbo no longer performs the transformations but instead plays a more active role in the game. By giving Mumbo a Glowbo the player can take control of him. Mumbo is able to stand on a Mumbo Pad to perform a spell designed to make things easier for Banjo and Kazooie. While on foot, Mumbo can't do much but jump, swim, and attack with his Zap Stick, and he has one less health than Banjo. It is obvious he is extremely skilled in his magic, due to the fact that he is able to revive those who have died (as seen in Banjo-Tooie when he revived the Aliens) and even send a person back in time (as seen in Grunty's Revenge). In Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, Mumbo builds all the odd vehicles that the duo dream up. He also plays parts in various other worlds.Career  Mumbo's past is largely a mystery, although he repeatedly states he was the best student at the Handsome Shaman Institute. What is known is that he was a magical instructor of Gruntilda's at some point in time. However, despite Mumbo's teachings, Grunty turned to dark magic and transformed Mumbo's head into a skull. Mumbo first appears in Banjo-Kazooie as the \"best shaman in all game\". Found in multiple worlds starting in Mumbo's Mountain, the skull-faced one transformed Banjo and Kazooie into native animals (and a plant) in return for Mumbo Tokens, as Mumbo wanted to help the bear and bird beat Grunty to get his face back. Despite Grunty being buried under a large boulder, Mumbo's face remained intact. Mumbo remained a friend of Banjo, while he and Kazooie got into dust-ups. Two months later, when Grunty went back in time to prevent Banjo and Kazooie from meeting, Mumbo sent Banjo back in time to fix what she had done. In this time period, Mumbo was less skilled as a transformer, but still allowed Banjo and Kazooie to fix the timeline. In 2000, Mumbo was just about to get all of Banjo's cash in a poker game when Banjo's House started shaking. Being brave, the shaman ran outside to find out what was going on. He found that Grunty had been revived by her two sisters and ran to tell, but Grunty spotted him and destroyed the house and killed Bottles. On the following adventure, Mumbo did some adventuring himself, helping the bear and bird get around by magically altering the environment (such as re-railing a derailed train and making the water in Jolly Roger's Lagoon breathable). However, Mumbo earned a competitor in the transformation business, Humba Wumba. The two hated each other, each convinced that they were better than the other. In the end, Grunty was beaten once more, but Mumbo's skull face still didn't revert. In the time after Banjo-Tooie, Mumbo's transformation skills went unused. He decided to try his hand at mechanics for a change after getting wind that the next game would be all about vehicles. Finally, in 2008, Banjo and Kazooie showed up at Mumbo's Motors in Showdown Town for the first time. Mumbo gladly helped build all of the crazy vehicles the pair dreamed up, although he didn't like playing Lord of Games' \"parts\" in the game worlds so much. Nowadays, Mumbo is still the masked shaman everyone knows him as. He still holds out hope that Grunty will be defeated permanently some day so he can get his face back, although the skull-faced look may have grown on him.Spells  In Banjo-Kazooie, Mumbo transforms Banjo, at the cost of Mumbo Tokens. These transformations include: His hut is absent from Treasure Trove Cove, Clanker's Cavern, Gobi's Valley and Rusty Bucket Bay; as such, those levels don't have transformations. Very rarely, he mistakenly turns Banjo into a washing machine, before going on to turn him into the correct transformation. Also he mentions he would turn Banjo into a T-Rex but changes his mind, saying that the transformation is too good for the game and leaving it to the next game. During Banjo-Tooie, Mumbo performs spells for Banjo and Kazooie, as long as he has the magic of a Glowbo with him to perform it (otherwise he's incapable of doing so). His spells are:Mumbo's Nicknames  There has been quite a few nicknames that Kazooie has called him. Here is a list of themRelationships with other characters Banjo  Mumbo befriends Banjo and helps him on his quest because of their mutual hate for Gruntilda. Despite that he barely ever refers to him by name and often calls him \"bear\".Kazooie  Mumbo is another target of Kazooie's impulsive judgments, being insulted for his appearance and being nicknamed \"Mumbo Dumbo\" and other things by her. He tends to ignore her. Similar to Humba, Mumbo always calls Kazooie \"bird\", with the exception of the Dragon Kazooie transformation.Gruntilda  Mumbo's ultimate goal is to bring the witch down, as it is the only way to break the curse on him. Mumbo has good reason to resent Gruntilda, since he taught her how to perform magic.  In Banjo-Kazooie, if the player loses their last life or simply quits the game before saving Tooty and the ending is shown wherein Gruntilda makes herself beautiful by uglifying Banjo's sister, Mumbo\u2014apparently smitten with Grunty's new appearance\u2014will suddenly appear and offer her a flower! This indicates that he has a weakness for a beautiful face\u2014even when he knows full well that it's only skin deep... Mumbo also asks Grunty to come back to Mumbo's skull hut with him.Humba Wumba  The two shamans are rivals at first, both believing that they are more powerful than the other. At the end of Banjo-Tooie, the two seemed to have buried the hatchet after Gruntilda's defeat, and they both agree that it's fun to play ball using Gruntilda's head. In Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, however, it seems as if Mumbo and Humba are rivals again. Mumbo tells Banjo not to buy things from Humba every so often, signifying that the two are indeed, business rivals.Voice Actor Quotes Showdown Town Nutty Acres  Act 2\nTick, tick bang!

Oomenacka!Trivia Humba Wumba  Humba Wumba is a sha-woman who made her debut in the Banjo-Kazooie series in Banjo-Tooie. She introduced herself as Mumbo Jumbo's rival, taking up his previous role in Banjo-Kazooie as the shaman who transformed Banjo (and Kazooie eventually), while Mumbo performed a more active role by using his powerful spells around the world so Banjo and Kazooie could complete puzzles. In Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, she wears a pair of shorts that resemble Banjo's.Games Banjo-Kazooie  Humba Wumba is one of the few characters in the series who made an easter egg appearance prior to their in-game debuts. While Humba Wumba herself does not appear in the first game, her name gets mentioned as an incorrect answer to one of the questions Gruntilda asks Banjo in Grunty's Furnace Fun.Banjo-Tooie  Humba Wumba would reside in her wigwam in Banjo-Tooie, until the duo needed her magic. Humba's magic required a Glowbo to work, a magical creature Banjo and Kazooie would find around the world and bring to Humba Wumba. They would then throw it into a pool of water in the middle of the wigwam, and jump in to transform. Once the spell was completed, a Glowbo was no longer required for further transformations. If Mumbo ever came into the wigwam, she would tell him to get out. These are her transformation spells:Beta  In a beta screenshot for Banjo-Tooie in Nintendo Power Volume 134, Humba Wumba is seen wearing a red dress. The Mumbo Token symbol can be seen in the bottom right side of the screenshot, implying that Humba Wumba was at one time going to accept Mumbo Tokens instead of Glowbos. The picture can be seen in the Worker's Quarters in Grunty Industry with the Mumbo Token and Character speach icon missing.Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts  Humba Wumba appears in Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. Due to the lack of a need for transformations, her new role is selling pre-made vehicle blueprints and vehicle parts to Banjo. She also frequently appears in the different worlds to give challenges to Banjo.She appears in Nutty Acres, LOGBOX 720, Terrarium of Terror\u00a0and\u00a0Spiral MountainShowdown Town  Humba appears in the Town Square to sell vehicle blueprints and parts. She has a red feather on her head and wears a red plaid shirt with yellow shorts held by a black belt, and yellow rubber boots. She says she needs money for the magic recession fund and sometimes reminds Banjo that she will not turn him into a T-Rex.Nutty Acres  Humba acts as Mumbo's wife in this world. She is one of the only hard-working persons at the farm and always has to pick up the other's slack. She wears her normal clothes but with a straw hat, gloves and different boots. She hosts challenges in Acts 2,5, and 6. First, she needs Banjo to push the flaming boulders into water so the air is not polluted. Then she warns of Mr. Patch's imminent return and asks you to deflate him. In the last act, she needs you to carry a load of coconuts to Mumbo and get them approved for shipping and then to the docks.LOGBOX 720  Humba acts as a member of an all-girl gamer tribe. She wears a sleek black outfit and a green visor. She is always challenging Banjo to races and sees if he can beat her tribe. She is very competitive but is gracious in defeat. She appears in Acts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. She first wants Banjo to race some other workers to a race. Then she wants to race him herself in her plane. Later, she needs Banjo to test a race course where the checkpoints are raised in the air (This was because Klungo messed up the CPU). Lastly, she holds another race against some others workers.Terrarium of Terror  Humba appears as a conservationist who is trying to save the flora in the terrarium from extinction. She wears pink, floral pattern top and beige shorts. She is very passionate about her job and gets angry whenever the flowers are in danger. She appears in Acts 1, 2, 3 and 4. First she needs Banjo to drive her ecologically friendly vehicle up to a vantage point to observe the flower. Then she wants you to push some trash from the 1980s out of the airlock. Later she wants you to defeat a gang of Gruntbots who have invaded the terrarium.L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges  She plays the Feisty Femme Fatale that once tried out for the Colloseum, but didn't quite make it. Her challenge is riding a horse and having to jump hurdles and dodge cardboard stand-ins of Pedestrians.Spiral Mountain  She appeared at\u00a0Banjo's House\u00a0in the end of the game\u00a0to congratulate\u00a0Banjo\u00a0and\u00a0Kazooie\u00a0on winning the game and getting to stay in Spiral Mountain.\u00a0Trivia Kazooie  Kazooie is one of the two major protagonists in the Banjo-Kazooie series. She is a red-crested breegull who lives in her pal Banjo's backpack most of the time, poking her head out only to berate various other characters with insults and jabbering. She does leave the backpack on occasion, but her friendship (and rent-free apartment) with Banjo always leads her back eventually.Name origin  Kazooie's name, like Banjo's, is based on a musical instrument: the kazoo. Incidentally, Kazooie herself is known to be an experienced kazoo player, although the only time Kazooie was ever seen playing her kazoo was during the introduction theme in Banjo-Kazooie. Oddly enough, Kazooie's kazoo barely resembles an actual kazoo and looks more like a bugle. Interestingly, whether coincidence or not, the term bugle is phonetically similar to breegull.Personality  Kazooie's personality is very different from Banjo's. She is a wisecracking, obnoxious, sassy, cheeky, hot-tempered, slightly egotistic, tell-it-like-it-is loudmouth and \"teen\". This could be because almost everyone that Kazooie has met had insulted her in some way. Bottles, for example, called her a 'strange friend' and asked Banjo if she could talk and Mumbo Jumbo called her the 'filthy feathered one'. This could also be why Banjo and Kazooie are such great friends since Banjo hardly ever insults anyone (and if he does he usually apologizes). Kazooie likes adventuring (something which Banjo hates) and saving the world while she hates boredom, Banjo's lack of an attitude and facing backwards. During screensaver mode in Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, Kazooie will suddenly poke her head out the backpack and peck at Banjo's head for the fun of it. In both Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo Tooie, half the time Banjo might get irritated by this and wring her by the neck, choking her momentarily without doing any damage. Obviously, this may resolve that Kazooie is a bit of a prankster. Despite Kazooie's foulmouthed rudeness, she never insults Banjo at all. Being best friends and both with different personalities, it's obvious that she respects him greatly and will stop insulting upon Banjo's words, proving her loyalty to him, however she insults everyone and always make trouble. Despite all her flaws, Kazooie still has a good heart, always willing to help those in need (Provided that it has something to do with the adventure) and she has a strong sense of justice. She hates evil, like Gruntilda, and takes pleasure in defeating enemies.Abilities  Aside from fitting into a backpack with no apparent discomfort, Kazooie can fly, climb steep slopes that Banjo cannot, shoot eggs out of her beak and butt, become invulnerable for a limited time, attack enemies with her wings and hatch large eggs when alone. In Banjo-Tooie, if the Mega Glowbo is given to Humba Wumba, Kazooie is able to transform into the ferocious Dragon Kazooie. When paired with Banjo, Kazooie has even more skills at her disposal. The duo can perform a Forward Roll while running to attack enemies. Kazooie can use Banjo as leverage to perform a fast Peck attack. She can also enjoy Banjo's excellent swimming abilities and his ability to climb and grasp ledges, among other useful skills. In Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, the Bird and Bear have forgotten their abilities and instead must battle their arch-nemesis Gruntilda the Witch by creating awe-inspiring vehicles for all sorts of terrain and conditions. With an almost unlimited assortment of weaponry and gadgets to add to these machines, Banjo and Kazooie will no doubt be ready for whatever challenges their new adventures may bring. Kazooie is also given a magical wrench that not only allows her to smack her enemies, but also lets her magically carry objects and turn pipes. She attacks with it from the safety of Banjo's backpack. When getting the All-Star-Move in Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing with Banjo-Kazooie, Kazooie swings the magical wrench she got in Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts in the air to call up a \"Jiggy rain\". While doing that the typical Banjo-Kazooie music is playing.Career  According to Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, Kazooie was originally discovered by Banjo on Breegull Beach inside the blue backpack one day. For whatever reason, the two became friends at some point after that and Kazooie lived an annoyingly-quiet life with Banjo and his sister Tooty for an unknown period of time. In 1998, Kazooie finally convinced Banjo to go out on an adventure somewhere, although Banjo insisted on taking Tooty along as well. Kazooie got her wish when Gruntilda captured Tooty, forcing a rescue operation. Kazooie thoroughly enjoyed learning cool moves and witch-bashing, although having to deal with Bottles, Mumbo Jumbo and Banjo's constant desire to help everyone was a constant pain in the butt to her. Eventually, Grunty was buried and Tooty saved. A few months afterward, Klungo devised a plan for Grunty to escape her rock prison and go back in time, preventing Banjo and Kazooie from ever meeting. Kazooie was taken back in time by Mecha-Grunty in order to prevent her past self from meeting up with Banjo. Luckily, Banjo followed Grunty and, with help from Mumbo and Bottles' ancestor, rescued Kazooie. The two of them proceeded to beat Grunty and restore the timeline. Convinced that they had not seen the last of Gruntilda, Kazooie insisted that she and Banjo continue practicing their moves and refining their abilities. In 2000, her instincts proved correct when Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda rescued her and destroyed Banjo's House in the process, killing Bottles. Kazooie was instantly pumped to get off on another adventure and, while Bottles' brother Jamjars was every bit as annoying to her as Bottles himself was, she learned to separate from Banjo and lay the hurt on the witch's minions herself. After defeating Grunty a second time and reviving everyone who died, the duo went into \"rest mode\" once more. Kazooie, however, wasn't pleased with sitting around and doing nothing. She jabbered constantly at Banjo to keep practicing moves. Banjo flatly refused this time, deciding instead to start fixing up his house for a few weeks. After that, the pair slipped into a depressing lifestyle of boredom, Xbox 360 and pizza. After eight whole years of nothing, Grunty reappeared in 2008. However, another being also revealed himself: The Lord of Games, a near-omnipotent character that set up a vehicle-based challenge between Banjo and Kazooie and Gruntilda for the rights to Spiral Mountain. Kazooie was not one bit happy about this, since L.O.G. had swapped her moves for a magical wrench. After an arduous journey in which Kazooie constantly felt as if she got the shaft, Banjo finally defeated Grunty and legally earned the deeds to his home. Kazooie also got her old moves back, so the adventure wasn't a total waste after all. Then in 2010, Kazooie heard rumors of a racing tournament starring a blue hedgehog of some sort. Kazooie helped Banjo fix up the 'Bolt Bucket' and join in the race against Sonic and friends.Trivia  \u00a0\u00a0Cloud Cuckooland  Cloud Cuckooland is the eighth world found in Banjo-Tooie, (as well as being the final \"regular\" world). It is depicted as a strange, surreal and bizarre place\u00a0in the sky. To find the bubble necessary to enter\u00a0Cloud Cuckooland, one must search for a crack in the Wasteland of the Isle o' Hags. It also ought to be noted that while the other worlds\u00a0throughout your\u00a0adventure carry\u00a0an emphasis on\u00a0cross-connectivity with each other, this is the only level in the game (barring Cauldron Keep and Spiral Mountain) that isn't directly interconnected with any of the others, and one of few without a\u00a0train station. This is for obvious reasons, as\u00a0Cloud Cuckooland is set high above the Isle o' Hags in the clouds, and the only way to travel between Cloud Cuckooland and the Isle o' Hags is via the bubble.Points of Interest  [1] [2] [3]Moves Learned Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Extra Honeycombs Cheato Pages Treble Clef Jamjars Locations Glowbos Characters Enemies Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts  A painting/model of Cloud Cuckooland makes up its own area in the third world, Banjoland, appearing alongside the Rubbish Bin and the Cheese Wedge.

Interestingly, there is also a red stop n swop egg perched on one of the outcrops, that when smashed releases a Gruntbot.Banjoland Info  \"Cloud Cuckooland was the last challenge world of Banjo-Tooie. It took L.O.G. a lot of effort to get running smoothly due to its large, open nature, and was where Banjo met Mr. Fit.\"Trivia Jinjo  Jinjos are small creatures found in every game in the Banjo-Kazooie series. These bipedal teddy bear-like critters with beaks come in a variety of colors and are more intelligent than their appearance might let on. It is never explained in detail, but Jinjos seem to have some magical powers, possessing the ability to fly among other things. They also seem to be able to breathe underwater and live in harsh environments, due to the fact that many Jinjos are found underwater or in other dangerous surroundings. In Banjo-Tooie, it was revealed that Jinjos live in a small village and are ruled by King Jingaling, a very large, yellow Jinjo much larger in size of a normal Jinjo. It was also revealed that there are evil versions of Jinjos, known as Minjos, who disguise themselves as Jinjos and attack Banjo when he tries to collect them.Games Banjo-Kazooie Collecting Jinjos  Five Jinjos - a Blue, a Green, an Orange, a Purple, and a Yellow Jinjo have been hidden throughout each world by Gruntilda. Once all five Jinjos are rescued, the player will be rewarded with one of the world's ten Jiggies. Like Musical Notes, Jinjos' positions are reset once Banjo leaves the world, meaning that he must go through and collect them all again if he misses any the first time. Jinjos reappear in a world even after all five have been collected and gives Banjo and Kazooie an Extra Life rather than another Jiggy if they are collected again. In the XBLA version, they stay collected, like the notes.The Final Battle with Gruntilda  Jinjos aid Banjo and Kazooie in the final battle with Gruntilda as thanks for rescuing them. During the fourth stage of the fight, Grunty casts a magical shield spell over herself which makes her invincible to all attacks from the player. Several seconds later, four stone Jinjo statues rise from the ground in each of the tower's four corners. By firing 3 eggs into a small hole at the base of the statue, the Jinjos can be awakened, at which point they will fly through the air and collide with the helpless witch. After the consecutive attacks from all four Jinjos, Grunty's broom shatters, stranding her on the ground, but unfortunately her shield was still intact. During the fifth and final phase, a single, very large Jinjo statue rises from the center of the tower - the fearsome Jinjonator. 6 eggs (for each hole) must be fired into four holes at the base of the statue while avoiding the witch's rain of fireballs and homing spells. Once awoken, the huge Blue Jinjo's eyes will glow red and it will rise into the air, circling Banjo a few times before ramming Gruntilda at full speed. Only after several attacks is the Jinjonator able to knock her from her perch to the ground far below. One yellow jinjo also appears at\u00a0Treasure Trove Cove in the ending.Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge  In Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, the Jinjos have been scared away by Gruntilda, and they have left the Jinjo Oracle by herself. The Jinjo Oracle is a large stone statue that resembles a Jinjo. She needs the Jinjos to give her gossip because she can't get around. Banjo and Kazooie must find five Jinjos in each of the different worlds. After a Jinjo is collected the Jinjo Oracle will give a hint about finding a Jinjo or how to obtain a Jiggy in that specific world. When all five Jinjos are collected the Oracle will give Banjo and Kazooie a Jiggy and tell them information about the next world. Each world's five Jinjos are a different color. Spiral Mountain's Jinjos are pink, Cliff Farm's Jinjos are orange, Breegull Beach's Jinjos are yellow, Bad Magic Bayou's Jinjos are green, Spiller's Harbor's Jinjos are grey, and Freezing Furnace's Jinjos are blue. This is the only time in which Grey Jinjos need to be rescued.Banjo-Tooie Collecting Jinjos  The Jinjos of Jinjo Village were scared away when the Hag 1 drilling machine plowed through their village, killing the grey jinjos. King Jingaling begs the pair to return the Jinjos to their homes in time for the upcoming kickball tournament with the moles, but finding them isn't quite as easy as in Banjo-Kazooie; rather than five Jinjos in every world, Jinjos of nine differently colored families are scattered throughout all of the game's worlds including Spiral Mountain and the Isle o' Hags. Only once all of a certain color's family members are returned will Banjo and Kazooie be rewarded with the family's Jiggy heirloom. Furthermore, where certain colors appear is totally random and changes with every save file, meaning that where one Jinjo of a certain color was found on one file, any other color could be in its place on another. This also means that you have a chance of finding the Black Jinjo family before even unlocking the 3rd world, but the chances of this happening are extremely rare. Once a Jinjo has been rescued, rather than resetting once the player leaves the area, it returns to its family house in the Jinjo Village. If any Jinjos are still missing, a slow, sad variation of Jinjo Village's theme will play inside the house, whereas completed families have a happier, more upbeat tune. The White Jinjo family contains only one member. The Orange Jinjo family has two, the Yellow Jinjo family three, the Brown Jinjo family four, the Green Jinjo family has five, the Red Jinjo family six, the Blue Jinjo family has seven, the Purple Jinjo family has eight, and the Black Jinjo family, the largest one, has nine members. There is also a tenth house in the village which apparently belonged to the Grey Jinjo family, but it was demolished by Hag 1 on its way to the Cauldron Keep, and thus Grey Jinjos do not make an appearance in the game. It is presumed that the Grey Jinjos were a family of ten. An easy way to distinguish Jinjos from Minjos is to remember which Jinjo families were completed. That way players can know which are impostors. Another way is hit a Jinjo from distance. If the egg hits it, it will be a Minjo.Multiplayer Mode  Once Kazooie learns the Hatch ability, she can use it to hatch the yellow egg inside Heggy's Egg Shed. Once it has been hatched, Heggy will announce that a Jinjo is now an available character for the FPS-style Breegull Blaster shootout matches in Multiplayer Mode. The Jinjo is the smallest and fastest character, but also the most vulnerable, having only four health - a single hit from an explosive egg such as Grenade or Proximity Eggs that instantly defeats Banjo and Kazooie.Banjo-Pilot  A Purple Jinjo is a playable character in Banjo-Pilot. It only has one point of top speed, but four points of acceleration and five points of handling, making him best for courses where a lot of weaving is required, but ill suited to courses with long straight ways. The player also races against seven Jinjos in the unlockable Jinjo Grand Prix.Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts  Jinjos reappear in Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, and have a similar task of collection as in the previous games. Instead of Banjo simply locating Jinjos and collecting them, he must find them and complete a challenge, which varies from going over a set speed to making them roll a certain distance. Completing a Jinjo's challenge earns him a Jinjo Token, which can be used in Showdown Town for King Jingaling's Bingo Palace. Also in Showdown Town, there are six Jinjos locked up in cages around town. Banjo must free them with a Wrench Switch and take them to their homes. When a Jinjo is freed, a Minjo must be found and carried to an open cage to replace a Jinjo that has been freed.Trivia Banjo-Kazooie (series)  The Banjo-Kazooie series is a set of video games developed by the UK-based company Rare, Ltd. The first game, Banjo-Kazooie, debuted in 1998 for the Nintendo 64. A sequel was made in 2000 for the same system titled Banjo-Tooie. In 2003, an inter-sequel that takes place between the first two games, Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, was released for the Game Boy Advance, and in 2005 a spin-off racing game, Banjo-Pilot, was also made for the Game Boy Advance. Two ports of Grunty's Revenge, called Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge Mobile and Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge Missions, were later made available in 2004 and 2005 as applications for download on cell phones. Although all four titles in the series were made for Nintendo systems, Rare was bought by Microsoft in September of 2002. The next game in the series was therefore produced for the Xbox 360. That game, titled Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, was released in November of 2008. To celebrate this release, Microsoft and Rare also released updated versions of the original Banjo-Kazooie in December 2008 and Banjo-Tooie in April 2009, both of which are currently available for download on Xbox Live Arcade.Games in the Banjo-Kazooie Series Main Games Spin-Offs and Ports Related Games  These games are also related to and have special significance within the Banjo-Kazooie series:Unreleased Game Logos  See also:Banjo-Kazooie (series)/GalleryGlitter Gulch Mine  Glitter Gulch Mine is the second world in Banjo-Tooie. Entered through an old mine shaft in the Plateau, it is a large underground cavern filled with mountains of colorful, glittering gems and wondrous rock formations (many of these are known as Glitter ). The cavern was turned into an ore mine and filled with an intricate system of mine tracks. The mine was long since abandoned though, leaving behind only Canary Mary, Bullion Bill, and many Billy Bobs. Down even deeper, beneath the actual mines, is a complex network of tunnels known as the Ordinance Storage. Small, dingy, wooden shacks (such as the Power Hut, Crushing Shed, and Prospector's Hut) are littered all throughout the mine. Parts of the mine (especially underground) are very dark and require the use of generators to power up the lights. This level was to be featured in Banjo-Kazooie but was not finished in time, so it appeared in Banjo-Tooie. Other notable landmarks include the Gloomy Caverns, fungi-ridden caverns with small prison cells, and Bullion Bill's shack. Streams of water constantly flow through the mines, and most likely come from the Waterfall Cavern.Moves Learned Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Glowbos Extra Honeycombs Cheato Pages Treble Clef  In the muddy waters of the Water Storage Room, acessable through the waterfall Cavern or a part of the main area.Minigames/Shootouts Characters Enemies Points of Interest Shortcuts to Other Worlds Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts  Part of Glitter Gulch Mine, specifically the pile of crystals near the beginning, makes an appearance in the game's third world, Banjoland.

Based off the ancient Mayan civilization of Central America, it is a large, lush, forested jungle set around a large stone temple, known as Targitzan's Temple built to honor the great god Targitzan. Common sights to see are quicksand pits, ancient stone buildings, and large stadium dedicated to Mayan Kickball. Mayahem Temple is certainly not devoid of life since it serves as a home to the Stonies, a race of statuesque stone beings, and Moggies, a race of primitive and savage tigers. Bovina and Chief Bloatazin also live in settlements not far away from Targitzan's temple. Other points of interest include the Jade Snake Grove, where Ssslumber the snake lazily rests atop a pyramid guarding a Jiggy, the Prison Compound, where Dilberta is trapped, and the Code Chamber, where the Banjo and Kazooie can access a variety of different cheats codes given to them by Cheato. Notably, Mayahem Temple is double the size Mumbo's Mountain, the first level of Banjo-Kazooie. Mayahem Temple is also where Banjo and Kazooie first meet Humba Wumba, who takes over Mumbo's role of transforming the duo. The entrance to Mayahem Temple is in the Wooded Hollow, and is located right beside Master Jiggywiggy's temple.Moves Learned Collectibles Jiggies Jinjos Glowbos Empty Honeycombs Cheato Pages Treble Clef  Behind the giant temple.Minigames/Shootouts Characters Enemies Points of Interest Shortcuts to Other Worlds Trivia Freezeezy Peak  \u00a0Freezeezy Peak\u00a0is the fifth world Banjo and Kazooie visit\u00a0in Banjo-Kazooie.

Here you'll find the available breeds.Marwari Game Information Introduction to Horse  The Marwari horse was introduced to the game Howrse during the 2009 Summer World Tour.Other Game Information  The breed, just like the other horses on the game, underwent the 2010 coat style change and the amount of possible coats the horse could have. The breed is one with some of the most diverse amount of coat possibilities. This has helped lead to it's renown popularity. In the Summertime of 2010, the breed, along with many others of the game, had it's first Unicorn. The most notable player who have advanced the breed in popularity and skill is Sighthoundlady. She also lead the Marwari's Unicorn advances. Top Marwaris are now bred by the team MRSA lead by Creol Queen. The most notable members include Blaairy, Azura and Ryiu. On Howrse it is more likely to get a Marwari than a Hanoverian in a cross breed of these breeds.Real Information  The Marwari, or Malani, is a rare breed of horse from the Marwar (or Jodhpur) region of India. Known for its inward-turning ear tips, it comes in all equine colours, although pinto patterns tend to be the most popular with buyers and breeders. It is known for its hardiness, and is quite similar to the Kathiawari, another Indian breed from the Kathiawar region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Marwari are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses, possibly with some Mongolian influence. The Rathores, traditional rulers of the Marwar region of western India, were the first to breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari in India, and in the 2000s horses have begun to be exported to the United States and Europe.Arabian Horse Servers Found on Other Game Information International server  The Arabian was an original howrse breed on Howrse. The breed underwent the game change in 2008-'09 and also took part in the spring of 2010 as the game went underneath and pulled up another fresh set of coats. The most common nickname is\u00a0Arab. The breed has been the most popular since the time the game was created. The most common coats are dapple grey, light grey, and chestnut. Top breeding teams include silvestrix (now Apostle) and their SweetnSpicy affix, later Kaytarah led by sassyk. Recently, Arabians have been overtaken by the Gypsy Vanner team The Dauntless Group as the top Stamina team and Cross-Country Grand Prix team. Since this change, long-time second-tier group Sikoa Emperor Arabians became the top group of the breed.

As a wedding gift when Peleus married ocean goddess Thetis, Poseidon gave the two to King Peleus, who then gave him to his son, Achilles. Achilles had a third, mortal horse, named Pedasos, who was worked as a trace horse alongside Balios and Xanthos. Pedasos was killed by a spear thrown by Sarpedon, which had been aimed at Achille's comrade Patrolcus, the former groomer and feeder of the three horses. When Patrolcus was also slain, Xanthos and Balios stood motionless on the battlefield and wept. When Xanthos was rebuked by the grieving Achilles for allowing Patroclus to be slain,\u00a0Hera\u00a0granted Xanthos human speech, breaking Divine law. The Latin spelling of Balios's name is Balius. There are seven different types of Balios: Balios, no matter his type, cannot be bred. He has 658 Genetic Potential.Gypsy Vanner Gypsy Vanners Coats and Colors: Servers Found on:  All servers have this breed.Other Game Info:  The Gypsy Vanner is a Horse breed on Howrse that excels in Stamina, Dressage, and Jumping.

In the spring of 2010, they participated in another change. Size:\u00a0from\u00a014.2\u00a0hands to\u00a015.2\u00a0handsReal Info  The Appaloosa is an American horse breed known for its distinctive physical characteristics, most notably its spotted coat. Originally bred by the native Nez Perce tribe, the breed takes its name from the Palouse River that ran through Nez Perce territory. It is considered the first official American horse breed. While there is evidence of leopard-spotted horses dating back to the Paleolithic era in Europe, the Nez Perce people developed the breed in America. Appaloosas were once referred to by white settlers as the \"Palouse horse\", but gradually, the name evolved into \"Appaloosa\". The Nez Perce lost most of their horses following the Nez Perce War in 1877 and the breed fell into decline for several decades. However, a small number of dedicated breeders kept the Appaloosa alive until a registry was formed in 1938. Today, the Appaloosa is one of the most popular breeds in the United States, and it was named the official state horse of Idaho in 1975. They are good at barrel racing in western competitions.Old Version look Divine Horses  Divine horses are rare horses that can be won from promotions or bought for a large amount of passes after a dedicated promo. Sometimes they are able to be won in luck items such as Golden Fleece, Horn of Plenty and Titan's Challenge or by achieving a certain rank in a promo. They usually have their own special effect or bonus.Mythological Divines  These divines are in a group with several sections, all of which vary.Female Divines With Limited Reproduction Abilities  Many female divines have the ability to breed with another divine of the opposite gender and the same type of divine (e.i. Water with Water, Chinese with Chinese). These divines can only breed once to give birth to unique foals. Sometimes they can also breed a second time to obtain an ultimate horse; ones that can only be obtained by collecting all of its family members.The Mother and Father of All  Gaia and Ouranos are the creators of horses. If you ever see the word \"foundation\" or \"foundie\", it means that the parents of the horse are these divines.Water Divines  Water divines have the unique ability to switch their skills around every day. Today they are amazing at galloping, tomorrow they are terrible at dressage. Snow is the only Water divine that has the ability to be bred for a certain type of competition.Nordic Divines  There are 6 Nordic divines. Each is inspired by a divinity from Nordic mythology. They earn a prize once they earn a certain amount of points that are obtained by rides - though when taking rides one has to be careful as only one ride will give points, the rest will take them away.Gemstone Divines  There are fourteen Gemstone divines. They offer you diamonds when certain objectives are fulfilled, which can be used to increase their skills. Once a player has all of the Gemstone divines, he/she is offered Diamond, the most special Gemstone divine there is.Solar System Divines  The Solar System divines are horses that resemble the planets and moons in the solar system. Their skills can be increased by taking them on rides on their designated planet (or moon.)Wind Divines  The Wind divines are unique horses.

The American Paint Horse is a breed of horse that combines both the conformational characteristics of a western stock horse with a pinto spotting pattern of white and dark coat colors. Developed from a base of spotted horses with Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred bloodlines, the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) breed registry is now one of the fastest-growing in North America. The registry allows some non-spotted animals to be registered as \"breeding stock Paints,\" and considers the American Paint Horse to be a horse breed with distinct characteristics, not merely a color breed in reality. |Thoroughbred Game Info Skill info:  Stamina\u00a0\u00a0 110.99\nSpeed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 202.84\nDressage\u00a0 183.52\nGalloping\u00a0 256.05\nTrotting\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53.31\nJumping\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 164.29Size:  Thoroughbreds range in size from 15.2 hands to 16.2 handsRanking:  Amongst purebred horses, Thoroughbreds have the highest Genetic Potential .

Many well-ranked cross-bred horses have thoroughbred decent Notable players who have enhanced the skills of the breed: Apostle, Nix, SpartanCat, yani, and ILUVTCW.Real Info:  The Thoroughbred is a popular horse used in racing, mostly speed races. They are well-rounded in other events such as dressage, cross-country, and show jumping, but are best at sports that require speed. They are the fastest horse breed in the world. They perform best in Gallop and Speed training. They are best (currently) at gallop races. In reality, The Thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing. Although the wordthoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. Thoroughbreds are considered a \"hot blooded\" horse, known for their agility, speed and spirit. The Thoroughbred as it is known today was first developed in 17th and 18th century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Arabian Stallions. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 1600s and 1700s, and to 74 foundation mares of English and Oriental (Arabian, Turkoman or Barb) blood. During the 1700s and 1800s, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 1800s. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist worldwide today, with over 118,000 foals registered each year worldwide. Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing, but are also bred for other riding disciplines, such as show jumping, combined training, dressage, polo, and fox hunting. They are also commonly cross-bred with other breeds to create new breeds or to improve existing ones, and have been influential in the creation of many important breeds, such as the Quarter Horse, the Standardbred, the Anglo-Arabian, and various Warmblood breeds. Thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion, which has resulted in high rates of accidents and other health problems. Racing has been proven to have a higher fatality rate than all other legal human and animal sports. Also, Thoroughbreds are prone to other health complications, including bleeding from the lungs, low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof to body mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and research continues in the field.Old Versions BLUP  Best Linear Unbiased Prediction -- BLUP -- is a measure of a horse's training that affects the foal(s) of the horse and owner. The lowest BLUP possible is -100 which is only present in newborn foals. The highest is 100 BLUP which can be difficult, but not impossible, to achieve.Effects of BLUP  BLUP is the ability for a horse to pass on its genetics. Two parents with high BLUP will have a greater chance of giving innate/inborn skills to their foals, and a greater chance of an increase in GP.Increasing BLUP  Increasing a horse's Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) is not difficult, but it takes at least ten years of a horse's life. To attain 100 BLUP, a horse must have: When a horse, pony, or donkey makes all three of these criteria, he or she has 100 BLUP. The percentages of BLUP are broken down as follows: 20\u00a0% of BLUP is gained each day up to age 10 = 40 points 65\u00a0% for all rides and training done in top 3 skills = 130 points 15\u00a0% for 20 victories = 30 points (1.5 pts per victory) = 200 pointsDonkey  Coats and Colors:Other Game Info:  The donkey is the only breed where the GP for the next generation falls instead of rises. . A donkey can only be bred three times (4 times if you're a VIP player and have the divine horse Tianma). A mare can carry one foal (or 2 if a fertility wand is used) and a male can also only breed a maximum of 3 times. Make sure to check how many coverings a donkey has before you buy it! Check the breeding tab on the donkey's page. If it says that the donkey has had less than 3 coverings, then you will be able to breed it, but if the donkey has already been breed 3 times, you will not be able to.Servers  On howrse, there are many servers and you can pick whichever one you want.

Most spells are done with the aid of a wand, even though it is possible to perform magic without one. Wands have different cores, woods, lengths and flexibilities. These factors, along with the owner's life experience and magical ability, combine to define a wand's character. As a result, no two wands are exactly alike. Originally, you could only acquire a wand on Pottermore after exploring the first 5 chapters and completing the Diagon Alley mission.Introduction  \"Wands\" is first discovered on Pottermore Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, chapter 5, Diagon Alley, \"Ollivanders\". From \"Magical Objects: The Top Ten\":Acquiring a Wand  Wands can be purchased at Ollivanders for a price of 7 Galleons. Ollivanders Bespoke Wand Selector matches Pottermore players with a wand. After going through a set of 7 questions, players are presented with a wand made from a wood and core chosen according to their answers. Most witches and wizards go to buy their first wand when they are eleven, just before starting their magical education. Most English wizards and witches get their wands at Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC in Diagon Alley, where they may try out multiple wands until they find the one that suits them, or rather, the wand finds the wizard that suits it.Wand Components  No single aspect or component of a wand should be considered independently of the others because they complement or counterbalance each other to make wands unique.Cores  All wands contain a magical substance known as a wand core. Wandmakers use a wide variety of substances, such as veela hair or kelpie hair, but Ollivander only uses three substances that he calls 'the Supreme Wand Cores': Other substances known to exist in the Harry Potter universe, but not used by Ollivander, are:Woods  Very few trees produce wand-quality wood, although these trees can usually be identified if they have Bowtruckles. Current known wand woods are: *Some of these wand woods are not available on Pottermore, but are known to be used in the Harry Potter world.Celtic calendar  While assigning the wands of certain characters, J.K. Rowling used the Celtic tree calendar: the Celts had assigned trees to different part of the year, much like the Zodiac still used in astrology. Although there may be some variations on this calendar, the following one is the calendar J.K. Rowling used and which used to be available on her web site. It is known that the wands of Harry, Ron (his first wand), Hermione and Draco are made of the wood that is linked to their date of birth.Flexibility  Wand flexibility or rigidity denotes the degree of adaptability and willingness to change possessed by the wand-and-owner pair. Possible flexibilities include:Length  Most wands are between 9-15 inches long. Wandmakers often match the wand length to the height of witch or wizard who will use it, but Ollivander considers this measure inadequate. In his experience, longer than average wands tend to be drawn to those with a physical peculiarity or a bigger personality whereas abnormally short wands select people whose character lacks in something.At Flourish and Blotts  At Flourish and Blotts is the fourth chapter of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, consisting of three\u00a0moments.

According to the original Pottermore welcome letter, when Ravenclaws are extremely upset he makes little cupcakes do a dance to cheer them up.Ghost  The Grey Lady also known as Helena Ravenclaw, is the Ravenclaw ghost. She rarely speaks to anyone outside Ravenclaw, but is a great resource for Ravenclaws who are lost or have lost something.Notable Members 1987-1994 1989-1996 1990-1997 1991-1992 school year 1992-1993 school year Ravenclaw Tower  The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in Ravenclaw Tower on the west side of the castle. Students enter through a door with an bronze eagle-shaped knocker. The knocker asks a question of anyone who knocks on it and opens the door when the question is answered correctly. If the riddle is especially difficult, large groups of students may congregate outside the door as they try to figure it out. The common room is circular, with arched windows that provide incredible views of the Hogwarts grounds, and a domed ceiling painted with stars like the night sky. It has a white marble statue of founder Rowena Ravenclaw, and behind it lies the door leading to the dormitories. The dormitories are in turrets off the main tower, where students can hear the wind whistling around the windows. The bedsheets on the four-poster beds are made of sky blue silk.Welcome Message  \"You probably know that some of Ravenclaw\u2019s most renowned members include Gilderoy Lockhart and Luna Lovegood. But did you know Ravenclaw\u2019s Grey Lady is the least talkative Hogwarts ghost, or that Ravenclaw\u2019s common room boasts the most stunning views of the castle grounds? Here you can discover more about your beloved house through writing by J.K. Rowling, articles by Pottermore and all the latest Ravenclaw news.\"Old Pottermore Welcome Message  \"I\u2019m Prefect Robert Hilliard, and I\u2019m delighted to welcome you to RAVENCLAW HOUSE. Our emblem is the eagle, which soars where others cannot climb; our house colors are blue and bronze, and our common room is found at the top of Ravenclaw Tower, behind a door with an enchanted knocker. The arched windows set into the walls of our circular common room look down at the school grounds: the lake, the Forbidden Forest, the Quidditch pitch and the Herbology gardens. No other house in the school has such stunning views. \"Without wishing to boast, this is the house where the cleverest witches and wizards live. Our founder, Rowena Ravenclaw, prized learning above all else \u2013 and so do we. Unlike the other houses, who all have concealed entrances to their common rooms, we don\u2019t need one. The door to our common room lies at the top of a tall, winding staircase. It has no handle, but an enchanted bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. When you rap on the door, this knocker will ask you a question, and if you can answer it correctly, you are allowed in. This simple barrier has kept out everyone but Ravenclaws for nearly a thousand years. \"Some first-years are scared by having to answer the eagle\u2019s questions, but don\u2019t worry. Ravenclaws learn quickly, and you\u2019ll soon enjoy the challenges the door sets. It\u2019s not unusual to find twenty people standing outside the common room door, all trying to work out the answer to the day\u2019s question together. This is a great way to meet fellow Ravenclaws from other years, and to learn from them \u2013 although it is a bit annoying if you\u2019ve forgotten your Quidditch robes and need to get in and out in a hurry. In fact, I\u2019d advise you to triple-check your bag for everything you need before leaving Ravenclaw Tower. \"Another cool thing about Ravenclaw is that our people are the most individual \u2013 some might even call them eccentrics. But geniuses are often out of step with ordinary folk, and unlike some other houses we could mention, we think you\u2019ve got the right to wear what you like, believe what you want, and say what you feel. We aren\u2019t put off by people who march to a different tune; on the contrary, we value them! \"Speaking of eccentrics, you\u2019ll like our Head of house, Professor Filius Flitwick. People often underestimate him, because he\u2019s really tiny (we think he\u2019s part elf, but we\u2019ve never been rude enough to ask) and he\u2019s got a squeaky voice, but he\u2019s the best and most knowledgeable Charms master alive in the world today. His office door is always open to any Ravenclaw with a problem, and if you\u2019re in a real state he\u2019ll get out these delicious little cupcakes he keeps in a tin in his desk drawer and make them do a little dance for you. In fact, it\u2019s worth pretending you\u2019re in a real state just to see them jive. \"Ravenclaw house has an illustrious history. Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house, including Perpetua Fancourt, the inventor of the lunascope, Laverne de Montmorency, a great pioneer of love potions, and Ignatia Wildsmith, the inventor of Floo powder. Famous Ravenclaw Ministers for Magic include Millicent Bagnold, who was in power on the night that Harry Potter survived the Dark Lord\u2019s curse, and defended the wizarding celebrations all over Britain with the words, \u2018I assert our inalienable right to party.' There was also Minister Lorcan McLaird, who was a quite brilliant wizard, but preferred to communicate by puffing smoke out of the end of his wand. Well, I did say we produce eccentrics. In fact, we are also the house that gave the wizarding world Uric the Oddball, who used a jellyfish for a hat. He\u2019s the punch line of a lot of wizarding jokes. \"As for our relationship with the other three houses: well, you\u2019ve probably heard about the Slytherins. They\u2019re not all bad, but you\u2019d do well to be on your guard until you know them well. They\u2019ve got a long house tradition of doing whatever it takes to win \u2013 so watch out, especially in Quidditch matches and exams. \"The Gryffindors are OK. If I had a criticism, I\u2019d say Gryffindors tend to be show-offs. They\u2019re also much less tolerant than we are of people who are different; in fact, they\u2019ve been known to make jokes about Ravenclaws who have developed an interest in levitation, or the possible magical uses of troll bogies, or ovomancy, which (as you probably know) is a method of divination using eggs. Gryffindors haven\u2019t got our intellectual curiosity, whereas we\u2019ve got no problem if you want to spend your days and nights cracking eggs in a corner of the common room and writing down your predictions according to the way the yolks fall. In fact, you\u2019ll probably find a few people to help you. \"As for the Hufflepuffs, well, nobody could say they\u2019re not nice people. In fact, they\u2019re some of the nicest people in the school. Let\u2019s just say you needn\u2019t worry too much about them when it comes to competition at exam time. \"I think that\u2019s nearly everything. Oh yes, our house ghost is the Grey Lady. The rest of the school thinks she never speaks, but she\u2019ll talk to Ravenclaws. She\u2019s particularly useful if you\u2019re lost, or you\u2019ve mislaid something. \"I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a good night. Our dormitories are in turrets off the main tower; our four-poster beds are covered in sky blue silk eiderdowns and the sound of the wind whistling around the windows is very relaxing. \"And once again: well done on becoming a member of the cleverest, quirkiest and most interesting house at Hogwarts.\"House Cup The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1  The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1 is a book written by Miranda Goshawk.

It disappeared in the big site revamp of 2015, and whether it will return or not is unknown at the moment. Potions are magical mixtures commonly brewed in cauldrons and used to create various effects on the drinker. A wizard or witch who specialises in potion brewing is known as a potioneer. Potions are brewed from ingredients with magical properties. Potions can be used as medicine, lethal poison, or give the drinker any effect from strength enhancement to immunity to flames. Potions are not necessarily used by drinking, as some can be applied by physical contact or creates an effect simply by being created. On the most recently update, difficulty levels for potion-brewing has been added. the difficulty levels are \"Easy, Medium and Hard\". If you use a Pewter Cauldron, the difficulty level will be \"Easy\", the Brass Cauldron's difficulty level is \"Medium\" and the Copper Cauldron's difficulty level is \"Hard\". The Potions class is taught in the Potions Classroom.Brewing potions  Once you have the right ingredients you can begin to brew potions. Successfully brewed potions can be given to your friends as gifts, or kept for self-use, and you'll also be awarded\u00a0house points for your efforts. You will lose house points for badly-brewed potions, so follow the instructions carefully. Before you brew a real potion, you can practise making Cure for Boils and you won't win or lose any house points for trying, even if you succeed. When following the instructions given to you in your book, students must follow the instructions in the order given. Example: If the book says heat your cauldron and then crush ingredients in your mortar, students are required to do it in that order. If students choose to crush their ingredients before heating their cauldron, they will fail at brewing the potion. You can only brew one potion at a time, so choose your cauldron wisely.Potions House points comparison Pewter Cauldron Brass Cauldron Copper Cauldron Strategies and Tips  Potion-making can be a very costly practice since you have to buy ingredients every time you make a new potion. However, there are some ways to mitigate the cost of your potion making:Books New from J.K. Rowling  It is often asked whether a Muggle could create a magic potion, given a Potions book and the right ingredients. The answer, unfortunately, is no. There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion (merely adding dead flies and asphodel to a pot hanging over a fire will give you nothing but nasty-tasting, not to mention poisonous, soup). Some potions duplicate the effects of spells and charms, but a few (for instance, the Polyjuice Potion, and Felix Felicis) have effects impossible to achieve any other way. Generally speaking, witches and wizards favour whichever method they find easiest, or most satisfying, to produce their chosen end. Potions are not for the impatient, but their effects are usually difficult to undo by any but another skilled potioneer. This branch of magic carries a certain mystique and therefore status. There is also the dark cachet of handling substances that are highly dangerous. The popular idea of a Potions expert within the wizarding community is of a brooding, slow-burning personality: Snape, in fact, conforms perfectly to the stereotype.J.K. Rowling's thoughts  Chemistry was my least favourite subject at school, and I gave it up as soon as I could. Naturally, when I was trying to decide which subject Harry's arch-enemy, Severus Snape, should teach, it had to be the wizarding equivalent. This makes it all the stranger that I found Snape's introduction to his subject quite compelling ('I can teach you to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death...'), apparently part of me found Potions quite as interesting as Snape did; and indeed I always enjoyed creating potions in the books, and researching ingredients for them. Many of the components of the various draughts and libations that Harry creates for Snape exist (or were once believed to exist) and have (or were believed to have) the properties I gave them. Dittany, for instance, really does have healing properties (it is an anti-inflammatory, although I would not advise Splinching yourself to test it); a bezoar really is a mass taken from the intestines of an animal, and it really was once believed that drinking water in which a bezoar was placed could cure you of poisoning.Trivia The Burrow  The Burrow is the third chapter of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.See also Curses and Counter-Curses  Curses and Counter-Curses is a book written by Vindictus Viridian that can be found on the bench in Christmas\u00a0at Hogwarts.

However, certain pages and actions within Pottermore, continued to occasionally reveal point totals. These leaks were reported and combined to derive the live current standings. Pottermore is apparently unaware of the leaks at present. One site reporting the totals in near real-time is housecup.info.\u00a0Notes Trivia See also Houses  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. The Sorting Hat places students into Houses based on their personal traits. Pottermore players are sorted in the chapter The Sorting Hat [Book 1, Chapter 7]. They then receive welcome letters from a prefect in their house, gain access to the house common room and start earning house points.Gryffindor  Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor's emblematic animal is the lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. Gryffindors are known for daring, nerve and chivalry. Minerva McGonagall is the most recent Head of House and Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as \"Nearly Headless Nick,\" is the house ghost. Gryffindor is traditionally Slytherin's rival.\u00a0\u00a0They were awarded the second Pottermore house cup with Gryffindor members earning the privelage to download photos and pictures as wallpapers and screensavers. Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire.Slytherin  Slytherin\u00a0is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin. Slytherin's animal is the snake and its colours are green and silver. Students in Slytherin possess the traits of cunning, resourcefulness and ambition. The house is composed mostly of pure-blood students, due to its founder's mistrust of Muggle-born witches and wizards. Slytherin house has a negative reputation, with many claiming that it is the source of most Dark Wizards in Britain, notably Tom Marvolo Riddle, a.k.a. Lord Voldemort, as well as many of his Death Eaters. Serverus Snape is the Head of House and the Bloody Baron is the house ghost. It has a traditional rivalry with Gryffindor. The great wizard Merlin was in Slytherin. Slytherin was awarded with the first inaugural house cup with Slytherin members having early access to the first chapters of the second \"Harry Potter\" book. Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of water.Hufflepuff  Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The founder was Helga Hufflepuff. Its animal is the badger, and yellow and black are its colours. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive of the four houses, valuing hard work, patience, loyalty and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. It has produced the fewest Dark Wizards of any house. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat Friar is the house ghost. Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth.Ravenclaw  Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw. Its house colours are blue and bronze, and its symbol is the eagle. Members of this house are characterised by their wit, intelligence, creativity and wisdom. The Head of House is Filius Flitwick and the house ghost is the Grey Lady. Many great wizards and witches have come from this house, including Filius Flitwick, Garrick Ollivander and Luna Lovegood. Ravenclaw roughly corresponds with the element of air.External Links Letters from School  Letters from School was the first moment of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 4, At Flourish and Blotts.

As a key component of various military combined arms operations, wanzers have been shown to engage in combat alongside tanks, helicopters, fighter jets and other real world weapon platforms. As time has gone on Wanzers have become progressively more standardized with the modern platform coming in two varieties: Non-combat wanzer technologies see use among civilians, such as in civil engineering. Civilian-grade machines are known as wanderwagens, and have a WAW designation, while military wanzers have a wanderpanzer (WAP) designation.Overview  The typical wanzer consists of four parts: a body, two arms, and legs. WAPs, which are about 120% bigger than WAWs, tend to be around 5.5 meters tall and, on average, weigh roughly 25 tons. As wanzer technologies developed, different types of wanzers begin to fill varying combat roles on the battlefield, involved in frontline combat, emergency repair of other weapon platforms, electronic warfare and reconnaissance. The development of WAW and WAP units also leads to derivative technologies, such as armored vehicle-wanzer hybrids known as \"Mobile Weapons\" (sometimes referred to as \"Huge Wanzers\"), armored vehicles that possess superior firepower and durability than the standard wanzers. Another derivative of wanzers is the \"Advanced Wanzer \". Advanced wanzers are prototype models boasting offensive and defensive capabilities far greater than the average wanzers. They also tend to be 25% to 100% taller than the standard wanzers. Advanced wanzers have been revealed to be standardized with the formation of the MULS-P2 standard; regular wanzers are built on the MULS-P standard. Although wanzers were initially used as land-based weapons, their uses have expanded to underwater and air support, and as of the 2170s, in space as well. Although it's a versatile weapons platform, wanzers are not strong enough to handle armed forces alone, and they can be surrounded and taken down through guerrilla tactics. Therefore, militaries tend to train wanzer pilots to operate together and work with other weapons platforms. Wanzers are seldom used alone. Not all soldiers can become wanzer pilots, since piloting a wanzer has been shown to tax both physical and mental strength. In fact, piloting a wanzer seems to be a highly stressful experience for certain individuals, presumably because of the dim and enclosed environment of the cockpit. However, some other evidence doesn't seem to be quite consistent with this view, since many individuals who apparently do not have that level of strength were also seen to pilot wanzers, with a decent level of efficiency. For example, Lira Labra was also seen engaging in battles in her wanzer during the Alordesh coup d'etat, but her physical build looks nothing like individuals with more extensive military experience. All in all, it is currently unclear what level (or types) of physical and mental strength it takes to pilot a wanzer efficiently.Related Organizations  WAW and WAP production is a booming industry, with many military and non-military organizations involved in the business. There are numerous arms manufacturers who are known to produce wanzer models, such as Diable Avionics\u00a0of U.S.N. America and Jade-Metal Lyman of O.C.U. Australia. Wanzer production is known to be a highly competitive field, with new models frequently entering the pool of over a hundred models during the timeline between 2090 to 2112. Many scientists, including engineers, physicists, and psychologists become involved in the study of these technologies, from researching efficient uses of wanzers in warfare to improving medical technologies such as cybernetic implants and artificial limbs. A notable example is the Durandal\u00a0of\u00a0E.C. Britain, an organization dedicated to researching ways to improve the efficiency of wanzers in combat. It seems that the toy industry has profited from wanzers as well, with children have been shown to possess toy wanzers.History  For many years, men had labored in research labs to improve machine designs, ultimately attempting to bring them closer to human beings in form. Robotic science was a rapidly-growing field in the late 20 and early 21 centuries, but a consistent problem was their mobility and the fact that they moved in a rather ungainly fashion that did not resemble humans. However, in the year 2020, the same year as the formation of the United States of the New Continent (U.S.N.), Dr. Landoldt of Wallenstein University and German arms manufacturer Schnecke proposed the model of a new actuator. This was a significant accomplishment, as it enabled the creation of machines that can move in more \"human\" manner. This proposal immediately drew the interest of the U.S.N. military. Schnecke, Dr. Landoldt and American arms manufacturer Diable Avionics soon joined hands in their research, and in 2025, they completed the first of these machines, called the \u201cwanderwagen\u201d (from the German words wander, \"to walk\", and wagen, \"car or carriage\"), abbreviated as WAW. At this time there was no functional distinction between WAW and WAP. Additionally parts of WAWs were not modular and therefore made manufacture and repair expensive. In the following year, The WAW began service in U.S.N. military. However, at this stage, the wanderwagen technology was still too expensive to have any practical military use. This changed in 2029, the M.U.L.S. (Multi-Unit Link System) was created by leading weapons manufacturers Schnecke, Diable Avionics, English arms manufacturer Sender, and Australian arms manufacturer Jade Metal-Lyman established this as a standardized platform for WAW technology to reduce developmental and production costs. This system represented a worldwide collaboration involving many of the major world powers. In that same year, the first mass-produced WAW, codenamed \"Cicada\", was completed. The U.S.N. Army purchased 97 of these machines, and the E.C.'s German Army ordered 15 of them. Meanwhile, political strife in Africa led to the beginning of the African Conflict in 2034. Squadrons of O.C.U. WAWs were deployed on battlefields across Africa. This was the first time the technology had been used in a combat situation; and it proved to be very effective. Research and development began focusing on making WAWs more suitable for military operations. It took several years, but in 2040, Schnecke and Diable Avionics released a new WAW-standard tailored for military applications. Considerably cheaper and more powerful than before, the new MULS-P standard paved the way for mass production and the machines soon became a large part of militaries around the world. To distinguish them from the WAWs, those made for military use were dubbed \u201cwanderpanzers\u201d (German for \u201cwalking armor\u201d), \"WAP\" or \u201cwanzers\u201d for short while keeping the WAW name for civillian designation. Thus, the wanzer as a weapon of war was born. From this point forward, the wanzer became a standard piece of wartime machinery, appearing often in international skirmishes. When the First Huffman Conflict began in 2070, squads of wanzers were deployed to fight in the battles. Wanzer production helped maintain world economies as seen in the case of Alordesh. As the wanzer continued to prove its worth on the battlefield, research and development continued at a brisk pace, to further advances in wanzer technology and build better, more powerful models. In the mid-22 century, a new M.U.L.S. standard was formed to facilitate mass-production of advanced wanzers. Dubbed MULS-P2 and exemplified by Driscoll's Raven, this new standardization greatly reduced manufacturing costs and led to a decline in older MULS-P wanzers as they were deemed inferior to the newer and larger models. Arms manufacturers slowly phased out the usage of old wanzers, relegating them to civilian uses, and began production of the new MULS-P2 compatible wanzers.In-Game Mechanics  Wanzers differ from other combat units in that it has four modular parts: body, left arm, right arm, and legs. Each part serves a specific function and has its own stats. Body keeps the wanzer operating. Upon its destruction, the wanzer will lose all battle capacity. Arms are equipped with weapons. If an arm is destroyed, the weapons equipped on it will cease functioning. Legs enable movement and evasion. When legs are destroyed, evasion will be lost, and movement will be severely impaired. A wanzer can continue fighting even if its arms or legs are destroyed, but its performance will be conceivably impaired. The back of the Body can be equipped with backpacks, which serves various functions such as emergency repair and carrying items. Each arm has two places for equipping weapons: Hand and Shoulder. The hands are generally equipped with guns or melee weapons, while the shoulder are typically for heavy artillery such as missile launchers, grenade launchers, and cannons. However, most of the time players will not be able to fill all four spaces due to the limitation of weight. Other than practical customization, players can also choose the colors of their wanzers. However, this feature is purely aesthetic, except in Front Mission Alternative and Front Mission Online, where the color schemes can serve as camouflage. Wanderwagen by comparison are shown to have a chassis that is uncustomizable save for weapons (hand or shoulder), and paint. With units appearing fragile but swift; able to dodge missiles with jump jets and block weapons with shields and utilize custom made components. However repair proves an expensive task with commanders often encouraged to minimize losesAbbreviations  Some installments in the Front Mission series use different designations for wanzers:Trivia Zenith  The Zenith is one of the most iconic wanzer models in the Front Mission series, appearing in all canon installments except Front Mission Alternative. It is the flagship wanzer line of Jade Metal-Lyman.Overview  Zenith and its variants are well-balanced machines that are employed heavily by the O.C.U. military. It is deployed primarily as assault units, although it is also capable of melee roles. Although developed for use in the O.C.U., the Zenith is imported by companies, organizations, and private militaries around the world. This is reflected by the fact that as seen in various installments, Zenith and its variants have been seen deployed by many different military units, even the U.S.N. were seen employing some Zenith wanzers in Huffman Island. One Zenith wanzer was also seen in the base of Japanese Defense Force (J.D.F.), suggesting that the J.D.F. also employed the model. In Front Mission Evolved, the Zenith LXXI-HB is the latest model in Jade Metal-Lyman's signature series. Widely used throughout the OCU, The LXXI-HB offers a well-balanced, all-terrain performance, making it a pilot's popular choice. In fact, the Zenith series has been so successful that the Jade Metal-Lyman has so far failed to establish other wanzer lines. When production of the series was temporarily suspended, the manufacturer's net income loss was so significant that it was forced to resume its development of the valuable Zenith model. The \"H\" in the designation indicates that the model uses a hydrogen fuel cell engine, while the \"B\" indicates that its manufacture is military-grade.Specifications Zenith V Variants Statistics Overall  Statistics Chart (At maximum upgrade level.)Body  Body Statistic Progression ChartArms  Arms Statistic Progression ChartKnown pilots Gallery  Add a photo to this galleryTrivia Front Mission Evolved  Front Mission Evolved is a third-person video game developed by Double Helix Games and published by Square Enix. It was released in Japan on September 16, 2010, in North America on September 28, 2010 and in Europe and the PAL regions on October 8, 2010 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.Gameplay  As a\u00a0third-person shooter, the gameplay of\u00a0Front Mission Evolved\u00a0differs from the\u00a0tactical role-playing game\u00a0entries of the numbered\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0titles. Rather than being played out on a grid-based map and using a turn-based structure, battles takes place in real-time on full 3D maps akin to\u00a0Front Mission Online. Game progression in the single player mode of\u00a0Evolved\u00a0works similarly to other\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0entries, and is done in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. Unlike other\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0titles, the player can redo missions at any given time using the\u00a0Act Select\u00a0feature. Players can earn\u00a0Trophies\u00a0or\u00a0Achievements\u00a0if they own the\u00a0PlayStation 3\u00a0or\u00a0Xbox 360\u00a0version of the game. In the multiplayer mode of\u00a0Evolved, players can compete against each other in\u00a0PvP\u00a0matches through one of four game modes, or in\u00a0PvE\u00a0matches via a\u00a0DLC\u00a0game mode called \"Last Stand\". Wanzer customization in the multiplayer mode of\u00a0Evolved\u00a0works similarly to\u00a0Front Mission: Online\u00a0in that the parts, auxiliary backpacks, and weapons the player can access is entirely dependent on their military ranking. Military rankings work in a progression-based fashion; players must complete mission assignments to earn experience and advance in rank. A player can also raise their rank by scoring kills against players on the opposing team. Missions aside,\u00a0Evolved\u00a0boasts other new features as well as returning ones, particularly from\u00a0Front Mission Series: Gun Hazard. The game introduces new auxiliary backpacks, Gunship Mode and a feature known as \"EDGE\". Hover backpacks allow wanzers to move around quickly or hover above the ground. Anti-missile backpacks increase enemy missile lock-on time, and release flares to throw off missile fire. Featured only in the single player campaign, Gunship Mode is a combat mode in which the player fights on a gunship; this mode plays out like a\u00a0rail shooter. E.D.G.E. is a unique ability that slows down time and allows the player to better react against enemy attacks. This feature is only seen in the single player campaign. The lone returning feature in\u00a0Evolved\u00a0is Infantry Mode from Gun Hazard, which is only available in the single player campaign. In Infantry Mode, players can go into combat on foot, but will not be able to ride any vehicle.Story  The game is set in the year 2171, 50 years after the events of Front Mission 5: Scars of the War. During the 22nd century, the world's superpowers look towards space for expansion and began constructing large structures called orbital elevators. With an increasing number of surveillance satellites and space-based technologies being developed, a\u00a0Cold War-style atmosphere sets in as the supranational unions used these technologies to watch over their adversaries on Earth. The plot of\u00a0Front Mission Evolved\u00a0revolves around USN engineer Dylan Ramsey. As an engineer for the weapons developer Diable Avionics, Dylan begins testing of a prototype wanzer on Long Island, New York. In the midst of the wanzer test, unknown forces begin attacking New York City and its orbital elevator, Percival. Worried about his father's safety in the city, he sets off for New York City inside the prototype. As he travels through the city to reach the National Strategic Research Laboratory (NSRL), Ramsey assists USN forces battling the unknown assailants. After battling through numerous enemy wanzers, vehicles, and aircraft, Dylan makes it to the NSRL premises just as missiles are launched into the building. With his father seemingly dead, he engages the attacker, Marcus Seligman of the Apollo's Chariot. The fight is cut short when the orbital elevator begins crashing down on New York City. After Percival collapses, Dylan is recruited into the USN Army as it prepares for war against the Oceania Cooperative Union.Characters Frost  The Frost is one of the most iconic Wanzer models in the series. It appears and is playable in all main series installments except Front Mission 3 (though it appears in the opening movie) and was also featured in Front Mission Evolved. It is the flagship model line of arms manufacturer Diable Avionics of U.S.N. America.Overview  The Frost and its derivative Blizzaia series are heavy armor type wanzers, boasting thick levels of armoring and advanced leg stabilizers that allows them to withstand enemy fire and maintain balance. While not boasting a level of armoring equal to a main battle tanks, the Frost HW models (which were designed specifically for Hell's Wall) have 400 mm armor plates attached onto the base armoring. As a result of this, the Frost HW is one of the few MULS-P wanzers that boasts a level of durability stronger than a main battle tank. The Frost's unique defensive scheme allow it to fulfill a variety of combat roles, from close-range assault types to long-range launcher types. The Frost's primary weakness is that it lacks mobility and therefore cannot travel around battlefields as fast as most wanzers. The lack of mobility was later rectified in the Blizzaia model line, which removes excess armoring around the arm and leg joints. Although this makes it more vulnerable to damage in those particular areas, the armoring around the core remains intact.Known Statistics  Frost Height: 6.1 meters Weight: 27 tonsDeployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Front Mission 5: Scars of the War  Front Mission 5: Scars of the War is the fifth game in the main Front Mission series, which focuses on the various conflicts between several world powers: the USN, OCU, EC, OAC, and Republic of Zaftra. The game was released on December 29, 2005 in Japan only. Both English and Russian fan translations are available for those who wish to play the game outside of Japan.Gameplay  Front Mission 5: Scars of the War\u00a0borrows much of the core gameplay mechanics found in\u00a0Front Mission 2, as well as a plethora of features from other\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0entries. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up their wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. Military bases and supply camps act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. Missions in\u00a0Scars of the War\u00a0are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets to protecting a certain allied target. There are a number of returning features from\u00a0Front Mission 2\u00a0that are used for mission play, namely Action Points (AP) and Links. Action Points (AP) is a feature that dictates how much actions can be done with each unit. Actions such as moving and attacking require a certain amount of AP to use. At the end of a full turn, which is one Player Phase and Enemy Phase, a set amount of AP is replenished. A unit's AP amount and recharge value depends on its pilot's proficiency levels; the higher it is, the greater the amount of AP that can be used and replenished. Links is a feature that allows multiple units to provide offensive and defensive support to each other during battles.\u00a0Scars of the War\u00a0streamlines this feature by allowing up to six units to form one \"link\" for Player Phase and Enemy Phase battles. As long as a unit's pilot has a Link-class skill and the appropriate weapons equipped, they can participate in linked battles. Incorporated into the Links feature is pilot types; this dictates the linked actions that a unit can do during combat. For example, an aggressive pilot will attack with complete disregard for friendly fire situations and AP. Likewise, a defensive pilot will avoid causing friendly fire, but will disregard this concern if they have used repairs on an allied unit in the line of fire. Returning features aside,\u00a0Scars of the War\u00a0has a number of new gameplay mechanics, the most notable being friendly fire. Unlike other\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0titles, any units in a weapon's line of fire will be subject to being hit by its rounds. Each weapon class has a distinct firing path; for example, shotgun rounds spread in mid-flight and can hit units away from its firing path. Another new addition is part skills; parts can be equipped with special features that grant them unique properties. For example, rifles can shoot through multiple targets in its line of fire with the part skill \"Piercing\". Auxiliary backpacks from\u00a0Front Mission 4\u00a0that make a return include: item, turbo, repair, jetpack, sensor, and EMP backpacks. Several of the auxiliary backpacks have new functions: item backpacks come with a small increase in power output, sensor backpacks can use EMP, and EMP backpacks can add armor coats or repair damaged parts. Outside of battles,\u00a0Scars of the War\u00a0also boasts a\u00a0New Game +\u00a0option as well as a\u00a0Hard Mode\u00a0difficulty setting. Other returning features from other\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0entries include: Arena, Battle Simulator, briefings, mission branching, and remodeling. Other new features to\u00a0Scars of the War\u00a0include: part sorting, scouting, Survival Simulator, and Theater Mode.Plot Story  See also: List of Front Mission 5 characters The plot of Scars of the War revolves around USN soldier Walter Feng. When Huffman Island is deemed ready for colonization by the United Nations in 2065, Feng becomes one of the island's first immigrants. Living in Freedom City, Walter befriends two other children - Randy O'Neill and Glen Duval. The three boys experience first-hand the realities of war during the outbreak of the 1st Huffman Conflict in 2070; Walter and Glen are literally scarred by shell casings during a battle in Freedom City. The three boys were separated at the end of the war when the USN forcefully repatriates Walter and Randy, and Glen is forcefully repatriated by the OCU. The three reunite during a peacekeeping operation as soldiers for their respective armies during the Huffman Crisis. Upon seeing Glen pilot a wanzer, Walter and Randy sign up for the USN Army's wanzer training program. As tensions between the OCU and USN elevate to a new high from the Larcus Incident, the two men qualify as wanzer pilots. However, on the same day they qualify, Walter and Randy are sent off to fight in the 2nd Huffman Conflict. During the invasion of Freedom City, they encounter Glen in the suburbs of city and defeat him. Feng and O'Neill visit Duval before he is shipped off to a POW camp. A year later, the three face off again on the battlefield - this time, Glen easily defeats his friends. However, instead of showing mercy, Glen kills Randy inside his cockpit block. A ceasefire between the OCU and the USN is declared shortly after he escapes. Traumatized by the experience, Walter cleans up Randy's quarters in an attempt to move on with life. Seeing an application form for the Strike Wyverns assault unit, Feng signs the form and undergoes intensive training. He passes the test and joins the unit, where he meets his old friend Edward Collins and new commanding officer Lynn Wenright. Over the next few years, Walter participates in numerous military operations and begins to take an interest in the conflicts he gets involved with. From Zaftra's struggles involving natural resources to pro-independence movements in the OCU, Feng gets drawn into a global war between nationalism and globalization that has been on-going for decades. At the heart of this conflict is the Grimnir - a terrorist organization aimed at destabilizing the supranational unions and returning to a world governed by nation-states.Characters United States of the New Continent Oceania Cooperative Union The Grimnir Zephyr  The Zephyr is a Wanzer model that appeared in Front Mission Evolved. It was produced by Diable Avionics of U.S.N. North America.Overview  The Zephyr is primarily characterized by its decent output and mobility, and thus seems likely to be deployed as assault or sniper units. It was said that the Zephyr model was designed to specifically facilitate use of the E.D.G.E. System. As of 2171, it is still in the prototype phase. The Zephyr was piloted by Dylan Ramsey, who tested the Wanzer and later used it as his personal Wanzer in the war. It was destroyed by S.C.I.O.N. when Dylan protected Adela Seawell from one of its attacks.Variants Known Pilots Trivia Front Mission First  Front Mission (known in re-releases as Front Mission First) is a turn-based tactical role-playing game developed by G-craft and published by Square in 1995 for the Super Famicom. It is the first game in the Front Mission series and the second piece of media released under the Front Mission brand, the first being Front Mission Zero. An enhanced remake of the game was released for the WonderSwan Color in 2002, PlayStation in 2003, and Nintendo DS in 2007. Of all the game's releases, only the DS version was released outside Japan, though an emulated English-language translation of the original Super Famicom version is available.Gameplay  Game progression in\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0proceeds in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a point-and-click world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize, backtrack, and set up their units for the upcoming mission. Battle zones are where the missions take place, though they become inaccessible upon the completion of a mission. In Front Mission, players use playable units called wanzers, a term for mecha derived from the German word Wanderpanzer, or \"walking tank\". A wanzer differs from the typical combat unit in that it has four modular parts: body, left arm, right arm, and legs, in accordance with the MULS-P standard . Each part has a specific function and its own health bar. The legs parts enable movement and evasion, the arm parts are necessary to use hand and shoulder weapons, and the body part maintains the wanzer's operability. In the event the body is destroyed, the wanzer is removed from play completely. Destruction of arm and leg parts does not remove the wanzer from play, but it severely cripples its performance. While the player fights mostly wanzers, vehicles, aircraft, and mobile weapons platforms are also featured. These enemy units generally have only one part, the body, and are much stronger than wanzers themselves. In the customization aspect of Front Mission, wanzers can be customized with a variety of parts, computers, auxiliary backpacks, and weapons. The player has full control over customizing their wanzers and can do so as long as its total weight value does not exceed its given power output. To field a wanzer in battle, it must have a complete frame of parts: body, left arm, right arm, and legs. Parts with built-in weapons in the body or arm sections can also be equipped on a wanzer. Computers improve the accuracy of the weapons equipped on the wanzer. Auxiliary backpacks and weapons are not mandatory equipment to use wanzers, but are crucial in order to progress through the video games. Auxiliary backpacks serve to give a wanzer special features during combat; they allow a wanzer to carry support items such as ammunition reloads and increase the power output of the unit, allowing it to carry heavier gear. There are four classes of weapons: melee weapons, short-range weapons, long-range weapons, and support fire weapons. Melee weapons are weapons used at melee range and have a tendency to strike the body part of its target. Tonfas and rods are examples of melee weapons. Short-range weapons are weapons used at close range and deal damage to all parts of a target. Machine guns and shotguns are examples of short-range weapons. Long-range weapons are weapons that have long firing ranges and are ideal for avoiding counterattacks. Bazookas are examples of long-range weapons. Support fire weapons are indirect fire weapons; they can never be counterattacked, but have limited ammunition supply and minimum firing ranges. Missile launchers are examples of support fire weapons. Lastly, shields can be equipped on wanzers to absorb some of the damage taken from incoming attacks. Front Mission has other notable features incorporated into the game. The arena is a unique feature in which the player can fight AI-controlled enemy combatants, or face another player to earn monetary rewards. Likewise, Front Mission sports a briefing feature that details basic information about the composition of enemy forces for the upcoming mission. Missions in Front Mission are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets or protecting a particular allied target.Plot Story  Set in 2090, the story of Front Mission takes place on Huffman Island and revolves around OCU captain Royd Clive. An OCU reconnaissance platoon led by Royd is assigned to investigate a USN munitions plant in the Larcus District, located on eastern Huffman Island. Upon reaching the premises, the platoon is ambushed by USN wanzers led by an officer named Driscoll. He quickly ambushes Karen Meure, Royd's fianc\u00e9e, and destroys her wanzer. As the two forces engage in battle, Driscoll detonates explosives inside the plant and escapes. The USN accuses the OCU of the attack, later known as the Larcus Incident, but the OCU insists that the incident was a set-up. Both sides soon declare war, setting off the 2nd Huffman Conflict. The OCU pins the blame of the incident on Royd's platoon, discharging them from the military and classifying them as MIA during exercises. One year later, OCU colonel Guri B. Olson seeks him out at a wanzer arena in the town of Barinden. Using the prospect of killing the person responsible for Karen's death, he manages to recruit Clive to the Canyon Crows mercenary outfit. With the Canyon Crows, Royd is assigned to help the OCU military reverse its fortunes and win the war. In the PS1 remake, a second scenario was added, with the player assuming the role of USN Black Hounds officer Kevin Greenfield. A number of mysteries and plot elements shown in the OCU campaign are examined further from the USN's perspective, as well as featuring tie-ins from Front Mission 4. However, numerous plot elements remain unresolved that later play a significant role in Front Mission 5: Scars of the War. In the DS remake, the connections with Front Mission 5 are fleshed out further through expanded and new scenes and the appearance of characters such as Glen Duval, Walter Feng, Randy O'Neill, and Hector Reynolds. The tie-ins with Front Mission 4 are also expanded, with additional material and equipment, such as the Zelt wanzer, and the inclusion of Darril Traubel and Billy Renges.Remakes  Front Mission was first re-released on the Japan-exclusive WonderSwan Color in 2002. The following year, the game was released as Front Mission 1st for the PlayStation. This version included new material and the ability to play from the USN's point of view. This content was used in the Nintendo DS version, which was released in Japan on March 22, 2007, and in North America on October 23, 2007, simply titled Front Mission. A mobile phone version was also released in Japan. In the Nintendo DS version, battle sequences are tuned to use the console's dual screen setup for an easy view of the action, and can be sped up. The DS version also includes a number of changes and additions. Playable, large mobile weapons platforms previously seen as boss units in Front Mission's SNES and PlayStation versions, as well as Front Mission 4, can be unlocked. The player can control Front Mission characters from other installments, such as Darril Traubel and Glen Duval, in a select number of missions. New parts and weapons were added, some from other Front Mission installments, including the Numsekar from Front Mission 5 and the Dragon Hand part, which could previously only be obtained by cheat devices. New secret missions and areas were added, which grant the player bonuses, such as new mobile weapons or wanzers. Difficulty settings and other bonuses can be accessed through repeated playthroughs of either side.Featured Wanzers Oceania Cooperative Union (OCU) United States of the New Continent (USN) Sakata Industries Characters Trivia Front Mission 3  Front Mission 3 is a tactical role-playing game for the PlayStation, created by Square and released in Japan on September 9, 1999, and later in North America on March 22, 2000. It is based on the near-future of the real world, circa 2112. It was the first title in the Front Mission series to be released in North America, courtesy of Square Electronic Arts.Gameplay  The mechanics of\u00a0Front Mission 3\u00a0are a radical departure from\u00a0Front Mission\u00a0and\u00a0Front Mission 2. While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on the role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. New to\u00a0Front Mission 3\u00a0is the Double Feature Scenario \u2013 this allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently of one another within the game's storyline. In other words, the player can play through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games. Front Mission 3\u00a0missions are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets to protecting a certain allied target. Where the game differs significantly from its predecessors lies mainly through a new combat feature \u2013 the ability to attack the pilots themselves. During any attack, the pilot can be damaged or forcefully ejected from their machines. The player can also have a pilot eject from their unit to fight on foot, or hijack another machine on the battlefield. The game also changes how skills are learned; instead of gaining experience to improve a pilot's proficiencies, they are now learned by equipping wanzer parts and using them in battle. When certain conditions are met, there is a random chance that a pilot may learn a new skill from one of their wanzer parts, which can be programmed into the wanzer's battle computer. Many gameplay features from\u00a0Front Mission 2have also been removed, greatly simplifying the overall structure of mission play. Missions are now much smaller in scale, limiting the amount of strategic options the player can use. There are some returning features from\u00a0Front Mission 2\u00a0that are used for mission play though, namely Action Points (AP) and Links. Action Points (AP) is a feature that dictates how much actions can be done with each unit. Actions such as moving and attacking require a certain amount of AP to use. At the end of a full turn, which is one Player Phase and Enemy Phase, a set amount of AP is replenished. A unit's AP amount value depends on how many combat ranks its pilot has earned; these are earned by destroying enemy units. Links is a unique ability that allows multiple units to provide offensive support to each other during Player Phase battles. Links operates differently in\u00a0Front Mission 3; a unit's pilot must have a Link-class skill and the appropriate weapons (which also acts as their linked actions) equipped. Once this condition is met, a linked battle will commence if the skill activates. Up to three units can be linked together to form one \"link\". Other returning features that appear in mission play include mission rankings and mission branching. As in\u00a0Front Mission Alternative, players are graded on how well or poorly they clear missions. While there are incentives to perform well, the game does not reward the player with new parts or weapons as it did in\u00a0Alternative. Mission branching returns and now allow players to choose what type of mission to play next. Aside from these, the Network feature from\u00a0Front Mission 2\u00a0returns and is greatly expanded upon. Players can now browse through the pseudo-Internet, send and receive e-mail messages, tinker with online files and wallpapers, or use the new Battle Simulator feature. The Battle Simulator is a game mode where the player can participate in\u00a0VR\u00a0training exercises. These drills can be used to increase the fighting proficiencies of the player's pilots and can be taken as many times as needed. Lastly, players can strengthen their parts with the return of the remodeling feature. Through this, the player can augment a wanzer's armor coating (known as \"Def-C\"), the accuracy of its weapons, increase its jumping power to scale buildings, or equip it with rollers to dash on flat surfaces quickly.Plot  On October 31, Kazuki begins testing a new prototype wanzer at a Kirishima Heavy Industries test site near\u00a0Okinawa. Upon completing the test, he is informed that some construction wanzers need to be taken to the JDF base in\u00a0Yokosuka. Ryogo asks Kazuki if he can join him in delivering the wanzers. If the player chooses to go with him, they will play the Emma scenario. If the player does not go with him, they will play the Alisa scenario. In either case, Kazuki and Ryogo are eventually tasked to deliver the Kirishima prototypes to the Yokosuka base. As they ready the wanzers for delivery, an explosion leads Kazuki to attempt going inside the base itself. The two test pilots are eventually forced to leave the base. Realizing that his sister Alisa was recently transferred to the base, Kazuki and Ryogo eventually find themselves back inside the complex. The two are then forced to escape the base and their JDF pursuers under different circumstances. In the Emma scenario, Kazuki and Ryogo are aided by Emir Klamsky with help from her USN allies. In the Alisa scenario, DHZ agent Liu Hei Fong saves the two and Alisa from being captured. In either case, Kazuki and Ryogo are framed as the terrorists behind the Yokosuka base attack. Wondering why they are being chased, Emma or Liu tells the two that the JDF stole a top-secret USN weapon called MIDAS from a base in Alaska, and that the explosion came from a failed attempt to reproduce it. The group pursues MIDAS to an OCU base hidden inside\u00a0Taal Volcano\u00a0in the\u00a0Philippines, but the OCU uses it against a DHZ-aided rebel force conducting an amphibious landing in\u00a0Batangas City. With MIDAS apparently gone for good, the group moves to the DHZ where they become involved in the government's battle against the USN-aided Hua Lian Rebels. As the battle escalates, the group encounters the \"Imaginary Numbers\" and \"Real Numbers,\" the results of a genetic engineering program intended to create the perfect human. Developed in\u00a0Ravnui, Bal Gorbovsky, the head of the program, had secretly continued his work with the DHZ government masquerading as the Ravnui Ambassador. However, the Imaginary Numbers turn on Bal and reveal that the MIDAS used in the Philippines was a successful duplicate. Their leader,Lukav Minaev, also reveals that Emir and Alisa were both created by the project, and that two scientists who adopted them as family helped them escape before they were killed. The Imaginary Numbers flee to Japan where they support a coup d'\u00e9tat hatched by Masao Sasaki, an ultra-nationalist JDF chief-of-staff who ordered the Alaska raid. Kazuki's group follows them to Japan, where he is reunited with his estranged father Isao Takemura. They manage to defeat the coup forces, clear their names and pursue the Imaginary Numbers back to Okinawa Ocean City. Although they finally defeat the Imaginary Numbers and safely detonate the original MIDAS out at sea, the game's ending will either be resolved or left ambiguous depending on the scenario chosen.Characters Oceania Cooperative Union United States of a New Continent Republic of Da Han Zong Wanzers Oceania Cooperative Union(OCU) Wanzers Mobile Weapons United States of New Continent(USN) Wanzers Euro Community Wanzers Mobile Weapons Wanzers Mobile Weapons Imaginary Numbers Trivia Front Mission 4  Front Mission 4 is a tactical role playing game developed and published by Square Enix that was released in Japan on December 18, 2003 and in the US on June 15, 2004. It is a tactical role-playing game in which the player assumes the role of two characters, both of whom pilot large mecha known as Wanzers. This is the fourth installment in the Front Mission series, the first to be released on the Sony PlayStation 2 video game console, and the second to be released in North America, the first being Front Mission 3.Gameplay  Front Mission 4\u00a0borrows several of the gameplay mechanics found in\u00a0Front Mission 2. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up their wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. Battle zones are where the missions take place, though they become inaccessible upon the completion of a mission. Like in\u00a0Front Mission 2,\u00a0Front Mission 4 alternates control between the game's two main characters. However, the two scenarios never merge at any point of the game. The missions in FM4 are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets to protecting a certain allied target. There are a number of returning features from\u00a0Front Mission 2\u00a0that are used for mission play, namely Action Points (AP) and Links. Action Points (AP) is a feature that dictates how much actions can be done with each unit. Actions such as moving and attacking require a certain amount of AP to use. At the end of a full turn, which is one Player Phase and Enemy Phase, a set amount of AP is replenished. A unit's AP amount and recharge value depends on how many AP-specific abilities its pilot has learned. Links is a feature that allows multiple units to provide offensive and defensive support to each other during battles. Unlike in\u00a0Front Mission 2\u00a0and\u00a0Front Mission 3, players have greater control over Links. Up to four units can be linked together to form one \"link\"; an offensive link for Player Phase battles, and a defensive link for Enemy Phase battles. Additionally, the player can dictate the degree of support a unit can provide; a linked unit can use battle skills or no battle skills at all. For linked actions, a weapon must be set in order to participate in an offensive or defensive linked battle. Lastly, two special actions can also be set as linked actions: Antilock and Salvage from EMP and radio backpacks, respectively. Antilock causes missiles within range to miss, while Salvage restores any wanzers destroyed in battle. Returning features aside,\u00a0Front Mission 4\u00a0has a number of new gameplay mechanics. Weapons are now capable of attacking more than once during any battle, provided that the unit initiating the attack has sufficient AP and weapon ammunition. The time of day affects a weapon's chances of hitting its target; for example, accuracy is lowered during night time. Weather conditions affect the effective range of weapons; for example, a blizzard will reduce a machine gun's maximum firing range by one square. Like in\u00a0Front Mission Alternative, there are new auxiliary backpacks that offer unique features when used on the battlefield. In addition to the item, turbo, and repair backpacks, players can now use jetpacks, sensor backpacks, EMP backpacks, and radio backpacks. Sensor backpacks are equipped with sonar and radar sensors that extend the firing range of missile launchers. EMP backpacks are armed with\u00a0electromagnetic pulse\u00a0(EMP) waves that disable various functions on its target. Jetpacks have built-in verniers that allow a wanzer to scale buildings and directly bypass obstacles such as water. Radio backpacks have communications equipment that allows a wanzer to act as a forward air controller by signaling a transport to drop supplies, armor coating, or call in an air strike. Aside from these new additions, turbo backpacks now come with a small amount of item space and repair backpacks can remove EMP-inflicted status damage.Plot Setting and story  See also: List of Front Mission 4 characters Front Mission 4 has two major scenarios that run parallel to each other, set in the year 2096. One scenario takes place in the European Community (EC) and the other scenario takes place in the Unified Continental States (UCS). UCS is the North American translation for the United States of the New Continent (USN), though the reasons for the change are unknown. In the North American translation for Front Mission 3, USN is left unchanged. A large portion of the between-mission dialogue is delivered through voice overs in English (for all regional versions of the game), which is a first for the series. At the beginning of the game, the player assumes the role of Elsa Eliane, a new recruit for the EC Armored Tactics Research Corps, the \"Durandal\". The Durandal's initial assignment is to investigate a series of recent attacks on EC German military bases by unknown forces. After completing several missions with the Durandal and learning more about the causes of the attacks, the narrative shifts focus to the other scenario. The second scenario starts off in UCS Venezuela (which has attempted to secede from the UCS) and centers around UCS Army Sgt Darril Traubel and his teammates Billy Renges and Phillip Chaeffer. The three witness the crash of a Venezuelan State Army (VSA) transport plane that turns out to be carrying gold bullion worth up to $25 million belonging to Venezuelan Governor Bruno Diaz. They decide to steal the gold and go AWOL, but it is not long before they are found out by the VSA and have to escape Venezuela. After a few more missions detailing their attempts to escape, the narrative returns focus to Elsa and the Durandal. For the rest of the game, the narrative continues to shift back and forth between the two scenarios after a certain amount of missions are completed. Eventually, a plot connection is established between the scenarios, though they remain independent of one another for the entire game. Eventually, the Republic of Zaftra is discovered to be source of their issues. Front Mission 4 expands on the unresolved plot elements regarding Zaftra that were revealed at the end of Front Mission 1st, detailing the real reasons behind Zaftra's involvement in both installments. Two characters from the first game also make appearances in Front Mission 4: Frederick Lancaster from the OCU side and Maria Paredes from the UCS side. Several minor loose ends are resolved in Front Mission 5: Scars of the War, though all of the major plot elements are resolved in Front Mission 4.Characters The Durandal Blauer Nebel EC England British Army Polish Ground Armed Force The U.C.S. Army 332nd Mobile Squadron Alianza de Libertad Venezolana USN Venezuela Zaftran Army Others Featured Vehicles Combat Vehicles Aircrafts Naval Crafts Featured Wanzers Wanzers Monster Kehei  The Kehei (Chinese: \u514b\u9ed1, lit. \"Ominous Black\") is a wanzer model that first appeared in Front Mission 3 and later in Front Mission Evolved. The model is produced by Shanghai Steel of the DHZ and is its most profitable product, directly competing with OCU Zenith or the USN Frost in terms of popularity and usage.History  Before the introduction of the MULS-P2 standard, the Kehei was classified as an \"Advanced Wanzer\". Boasting above average offensive capabilities, prototypes of it were seen on the battlefield during a Japanese coup d'etat in 2112. Despite their impressive combat potential, the early Kehei models were high-powered machines with complete disregard to mass-productivity. Shanghai Steel's design philosophy with its flagship wanzer line wavered greatly during the Kehei's early stages. By 2171 however, the company managed to strike a good balance between cost and performance, making them more effective in combat. When the MULS-P2 standard was formed, militaries around the world, particularly the OCU, began importing Kehei models.Overview  As mentioned earlier, Kehei prototypes were seen in Front Mission 3 as advanced, high-powered wanzers with a larger size and better performance than average wanzers. It has two known variants: Both variants can also use its fist to strike close-range targets. By Front Mission Evolved, Shanghai Steel created a few specialized Kehei models that were used by the Changli Army and Rapid Reaction Force. For example, the Kehei 35 used by Yun Tae Hwan is a lightweight, high mobility model that emphasizes fast strike capabilities. The laser cannons mounted on the back of the original Kehei 0 earlier were reported to be still in use for sniper-type Kehei models, but it is not seen in the game. All in all, the Kehei model is very versatile, and thus can be deployed as various roles, ranging from close range combat to long range support.Statistics Body Arms Legs Body Arms Legs Trivia Calm  The Calm is a wanzer model that has long been a part of the Front Mission series. It appeared in Front Mission First, Front Mission 2, Front Mission 4, Front Mission Online and Front Mission Evolved. It is produced by the Diable Avionics of U.S.N. America.Overview  Although its appearance is far from intimidating, this war machine is strong in melee combat as well as long-range firefights when equipped with the appropriate weapons. Calm and its variants are characterized by above-average to high output and otherwise versatile capacities. Calm were seen being used by both O.C.U. and U.S.N. armies in the Huffman Island. It was also seen being deployed by the Venezuelan State Army (V.S.A.) and Venezuelan Liberation Front, the guerrillas in U.S.N. Venezuela. Presumably due to its versatility, it was deployed widely in various roles, including melee fighters and assaults. It also has a branch series named Vortex that is seen in Front Mission Online.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Raven  The Raven is a wanzer model that appeared in Front Mission 2089-II, Front Mission First, Front Mission Online, and Front Mission 2. It is one of the most recognizable wanzer models in the series, and arguably the most well-known for an enemy-based wanzer. The model was co-produced by Sakata Industries and Demitri Corp., and its design was conceived by engineer G. Lycov from Front Mission 2089. Although it is designated as the \"Type 11\" or \"Type 11 DS\", it is commonly referred by its codename \"Raven\".History and Overview  As one of the earliest-known \"Advanced Wanzer\" types, the Raven was not designed to be compatible with MULS-P WAP models in mind. Being 40% bigger than the standard wanzer, it was one of the most dangerous wanzers encountered during the Second Huffman Conflict. Possessing incredible firepower, defenses, and mobility, the Raven was an instrumental factor in the U.S.N. Army's victories during the war. The wanzer's true purpose, however, lied in its role as a prototype Bioneural Device (BD) use machine. Although the BD technology equipped on the wanzer was not fully completed, it allowed the Raven to effortlessly handle swarms of enemy forces almost single-handedly. It was also one of the very first wanzer models to incorporate nanotechnology-based armor, significantly decreasing its overall weight and thereby greatly increasing its mobility. Only four Raven models, excluding the prototype, were produced: one which is piloted by U.S.N. captain Driscoll (his version has a DS designation, for Driscoll's System), and another piloted by U.S.N. Black Hounds commander Gail. Two other Ravens were seen being piloted by two unnamed subordinates of Gail in the Black Hounds. The prototype version was completed and seen in Front Mission 2089-II, being piloted by X-06 \"Raven\" of the Vampires mercenary outfit. The Type 11 prototype uses the Puppet Soldier BD, the Ravens piloted by Gail and the Black Hounds utilize the Brain Type (B-Type) BD, and Driscoll's own version makes use of both the B-Type and the Sensory Type (S-Type) BDs. Although all Raven wanzers were destroyed by the end of the 2nd Huffman Conflict, one final model was recreated from the remains of the destroyed Ravens during the Santa Barbara attack in Front Mission First. G. Lycov, who had been captured by U.S.N. authorities, was forced to develop a stronger version of the advanced wanzer. Upon completing the new Raven, he escaped his captors and sought assistance from the O.C.U. Later, he delivers the newly completed Raven to Lisa Stanley of the O.C.U. Ground Defense Force Intelligence Agency (GDFIA) during the Alordesh coup d'etat in 2102. While this Raven was not designed for Bioneural Device usage, it possessed a special computer part which functioned similarly to the B-Type BD.Statistics Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Giza  The Giza is a wanzer model that appeared in all main series installments except Front Mission 3. It was also featured in Front Mission Online and Front Mission Evolved. Similar to Frost, it is one of the most iconic wanzer model in the series. It is produced by the Leonora Enterprise of O.C.U. Australia.Overview  It was often seen equipped with shoulder weapons and repair backpacks. These is probably due to the fact that the Giza wanzer and its variants are characterized by very high output, rendering it capable of being equipped with shoulder weapons or repair backpacks, the two heaviest classes equipment known in the series. However, unlike most high-output models, Giza also has decent mobility and armour. This means that it is capable of supporting frontline allies, who, due to their position, are the ones who are most likely to need emergency repair. Giza seems to be widely employed by many military units, since the wanzer model was seen in Front Mission First to be used by both the O.C.U. and U.C.S. in the Huffman Island. In later installment, it was also seen to be under control of pilots from many parts of the world. The Giza has a branch series named Bes, as seen in Front Mission 5: Scar of War.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Recson  The Recson (also known as the Rexon) is a wanzer model that debut in Front Mission 3, and later has appeared in all installments so far. It is produced by the Diable Avionics of U.S.N. America.Overview  Recson and its variants are consistently characterized by a typical sniper's stats distribution: outstanding accuracy and below-average armour and mobility. Therefore, it has always been seen as sniper units, typically equipped with rifles or bazookas. So far, they has been seen heavily employed by U.S.N. military. U.S.N. troops are typically seen with Recson units or its variants. However, there has not yet been military other than the U.S.N. who are known to deploy Recson wanzers. They were also seen being deployed by the Hua Lian Rebel of the D.H.Z., presumably because of the support the U.S.N. is giving to the rebel. Numerous named (but minor) members of the Rebel also piloted Recson wanzers. In Front Mission 5, many pilots in the arena were seen equipping Recson arms on their wanzers while using body and legs of other models, probably suggesting that many military units also use Recson arms for the sake of accuracy. It also has a branch series named Recsys.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Grapple  The Grapple is a wanzer model that debut in Front Mission 3, and then was later featured in Front Mission 5: Scar Of War and Front Mission Evolved. It is produced by the Diable Avionics of U.S.N. America.Overview  Since its debut, Grapple has always been seen being deployed as melee units, presumably due to its extremely strong armour and, in contrast to its bulky appearance, decent mobility. These abilities suggest that it is primarily a heavy assault and melee-type wanzer. It seems to be primarily used by the U.S.N. Armies, as evidenced in its appearance in the game. Also, the Hua Lian Rebel was also seen employing the Grapple as melee units, probably due to the fact that the U.S.N. supported the rebel.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Gepard  The Gepard (German: Gepard, Cheetah) is a wanzer model has only appeared in Front Mission 4. An \"Advanced Wanzer\" type, it was created by arms manufacturer Schnecke of E.C. Germany.History  Believed to have been influenced by other advanced wanzers, the Gepard was designed to be the successor model to the Igel and Grille lines. In an attempt to rectify the poor armoring of the said wanzer lines and create a powerful offensive model, Schnecke began production of the Gepard line. Through the addition of extra armor plates and reinforced joint armor, it was said to be 25% larger and heavier than the Igel and Grille models. Unlike the long-range specialized Igel and Grille lines, the Gepard series was primarily designed as an assault-type wanzer. It was also designed to carry heavy weapons, such as the machine gun version of the company's Ziege sniper rifle. Despite finding success in developing the Gepard, Schnecke used custom-made parts to develop the machine and thus, mass-production would have been too costly. In an attempt to bring it to mass-production, the arms manufacturer develops several more prototypes along the way. As of Front Mission 4, nine prototype models were developed with the last two being seen in the game: the Gepard Acht and the Gepard Neun. Both of these wanzers were piloted by Rolf Wagner of the German Blauer Nebel special forces. The Gepard Acht was designed with ranged combat in mind, whereas the Gepard Neun was capable of both melee and ranged combat. The final prototype had its left arm part changed to one with claw-shaped hand manipulators, and was equipped with a small machine gun compartment for defense.Overview  The Gepard series is marked by very high armour and output (thus enabling it to carry heavy weapons). However, its evasive ability is below-average for an assault-type wanzer. Still, it proves to be a deadly weapon in combat. In the game, it was seen to be equipped with heavy machineguns. Not only does it has strong offensive power, but its high armour also enables it to take a large amount of damage before going down. More specifically, it can take at least twice the amount of damage ordinary wanzers can withstand.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Igel  The Igel (German: Igel, Hedgehog) is a series of wanzer models that apparently has become a part of the Front Mission series since its debut in Front Mission 2. Afterward, it has appeared in every installments to date. It is produced by the Schnecke Corp. of E.C. Germany. Among Front Mission fans, it is more commonly known through its successor line, the \"Grille\" (German: Grille, Cricket).Overview  Igel and Grille models are largely deployed as sniper units. Due to its precision-based actuator design and responsiveness of the recoil stabilizers in their arm parts, both lines boast very high accuracy ratings when using virtually any kind of ranged weapon. As a result, numerous armed forces and organizations have imported dozens of Igel and Grille models, despite a noted lack of armoring and mobility in their designs. The Igel line and its derivatives are considered the flagship line of Schnecke Corp., with it being commercially successful for more than two decades since its inception in the 2080s. The popularity of the Igel Eins and Igel Zwei models led to the creation of derivative units, equipped with shotgun weapon arm parts and caterpillar-type legs. These derivatives, while not as popular as the standard bipedal model, saw uses in developing O.C.U. member-states such as Alordesh. The tank-based Igel Eins and Igel Zwei sacrificed long-range combat abilities in exchange for better short-range combat and improved defensive capabilities. The Igel and Grille lines boasts several variants with a Horn designation (noted as \"H\" in the unit's naming). The Horn variants are advanced models with slight internal and external changes to provide better overall combat performance than the standard ones, enabling them to fulfill more than just sniper roles. The \"H\" units are also commonly used by military commanders in the German Special Forces, the Blauer Nebel. During the introduction of the MULS-P2 standard, the company built a new Grille model which used the Gepard prototypes as a base. The new MULS-P2 model boasted significant improvements in durability and mobility, allowing it to function as assault roles more easily than before.Models The Igels The Grilles Wanzer Data Overall  Statistics Chart (At maximum upgrade level.)Body  Body Statistic Progression ChartArms  Arms Statistic Progression ChartDeployments Known Pilots Gallery  Add a photo to this galleryTrivias Oceania Cooperative Union  The Oceania Cooperative Union, often shortened to OCU, is a supernation that consists of Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, a number of countries in Southeast Asia, and some Pacific islands. The headquarters of the supernation is in OCU Australia. The bloc, which was created in 2019 out of another ASEAN-type organization called the Bangkok Economic Alliance, also has partial control of Huffman Island, which it shares with the USN. This island in the Pacific Ocean holds much significance in terms of natural resources, which has led to two major wars with the USN. Although regarded as an equal to the USN in many aspects, the OCU suffers from civil strife. Cambodia and Laos were the first to rebel with the creation of an independence alliance as depicted in Front Mission 5. The People's Republic of Alordesh (formerly known as Bangladesh) was the next member to revolt, which is expanded upon in Front Mission 2. The OCU has been struggling to maintain unity since the events of the coup in Alordesh, the rebellions in Cambodia, and numerous civil disputes in other member-nations such as OCU Philippines. The OCU nearly broke up during an attempted coup in Japan, but this was stopped when news broke that the Okinawa Ocean City was invaded by the DHZ military in Front Mission 3.Known Wanzers Manufactured Trivia  The Oceania Cooperative Union is known as the Oceana Community Union in the english release of Front Mission 3.Enyo  The Enyo (Japanese: \u708e\u967d, Blazing Sun) is a wanzer model that debut in Front Mission 3, and later appeared in Front Mission 5: Scar of War and Front Mission Evolved. It is produced by the Kirishima Heavy Industry of O.C.U. Japan.Overview  Most of the time, Enyo and its variants have very high output, but weak armour and mobility. It is fragile, but proves to be valuable in long-range battles, reflected by the fact that it had been widely deployed as launcher units. However, such high level of specialization means that it is not very versatile. Thus, it is rarely seen playing any role other than being used in providing long-range support fire. Enyo and its variants were employed extensively by the Japanese Defense Force (J.D.F.), mostly equipped with shoulder weapons. It was also seen being used by the O.C.U. army in Huffman Islands and Cambodian troops, as depicted in Front Mission 5.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Gust  The Gust is a wanzer model that has long been a part of the Front Mission series. It appeared in all main series installments except Front Mission 3. It was also featured in Front Mission Online. It is produced by the Diable Avionics of U.S.N. America.Overview  Gust and its variants have been characterized by its strong armour and mobility, but rather mediocre output. These suggests that it would make good assault wanzers. Its two arms can be internally equipped with machineguns. However, in later appearance, it is seen with standard arms. If these are variants of the same model or not is not explicitly stated. Gust seems to have proven itself to be competent assault units, and is widely deployed by the U.S.N. Army, as they were seen being piloted by U.S.N. assaults in Huffman Island. Gust and its variants were also seen being deployed by U.S.N. army when it attempt to regain control of Venezuela and when it invaded the Madeira Island. However, they were not exclusive to the U.S.N. since the Revolutionary Army in Alordesh were also seen employing Gust wanzers. The Gust wanzer model has two branches series, namely the Vapor and the Storm.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Uisk  The Uisk is a wanzer model that appears in Front Mission 3, Front Mission 4, Front Mission 5: Scars of War , Front Mission Online and Front Mission Evolved. The Zelt variant of the Uisk also appears in the Nintendo DS version of the first Front Mission. It is produced by the Sender Corp. of E.C. England.Overview  In most of its appearance, Uisk and its variants are characterized by high output and mediocre armour. However, its stats are not very consistent in different installments. In Front Mission 3, it was employed as launcher units by the Centipede Mercenary. Later in Front Mission 4, its output was further raised and became a Comms wanzer model. In Front Mission 5, however, its output was lowered and its agility became higher, making it a suitable candidate for Jammers. It was seen deployed by U.S.N. Army as Jammer units. They may be variants of the same model, but this was not explicitly stated. It has a branch series known as Zelt.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia Vyzov  The Vyzov (Russian: \u0412\u044b\u0437\u043e\u0432, Challenge) is a wanzer model produced by Demitri Corp. of the Republic of Zaftra. It has appeared in Front Mission 4, Front Mission Online, Front Mission 5: Scar of War and Front Mission Evolved. They served mainly as sniper wanzers, typically equipped with rifles or bazookas.Overview  Like all sniper wanzers, Vyzov has high accuracy, but it also has a higher degree of evasion, mobility, and stronger armour compared to most other sniper models. They were widely used by the Zaftran Army during the attacks on German and U.S.N. troops, as shown in Front Mission 4.Deployments Models Known Pilots Trivia United States of the New Continent  The United States of the New Continent, often shortened to USN (known as the Unified Continental States or UCS in some English versions), is a supernation formed in 2020 in response to the formation of the Oceania Cooperative Union. The headquarters of the supernation is in USN North America. The USN is often at an uneasy standstill against the OCU with regards to the Pacific region and particularly on Huffman Island. There is a large disparity in quality of life throughout the USN, which has led to disaffection and open rebellion in several member-states. Most of the rebellions occur in South America, such as in USN Venezuela.Known Wanzers Manufactured Trivia ", "Breeding Season Wikia": "Breeding Season Wikia ", "Cookie Clicker Wiki": "Cookie Clicker Wiki ", "Communaut\u00e9 Cookie Clicker": "Communaut\u00e9 Cookie Clicker ", "Wizardess Heart Wikia": "Wizardess Heart Wikia ", "Animal Crossing Enciclopedia": "Animal Crossing Enciclopedia Animal Crossing Wiki Animal Crossing: Wild World Characters Animal Crossing: City Folk Characters Hair Style Guide  In Wild World, City Folk and New Leaf, the player can change their character's hairstyle by visiting Harriet at Shampoodle.

It is a life simulation game where the player lives with animals, same as the other games (ex. spin-offs). It was released in North America, Japan, Europe, and Australia on November 16, 2008, November 20, 2008, December 5, 2008, and December 4, 2008, respectively. The title boasts a variety of changes and additions to the Animal Crossing formula, including the ability to travel to the City.New Features  City Folk takes advantage of the WiiConnect24 functionality of the Wii console. It also uses a new feature called Wii Speak, which allows players to talk to each other when visiting each other's towns. There are now 64 insects and fish which is an increase of 8 since Wild World, which had 56 insects and fish.The City & New Attractions  This incarnation of the Animal Crossing series features a newly accessible location called the City. The City houses most of the characters that, in previous games, were considered special visitors. These include Gracie the Giraffe and Redd the Fox, among other characters such as Dr. Shrunk and Lyle. This area of the game is available via Kapp'n's bus, and is open all hours of the day. Most of the shops close at 9 PM daily, with the exception of Redd's Store and The Resetti Surveillance Center. The City Plaza also features new characters Phineas the sea lion and Kicks the skunk. Lyle now works in the Happy Room Academy and Shrunk now works at the Marquee next door. The player can now find Gracie in her store, GracieGrace, who is managed by the new character Labelle. The game also features more Holidays, such as; Halloween, Harvest Festival, Christmas, Festivale and many others.Moving  When moving in, the player has two options; to start fresh or to move in as their DS character. Moving in as their character will only keep the Wild World character's catalog and appearance. However, not all items transfer from a Wild World save, such as the Royal Crown. No items, Bells or house size will be ported with the character. If the player has an illegal game storage device, such as an R4 card or a TTDS, the moving function will not work.Wi-Fi  This version of the Animal Crossing series features Wi-Fi capabilities, which was earlier implemented in the previous game, Wild World. This feature gives the player access to other towns, enables them to communicate with friends' towns with letters, and also subjects them to special furniture items sent from time to time from Nintendo, such as Nintendogs statues and the Red Pikmin Hat, which reference some of the company's best-selling franchises. It also allows players to experience another feature, which in-game is the Mysterious Cat. This enables a visit from Blanca, a character who travels via Wi-Fi into towns, which promotes connectivity between players locally and globally. It has no compatibility with its 3DS counterpart.\u00a0On May 20th, 2014,\u00a0Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection\u00a0on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii was discontinued. This terminated the Wi-Fi capability of City Folk.Development and unveiling  The conception of City Folk began during the production of Wild World and was confirmed that an Animal Crossing title for the Wii, then codenamed Revolution, was in development. Katsuya Eguchi, the producer of both titles, suggested that the two titles may be able to link up to one another at e3 2005. In 2006, Eguchi confirmed that City Folk was still just a concept and very little work had been completed. His time was being consumed by research and development of the Wii console. The Animal Crossing team explored ways to involve the Wii Remote. They planned to allow players to use tools, such as the axe, shovel, and fishing rod. They also explored the use of WiiConnect24 in the hopes that a player could visit a friend's town even when they were not playing. The friend could then leave letters or gifts. Additionally, they planned to use Wi-Fi Connection to allow simultaneous play. At this point in time, however, the title was still not playable. In early 2007, Nintendo of Japan unveiled its video game lineup for the coming year. It included \"Doubutsu no Mori\" (\"Animal Forest\"). Having finished the Mii Channel for Wii, Wild World director Hisashi Nogami joined the Animal Crossing team. Later that year, Edge Magazine reported that a trusted source confirmed that City Folk would be a massively multiplayer online game. The publication declined to name the source. Nintendo failed to release the title in 2007. Online publication IGN predicted that the title would arrive in 2008. At E3 2008, Reggie Fils-Aime unveiled the title in playable form under the name City Folk. It was released in November 2008.People who owns shops in the city Harriet the Poodle (Shampoodle)  Harriet was first introduced in the previous Animal Crossing game which was called Wild World. She appeared in Nookington's by the stairs and she was moved to the right hand side of the city. Her store is Shampoodle.Kicks  Kicks was a new character in City Folk, he owned a business of shining shoes. You can see him in between Lloyd's store and Shampoodle.Redd's shop  Redd's shop is a corner shop in the city. It has a metal door and it's found near the west side of the city, next to the Marque. The shop sells art such as paintings and statues. These can be later donated to the Museum but you have to make sure they aren't fake.Release and reception  Initial editorial previews of the title from IGN and GameSpy indicate that, as with the title's predecessor, Wild World, Nintendo has made very few changes to the title and that some Animal Crossing players, who have played all of the past Animal Crossing games, might not find as much in City Folk, than other Animal Crossing games, although, the game is still fun and might appeal to newcomers. IGN gave City Folk a 7.5/10 rating. E3 2008: Animal Crossing: City Folk Hands-on. GameSpot gave a positive preview of the title, noting the charm of the game, but gave the game a 7.5/10 rating. The game's MSRP was $49.99 on release, but was later dropped to $19.99. Some copies of City Folk include Nintendo's Wii Speak. These copies of City Folk were sold for $69.99, but was later dropped to $34.99-$49.99.Villagers  For a list of villagers in\u00a0Animal Crossing: New Leaf, click here.Fish  Fish are a number of collectable items in the Animal Crossing series. Players can catch them with a fishing rod. They can be donated to the museum to fill up the aquarium, sold to Tom Nook/Reese, or placed in the player's home inside a Fish Tank, like a piece of furniture. However, only small fish tanks will be able to placed on top of furniture (e.g. A Table). Larger fish tanks must be put onto the floor. A large amount of fish will only emerge during the summer, a few unique species will emerge in autumn and spring, and there are almost none during the winter. Some villagers in City Folk will ask the player to try and catch a certain fish, and, upon doing so, they will give an item to the player, which could be anything from an article of clothing to a piece of furniture. For further information, see Fishing.Fish Sizes  In the series there are six different sizes of fish. Each fish is limited to its own shadow size. Sharks and sunfish are unlike other fish in that they show a fin in their shadow. In New Leaf, there are now various catch sizes of each fish that can be kept track of and recorded into an encyclopedia. Every time the player catches a fish that is bigger than the original record, it will be overwritten. However the shadow size for each type remains the same, no matter how big or small the resulting catch size is.List of fish Animal Forest  In Animal Forest, there are 32 species of fish obtainable. The coelacanth is the only fish that can be caught in the ocean.Animal Crossing  In Animal Crossing, there are 40 species of fish obtainable.The herabuna from Animal Forest and Animal Forest+ has been replaced with the brook trout. The crawfish, frog, killifish, jellyfish, sea bass, red snapper, barred knifejaw, and arapaima were added.Animal Forest e+  In the Japanese-only game, Animal Forest e+, an extra 8 species occur, making 48 species of fish obtainable. The new species include the horse mackerel, puffer fish, dab, olive flounder, squid, octopus, seahorse, and swordfish (Called blue marlin in later games).Wild World  In Wild World, a total of 56 fish are obtainable. Dropped fish include the herabuna, brook trout, giant catfish, small bass, and large bass. New fish include the yellow perch, king salmon, dorado, gar, sea butterfly, clownfish, zebra turkeyfish, football fish, tuna, ocean sunfish, hammerhead shark, and shark. No Animal Forest e+ endemics were dropped. In Wild World, 35 fish are freshwater and 21 are saltwater.City Folk  In City Folk, a total of 64 fish are obtainable. No fish were dropped. New fish include the pike, neon tetra, surgeonfish, butterfly fish, napoleonfish, lobster (fish), moray eel, and ray. The placement of fish in this game is evened out. In City Folk, 37 fish are freshwater and 27 are saltwater.New Leaf  In New Leaf, a total of 72 fish are obtainable. Dropped fish include the jellyfish, while the octopus (fish) and lobster (fish) became Deep-sea creatures. New species include the soft-shelled turtle, tadpole, mitten crab, nibble fish, saddled bichir, blowfish, ribbon eel, giant trevally, saw shark, whale shark, and oarfish. The game features 41 freshwater fish and 31 saltwater fish.Animal Crossing: Wild World  Animal Crossing: Wild World, known in Japan as Animal Forest: Come on Over (\u304a\u3044\u3067\u3088\u3000\u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u68ee Oideyo D\u014dbutsu no Mori?) is a life simulation game for the Nintendo DS, set in a town where the player is a person who lives among animals. It is a follow-up to the 2002 hit Animal Crossing for the Nintendo GameCube and the Japan-only Animal Forest, Animal Forest+, and Animal Forest e+. This is also the first South Korean release, known as Animal Forest: Come in to Play  (\ub180\ub7ec\uc624\uc138\uc694 \ub3d9\ubb3c\uc758\uc232, Nolla Oseyo Dongmul-ui Soup) in South Korea. It was also unofficially translated into Mandarin Chinese as Welcome to the Animal Forest (\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u52a8\u7269\u4e4b\u68ee, Hu\u0101ny\u00edng l\u00e1i d\u00e0o d\u00f2ngw\u00f9 zh\u012b s\u0113n). During development, the working title was 'Animal Crossing DS'. The important features of the first Animal Crossing series game return in this one, but with improvements and many changes. Activities in town include buying and selling items, fishing, and several others, especially becoming friends with the villagers. The game occurs in real time, with the real calendar, and time progresses even when the game is turned off.Online play  Wild World is the second Nintendo title that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the first being Mario Kart DS. This lets players use wireless access points to connect to the Internet and visit other players' towns. As of May 20th, 2014,\u00a0Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection\u00a0on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii has been discontinued. This terminated Animal Crossing: Wild World's Wi-Fi capability. The local multiplayer will still work because it does not use Wi-Fi. However, some homebrew developers have created their own custom servers allowing Wild World to be played online again.Release  Wild World was released in Japan on November 23, 2005. It was released in North America on December 5, 2005, in time for Christmas. Version 1.1 of Wild World for Japan and North America was created on February 10, 2006.Players in Europe had to wait until March 31, 2006 for the European release. It was rereleased in Japan with copies of Animal Forest. On October 13, 2016, Wild World was made available on the Wii U Virtual Console service in North America. Online and multiplayer features are not available, although the requirement for a friend to visit to upgrade to Nookington's was dropped. The game had already been available on Wii U for some time in Europe and Japan.Gameplay  Following in the footsteps of the popular GameCube original, the player starts out as a human in a town with no money. The player mortgages a small house from the local shopkeeper, the Tanuki (or raccoon in the English version) Tom Nook. Paying off a loan results in a larger house. Unlike the original Animal Crossing, where each player lives in one of four houses in a single estate, all players live together in one house. Many players will want a bigger house, because decorating their house in their way, with furniture and other items, is one of the main features of the game. The player can collect fruit, fish, insects, paintings, fossils, furniture, and other items. There are over 550 different pieces of furniture. Once the player has some furniture, taking it to their house is easy; the furniture becomes a leaf that fits in their pocket. They can also customize themselves by buying clothes, accessories, hats, or drawing patterns. Outside the house, the player can befriend the animal neighbors; the animals are much more interactive in this game than they were in the GameCube game. Villagers can still ask the player to do errands for them, but there is no longer an explicit menu item to request them, and they no longer require the player to find a missing item from a long chain of animals. Animals can also give the player their picture of themselves, with a unique quote on the back that is the player's to keep, even after they move away. The player can also customize their town by planting trees and growing flowers. At the museum, the player can donate certain items to the collections. At the tailor's, the player can buy clothes or draw their own patterns. This way, the player can customize their town. Furthermore, if animals are not enough, the player can invite up to three human friends to their town using the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection or DS to DS.New additions Changes Gallery Problems  On January 26, 2006, an accident occurred relating to the Wi-Fi features. A few weeks prior, Nintendo sent out a free Mario Coin item from Satoru Iwata to all who connected to Wi-Fi while it was available. On the same day, a failed attempt to send a second exclusive item sent a blank letter to all who connected to Nintendo Wi-Fi before 5:00 PM. This letter contained the \"glitched red tulip\" item. This item could be planted in cement as a tree or, if put into the player's house, would create an invisible, irremovable wall. The item could be disposed of by planting it in the ground or selling it. On February 13, 2006, Nintendo sent out a letter containing 10,000 Bells and an amusing town bulletin board notice to apologize for the mistake. Here is a video of the glitched barrier.Trivia References K.K. Slider  K.K. Slider (\u3068\u305f\u3051\u3051, Totakeke?), commonly known as K.K., or DJ K.K. is a dog who appears in all of the Animal Crossing series games to date. He works as a musician, playing songs on his guitar. In Animal Crossing, he could be found near the train station; Wild World and City Folk had him playing in The Roost caf\u00e9; whereas New Leaf saw him move to working in Club LOL. His birthday was revealed in Animal Crossing Plaza. Like other special characters that appear in the Animal Crossing series, he does not celebrate it. K.K. Slider plays a total of 55 songs in Animal Crossing, 70 songs in Wild World, 75 in City Folk, and 91 in New Leaf. A full list of his songs can be found here.Personality  K.K. Slider is a hippie-style traveling musician, which is reflected in his mellow speech towards the player. He comes across as someone who wants to be liberated, as shown by his rebellion against putting a price on his songs. This adds to the musician stereotype of going against a particular norm. Despite that, his songs are for sale in New Leaf for 3,200 (3,600 with the bell boom ordinance) bells when Timmy and Tommy upgraded to T.I.Y. K.K. has an obvious passion for performing for others, as he offers to play for people on a weekly basis. In Wild World, he seems to know Brewster fairly well.Appearances In Animal Forest and Animal Crossing  In Animal Forest and Animal Crossing, K.K. Slider is seen sitting on the stool close to the Train Station found from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM on Saturday. He still has the same role, to request or ask a song or for him to choose. He is also seen when the games are started and booted up.In Wild World  In Wild World, K.K. now plays his music at The Roost on Saturday evenings, from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM. The player may request a song, otherwise K.K. will sing a randomly selected song. After the performance, the player receives a free copy of the song that was played. The copy of the song can then be deposited and used in any stereo in the player's house. He is also involved in the Golden Axe Trading Event, where he trades the player his picture when given the country guitar (which is received from Wendell).In City Folk  K.K. has a similar role in City Folk as he does in previous games. Now, he gives encores of his music. However, the encores are not added to the dock of the player. As in Wild World, he is seen in The Roost on Saturday nights, from 8:00 PM. to midnight. If the player decides to request a song, they are required to type it in. The player can also choose a song by mood or let him pick a random song. The game credits play while he plays a song.In New Leaf  In New Leaf, K.K. appears on stage on Saturday nights after 8:00 pm inside Club LOL, owned by Dr. Shrunk. From Sunday to Friday, he takes on the guise of DJ K.K., performing a variety of different songs based on themes. On the first performance as K.K. Slider, he will randomly pick one of the new songs introduced in New Leaf. Afterwards, the player is allowed to request a song by specific title or mood. Players will get the first song he plays, but not the rest, unless they do not have enough space in their pockets, in which case the player will receive a song as soon as they have made space in their pockets and requested another song. And on your birthday or the Saturday before your birthday, if you request K.K. Birthday, K.K. Slider will play it for you. If you request K.K. Birthday any other time, he will not play it for you. The credits play as he plays a song His songs now come with unique album covers. These album covers now make it possible to hang copies of his songs on the walls. K.K. Slider's Pic is obtainable. If the player listens to a K.K. show for 20 weeks consecutively, the picture is received in the mail.In D\u014dbutsu no Mori (film)  K.K. Slider has a minor role in D\u014dbutsu no Mori. Margie requests that he should play K.K. Bossa.Cameo In Super Smash Bros. Melee  K.K. Slider makes a cameo in Super Smash Bros. Melee appearing as a trophy as well as being one of the special characters and appearing in a screenshot in the stages.Trophy Information  \"A wandering musician whose daily life is a bit of a mystery. He plays in front of the train station every Saturday night starting at 8:00 PM. He has a large repertoire and plays old and new hits from all over the world. His music is so ingrained in the villagers that it's impossible to imagine them living without it.\"In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  K.K. Slider makes again a cameo in Super Smash Bros. Brawl appearing as a trophy as well as being one of the special characters and appearing in a screenshot in the stages.Trophy Information  \"A wandering musician. He plays concerts every Saturday night at the Roost in the basement of the museum. All he carries is a single acoustic guitar, but he can play music from all genres. You can request a single tune per concert, and afterward he will give you a recording of the song to take home. In Wild World, his playlist included 70 songs.\"In Mario Kart 8  K.K., along with other characters, appears in Mario Kart 8 in the Animal Crossing race course of the Crossing Cup, included with the Animal Crossing \u00d7 Mario Kart 8 downloadable content package. He sits in different predetermined spots on the course depending on the season; in addition, he performs a song when the player drives close to him, each corresponding with a specific mood: He also appears in the Switch version of the game, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, this time included in the base game instead of with paid DLC.Trivia Tom Nook's store  Tom Nook's store is the economic centerpiece of every player's town (with the exception of Re-Tail in New Leaf). The store is owned and operated by Tom Nook, the most important non-playable character in the series. In Wild World, Tom Nook stocks items based in Groups (A, B or C). The player's town is designated a group, and items from that group are more likely to stock in the store. Items from other groups will stock as well, but less frequently. The only way to find out what group the player's town has been designated is for them to keep a tally of the number of items from each group. Item Groups do not exist in Animal Crossing or City Folk, items are available based on individual towns. When the shop is about to upgrade, a message will be posted on the News Bulletin telling that on the next day, the shop will be closed for remodeling. Nook also sends the players a letter informing them that his shop will be closed that day.History In Animal Crossing  Tom Nook's store made its first appearance outside of Japan in the Nintendo Gamecube Animal Crossing, as did many of the items sold at his store. The store was randomly located on the map of each town, but, like the Post Office, could only be found in the 'A' acres. The store offered furniture, clothing, tools, flowers, tree saplings, carpet, wallpaper, paint, and sign boards in exchange for Bells, the currency of the Animal Crossing world. At the beginning of each game, the player will have a part-time job at Nook's Cranny, to help pay off their mortgage. This will involve making deliveries, writing letters, and meeting the residents of the town. While working for Nook, he gives a Uniform. This outfit is rare and it cannot be obtained from anywhere else. After finishing the tutorial part-time work, the player is able to sell various items to Tom Nook in exchange for Bells. In many respects, these transactions form the core of the game experience.In Animal Crossing: Wild World  Wild World also featured Nook's store randomly placed, but as the acre system was discarded for this title, the store may be located anywhere in the town. Furthermore, it will always be accompanied by Mable and Sable's clothes shop directly to the east. Several minor changes were made for this title. The sign board item is no longer offered, though other tools have been added. Nook also does not sell clothing in this title, except via catalog; one must purchase shirts and other accessories next door from the Able Sisters. Shampoodle was also featured in Nook's store in Wild World, operated by Harriet as a hairdresser in the Nookington's upgrade.In Animal Crossing: City Folk  While the store is once again located randomly, it is no longer tied to the Able Sister's shop. Store hours for the Nook 'N' Go upgrade were changed, with the store now remaining open until 1am. Tom Nook's Point System was revised to include a gift exchange feature, so that points can be exchanged for rare items. The Shampoodle was moved from Nook's to the city in this title. Interestingly, this title also features the thus-far unique ability to have Nook downgrade his store. Thirty days after the player obtains Nookington's, as they are exiting the store, Nook will ask if the player favors good hours, a balance, or variety. The player's response will cause him to downgrade to Nook 'n' Go, Nookway, or keep Nookington's, respectively. Any change, if requested, will happen a week later. If the store has been downgraded, Tom Nook will eventually survey the player again.In Animal Crossing: New Leaf  In New Leaf, Timmy and Tommy now run Tom Nook's old shop, while Tom Nook has taken a new living and runs a home improvement store named\u00a0Nook's Homes, alongside with Lyle. Tommy runs the shop on Monday, Wednesday, Friday,\u00a0and Sunday.\u00a0Timmy runs the shop on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.\u00a0Shampoodle's salon is not inside the shop in this title, as it would open up above Able Sisters in Main Street. However, once the store gets its first upgrade into T&T Mart (which is very similar to Nook's Cranny), Tommy will run the store in the morning and Timmy will work the night shift, similar to how Pelly and Phyllis run the Post Office. Each time the Player expands the stores, both Timmy and Tommy will be seen and work more frequently.Special Features  These are the special features that Tom Nook's Store can provide.The Turnip Stalk Market  A noteworthy item that Nook will buy is the turnip, an item that may be purchased by the player from Joan on Sunday mornings between 6:00 AM and noon. This particular transaction is notable because the price Nook will pay varies from day to day, forcing the player to follow the Stalk Market. In New Leaf, the task of purchasing turnips was handed on to Reese, owner of Re-Tail. Joan still has the job of selling the turnips to the player.The Catalog  Aside from selling items in the store, Nook also gives the player access to their own personalized catalog, from which the player can order any item that they have held in their pockets. Anything that was ever held there will be featured, but rare items, fossils, fish, etc. cannot be ordered. When purchased, an item will arrive by mail in about five hours. Only five items may be ordered at a time between mailings.Monthly Lottery  Exclusive to Animal Crossing, Nook offers a raffle for three rare items on the last day of every month. One entry for a chance to win requires five raffle tickets. Tickets are given to the player by Nook during the month after the purchase of an item in the store (not for items ordered through the catalog). The tickets are only good for the month they are labeled for but can be used in the future if saved. Nook will only give out raffle tickets for purchasing certain items. Items that are worth a raffle ticket are clothes, umbrellas, furniture, wallpaper, and carpet. Nook takes five raffle tickets, rolls the tumbler and lets out a colored ball. White balls are not winners. Green wins the third prize, red the second and gold wins the first prize.Tom Nook Point System  When buying items in the store in Wild World and City Folk, Players are awarded Nook Points. For every 100 Bells spent, the Player earns 1 Nook Point. However, this is not cumulative: i.e. buying a pack of seeds at 80 Bells gives zero Nook Points, buying a second pack for a total of 160 Bells will still give zero Nook Points since they were purchased separately. Nook Points serve to reward players for shopping at Nook's, offering discounts and prizes for their loyalty.Methods for gaining points  The easiest method for accumulating points would be on the Point Special. This event which are announced on the Bulletin Board, any item will award five times the normal point value. A normal purchase of an item at 100 Bells will now give the player five points during these days. Items ordered from the catalog will work as well. During these times, a moon will give the player 1,600 points and spending 400,000 Bells would unlock the Platinum membership. Normally, this amount would not be enough for Silver membership.Stages Nook's Cranny  Nook's Cranny is the first incarnation of Tom Nook's Store. Open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., the player begins the game with this store. In City Folk, Nook's store is laid out with shelving on the left wall, supporting one wallpaper (changes daily), some flooring (changes Daily), a flower seed or sapling, medicine, and some writing paper. Two pieces of furniture stand alone in front of the store. Three tools are set up on a table in the center of the room, which usually are a combination of Nets, Fishing Rods, Shovels, and Watering Cans. At the end of the shelving on the left is Nook's Point Tracking System. The bottom-right of the store resembles the cashier, and is one of the trademark features that all of Nook's Stores have. 'Nook's Cranny' is a parody of 'nook and cranny', meaning a small corner or hole. The store itself resembles a shed, made with wooden planks and held together with metal sheets. In fact, it is even stated that Tom Nook's shop may be Tortimer's old gardening shed before he became mayor. It is the only one of Nook's shops without an automatic door. The player must spend and/or sell a total of 25,000 Bells and play for at least eight days for an upgrade. After earning a Bronze membership at Nook's Point Tracking System, a model of Nook's Cranny is obtained.Nook 'n' Go  Nook 'N' Go is the second of Tom Nook's shops in the Animal Crossing series . For Tom Nook to expand to this shop, the player will need to buy/sell 25,000 Bells worth of stock at Nook's Cranny and play the game for at least 8 days. It is the only shop that has a sign pole. This shop is also the one that is open latest, and earliest (from 7:00 AM \u2013 11:00 PM) in Animal Crossing\u00a0and from 7:00 AM to 1:00 AM in City Folk. In Wild World, the store opens and closes at the same time as the other stores. Nook 'N' Go also appears in Wild World and City Folk. To upgrade to Nookway in City Folk, the player must buy/sell a total of 80,000 bells and the store must be Nook'n'go for at least fifteen days. To upgrade to Nookway in the other versions, the player must only buy/sell 65,000 bells worth of stock at Nook'n'go.Nookway  Nookway is the third expansion of Tom Nook's shop. For it to open, the player will need to spend 65,000 Bells at the previous Nook stores combined. It has a wider variety of items to choose from. This shop follows Nook 'N' Go. It is the second shop to have an automatic door.Nookington's  Nookington's is the largest expansion for Tom Nook's shop. In this expansion a whole new floor is opened up where furniture, wallpaper, and flooring is sold. Also, on the top floor Timmy and Tommy replace Tom Nook. In Wild World, after Tom Nook expands into Nookington's, the Shampoodle will also move into it to provide hairstyle makeovers for players at the cost of 3,000 Bells. To get Tom Nook to expand into Nookington's, the player must spend 240,000 bells and have a friend shop at the store. This shop has an automatic door. In City Folk, the player does not need a friend to shop at Nookway, and the upgrade cost has been reduced to 150,000.Upgrading in Wild World  To upgrade to Nookington's in Wild World, the player must spend 240,000 Bells at Nookway and a friend must buy something in the player's town as well. This creates problems for those who do not have a friend that they can connect with, and further problems if players do not have a sufficient internet connection using the built-in Wi-Fi using the DS (to connect to the internet) or Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector (that connects the DS or Wii to the internet using the computer) - they will be unable to upgrade. There is no other way to get Nookington's, though the problem can be solved by exchanging friend codes with another player over the internet. However, some Wild World game cards may have a glitch and will upgrade from Nookway to Nookington's whether a visitor shopped at the store or not. Online forums concerning the game will generally feature several people looking to travel and make new friends, with a dangerous risk. However, as of May 20, 2014, Nintendo has officially stopped Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for the Wii and DS, making visiting towns over the internet and upgrading to Nookington's normally impossible. The Wii U's Virtual Console version of Wild World, however, allows the player to upgrade to Nookington's without the need of a friend visiting their town and buying something from Nookway.Trivia Characters  Category:Characters is a list of articles about individual characters who appeared in at least one Animal Crossing game. This list does not include characters seen in Super Smash Bros. Brawl who are not affiliated with the Animal Crossing series, such as Mario or Pikachu. Other categories are available for lists of characters who are only in a certain game, made their first appearances in a particular title, or can be further subdivided into villagers, visitors, and special residents.\u00a0Snooty  Snooty villagers (\u30aa\u30c8\u30ca Otona, or \u3042\u305f\u3057 Atashi) (sometimes called Snobby) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. They are called snooty villagers because they act more mature and higher-class than other villagers. They are usually portrayed wearing makeup and high-end clothes that match their style, and their homes appear luxurious, though there are some exceptions. As of now, there are 65 snooty villagers.Characteristics  Snooty villagers are well-spoken and sometimes appear offensive and rude towards other villagers, including the player. They are self-centered, hot-tempered, and sarcastic, but if the player talks to them often, they open up and become more kind, sometimes giving the player lessons in fashion. However, this doesn't prevent them from making the occasional scathing comment. Snooty villagers usually have exotic or upper-class names, or names relating to high-value items and gemstones, making them easy to distinguish when talking to villagers around the town. Snooty villagers go to sleep at 3:00 AM in the original Animal Crossing and wake up at 9:00 AM. In Wild World, and City Folk they go to sleep at 3:30 AM, and wake up at 9:00 AM. In New Leaf they wake up at 9:30 AM and sleep at 2:00 AM. Like the peppy and normal villagers, they read \"Ms. Nintendique\" frequently, coming out with quotations from the magazine such as what their lucky item of the day is, or saying that they bought so much blush that the magazine gave them an item, which they then give to the player. They will often talk about Gracie and how much they love her clothing. They also frequently talk about the unseen magazine, Chic (villager species) Monthly. They will find it difficult to socialize with most\u00a0villagers, who have conflicting lifestyles to their own. They do not understand how lazy villagers can relax and not worry about their physical appearance. They also cannot fathom how jock villagers exercise or talk about exercising seemingly constantly and not worry about fashion; a jock villager's comment on the snooty villager's fitness will anger them. Normal villagers usually do not get along with them, and on most occasions both villagers criticize each other or the normal villager gets offended by the snooty villager's criticism. Peppy villagers sometimes, without knowing, let their ideas come out; for example, a peppy villager may say \"You know you're always rude...\", leading the snooty villager to leave the conversation annoyed. Uchi villagers likely won't get along with them, due to snooty villagers' tendency to talk about them behind their backs. They get along with cranky villagers, who share their maturity and viewpoints on life, and smug villagers as well, due to their similar interests in fashion. In City Folk, when you talk to snooty villagers in the city, they will sometimes do the irritation emote before saying anything to you. In New Leaf, when they have been befriended, snooty villagers will give the player medicine if they speak to them after being stung by bees. In Happy Home Designer, they turned into housewives and got especially interested in cooking and housecleaning. When they're at the restaurants they say that they would never be able to cook in the same way despite they have years of experience behind or they're envious that someone cooks better than them. They often talk about unknown generic neighbours comparing their lifestyle to themselves: of course Snooty's habits are always better than others. They're even more kind than in ACNL, having been \"replaced\" in the role of the most mischievous by the Uchi personalities.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by snooty villagers.Picture Portraits  Below is only relevant to Wild World. Snooty villagers will ask you the following question to trigger their portrait-giving sequence: Responses will be: By choosing \"I don't know\", and after a tirade about being mysterious, she will reply by saying:Trivia Tom Nook  Tom Nook (\u305f\u306c\u304d\u3061, Tanukichi?) is a special character who plays the most important role in all of the games. He is termed a raccoon in the western versions of the game but a tanuki in the Japanese version. In all games leading to New Leaf, he is the manager of the town shop. After the final expansion, Nookington's, he will employ his \"nephews\" Timmy and Tommy, who work on the second floor in every Animal Crossing series game except Animal Crossing: New Leaf. However, in New Leaf, Nook has taken his interest in real estate to a whole new level, opening Nook's Homes, whilst Timmy and Tommy run the town shop. In Wild World, he will give out his picture if the player gives him the safe from the Golden Axe Trading Event.Appearance  Tom Nook is a tanuki (a\u00a0raccoon in Western versions) with brown fur. His eye area has a dark brown mask-like shape for his raccoon eye characteristics. His nose tip, his hands, feet, and his tail are dark brown. The apron he wears over his lower half is inferred to be for modesty, a reference to the legends of the tanuki. In New Leaf, Nook wears a white shirt with a red necktie and a green sweater vest over it. His sweater has a left sided pocket protector with a pen sticking out. He also wears black pants. Whenever outside of Nook's Homes, such as the player selecting their new home spot or at The Roost, Nook is seen with a yellow jacket over his sweater.Services and General Information  In Animal Crossing, Wild World and City Folk, When the player first arrives in town, Tom Nook will greet them and introduce them to their new house. He will give a quote to them on the initial mortgage of the home. Tom will hire the player to  work part-time at his shop to help pay off the loan. Eventually, he will run out of tasks for the player and will lay them off, letting them free to find other methods to make Bells, in order to pay off the rest of the debt. Following the job, the player can shop at Tom Nook's store, and can sell items to him, for which he will pay for in full value. In New Leaf, however, Tom Nook has become a real estate agent, leaving the management of his store, now known as Nookling stores, to his \"nephews,\" Timmy and Tommy. The responsibility of welcoming new players has been given to Isabelle. Like in previous games, Tom will be responsible for orchestrating the construction of the player's house and providing the mortgage the player pays off via the ABD machine in the Post Office. Tom Nook runs a real estate agency called Nook's Homes, which also provides house customization and renovation services. The office also functions as the headquarters of the home inspection organization, the Happy Home Academy, ran by Lyle. Tom Nook also assists the player in searching for a plot to build their house when the first move in. Once a plot has been chosen, he will pitch his tent for the player to use as temporary housing while they are gathering funds to pay off their first home loan. Tom Nook's agency is also responsible for building the houses neighbors live in, as well as assisting them with moving in and out. Tom is noted to be very work-driven, and many years ago he left behind his friends, most importantly Sable, to travel to the big city. His dreams of success are quickly broken by the harsh life there. After making nothing of himself, he returns to the player's town to set up his store. Nook no longer appears to be as good of friends with Sable as he used to be, though the two often mention each other to the player. Nook seems to have a varied reputation among the villagers, with some speculating that he is, in fact, a man in a suit. In fact, when asking Dr. Shrunk about one emotion, he talks about how we all wear masks, and then says that Tom Nook \"wears a raccoon suit, but it serves the same general purpose\". Many will say that he has a checkered past, hinting at illicit activities - the fact that he seems to have a history with Redd (who describes Tom as a \"raccoon in an apron\" and treats him as something of a business rival) supports this, this is further hinted in Happy Home Designer as talking to Tom in his house he says he worked with a fox in the past and it was a horrible experience. In Animal Forest e+, the player can wake up Tom Nook after hours by banging on the doors three times with the shovel. He will be in his pajamas and allow you to shop, but he will move much slower. Not only this, anything the player sell to him will be lowered from its base price by 30%. Similarly, prices of items in the shop will be inflated by 17%, and the player is only allowed to either sell or buy what is on display. The catalog and other options will not be available either. Timmy and Tommy are Nook's nephews that appear in the final expansion of the shop, Nookington's, as assistants on the second floor. They assist him in his business. All three make a cameo in the Smashville stage in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.Game Guide  In the City Folk's game guide this description is given: \"A kind raccoon with a heart of gold (well, pockets of gold even though he only owns a shop, if ya know what I mean), Tom Nook helps you get started when you first move to town by loaning you a home to live in. Tom also runs a little supply shop in town that sells all the basics, including furniture, tools, and gardening supplies. Tom will help you in a variety of ways as your life unfolds, and you'll help him as well: keep shopping at the store and it'll get bigger and bigger. Eventually, old Tom will even need to hire his two nephews, Timmy and Tommy, just to keep his business running!\"Shop  In all games except New Leaf, Nook starts out with Nook's Cranny, expanding after the player buys enough from him. There are a total of four expansions for his shop: After a period of time with Nookington's, Tom Nook will ask you a question to better serve his customers. Based on the answer you give, Nookington's can close and reopen as a previous store to better suit your needs. Periodically, after the first questioning, Tom Nook will ask again, and the player can change their store again. This event only happens in City Folk.Other Appearances Super Smash Bros. Melee  Tom Nook appears as a Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, using his in-game model from\u00a0Animal Forest (evidenced by the Japanese character on his apron). Description: \"This guy's the friendly neighborhood shopkeeper who kindly helps the player set up their first house. He has a nose for business, and his customer service is second to none. During the course of the game, his store starts as a corner shop, expands to become a convenience store, and finally becomes a thriving supermarket and stalk market.\"Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Tom Nook also appears in the sequel to Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in the background of the Animal Crossing themed stage Smashville.D\u014dbutsu no Mori  Tom Nook appeared in D\u014dbutsu no Mori as the town shop owner, just as he does in the games. Like also in the games he helped Ai settle into town by making her work.Monopoly  Tom Nook also appears in the 2010 Nintendo Collector's Edition of Monopoly with K.K. Slider and Rosie in the light blue grids. He is worth 120 US dollars on the game board, the highest of the Animal Crossing characters that appear in the game.Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS  Tom Nook appears in the fourth installment of the Super Smash Bros. series. He appears alongside his nephews Timmy and Tommy as part of the Villager's final smash, which sees Nook construct a house on top of other fighters causing massive damage.Taiko Drum Master: Atsumete Tomodachi Daisakusen  In Taiko Drum Master: Atsumete Tomodachi Daisakusen, Isabelle, Resetti, and Tom Nook are unlockable by using their respective amiibos to listen to the Animal Crossing: New Leaf Melody (\u3068\u3073\u3060\u305b \u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u68ee \u30e1\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc).Stories  Sometimes, upon entering his store, he will appear in thought, and may tell you a story when approached: \"...Well, actually, I was just thinking about the good old days, hm?\nI know it seems that the world is my oyster, what with my fine shop...\nBut in my childhood, I lived the kind of life you couldn't even imagine!\nYes, yes, but this was all some time ago, but this was all some time ago, before I moved to this town, hm?\nOf course, I was born in our lovely <Town Name>, but I moved away for a time...\nYes, yes, the city years, I like to call them. I was a raccoon of action, hm?\nThe big city certainly had its charms...but it had its pitfalls, as well.\nIndeed, I had to endure certain hardships that I've never spoken of, hm?\n...Hard to believe, yes?\nYou're probably asking yourself, what the heck is Nook talking about, hm?\nFor now, <player name>, maybe it's best that we forget we ever talked about this.\"Aliases  Redd refers to him as a \"raccoon in an apron\". In Animal Crossing, Pelly refers to him as \"Mr. Nook\" when you chose to pay your loan. In New Leaf, Isabelle refers to Nook as the Real Estate Agent. Also in New Leaf, Saharah calls Tom Nook \"King Nook\" when you interact with her. His English name is derived from \"tanuki\" (often written as \"Tanooki\" in English) and his last name is likely a pun based on a myth about the Tanuki. His Japanese name, Tanukichi, is a mix between Tanuki and the Japanese word, kechi , meaning \"stingy.\"Trivia Resetti  Resetti (\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3055\u3093, Risetto san?, Mr. Reset), also known as Mr. Resetti, is a very cranky mole that appears in all the Animal Crossing series games. His job is to make sure that all players save continuously throughout gameplay. The more the player resets within the Animal Crossing games (or turns off the power without saving), the harsher he gets, so people must make sure that they save their game. In certain installments, resetting the game too many times will lead to either a \"fake\" reset in Animal Crossing and in Wild World, mentioning about his cousin Vicious Vole Vinnie (Possibly referencing the movie My Cousin Vinny). When Resetti's calmer, older brother Don Resetti appears, he will reveal Resetti's first name as \"Sonny\" in both Animal Crossing and City Folk.Appearances In Animal Crossing/D\u014dbutsu no Mori+  Resetti's role in Animal Forest+ and Animal Crossing stays the same throughout the whole series, but one of the main differences in this game is when he tells the player \"Thanks for buying Animal Crossing!\", which breaks down the fourth wall, where characters in a game or television program talk directly to the audience, or in this case, the playable character. As aforementioned, he appears when the GameCube resets or is turned off without saving. He will appear outside the player's house, giving a lecture of why saving is important. Resetting frequently will lead to him forcing the player to repeat a line of text to remind them of the importance of saving. Some of the sentences that the player may have to repeat are: \"I repent\", \"I'm sorry\", or even \"I like you.\" But if you say, \"I hate moles.\" he will get even more mad. Sometimes, he will pretend to reset the game himself, mentioning beforehand that all the progress the player has made will be lost. After the \"reset\" takes place, the screen will pop back up, and Mr. Resetti laughs saying: \"It was all a joke.\" If you reset enough, Resetti will start to say his doctor told him not to yell so much.In D\u014dbutsu no Mori e+  In Animal Forest e+, the player can visit the Reset Monitoring Center where Mr. Resetti and Don Resetti monitor resetting across the globe. To visit the Center, the player must speak to Mr. Resetti by resetting twice. Then, they must hit all the rocks in the town with a shovel. Once a week, a random rock may crack; hitting it again will reveal a hole the player can jump into to enter the Reset Monitoring Center. The \"Reset Alarm\" may go off while visiting. Don Resetti can also appear in the Reset Monitoring Center if he is met after resetting; one, both, or none of the moles may be present when the player visits.In Wild World  In Wild World, he portrays the same role as in the GameCube game. However, he may be seen within The Roost located inside the Museum on Sundays between 2:30 PM and 4:00 PM drinking coffee with a relaxed attitude. Resetti will converse about his work while maintaining calm demeanor when directing to the player.In City Folk  His role in City Folk stays the same as in Animal Crossing and Wild World, but he can now be encountered in new area in the city, called the Reset Surveillance Center, with his older brother occasionally making an appearance at the venue. This appears if the player has luck and the cones are out of the way, to the right of the city near the tunnel where he may give the player a Silver Shovel to leave the area. He will also appear the second time the game is accessed by the same player, to talk about the important of saving, regardless of whether or not the game has been turned off or reset with or without saving. This is the only time he will appear by the player's house for something positive.In New Leaf  Resetti's role and personality has softened in New Leaf compared to other installments in the Animal Crossing series. In New Leaf he similarly but not to an extent scolds the player for quitting without saving their game. But for the first time, Resetti is optional: after the first time the player quits without saving, he will appear in the lobby and talk about how he cannot appear again until the Resetti Surveillance Center has been built. From then on, Isabelle will remind players about saving their game when they quit without saving unless the Resetti Surveillance Center is built. The Resetti Surveillance Center can be bought as a Public Works Project by the Mayor of the Town for 360,000 Bells. This time it is inside a manhole which occasionally opens in the player's town after 8:00 PM, allowing the player to enter. When the Reset Surveillance Center is built, Resetti will appear every time the player quits without saving the game. When he appears, he will ask why the player reset, giving the player the options of \"I wanted to reset!\", \"My batteries died\", and \"I don't remember.\" By not ever saying \"I wanted to reset\", this marks the first time to where the player can avoid being lectured or yelled at by Resetti every time the player would reset their game. Once after the Reset Surveillance Center is built within the town, Resetti can be found having coffee in The Roost. Resetti can be seen if an error blurb is executed while playing with the gates open.In D\u014dbutsu no Mori  Resetti, has a minor role in D\u014dbutsu no Mori. He makes his appearance when Ai falls over when Yu is chasing a dragonfly flying around her. He appears just after she lands on Apollo's flower patch. He warns her of the rules in Animal Village, but lets her off because the damage to the flowers was accidental. He also appears when Yu and Alfonso are seen digging holes looking for fossils. Yu accidentally bangs Resetti with a shovel, and the mole gives a lecture about this \"Diggin' Spree,\" but Yu ditches him. Resetti then goes back underground to fix a leak. He can also be seen helping to decorate for the Winter Festival.Other Appearances In Super Smash Bros. Melee  Mr. Resetti himself does not appear in Super Smash Bros. Melee, but his trophy can be obtained when the player defeats five Fighting Wire Frames in Cruel Melee in Multi Man Melee Mode. It is worth noting that this marks as Mr. Resetti's first technical appearance outside Japan.Trophy Information  Prepare to receive a really long talking-to if you reset this game: the next time you play, Mr. Resetti will be waiting to deliver his best scolding. No matter what your intentions are, pressing the RESET Button will bring you face-to-face with this fervent character. Sometimes, the only way to shut him up is to apologize.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Mr. Resetti appears as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, where a blurb amasses the screen while ranting through a long lecture. His dialogue box obstructs either the top or bottom half of the screen. Mr. Resetti will also respond to stage events, such as characters falling asleep or getting knocked out. He also tries to mock characters, like doing a Kirby Impression. Mr. Resetti notably breaks the 4th wall within the game, as he exclaims that he is not pleased about being \"thought of as an item\", referring to the fact that he can be summoned though the Assist Trophy. A more obvious example of breaking the 4th wall is how he appears as if the game was reset on summoning most of the time, as well as he somewhat covers the stage view.Trophy Information  Resetti has two Trophies in Brawl, one with him in the ground, and one with his feet shown. Both are unlocked at random.In Ground Trophy Text  A mole wearing a hard hat who'll show up when you restart your game without having saved. He pops up and lets you know in no uncertain terms the importance of saving your game. The problem is, his speeches are entertaining enough to warrant breaking the rules at least once. In Animal Crossing, his brother Don appears too. He's the polar opposite of his sibling.Exposed Feet Trophy Text  A character who normally appears from underground to lecture the player. However, he is not always underground\u2014in Animal Crossing: Wild World, he can be found sipping coffee at the Roost if you go at a certain time on a certain day. In the Japanese-only \"e+\" version, he works at a so-called \"Resetti Observation Center\" where you can pop in for a visit.In Super Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS  Mr. Resetti no longer appears as an Assist Trophy, however, is briefly referenced in Super Smash Bros. Wii U during Palutena's guidance conversation regarding the villager. Trophy Information Be sure to save your game before you turn it off, or this guy will show up screaming \"AAAAAAARGH!\" Sonny Resetti and his favorite brother, Don, keep an eye out for sudden game resets, and they aren't shy about reminding you to save often. Best not to aggravate them needlessly...In Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate  Capcom revealed outfits based on Isabelle and\u00a0Mr. Resetti\u00a0via its Unity blog, and confirmed that Felines' meow sound will be altered accordingly when they are equipped.In Mario Kart 8  In Mario Kart 8, Mr. Resetti appears as an obstacle in the Animal Crossing race course, included with the Animal Crossing \u00d7 Mario Kart 8 downloadable content package. He appears in every season with the exception of winter, and he plays a role similar to the Monty Mole, occasionally popping out of the ground to pose an obstacle for racers.Coffee preference  Mr. Resetti likes Blue Mountain coffee with no sugar or milk. Mr. Resetti's preference of coffee with no sugar or milk is a reflection of his bitter personality.Quotes and Dialogues  The following is a full list of Resetti's dialogues and quotes.Mario Maker  Resetti appears as an unlockable amiibo costume in the intermediate 100 Mario Challenge.Trivia Gracie  Gracie (\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9, Gur\u0113su?, Grace) is a celebrity fashion designer in the Animal Crossing series who occasionally passes through the undeveloped towns of the country, impacting the lives of fashion-conscious villagers. As a giraffe, Gracie is very tall compared to the player. Gracie is the \"number one name\" in fashion in the Animal Crossing universe, and has no known rivals. Gracie is a male in the original Japanese version of the game, Animal Forest. Gracie is the face of Ms. Nintendique, but it is unknown if Gracie is connected with Fauna Magazine as well. Snooty villagers will sometimes call her outfits \"trash\" and her car a rusty heap, disgusted at the motives and ideals of Gracie's style. Gracie has appeared in every Animal Crossing series game to date, but was not featured in the film adaptation, D\u014dbutsu no Mori.Appearance  Gracie is a giraffe with pale yellow and dark brown hooves, brown spots on the skin, short brown hair, and purple eyeshadow. She wears a purple scarf and brown pantyhose on her legs. One of Gracie's notable apparel is the tank shirt. The shirt has her personal design consisting of a blue fill and two circles colored green and orange. This is also used in all of Gracie's furniture involving cloth. In New Leaf, Gracie wears round rimmed shades on her forehead colored the same as her signature tank top, although her appearance stays the same otherwise.Personality  Gracie is highly pampered and it can be assumed that Gracie lives a glamorous lifestyle. Gracie drives an expensive looking car, which is the only personal vehicle to appear in the games so far. Gracie has an abrupt manner and doesn't hold back from saying any opinions. Whenever Gracie's car becomes dirty, Gracie demands a nearby villager cleans it up. Gracie is often thought of as bossy and arrogant amongst the villagers, but will reward those who help or happen to strike the right fashion style.Professional Life Gracie's Fashion Line  Gracie works in the fashion industry. Gracie's designs are so well known that the name \"Gracie\" is synonymous with fashion (and, naturally, the magazine she stars in). However, rather than be intimidated by the city, Gracie has used the hustle and bustle to become famous. She owns a store in the city in City Folk and in T&T Emporium in New Leaf.In Animal Crossing  In the GCN games, Gracie will appear on a random week day. The player must wash Gracie's Car by quickly tapping \"A\". If the car isn't washed enough the player will not receive a reward. If the car is somewhat clean (indicated by small sparkles), the player will receive a normal shirt. If the car sparkles and shines, the player will obtain a special Gracie brand shirt. An odd coincidence that occurs is that every time Copper and Booker hold a Bust Illegal Parkers campaign, Gracie appears.In Wild World  In Wild World, Gracie will come on a random weekday by car on the same spot Redd sets up his tent. Gracie will make a quiz for the player, and will then give them a letter with clothing attached. If talked to enough, Gracie will ask the player to make an offer (in Bells) on how badly they want to achieve style. The player will not be able to obtain anything else from Gracie after they have both completed the quiz and received the style until the next time Gracie visits.In City Folk  Gracie has a store called \"GracieGrace\". The only other known staff member is Labelle. Here she sells unique furniture, shirts, and accessories at high prices. Gracie will appear in this store during the first day of every month, and sometimes at other dates. Gracie offers judgements of the player's fashion sense. The items considered are the player's clothes, accessories, haircut, hair color, and shoes. However, if wearing a helmet the hair style is not considered. If the player wears a wig, the color of the wig is considered rather than the hairstyle. Below is a guide to pass her 'fashion checks'. Do: Don't: If the player's ensemble is sufficiently coordinated, Gracie will give a 10% discount on GracieGrace purchases while within the store, though it expires when exiting the store.In New Leaf  After the player has expanded the Nookling store in their town to\u00a0 T.I.Y.\u00a0and spent 70,000 bells or more there, Gracie will start to visit the town's Plaza on completely random days. However, she may rarely appear for some players, making it more difficult to get the T&T Emporium. But, if you know the exact date Gracie once came, there is a proven way to see her. Time travel to that day, save and quit, and time travel a day forward. Then save and quit again and time travel a day backwards. Gracie should appear at the event plaza. While in the plaza, she expresses an interest in opening a shop, but in order to do so Gracie must check if the fashion sense of the town's people meets her fashion standards. Gracie will then give the player the chance to complete a fashion check. Gracie selects a style theme and will ask the player to dress appropriately for that theme. The Player can only pass the fashion check by wearing an outfit with most components matching the theme and no components clashing with the theme. If the fashion check is failed three times or it is not passed before midnight, the player will have to wait until Gracie's next visit to the town before they can ask for another check. However, if the player passes, they will receive a piece of furniture or clothing from Gracie's shop; depending on how well they scored in said fashion check (clothing is given for 'so-so' grades). After four successful fashion checks (whether the result is \"so-so\" or \"exceptional\" does not matter), Gracie will decide to open a shop in the town. Once T&T Emporium is built, Gracie's shop can be found on the third floor and fashion checks will no longer be available.Effect on the Town  Whenever Gracie visits the town, the snooty female villagers take note. Occasionally, Gracie will create an outfit for villagers who do favors or pay money. As a result, Gracie\u2019s designs have become coveted among female villagers. Peppy villagers sincerely hope that the reason they have not experienced much success in their performing careers is because they do not have fancy clothes, and see Gracie\u2019s fashions as a way to correct the issue. The lazy villagers have been known to admit crushes on Gracie, as people of beauty do not often visit the town. If the jocks wear one of the player's patterns in Wild World, they'll say something like, \"Man, that's UNCANNY. Are you Gracie's apprentice, [catchphrase]?\"Trivia Animal Crossing: Jump Out Peppy  Peppy villagers (also called \u5143\u6c17 genki, or \u30a2\u30bf\u30a4 atai) (sometimes called perky) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. They are incessantly friendly and excitable, making them very quick to apologize for anything they regret doing, even if they had not done anything particularly wrong. As of now, there are 65 peppy villagers. The Japanese name Genki comes from Wild World, where it is referenced in the game's files. It has not been mentioned outside of the game by Nintendo.Characteristics  They speak with chipper, bouncy voices and enjoy cheering when talking with player/players and other villagers; they are rarely discouraged from doing anything. They come out of their homes often. In the original Animal Crossing, they go to sleep at 11:30 PM and wake up at 7:00. In Wild World and City Folk they usually go to sleep at 2:30 AM and wake up at 7:00 AM. In New Leaf, they wake up at 9:00 A.M. and go to sleep at 1:00 A.M. They are always excited to see the player. They have short attention spans and wild imaginations. They express a number of aspirations which they will often share with the player such as their numerous claims to stardom as a pop star or diva. They have a tendency to say stereotypical valley girl words and phrases like \"ohmigosh!!!\" and \"like\" (as in, \"That is, like, so cool!\"). When they are describing certain things, they often use \"SOOOO!\" and \"totally!\" They commonly say a long, drawn-out \"Yaaaay!\" to show excitement and tend to claim they are hyper because they eat candy frequently. Peppy villagers are considered the female equivalents of Jock villagers, who are also energetic and very young and somewhat immature. They find it easy to get along with other villagers, but may become the center of jokes and gossip created by snooty and cranky villagers, and when either of two are rude, peppy villagers are rude back to them. They get along with normal, lazy, and jock villagers, who naturally avoid making rude comments and share similar lifestyles with them, such as; food with lazy villagers, activities with jock villagers and typical, 'girly' discussions with normal villagers. They do not hesitate to talk to snooty and cranky villagers, but may annoy them and make them angry with their conflicting habits, such as jumpiness, which conflicts with their refined stature.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by peppy villagers.Trivia Cranky  Cranky villagers (\u30b3\u30ef\u30a4 Kowai, or \u30aa\u30ec Ore) (also called Grumpy villagers), are male villagers in the Animal Crossing series. The name is a direct reference to the meaning of cranky; someone who is irritated or annoyed easily. As of now, there are 63 cranky villagers.Characteristics  The cranky characters can seem quite bitter and out-of-touch with social trends, making them generally unpopular with the peppy villagers. They have the deepest voice of all the characters except Joan, and many have frowns on their faces. In Animal Crossing they go to sleep at 5:00 AM and wake up at 10:00 AM. In Wild World and City Folk they go to sleep at 4:30 am and wake up at 10:00 am each day. In New Leaf, they go to bed at 4:00 am, and get up at 10:00 am. When trying to enter the house of a cranky villager before they wake up, the letter explaining that they are asleep is much angrier than other personalities. They usually spend a small amount of their day in their houses, and most of the day out. They are very self-centered and often enjoy gossiping about lifestyles of other villagers, making them snobby as well as grouchy. They will act protective of the player when the player becomes friends with them and they will seem to disagree with most of the things that other villagers say. They find it easy to get along with snooty, jock, and other cranky villagers, usually discussing trivial things such as food and the problems with unhealthy food. They find it difficult to get along with\u00a0peppy, smug, and uchi villagers, who cranky villagers claim are mucking around. Thus, conversations between a cranky villager and a villager of one of these types will result in one of them depressed and occasionally cranky villagers will tell the player that things are getting boring so they are considering spreading rumors about another animal and 'watching the fun.' The usual response from either of the personalities is to call them an 'old man' or 'grandpa.' They also get along with lazy\u00a0and normal villagers most of the time, but can directly offend them when anything wrong has been said. Although they may appear unfriendly, if the player talks to them, does errands for them and sends them letters for long enough, they will eventually begin to open up and will be more friendly with the player. In Animal Crossing, a cranky character will often speak to the player about their niece after becoming friends, they also may give requests relating to their nieces, such wanting a ball for their niece or a bug to give to them. While dialogue in earlier games suggests that their niece is coming to visit them, said niece never actually appears. Also, in City Folk, they may say this to another cranky villager. When a cranky villager becomes sad, he will say something along the lines of how he 'lives in a cold world.' They can usually grow to be close friends if the player meets them often and sends them letters with presents attached. Many of their picture quotes are a variant of \"I'm watching you.\" Cranky villagers are often the ones that give the player an invitation to Crazy Redd's, though they do warn them about how sly he can be. When a player gets closer to a cranky villager, the villager may appear more gentleman-like than the other villagers, because while the player is getting to know them, they may refer to themselves as more mature or like an old man. In Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer they state to follow ukulele lessons and show their knack for everything related to Hawaii.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by cranky villagers.Trivia Villager  Villagers are the main NPCs in the Animal Crossing series, and there are currently around 460 of them. They live simple, quiet lives scattered around the player's town. On the release of Wild World, villagers started to specialize in hobbies, such as fishing, finding fossils, collecting insects - to name but a few. They are all animals, as the title of the series, Animal Crossing, suggests, and they come in a variety of species, from mice to elephants. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf villagers are more interactive. They occasionally plant flowers, shake trees or even buy items from the shop. Villagers move into the town at random, and there is no way to determine who will move in next until their house is set, they have convinced a villager from another town to move in, or the player has convinced the villager to move in from the Campsite. Players with The New Leaf Welcome amiibo update can contact Wisp which allows them to move in any villager using their amiibo card. Each villager initially comes with a unique interior house design, which will gradually change over time depending on what furniture they request (as well as insects, fish, fossils, and clothes) or they obtain by either buying it or getting it from the player. When villagers talk to other villagers clothing change is a frequent occurrence. The villager's house can usually only be entered if they are inside. Villagers have varying \"sleep cycles\", and the house remains locked while they are sleeping. The player cannot see inside chests, wardrobes, or any other type of storage units inside a villager's home; when the player opens one, a specific message will appear relating to each wardrobe, some references to other Nintendo games. The player also cannot turn lights off inside of a villager's home. Sometimes, at random, the villager will offer a furniture item when the player looks in a storage unit.Appearance  As aforementioned, villagers appear as animals within each game in the series. Being of anthropomorphic nature, they stand on two feet with the same posture and poise as the human playable characters do. They also wear clothes and makeup, giving them a human appearance. They are capable of acting out different perceived, human emotions from crying to rejoicing, which are considered impossible in most animal species. The playable character can learn these emotions from Dr. Shrunk and Frillard (City Folk).Personalities  This section briefly underlines the key notes about each personality trait. For more information, check out the individual personality pages:Male Female  There are different personalities and characteristics found in villagers. All villagers share the same interests and hobbies, but some are more apparent in individual personalities than others. There are several personalities: Cranky, Jock, Lazy and Smug, which are male villager personalities, and Snooty, Peppy, Normal and Uchi, which are female personalities. The different personalities share similar traits, especially the male and female equivalents. There are many common characteristics of villagers. For instance, Snooty and Cranky villagers can come off quite mature, snobbish, arrogant, and somewhat hostile towards others and the player and will soon warm up, but still appearing arrogant. Uchi and Smug villagers will come off as concerning and caring towards the player and other villagers, almost as parental-like figures. Normal and Lazy villagers appear very calm for the majority, but are also very kind and caring and will usually get along with the player and other villagers for the most part. Peppy and Jock villagers are typically friendly as well, but will show a competitive side and somewhat child-like traits.Starting Villagers  The starting villagers are the first villagers the player has in their town when they start a new game. The amount of Starting Villagers differs in each game. In Animal Crossing there were 6, in Wild World there were 3, in City Folk the amount was reverted to 6, and in New Leaf, the amount of starting villagers is 5.Role in Animal Crossing  Initially in original Animal Crossing, there are 6 villagers in the town when the player moves in. The maximum number is 15. Once 15 villagers have moved in, one of the already existing villagers will attempt to move out to allow a new villager to move in. Villagers have a unique role in Animal Crossing that is not so apparent in Wild World. During town events, they gather and celebrate in different areas of the town to partake in different events. Most noted is during the New Year's Eve celebrations, where they gather around the town pond (in future releases, they are simply scattered around town, and have special conversations revolving around the festivities). During Summer and Winter, a random villager may appear in the town and live inside a tent or an igloo for the day, where they will offer to play games with the player and give the chance to obtain unique items. In future game releases, they are not a source of rare, unique furniture, but become a means of gaining furniture through trades. They also do not camp out, and only live in their homes.Role in Wild World  Initially in Wild World, there are 3 villagers in the town when the player moves in, out of a possible 8. Once 8 villagers have moved in, one of the already existing villagers may move out, to allow another new villager to move in, lowering the number to 7 until the new villager moves in. Although villagers do have a similar role as they do in Animal Crossing, they do have a few new features. When the playable character befriends them, they are likely to give the player a picture of themselves, as proof of their friendship. Each picture has a unique quote for each villager, which can be read when the picture is placed in the player's house and clicked. There are no tents or igloos in Wild World. They are also competitive in Wild World, a feature unique to the game. During some conversations, they may ask the player if they want to see who can catch the biggest fish or find the rarest insect. These are games which are similar to the Fishing Tourney and Bug-Off. During these events, when two villagers meet they will not talk. Another new feature were the rumors that some villagers were dating. This could be discovered by talking to some of the villagers in the town, who would either be gossiping about the two villagers, or one of the two villagers in the relationship. Usually, it is snooty villagers who gossip. There was no proof, however, of the two villagers dating, other than through conversation. Unlike the first game, the villagers walk at a much slower pace than the player, which is continued through City Folk.Role in City Folk  Initially in City Folk, there are 6 villagers in the town when the player moves in. The maximum number is 10. Once 10 villagers have moved in, one of the already existing villagers will attempt to move out to allow a new villager to move in. Villagers have a slightly different role than in Wild World. They no longer compete against the player, as this feature was the prominent feature within the Bug-Off and Fishing Tourney events. They do, however, have a new feature which is playing Hide-and-Seek, where a group of up to 3 villagers hide around the town; behind trees, signs and buildings (but never in them). They no longer give out pictures of themselves when they become friends with the player. Villagers now talk about the glamour and style found within the city, a new area found in the game. It is the only place in any of the games to find villagers who are not residents in the player's town.Role in New Leaf  In New Leaf, the maximum number of villagers in total is ten, though the tenth can only be accessed by either having one move in from a friend's town, using the amiibo cards, or the campsite. Villagers can now both water and plant flowers, shake trees, read the bulletin board and sit on benches and stumps, and in addition pictures and dating gossip are brought back. Other events are also gossiped about, such as when other villagers are planning to move or are ill. Past villagers that have moved out may periodically appear on Main Street. Though these villagers can't be recruited back to the player town from these interactions, they will speak about their time there among other topics. Villagers who have left may return to the town, but only after sixteen other villagers have moved in and then moved out of the town.Agent S  Agent S (2\u3054\u3046, Ni G\u014d?, #2) is a peppy squirrel villager from the Animal Crossing series. She was introduced in the 2003 Japanese exclusive Animal Forest e+, and reappeared in later games in the series. The \"S\" in her name most likely refers to her species, giving her the full title of Agent Squirrel. It is also possible that the \"S\" stands for sidekick, supporting the theory that she is Kid Cat's sidekick, also supported by her catchphrase and Japanese name. She is the second of the five superhero-themed villagers along with\u00a0Kid Cat, Big Top, Rocket, and\u00a0Filly.Appearance  Agent S wears a blue helmet emblazoned with two vertical white stripes that has the number two between them. Her arms and legs appear to be blue with white markings, while her tail is white with a gray swirl. She has half closed circle shaped eyes. Her initial clothing is the No. 2 shirt.Personality  Peppy villagers appear to be in a good mood often, and are easy to become friends with. As a peppy villager, Agent S will have the tendency to over-react in conversations about trivial subjects, and will usually be over-excited to see the player or other villagers. This villager, like other peppy villagers, will rarely be discouraged from doing anything, including the usual hobbies. Peppy villagers dream of becoming famous in the future and read Ms. Nintendique, an unseen magazine read by snooty, normal, and other peppy villagers in the Animal Crossing Series. Peppy villagers will also have a very short attention span, which means they soon forget some arguments or tasks given to the player which were not completed. Agent S may easily get upset in conversation when wrong things are said. She will get along well with other villagers, particularly the lazy, normal, jock, uchi, other peppy villagers, but she may annoy and upset cranky and snooty villagers, whose personalities differ. Due to the nature of peppy villagers, she may mention how \"old\" or \"boring\" cranky villagers are compared to her opposing, upbeat personality.House  In\u00a0Animal Forest e+, Agent S has the same furniture styling as Rhoda's house, only that she has changed the wallpaper to the tree wallpaper and the flooring to stone tile. There is a dice stereo by the left window that plays either K.K. Cruisin' or K.K. Western. She owns many econo chairs which are placed all around the house. In the bottom right, there is a regal vanity by a ruby-econo chair. In Wild World, Agent S owns many items from the Cabana Series, including the lamp, the bookcase, and the bed, the latter of which being situated in the middle of the room. She also owns a Classic Clock, a harp, and a birdcage. She also owns a High-End Stereo, which plays the song K.K. Cruisin'. Her choice of wallpaper is the Cityscape Wall, and her flooring is the Mosaic Tile. In City Folk, Agent S' house is extremely similar to her Wild World house, with the only difference being that most of the furniture has been moved around. In New Leaf, Agent S' house has more of a jock theme to it. She has the default basement wallpaper and flooring. In addition to this, she also owns a few boxing themed items, some examples being the boxing mat and the blue corner. She also owns a claw-foot bathtub, a drip pail, and a clothes closet. Agent S also owns a CD Player, which plays DJ K.K., unlike her previous two appearances, where she had K.K. Cruisin'.Normal  Normal villagers (\u666e\u901a Futs\u016b, or \u79c1\u00a0Watashi) (sometimes called sweet or sweetie villagers) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. The name comes from their neutral opinion on things such as hobbies and other characters such as the player, villagers, and special visitors. They are often kind to the player. As of now, there are 71 normal villagers, making them the most common female personality.Characteristics  Normal villagers, despite being called \"normal,\" have a lack of self-worth, where they feel self-depreciative. They also appear slightly obsessive with cleanliness and hygiene - a trait also found in peppy villagers. They do not, however, appear to show any concern for their physical appearance, making them happy with what they have. In Wild World, they talk about a friend called Moppina, a non-present mop which reflects on their clean-obsessive nature. They can also have a conversation with a peppy villager about Moppina, which the peppy villager may find funny. They get along very well with every villager and will usually talk about other villagers instead of talking about themselves and their problems. However, They will occasionally talk about themselves and their personal issues. If a normal villager stays in the player's town for a long period of time, she will get rid of all her furniture and when she does leave, she will announce to leave \"empty handed, and without anything.\" Normal villagers have the easiest time getting along with smug, lazy and other normal villagers, and sometimes even snooty villagers. However, they make each other sad or even angry during a conversation. They may conflict with cranky villagers due to their rude, arrogant, and sour nature. The male equivalent of normal villagers are lazy villagers, who display many similar characteristics to them, including their caring and friendly nature that both personalities share. They are the mother-like characters in the town, appearing friendly, sweet, and hospitable towards the player and other villagers. They like to use French expressions, too. In the original Animal Crossing, the normal villagers will wake up at 5:00 A.M. and go to sleep at 9:00 P.M. In Wild World, and City Folk, they wake at 5:00 A.M and go to sleep at 1:00 A.M. In New Leaf, they wake up at 6:00 A.M. and go to sleep at 12:00 A.M. They are very rarely (if at all) angry and tend to take insults and disappointment personally, but will apologize even though they may not have done anything. They also seem to enjoy cooking and will often ask the player about food. In Happy Home Designer, normal villagers got more focused on fashion and style, reading a lot of books about, they got also sillier than before, resembling the peppy personality.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by normal villagers.Trivia Redd  Redd (\u3064\u306d\u304d\u3061, Tsunekichi?), also known as Crazy Redd, is an untrustworthy kitsune, or fox. He runs Crazy Redd's, an illicit furniture store in the Animal Crossing series, where he is known to sell counterfeit paintings and over-priced items. Certain items sold are considered \"special\" Redd items, which have an HRA bonus. He has a sneaky, sleazy, crafty, and sarcastic personality. When the player leaves his store without buying anything, he will say 'thanks a lot...' in a sarcastic way. But if the player does buy something, he will give them a sincere thank you. He is thought to be 35 in Wild World, as two passwords state Redd is that age. He considers Tom Nook as competition, referring to him as \"that raccoon in an apron.\"Profession  Through the Animal Crossing series, Redd owns small businesses that makes most of its profits by over-charging its customers. Unlike Tom Nook, Redd charges for admission into some of his shops and on an invite-only basis. He tends to pressure players into buying his wares by concocting stories and lying about his products.Role In Animal Crossing  In Animal Crossing, Crazy Redd owns a tent suspiciously labelled the \"Black Market\" - the \"Black\" being crossed out clumsily in red marker. His name could be a reference to this, making it the \"Redd\" Market. When he shows up in town, Redd sends the player a letter telling them the date at which he will arrive. On this date, the player will have to wander around town until finding him in a random spot. He will occasionally sell paintings. Unlike in other games, Redd has a \"B\" (possibly standing for \"black\", as in \"black market\") on his apron.  Redd also runs a stand during the Fireworks Show, where he sells novelty items, such as balloons and pinwheels.Wild World  In Wild World, Redd appears once a week on a specific day (which the player can choose by speaking with Lyle) and sets his tent up outside the Town Hall. On the first week of his arrival, the player will not know the password required to enter, and so will have to ask the villagers. A random villager will have the password, not necessarily the closest friend of the player. After reciting the password correctly to Redd, the tent will open and allow the player in. The player will then be asked to pay 3,000 Bells in order to use his store. If they do not agree to this, the player will not be allowed to purchase anything, and will have to inquire with the villagers next week for another password. Once the player becomes a member of his \"family\", Redd will send them a weekly letter, received on the day before he arrives, with a new password. It is believed that Redd is in cahoots with an Lyle who offers forgery insurance. Insurance can only be bought weekly at a price which does not cover for the cost of buying a forged painting, meaning both Lyle and Redd have made a profit at the expense of the player. This belief is also upheld by how Redd knows the day of the week on which he should come to the town, which matches with the day the player selected when talking to Lyle. Redd's age is implied by a password to be 35, though this is never verified.City Folk  In City Folk, Redd owns a small shop on the left of the city, in what villagers call a \"dark alley\". To get into his shop, a villager or friend would need to send an invitation to the player. This replaces the secret password in Wild World. After buying something, Redd will give the player an invitation to send to other players - If they visit Redd's, he would give 1,000 Bells to the player. The entry fee is 3,000 Bells. Redd changes his inventory every Wednesday. He appears to have no connection with Lyle, who now runs the Happy Room Academy in the city. Therefore, insurance does not exist and any forgeries cannot be refunded at all. Most of the time when he guarantees its value, it's real.New Leaf  In New Leaf, Redd returns to the tent business, setting up in the Event Plaza. He specializes in the art department now, only selling paintings and the newly added statues. Some paintings and statues are always genuine, but most can be forgeries. However, forgeries now have noticeable cosmetic differences from the real version to make it less luck-based. The fake versions of the normal items are a separate collectable item. Unlike the statues there are certain paintings which are now always genuine. His store runs on a \"one-a-day\" policy, where he only allows customers to buy one item per day. To prevent loopholes, any item purchased from Redd in one town counts in all others, therefore ensuring that a single player can only purchase a single item from him each day. He also mails purchases to the player's mailbox the following day, rather than giving the purchases to the player straightaway (marking purchased artwork with a special note).\u00a0 He also appears at New Year's Eve and Fireworks Show at the plaza, where he sells hats for 300 Bells at the former and Redd's Cookies for 500 bells at the latter.In Animal Crossing The Movie  Redd appears in D\u014dbutsu no Mori, where he tricks Yu and Alfonso into buying a fake Golden Slingshot during the Fireworks Show, for which he charged them 3,500 bells. Redd insists that the Golden Slingshot is one of a kind, while in reality he had an entire box filled with them in his tent.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Redd can both be seen as a trophy, and as a spectator in Smashville.Trophy Information  The owner and proprietor of Crazy Redd's Emporium, which sells furniture acquired on the black market. It's said he's famous in the underworld. He drops by once a week and sets up his tent in front of the town hall. His shop's full of rare items, but the prices are high. It's open until midnight, an hour longer than Tom Nook's place, which pleases night players.Trivia Coelacanth  The coelacanth (\u30b7\u30fc\u30e9\u30ab\u30f3\u30b9, Sh\u012brakansu?) (pronunciation: /\u02c8si\u02d0.l\u0259.k\u00e6n\u03b8/ 'seel-uh-canth') is an extremely rare saltwater fish that has appeared in every main Animal Crossing series game. In Animal Forest, this was the only fish to appear in the ocean. Unlike any other fish in the series, the coelacanth can only appear when it is raining or snowing, and it is the only fish to spawn in this unique manner. Despite the fact that it can rain on the island in New Leaf, it cannot be caught there, though it can be caught on the island in Animal Crossing. In Animal Forest e+, the coelacanth can only be encountered once per play session, even if it isn't caught.Donation To The museum  As with all fish caught in Animal Crossing series, the coelacanth can be donated to the museum by talking to Blathers.In Animal Crossing  Blathers will say: \"Hoo, my goodness! Glorious! Seen in this light, of course, it's quite a grotesque beast. And yet, it does have a certain peculiar allure, wot? You may rest assured that we shall treat it with much affection and respect, wot! My word as a gentleowl.\"In Wild World  Blathers will comment: \"It was once thought that the coelacanth had gone extinct, eh wot? Indeed, right up until a scholar saw them lined up in a market. Hoo hoo! That would clearly suggest that they are edible, don't you agree? Though I must admit, they don't look like they would taste very good...\"In City Folk  Blathers will say the following when given the coelacanth: \"Many years ago, the theory was that the coelacanth had gone extinct...But as it turns out, it still exists and has been living deep in the ocean this whole time, wot? Imagine! This fish has known the world since the dinosaurs... Perhaps it's the true master of the sea!\"In New Leaf  The description plate in the museum will say the following: \"Coelacanths are ancient fish once believed to be extinct but recently discovered around South Africa. Called \"living fossils,\" they have apparently changed very little over the past 400 million years. They can live for over 60 years and reach lengths of six feet but have rather small brains, even for fish. They have more fins and harder scales than the average fish, making them a rather resilient breed. Their flavor is very different from most fish, and they contain a fat that is indigestible by humans. It's for that second reason that eating them really isn't highly recommended.\"Further information  The coelacanth is a type of fish that was thought to have gone extinct long ago until it was rediscovered in 1938 off the coast of South Africa. It is considered to have evolved into its current form over 400 million years ago. They are large fish that can grow up to 1.8m in length. They are mostly active at night, between the depths of 100 and 500m, and feed mostly on fish that they come across. Whilst little remains known about the life of the coelacanth, they have been observed to have shark bite scars, suggesting they are prey to the large predators of the deep ocean.Trivia GracieGrace  GracieGrace is a high-end furniture store in City Folk and New Leaf, owned by Gracie, the giraffe fashionista. It is located in the city in City Folk, where it is run by the estranged Able sister, Labelle, and in T&T Emporium in New Leaf, where Gracie herself runs it, as Labelle works at the Able Sisters. All of the furniture that Gracie sells are many times more expensive than those in Tom Nook's store or the Nookling stores, with many items selling for over 200,000 Bells each. In addition to furniture, Gracie also sells clothing and accessories, which are not as expensive as the furniture. Villagers are often seen in GracieGrace, where they will complain about the high prices.Furniture  GracieGrace's furniture and clothes change seasonally, unlike Tom Nook's or the Able Sisters, which change daily.Sales  There is a sale at the end of every season. They are as follows:In City Folk  During the sales period, items may disappear and be replaced with a \"sold out\" sign, much like at Tom Nook's Store. This suggests that some villagers have bought things, though this cannot be seen by the player. The player is also able to obtain a further 10% discount by presenting to Gracie a complete look. The discount is available for as long as the player is in the store.In New Leaf  In New Leaf items can still sell out, but various other items will appear like the wedding cake or furniture from the Card Series. Additionally, the clothing sections will be replaced with similar exclusives. These items are all new to New Leaf and can only be found during the end of season sales.Trivia ", "Animal Crossing Fanon Wiki": "Animal Crossing Fanon Wiki Animal Crossing: Wild Folk!  Animal Crossing: Wild Folk! is a fan-made Animal Crossing game exclusively for the Wii U. Multiple new additions are created for this game, one example includes local Multiplayer support. The game will be released on November 20, 2012 in America, November 19, 2012 in Canada, November 12, 2012 in Japan, November 23, 2012 in Europe and November 25, 2012 in Australia. It has also been confirmed to be releasing in South Korea when the Wii U is released there. The series also returns to it's roots, as you are, unlike the 3DS title, a person who has just moved out and wants to get their own house. Although this time, it is explained that the person got on the wrong train, and it is how they are with anthropomorphic animals.Events  Please see List of holidays in Animal Crossing: Wild Folk!Birthdays Tom Nook's Shop  Tom Nook, like the first three games of the series, owns a shop which is able to be expanded by buying multiple items. Below are a list of renovations, with the price that the store expands. Please note, the prices are accumulative, meaning that once you upgrade the store, the number does not reset to \"0\". In addition, a secret upgrade is also available in the game, and by spending 1,000,000 accumulative bells with only 1 player and by playing for a year, the player(s) will unlock this upgrade. Tom Nook renames his store the Nook & Nephs Deluxe Store and includes all of what Nookington's has, but also includes a smaller version of the Gracie Grace store. The Gracie Grace store includes only three shirts, and two accessories. A lamb named Daphne runs the shop.Nook Points  As with City Folk, the Tom Nook Point System returns under the name Nook Points. Like with City Folk, a special bank machine-looking object appears in every store, and is named the Nook Points Center (NPC). Depending on how many bells you spend, you gain points. Every time you spend 100 bells in Tom Nook's shop, you gain 10 points. Spending 1000 gives you 100 points, and so on. (Theoretically) If you buy every item in Nookington's in one day, you can gain up to 2,500 points.Rewards  After gaining a certain amount of points, one is able to spend those points on different rewards. The rewards are usually based upon other Nintendo video games. Below is a list of rewards and the amount of points you need to spend to get them. The awards are only available from the NPC.Super Animal Crossing  Super Animal Crossing is a kart racing game for the Nintendo Wii and DS.Character Key  KEY:\nItalic Characters - Lightweight\nBold Characters - Middleweight\n Regular Characters - Heavyweight\nBold and Italic Characters - UnlockableCharacters  The characters are split into teams.You choose 2 people in 1 kart.Team 1 - City Folk  Samson (Mouse)\nAnimal Crossing Boy (from the Wii version)\nNibbles (Squirrel)\nAnchovy (Bird)\nSpork (Pig)\nWart Jr. (Frog)\nLucy (Pig)\nBecky (Chicken)\nRod (Mouse) - Small\nGladys (Ostrich) - Medium\nGwen (Penguin) - Small\nCesar (Gorilla) - Heavy\nMonty (Monkey) - Heavy\nPatty (Cow) - HeavyTeam 2 - Inner Metalic  Egbert (Chicken)\nCamofrog (Frog)\nCube (Penguin)\n Alfonso (Crocodile)\n Louie (Gorilla)\nAnkha (Cat)\nAce (Bird)\n Octavian (Octopus)\nPompom (Duck) -Medium\nPuck (Penguin) -Medium\nPurrl (Cat) -Medium\nOlivia (Cat) -Medium\nMint (Squirrel)-MediumTeam 3 - Special  Mable (Hedgehog)\n Mr.Resetti (Mole)\nPelly (Pelican)\nPete (Pelican)\nPhyllis(Pelican)\nPorter (Monkey)\nRedd (Fox)\nSable (Hedgehog)\nSahara -Large (Camel)\nTom Nook -Medium (Raccoon)\nTortimer -Medium (Tortise)\nK.K.

Welcome to the Wiki!! Animal Crossing Galaxy  Animal Crossing Galaxy is the 4th title in the Animal Crossing series. It was first seen at E3 2011 where Shigero Miyamoto stated that it would be aimed more towards hardcore gamers than with previous installments which were aimed more for casual gamers or non-gamers. Animal Crossing Galaxy was released on March 20th 2012 for the Wii console and is compatible with the wii motion plus accesory.Story  The game begins with the player inside kapp'ns taxi spaceship. The Kapp'n proceeds to ask the player questions that determine the players and the players planets appearence and name. Once the player arrives at his new home planet he meets Pelly who gives the player a map and instructs him or her to go to his new house. After he arrives at his/her house the player meets Tom Nook  who explains that he is the one who built his/her house and that he owns the mortgage but he will lower it if the player works at his shop, Nooks Cranny. The player than must go through a tutorial from Nook before he is released to do as he/she pleases.Places Home Planet  The home planet is the Town of Animal Crossing Galaxy. Important buildings there include the Civic Center, the Planet Portal, Tom Nook shop, the Able Sisters, and the Museum. Landmarks include the ocean (which takes up on average 1/4 of the players planet), the river system and various trees and flowers. The Planets name and general appearance are determined when the Kapp'n talks to you in the opening sequence.The City Planet  The City Planet takes the place of the city from Animal Crossing: City Folk. It is larger than the players home planet and has 3 moons that orbit it.

This vehicle was developed first to expand into the earth and for mining. It was then repurposed during the Inforian-Paradian civil war to crush and drill through enemy blockades in the underworld that made up the two nations. Drill Breaker Transport: A variant of the DBMV this was developed in response to needing a protective command/regroup/resupply station during the long tunnel fighting within the underworld. While it can carry 20-50 men it is more often relagated to a support role as an armory or command vehicle rather than entering combat itself. However due to the nature of the foes it faces the transport, armor, and command variants are all equipped with multiple repurposed 40mm cannons to shred attackers.\n\nTransport Submarine: Developed in response to needing a way to move large numbers of troops around silently (well as silently as a Transport submarine can be) the transport submarines often carry a few hundred personnel and are generally used to ferry incredible amounts of supplys to hotspots or disaster areas. Currently they are unarmed and are dependent on Paradines small surface fleet or allied fleets to provide protection. With the recent Inforian attack however Paradine has started looking into arming their fleet, although this would require massive amounts of time and resources.Paradian First Generation Species  Gorillas \u2013 Undergoing revision.\n UtahRaptor \u2013 Undergoing Revision Megalodon \u2013 The biggest baddest shark returns in Paradine's arsenal of Sea monsters. The titanic Megalodon serves as escort for both Paradian and LIN forces when at sea. Its strength and size make it a dangerous threat to nearly anything it encounters. Dunkleosteus \u2013 A prehistoric armored-plated fish some 40 feet in length. The Dunkleosteus' bony plates have been modified with an additional cortical calcite substructure to be significantly tougher, allowing them the sufficient protection to ram armored targets such as submarines. Known for being highly aggressive these animals are used for defensive operations due to their slow swimming speed but devastating bite and ram, they are an essential component to Paradine's naval defense against Inforian creatures.\n\nArthropleura \u2013 An enormous millipede like creature. It is 6 meters long and able to produce a toxin that can kill near anything instantly. It is a capable ambusher for its size and excellent at hiding in its habitat. The Arthropleura is capable of fighting on both land and in lakes, rivers, or streams where its genetically modified ability to produce a glue like substance allows it to collect rocks and brush to form camoflauge. Therinzinosaurus \u2013 A plant eater that should've been a carnivore, it has meter long claws capable of shredding metal and bone. Despite this they are still breakable but they've been genetically engineered to regrow and reinforce their claws in the event of breaking them.\n\nDire Wolves \u2013 Large Wolves that hunt enemy forces in Paradine's forests. They are given stronger bones and they now have spines akin to hedgehogs for greater protection. Dire wolves are often use by the Underguard and can also be found in Port City sniffing for any sign of WOP, Inforian, or other taint. Thanks to their incredible senses they're often quite capable of finding and brutally dispatching anything they find unpleasent. Direwolves are also found in Unity Lake City and Port City along with numerous cities underground. Thanks to their amazing senses they are an incredible asset against Inforian beasts and Woppie infiltrators. Tyrannosaurus Rex: Revising In Process Misc 1st Generation SpeciesSecond Generation of Paradian Species  Grenadiers TBAAlperia Geography and Environment:  Alperia was mostly inhospitable land consisting of high mountain ranges, arid plains, deserts, and a few fertile zones and coniferous forests. If it was not for the vast natural resources that where located under it, Alperia would have never been a Drakite province. Original Drakite industrialization of the mountainous coast consisted of vast cities and complexes built on the coast and into the mountains, however as the province expanded so did its population, and thus cities. By the time of the assassination of the emperor; Alperia was the most densely populated of the territories. In the land-grab since then, Alperia expanded its control considerably, making it the second-largest nation on the planet (second to TWP) and controlling most of the former United States, Canada, and parts of Mexico.  Due to the geological changes caused by the great fault Alperia is mostly arid plains/rocky desert, mountains, prairie and coniferous forest (primarily the areas that were Canada and Alaska), with speckling of other biomes throughout; in sharp contrast to the massive diversity it had pre-fault. Apart from the natural biomes, Alperia is dominated by one man-made one; urban sprawl. Alperia has more square miles of city and suburb than any other nation on the planet by several orders of magnitude. Rural living is unheard of, with any \u201crural\u201d area being held by corporations performing automated mining or farming of genetically modified crops. Alperian cities are known for being unconventional, they are miles and miles of widely spaced city clusters that are considered part of \u201cthe network,\u201d at the center of each \u201csection\u201d (Alperian states or territories) is a mega-city\u2026which is as its name suggests (mega-cities are surrounded by \u201cthe network\u201d). The areas untouched still have the same ecology and flora and fauna that survived the fault, usually the areas up-north in what was once Canada due to the mega-cities being more prominent in what were the American west-coast, east-coast and Midwest. Alperia is also known for being extremely hot most of the year, primarily in the urban areas that aren\u2019t costal, often not dipping below 70F even in winter. White uncomfortably sweltering for many foreigners, heat is something most Alperians revel in.Government:  The Alperian government is a bizarre one, formed from what was left of the North American nations and the ensuing corporate-technocratic city-states after the fall. Due to the dominance of business and academics in the industrial and technological bases of the old United States, when Alperia finally succeeded from the Empire and \u201cregained\u201d its cultural identity it quickly set up a form of government emulating the pre-Drakite era. The Alperian Technocracy is divided into 4 branches; Judicial, Legislative, Executive and Advisory. The Judicial branch consists of the courts and much like pre-fault nations serves to both punish criminals but also to determine if laws are constructional. The remaining branches however; are what really set Alperia apart. The Alperian Legislative and Executive branches are dominated by automated systems, unlike pre-fault nations which tended to be infested with bloated and wasteful bureaucracy that both corrupts and spends excessive amounts of money. The Alperian Legislative branch is unicameral, consisting only of a senate of 3 elected officials for each of the 62 Alperian \u201csections\u201d; a \u201csection\u201d is defined by the presence of a \u201cmega-city\u201d (which its self is defined by a certain economic output and size) rather than population or any other means as Alperia draws lines based on economics. Senators are elected every 4 years by the public in open voting that is open to any individual possessing a university education and owning property (general local voting is open to everyone). The Legislative branch does as its name suggests, it draws up laws, amendments, passes bills and helps along other changes. The Senate is led by the non-partisan Smart-AIs \u201cJuno\u201d and \u201cMinerva\u201d who acts as the Speakers of the House (or Senate) due to their status as an AI. Juno and Minerva also run the entire bureaucracy of the Legislative branch, with each senator only having very small numbers of human staff. The Executive branch consists of the President, his Second (not vice president, the \u201csecond\u201d is powerless and only there in-case then president is in some way disposed) and the \u201cPermanent Executive Assistant\u201d who is the Smart-AI Juno, plus all the other staff. Juno was instated for the role of helping to run the nation because she is a machine, a sentient-AI dictated by what is best and not by personal goals or gains, making her perfect for helping the president (and the rest of the government) on the best path for everyone in the long run. The President is not publically elected, instead picked from the Legislative and Advisory branches, all of whom vote to select the next president from among the Senators or Councilors. The President serves a 6-year term and can be re-elected without limitation; however no Alperian president has served more than one term. The Alperian president is both less and more powerful than presidents or prime ministers like those who served the United States, United Kingdom or Germany. The veto process is much more intricate, but the president is also treated like the true head of the government and not a glorified figurehead. The president and Juno have the final say in almost all matters. It may also be noted that the president is not considered the commander-in-chief of the Alperian military by default, however they may be given military command if he/she served and retired from the military with a pay-grade of OF-7 or higher (this has yet to happen however so there is no real legal precedent). Below the president, Juno and the second are the two chancellors (also voted in similar to the President) who act as the president\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d advisors. After them come the various High-Chancellors who are considered part of the executive branch in terms of succession or \u201cimportance\u201d due to the High-Chancellors performing a similar role to the various \u201cSecretaries\u201d of the United States\u2019 government. The final branch is the Advisory, which is the smallest by far. The Advisory branch has very little actual power except for the fact that their word caries considerable weight anywhere and when they work with the Judical branch to reject bills they believe will be very harmful to Alperia. Since many of the AIs run actually run the nation\u2019s\u2026everything, the Advisors fill an\u2026advisory role to the rest of the government and therefore lack formal power. The Advisory branch does as it name describes, it advises all the other branches and is filled with many of Alperia\u2019s greatest minds who serve short; 3-year informal terms. The Advisory branch is elected academically, only academics in the field of the councilors or high-councilor may vote in that election, for example; only people who hold extensive degrees in \u201ceconomics\u201d may vote on the Councilors or High-Councilor of Economics. Each scientific, analytical or mathematical field (there are roughly 5 dozen; including medicine, economics, metallurgy, computer engineering, agriculture, etc) has a High-Councilor, who is considered; more or less one of the best men or women in that field, and 5 Councilors below them who; while considered second to the High-Councilor are still highly respected in their field. It is considered an extreme honor to be selected for candidacy for a job in the Advisory Branch and most people are actually voted-in via write-in election. While significant academic skill is a requirement for any position in the Alperian government, the Advisory branch is a step above; and filled with some of the world\u2019s most brilliant minds. The actual service is somewhat informal, while the Councilors and High-Councilors do have a meeting chamber in Mechanis they are mostly free to live where they want and only have to meet as a group once a month. They are also free to continue their other jobs since their job is simply to send some e-mails to help educate people on how they think a bill should be voted on (more or less). As one may be able to tell the federal government dominates the Alperian government completely, with sections able to manage themselves but still deferring to the Federal government for anything important. This causes some chafing but Alperia explicitly focused on sections being centered around mega-cities so that they are all relatively homogenous, plus the AI that run Alperia help to make sure every section gets treated like individuals despite all the federal control. It may also be noted that due to the limited nature of Alperian official\u2019s elections serious limits have been places placed on campaign contributions to limit excessive influence by special interests and corporate entities.Demographics:  Alperia was a fairly racially and culturally diverse Drakite territory, and the diversity only increased after the First Drakite Wars with the influx of refugees and immigrants from more ravaged nations that continues to this day. Since the country was founded mainly by North Americans and Middle Europeans, the nation has a unique blend of general culture compared to other nations which were founded mainly by people from one geographic area (making defining any one single culture to be a fool\u2019s errand). Alperians are widely considered very snooty and elitist by members of other nations, in part due to their superior standard of living and education; however they are often more than willing to help improve others (whether they want it or not). The official languages of Alperia are German, French, Spanish and English, most of which are spoken fluently by most Alperians; however a distinct \u201cEuropean accent\u201d is held by people from the mega-cities when speaking English, whereas most living in the network speak English with a Midwest-American accent, making it easy to identify where somebody lives. Religion is a rapidly declining practice in Alperia, with less than a fifth of the population practicing some form of religion. Most crimes committed in Alperia in recent times are white-collar crimes, whereas blue-collar crimes are uncommon since unemployment rate is so extremely low and most everyone with a job is an equivalent college graduate working in a professional field (Alperia is not crime-free by any measure, just that muggings have been replaced mostly with account hacking, electronic bank robbery and the like). Punishment for crimes are typically quite harsh but not cruel, the death-penalty has been banned for all but cases involving war crimes, massive breaches in social conduct and traitorous acts. Relative to the legal systems at the turn of the century in most nations, the Alperian legal system is quite simple (regarding court proceedings, since computers run a considerable deal of it) and gives law enforcement large amounts of power. The power is expected to keep citizens in line, however; any officer who abuses their power is subject to extreme penalties for misuse, which helps to assure the proper use of their authority. It is not uncommon for the few riots or other violent demonstrations that Alperia deals with to be dealt with by use of near-lethal force and psychological warfare to break mob mentality. Freedom of speech is upheld, however; the government has the right to blacklist or demand limited publication/distribution of things such as hate speech, dangerous documents like home bomb-making, and excessive or disturbing violence (not to say Alperians can\u2019t enjoy a good splatter film but some of the things that are probably indicative of the writer\u2019s/artist\u2019s mental illness can be controlled). Free speech zones are also established to protect the right of free speech while ensuring security at public events. Alperian citizens have a partial right to bear arms and are free to buy and own firearms assuming they have the proper qualifications and expertise and their government psych reports are cross-referenced with this right to make sure unstable citizens don\u2019t have access. One of Alperia\u2019s most bizarre legal practices however is that it does not recognize marriage if of its self, to the Alperian government marriage is a private, contractual matter between consenting adults and alone offers no special legal or tax benefits.Medicine:  Healthcare in Alperia is socialized due to its extremely low costs, seeing as how Alperian medical techniques are extremely advanced; with a heavy use of robotics, lasers, computer interfaces, and advanced techniques create a very high success rate for even the most invasive surgeries. The costs saved on labor due to computerization and resources due to general technological advancements mean everyone can afford all but the strangest operations. Organ cloning is also used often for critically damaged or infected organs, and most Alperian citizens over 40 have at least some cloned tissue (like skin, hearts, or livers). Some of the more \u201cextreme\u201d medical practices are a hallmark of Alperian living, the foremost is cybernetics, all Alperians born since around 2058 have a cybernetic implant installed in their cerebellum by the time they are 5 months, the semi-organic computer grows with the person throughout their lifetime and allows them to command electronics (like TVs, computers, or toasters) with thought. Older citizens can opt for accelerated growth implants too, free of charge. While the basic implant is provided free by the government, numerous upgrades are also offered for additional fees by numerous companies; including everything from compete photographic recall, to telepathy with other telepathically upgraded people (although that one is very rare). All Alperians are also injected with a \u201cdose\u201d of nanites during the cybernetic surgery; these nanobots also grow with the individual and maximize the efficiency of the body in every conceivable way, even the average Alperian will live a far greater span than the unagumented, and are faster, stronger, healthier and able to recover faster than citizens of any other nation. Advanced prosthetics are another option to a cloned body part (and rapidly surpassing said cloned organs in popularity), not to mention that voluntary non-emergency cybernetic replacements are getting more and more common with some people bordering on being post-humans with a near-addiction to cybernetic and genetic enhancement. On that note, genetic therapy is another popular science used to fix genetic conditions (or in some cases; enhance). En-Utero therapy which can fix everything from genetic disposition for shortsightedness to a weakness toward developing cancer is a highly popular option, often tests and \u201coperations\u201d are performed with the same percentage of parents wanting to know what gender their child will be in other nations. While Alperians prefer cybernetics to genetic modification; due to the stigma associated with genetics coming from the issues with the Infor, it\u2019s still a very powerful field capable of many brain-bending feats. The advanced medical system means that many from other countries often come to Alperia for treatment to cure particularly complex or unique ailments. White it may seem utopian, one must remember that Alperia is everything it is due to science and trade, a somewhat delicate balance if one looks at it the right way.Education:  A good education is considered the single most important thing a youth can be given during the informative years. Alperian schools are heavily state-funded and are given access to the absolute best resources available. Alperian children are given extensive grooming in math, the sciences, government, history, engineering and business/economics, while the arts and language are left to be considered basic forms of education; however language classes are taught until the 12th grade and most Alperians are taught numerous languages to stay competitive in the international field. Alperian colleges (mostly free to students) and standardized testing are set to what other nations might call \u201cinsanely\u201d high standards, however; Alperian students have the highest graduation ratio of any nation and are often considered the brightest in the world from their extensive education.Economy and Science:  Alperian economy is a \u201csocial market\u201d (which is to say, regulated capitalism) and based entirely on the export and production of high-quality, high-tech, and large scale industrial and domestic products. A number of the world\u2019s greatest scientific research firms are also based in Alperia, as the advancement of technology and science is considered paramount by the Alperian government, many companies base themselves out of Alperia for the sake of large benefits and tax breaks. The Alperian economy is one of the most successful in the world and Alperian citizens have the highest standard of living known. To say it bluntly (and save time) it can pretty much be said that Alperian are addicted to the advancement of technology and that most jobs are devoted to the advancement of some kind of technology. Alperia turns out a massive per-capita of scientists, doctors and engineers, who often find little issue getting a job employed in a firm either locally-based or for forigen branches. This is what has made Alperia what it is today and most Alperians see technological obsession to be the very hallmark of what makes an Alperian an Alperian.\n--Note: Alperians are the first (and currently only) to develop Smart AIs working off a dynamic memory-processor matrix, meaning they can not only be taught a vast wealth of information, but can learn and comprehend from their surroundings, and are able of thinking creatively. Much more common however are \"static intelligences\" (SI) which are much like conventional computers but have the advantage of very advanced GUIs, an exceptionally long list of parameters, and unusually-fast processing power. SIs can come close to duplicating the external performance of a true AI but are incapable of actually learning, only making slight adaptations to parameters within another set of parameters. SIs are given class names, with the first letter of the class dictating the intelligence based on a scale, with A being the \u201csmartest\u201d and Z being the \u201cdumbest\u201d (an Algonquin-class AI is faster and capable of more than a Gerald-class AI). SIs are found just about everywhere and are simply a part of Alperian society, government, and military; most households for example contain a variable-class AI to operate machinery and assist its occupants.Infrastructure:  Alperian cities are heavily engineered so that the aesthetics, efficiency and durability of a city are never compromised. Since a huge amount of Alperian land is covered in some kind of urban or suburban sprawl and mining facilities or factories, cities are designed to not only concentrate the high population comfortably; but also to look pleasing as most Alperians rarely get away from them. Alperian architecture tends to be highly organic in influence; sweeping slopes, curved shells, and (synthetic) stone rather than concrete pathways are all hallmarks of Alperian design. In stark contrast to the urban areas of other nations; Alperian cities have wide, spacious streets, well lit alleys, thoroughly cleaned buildings and roads, glittering high-rises, interconnected buildings, large parks and green spaces and extensive gardens and planted pathways. Alperia is also known for its mega-architecture and hyperstructures; with most of the world\u2019s largest and tallest buildings in the world calling Alperia their home (often by several orders of magnitude). Alperia has also dabbled in layered cities, pyramid-cities, and even orbital-elevator theories. High levels of energy efficiency are mandatory for building designs and often include features such as air purifying greenhouses on the roof, this coupled with extensive use of low-emission and renewable energy resources, fusion power plants, and an extremely well-funded mass-transit system (94% of Alperians make use of some PT system at least once a day) make Alperian air and ecology some of the purest (if you don\u2019t mind the heat). Factories, docks, some personal services and menial labor are mostly automated since most citizens are employed in business, R&D companies, engineering firms, or medical technologies/fields. The beauty of Alperian cities also functions as a tourist attraction, since the unique architecture; designed to look pleasing, is appealing to most visitors, even those from other industrialized nations/cities, and this somewhat compensates for the lack of natural wonders the mountainous and mostly arid land Alperia is located on offers. Apart from the above ground building; a number of buildings are built underground and a few cities are even built into the sides of mountains and extend throughout them (mainly port cities). As described in the Government and Geography system Alperia has mega-cities surrounded by the semi-urban-semi-suburban \u201cnetwork\u201d which are very wide clusters of vertically-constructed cities within eyesight of one-another. Most individuals live in the network, while being employed in mega-cities and commute via train to get to work each day. Mega-cities contain most of Alperia\u2019s business and industry while the network contains most of the livable space, entertainment, shopping and tourism.Foreign Policy and Trade:  Trade has always been important to Alperia and its export of the world's finest technological and electronic goods are what keep it at the top of the GDP charts. Alperia's primary exports are complex technological machinery, electronics, appliances, computers and software; Alperia also makes a considerable deal of money in the service industry as its scientific and engineering firms are often hired by other nations to perform problem solving or R&D. The nation's advanced space program and control of the asteroid-mining business also make Alperia a massive supplier of spcific rare minerals and services regarding orbital transport (such as satellite installing). Import-wise; Alperians are known for their consumption of earth-metals and luxury goods, along with assorted heavy machinery and equipment (primarily imported from the Protectorate). Alperia has always had a somewhat controversial foreign policy. Originally Alperia was a crusader; willing to go to war with any nation that threatened global stability or treated its citizens without basic dignity. As time changed however so did Alperia and its citizens, as Alperia grew into a technological, economic and scientific powerhouse bar none its citizens grew elitist and haughty and while even to this day support is offered around the world and Alperia will stand up for other\u2019s rights if necessary it is always done in subtly condescending way at best. Alperia also no longer will wage a war on principle and has grown obsessive with the proper channels and reasons for going to war, becoming ever-more withdrawn and beholden to rules. Alperia\u2019s most controversial choice however is their declaration of sovereignty over earth\u2019s orbit and space. With few exceptions, no nations are allowed anything but civic satellites and space travel is strictly prohibited unless under direct Alperian authorization. Alperia controls space and has done so for years under the premise of them protecting the world from its self, and that they are the only ones worthy of the power that is control of earth\u2019s orbit. As the co-founder of the Global Security Coalition, Alperia sees its self as the center of the modern world, and often uses that to its advantage, its massive economic and political sway combined with being the nation whose law-makers chartered over 90% of the original New Holstice Convention and the leader of the International Stability Council (the \u201cleaders\u201d of the whole GSC General Assembly, akin to the UN Security Council) means what it says usually passes with little issue, and with very little public opposition to its actions. This has led to many outside the GSC to state that Alperia is tyrannical\u2026an arguable point, however not one likely to be agreed upon by most of the long-term members publically or privately.Military:  The Alperian military has held the property of \u201cquality over quantity\u201d in high regard as it does with domestic products. Alperian soldiers are the best trained, equipped and prepared in the world, however; despite Alperia\u2019s massive defense budget and economy, the Alperian military\u2019s size remains disproportionately small, mainly due to the cost spent on each man. Alperian soldiers are recruited voluntarily but by an extremely stringent recruitment procedure.  Alperian infantry are a select group, with only an extremely small percentage of recruits actually getting their PCAS; due to the sheer cost of creating even a single infantry unit there are extensive genetic and physical, and psychological qualifications an infantryman must fill to be trained. Non-infantry are an entirely different group in the recruitment procedure altogether, as while many view the infantry with awe; they are terrified by exactly what they are. Alperian infantry have the longest overall training period of any nation by an incredible degree, often extending into over a year. This is nessecary due to the fact that all \"wetware platforms\" are operated by the Mk II \"Unliving Warrior\" System. Developed from the Titan NILSCE-program; the ULW transforms all of Alperia's operators into full post-human soliders, little more than a brain and life support locked away inside their armor until they perish in battle, feeling the world strictly through autosenses and simulated vision. Most Alperian infantry-applicants are non-citizens, critically wounded soliders, death-row inmates, even repeat-attempt suicide offenders who have been nonresponsive to treatment. All people either unable or unwilling to return to a normal life; or those so fanatically devoted to Alperia or one of the techno-cults that they feel a need to end their \"humanity\" in pirsuit of mechanical perfection. One of the most common type of applicants are Warpian infantry who are religiously devoted to war but are unable to fight due to severe wounds, they gladly tribute themselves to the Alperian war-machine in order to become \u201cAvatars of War\u201d as is the more zealous title for Alperian infantry given by their chaplains. For others it\u2019s a way to suffer death but to do something useful in death, to provide one last service; this is especially true due to the hefty stipends paid to the families of successful applicants. The one thing this motley crew all must share however is an unusually brilliant or quick-thinking mind and a high-degree of augmentation tolerance and spatial awareness. After the applicant is deemed to have the necessary attributes they are given a funeral and shipped off to undergo a \u201ccorpusectomy\u201d; the nickname for the removal of the body and the heavy upgrade of the remaining brain and stem with cybernetics and genetic enhancements. By the time the new \u201cSynth\u201d awakes, he/she will be 53% cybernetic at minimum\u2026depending on how much of the brain needed to be improved and the rest will be treated so as to think and react at factors far faster than any unaugmented mind and be incredibly resistant to concussive force. \u201cSynths\u201d; as they are known by the non-augmented infantry and bodyguards, then undergo anywhere between 10,000 and 12,000 logged simulator hours (in sleep-accelerated jaunts). Psychological training and conditioning is spaced between simulator runs; it seeks to enforce absolute loyalty to the military and Alperia; some call it \u201cbrainwashing\u201d but the fact of the matter is that it\u2019s a necessary security protocol; the synths are ultimately loyal to Athena, her assistant AIs and the High-Generals and will not take orders from anyone but them except in \u201cBlindman Orange\u201d scenarios. This training also seeks to reinforce proper use of the suit in combat as it defies normal evolutionary \u201csurvival logic\u201d (IE, forcing one\u2019s self to walk right into enemy fire) and a specially developed CQB \u201cmartial art\u201d specially designed for destroying enemy armor and disabling heavy weapons or fortified targets.\u00a0 Due to their connectivity the infantry exist outside normal force organization and have their own command structure. During their simulator runs, those who adopt the best to military tactics are given \u201cNCO\u201d positions; those with the best grasp on strategy are assigned as \u201cofficer\u201d platforms and assist the organic-officers in planning. One caveat however is that all infantry take to the field, no exceptions; however their command structure is incredibly shallow due to computer control and their linked \u201ccombat mind\u201d meaning a chain of command is far less important. There are only 4 ranks of infantry \u201cOperator\u201d, followed by \u201cNetwork,\u201d then \u201cCentury\u201d and \u201cCommand.\u201d \u201cSquads\u201d of infantry typically consist of only 3-4 wetware-platforms each with an entourage of several (up to a dozen) assorted autonomous combat drones slaved to the operator's thoughts. Command between operator and drone and operator and operator is reflexive, the simple command of \u201ctake out that bunker\u201d or \u201ctake cover from this inbound airstrike\u201d is as natural as picking up a glass of water and is accompanied by a myriad of IAWSL-supplied data that would be indecipherable to any other being. Operators are said to think in terms of pure data, even the thought of firing a weapon is accompanies by barrel heat, mechanical stress, ammo counts, accuracy so far, wind strength, projected accuracy, enemy concentrations, and millions of other bits of information; they know everything, they see everything. Drones are capable of performing actions on their own, basic problem-solving and a rudimentary grasp of tactics; but don\u2019t have initiative, requiring their sense-connected wetware platform to prove them with basic commands. After all surgery and sims are complete, a synth will be hooked into their PCAS for the first time and operate in a training platoon for 5 more weeks before being checked-out for active combat rotation. In essence, Alperian infantry become living dead; unspeaking, uncaring, unfeeling, merciless, faceless and unstoppable, and worthy of all the terror and fear this brings. (note: Alperian \u201cinfantry;\u201d which includes all forms of battlesuit users are often called \u201coperators\u201d rather than infantry since they sort of blur the line between actual infantry and AFVs, technically the official term is \u201cwetware-based combat platform\u201d) General education for non-infantry troops in both the army and breakers runs for around 22 weeks, the first 14 are spent learning basic military training exercises and going through typical regiments and the remaining time is spent on education in general warfare, Alperian enlisted are expected to be trained like the officers of most other nations. After basic the serviceman or woman will be sent to the appropriate \u201cuniversity\u201d whey they will learn the inside and out of their respective specialty. This can range from a few months for AFV crewmen to a year or more for advanced battlesuit engineers and mechanics (who typically will also require a previous college degree in something like mechanical or electrical engineering). Pilots and vehicle operators also undergo rather heavy cybernetic upgrades so they can \"link-into\" their vehicles while operating them, drastically increasing response time and operational effectivness as well as decreasing the crew requirements. This manifests in some as a sort of \"machine-empathy,\" those who adapt well to the treatments seem to be able to communicate with a vehicle's systems on a much deeper level than expected and are able to perform better diagnostics by feel alone than most dedicated computers. During basic training all servicemen are also given a rigorous physical and psychological regimen, along with a number of neurological-enhancing chemicals and upgrades to their neural implants to allow their brain to keep up with and efficiently control various pieces of interface technology and enhancing their ability to think clearly in battle, they are also given a diet high in calcium, ceramics, proteins, and metals; increasing their body\u2019s toughness, strength and ability to withstand fracture. Alperian psychological \u201ctraining\u201d seeks to harden them from the images of war, heavily reducing the potential for shell shock and PTSD and other damaging aspects of war that affect the mind. Alperian military units are thoroughly grounded in all manner of combat especially in desert and urban environments. On top of a heavily armored and extremely well-trained military; most weapons in Alperian military service are incredibly advanced compared to their contemporaries in other nations, featuring electronic scopes with links to HUDs, ammo counting systems, self-adjusting features, automatic cleaning, dynamic electronics and other advancements. Most Alperian weapons are railgun/gauss guns or are magnetically assisted in some way; this makes most Alperian weapons extremely dangerous at ranges far above the average. Alperian tanks and vehicles are designed along the lines as tanks like the Merkava IV or Leopard 2 (for design concepts); featuring heavily sloped/angled and multi-tier armor, and emphasizing on crew survivability. Alperian tanks are meant to mount dangerous high-velocity guns and are extremely fast for their size, if they ever actually manage to engage an enemy that can either outrange them or are too heavily armored, they will close ranges using superior mobility to outmaneuver enemy armor and exploit every weakness there is to offer. Alperian tanks also focus heavily on extremely advanced targeting computers and electronics, fire control systems, radar, sensors, autoloaders, and anti-missile defense systems. Advances in robotics also give UCAVs and UGVs a large support role in the military at large most companies have access to multiple automated support options, everything from automated bombing runs to airborne nanomachine camera clouds (usually dispersed by aircraft) are available. Most support vehicles for the military are also automated; vehicles such as medical transports and cargo/fuel transports are entirely automated as are most \u201cmindless\u201d support jobs such as the loading and unloading of cargo, rearming fightercraft and the like. One of Alperia\u2019s more controversial decisions is to make its military extremely impersonal; literally it is illegal to take pictures of any active Alperian combat serviceman or woman outside their combat uniform, which in ALL iterations (from pilots to tankers) will have a full-face helmet (normally for the HUD but also serves to conceal identity). Military parades will be done in battle armor, medal presentations will be done in combat dress, etc. It seeks to foster an air of the \u201cinhuman killing machine\u201d to Alperia\u2019s enemies (Alperians are big on psychological warfare). This is done to create fear, and Alperian infantry are the most infamous of all; known for being silent murder machines who stomp across the battlefield tearing apart anyone foolish enough not to run. While obviously the Alperian infantry have no problem with this, being not much more than organic CPUs for their armor, it can cause some pilots and tankers to suffer some resocalization issues, but the Alperian government has put a great deal of thought and resources into psychological care and support for discharged (and active) members of the military. While this is all a highly effective strategy in normal war, the impersonalization has come to bite Alperia in the butt a few times; mainly in dealing with insurgency in other countries, the faceless Alperian military giant does little to win over a populace quickly; often requiring the use of regulated PMCs to perform humanitarian and security ops.Military Doctrine:  Alperian military doctrine is all about the strike force. The Alperian military is small, or rather its number of frontline troops is relatively small for its size and military expenditures (in fact the whole Alperian military is huge, especially with every squad of PCAS troops having an even larger team of technicians, computer specialists, mechanics, engineers and comm operators devoted exclusively to its operation both on the battlefield and off). To counter this, it is extremely fast; apart from their superb infantry, Alperia has the most powerful and massive air force ever seen by man. Together they are capable of running circles around the enemy both strategically and tactically. In symmetrical warfare, Alperia uses its airforce to transport everything everywhere, the advent of the pulse engine allowed for cheap, high-capacity transportation of war material, a far cry from the normally extremley expensive air-transport of the fossil-fuels era. This alone gives the Alperian military a huge step-up in speed and ability to choose which battles it wants to fight and where. Alperian fighters are rare but tend to be able to clear hundreds of square miles of sky with a small handful, most air-to-air is actually handled by gunships; however if a squadron of Talons is ever actually deployed there\u2019s no chance any enemy aircraft will return to base as anything more than scrap. Gunships and heavy combat transports allow Alperia to dominate the land from the skies and avoid ground-focused defenses, meaning they can drop troops where they want and when they want, often right on the enemies heads or behind their lines. The second advantage is raw speed of heavy ground support, Alperian tanks and land-craft are also very fast, practically racecars of the armored world; meaning they are often not far behind an infantry and air strike. The Alperian military takes advantage of this to stage what is called a \u201cThree Hammers\u201d maneuver; the airforce and infantry go in first and systematically disable supply lines, emplacements, heavy anti-armor, etc. (Alperian strike fighters are usually the first of the first; sent in to disable heavy AAA). Then the armor shows up and proceeds to dislodge anything too troublesome for the infantry, then a second wave of infantry (mechanized infantry) moves in to perform clean-up and securing. All this combined with efficient \u201crecharging\u201d capability means that the Alperians can create an uninterrupted \u201crolling surge\u201d of their control all over the enemy lines, all over their country, and all over their strategic maps. The Alperian military is also renowned for its use of passive psychological and stealth warfare. The Alperian military tends to be perceived as a faceless monster, a brutal and efficient inhuman army that kills without pity or remorse\u2026which more or less has roots in reality when it comes to enemy combatants (Alperians are very proud of their precision and ability to inflict absolutely minimal civilian casualties). Therefore the mere presence of Alperians, especially their infantry tends to sap many men of a will to fight. On top of this, Alperian use of surveillance and active camouflage tech tends to induce huge amounts of paranoia; you never know what the Alperians might know, you don\u2019t know if they are watching you wiz behind a tree right now or that you\u2019re actually low on ammo, not to mention that the threat of constant ambushes do little to raise morale. Historically however; the Alperians really only use ambush warfare minimally, but just enough to keep the fear fresh in the minds of the enemy. The Alperian military has an extreme degree of branch-integration, this is to foster overall military unity, and allow specialization in tactics on the divisional and corps level. Any battle will see at the very least the Breakers, Army, and Air Force working closley side-by-side. The Breakers are designated shock troops, while they have associations with the Navy and are often compared to the Marines of other nations, they exist strictly for performing smaller operations than the Army or being the speartip of a full assault. While the Army will be off performing massed paradrops and general assault of say; and enemy city, the Breakers will be sectioned into independent battalions performing high-profile objectives that require speed and precision beyond even what the army can bear. It is the Breakers who will be securing capitol buildings, terminating artillery batteries or destroying ammo dumps while the Army does the overall heavy lifting. On that note; the Army is the main force of the Alperian Military and posesses far larger numbers of heavy armored vehicles and PCAS-variants than the Breakers, as it is their duty to be the most adaptable and general of the 3 land-deployment branches, capable of tacking any situation big or small and reinforce the Breakers or SpecOps if they run into a roadblock. The 2 Elite Assault Divisions; also known as the Stormtroopers capture this the most; and are known for being utterly unflappable troop sections that can and will fight anything, at any time, with any resources at the drop of a hat. Alperia is also unique in that its Special Forces are their own branch, culled entirely from the top precentile of recruits in the Breakers and Army, it is rare to see Special Forces deployed in a conventional warzone as they are often saved for independent deep-territory raids, counter-terrorism or high-profile target disposal; however when they are deployed one can expect them to leave a wake of corpses on their path to whatever target is deemed important enough for them. The Air Force and Navy are largley unchanged in role from any other, however the Alperian Air Force is known for being omnipresent, in many other militaries forces like the Army or Marines have their own fixed or rotary-wing aircraft, not so in Alperia; if it flies the Air Force are the sole group coordinating, repairing and operating it. This is to give the Air Force a more active role and allow them to be ultra-specialized in aerial warfare while the other branches have their own set-up. Even carrier-based aircraft are flown and operated by the Air Force who will have a contigent of their people aboard any aircraft-capable warship. It may be noted that recently, with Senate Bill H7-900-0I8-M and the \"New Directive for the Alperian Air Force\" in the military; that Alperia has started the slow process of nearly removing its navy entirely and downsizing its heavy ground forces (relativley minor downsizing) as a cost-cutting method due to the new Air-Fleet iniative. Alperia's airforce had begun to supplant the duties of much of the heavy ground-armor due to the gunships being able to mount dangerous autocannons and missile systems, not to mention armor far greater that pre-fault helicopter gunships while also able to maintain trans-sonic airspeeds and incredible agility. This is almost entirely in-part due to the pulse engine, as it allowed Alperia to also construct superheavy aircraft like the Condor gunship and C-27 Solar superlifter, due to the fact that they had high power-weight ratios (if not nessecaruly speed) and didn't burn fuel; simply needing electricity provided from microfusion cells or miniature fusion generators. Eventally the plan was put forward for the \"Air Fleets\", massive conglomerations of Peregrine gunships operating like an airborne armored lance. Eventually the numbers of active gunships skyrocketed as their effectiveness became apparent and unquestioned, the term \"air-fleet\" became more and more literal, as the huge Condor gunships and other heavy gunships began to operate in roles similar to naval command craft, leading \"task groups\" consisting of other aircraft. This proved to be so effective and cost-effecient that the government ran with it, decomissioning huge numbers of warships (which became less useful due to the pulse-engine granting week-long loiter times even at maximum energy draw) and drafting plans for literal flying warships (the P-series, listed in the \"Aerial Warships\" section) that would form a literal airborne fleet, the P-series coming in sizes, function and armament similar to naval cruisers, destroyers, frigates and even aircraft carrier and battleship analogues (while obviously the gunships provide fighter and escort-like jobs). These massive flying fleets are currently under construction; in unison with the decomissioning (mass-recycling) and reassigning of naval assets and personnel to the Air Force (this has caused endless amounts of grumbling). Eventually the Navy will consist of little more than a few submarines and some littoral combat vessels, all their former roles supplanted by the Air-Fleets, while several ground-elements are being decomissioned due to the Air Force's newfound ability to perform almost any role whatsoever. The Alperian military seeks to win wars fast by dismembering and decapitating the enemy with pinpoint strikes on vulnerable or vital areas and facilities; let them wither on the vine so that either they or an ally (such as the Protectorate) can destroy the weakened and piecemeal forces that are left over. The aim is to bypass unimportant or heavily fortified areas; to punch into the chest of the enemy and rip the heart straight out. Information and very fast supply chains are the key to the Alperian military\u2019s success. Alperian supply chains have to be well-protected and very efficient due to the fact that their military literally operates entirely on stretched-out lines (although the enemy is usually too busy with other forces or too weak due to their strikes to fight back effectively). Information is key because Alperia is a maneuver force, every unit needs to know exactly where it needs to be, when it needs to be and time quotas for actions are essential. Therefore; the Integrated Advanced Warfighter Networked Command Link was created; a marvel of modern military information technology. The IAWNCL may be considered the greatest achievement in military history, along with the invention of steel, the bow, the firearm and the armored vehicle. There is literally nothing it can\u2019t do for each and every single solider, pilot or driver. Managed by the two Smart-AI; Athena and Ares, the IAWNCL is a constant influx of information from billions of sources, all the sensors and cameras on each tank, aircraft, transport, PCAS, battlesuit, satellite, even the AIs projections themselves, assorted automated sensor networks and unmanned vehicles contribute data on enemy sightings, incoming fire, suspected enemy locations, artillery both friendly and hostile and where it will land, projected explosive radii, flight paths for enemy gunships and friendly aircraft, the list is endless. Data is shared through combined satellite uplinks and peer-to-peer wireless networking along multiple different encryptions and transmission wavelengths. This generates a flawless 3-dimentional view of the battlefield where anything that is known by one is known by all. Every single Alperian troop can access all this data. This allows infantry to literally call massive blankets of artillery fire on themselves and slowly walk through the maelstrom of fireballs because they know exactly where every computer-guided shell is going to land, how big its casualty radius is and what sort of crater it will leave. Tankers can see the location of a sniper picked up by a PCAS\u2019s sonic sensors and level his building through several blocks with perfect accuracy. Gunship pilots can get precise locations of everything and everyone anyone knows about with an anti-air system, their threat rating and what angles they can see at. A PCAS with all its cameras and sensors blinded can still operate by using the IAWNCL to generate an environment based on what is known. And these are just naming a few uncreative uses. The IAWNCL also acts as a decentralized processor for units to calculate their own cannon shots or missile flightpaths; cross-referenced with other units, this allows maximum firing efficiency. This also gives commanders unprecedented battle control, a general in a command bunker can get a holographic overview of a battlezone with perfect up-to-date locations of all Alperian units and all known enemy units, even things like how many rounds they have fired, time to rearming or their performance in the battle so far. Commanders can simply point and squads can get waypoint data for their next objective. As said, the applications are endless and the IAWNCL is the epitome of information distribution technology, allowing the military to act with clean, cohesive, and efficient machine-like precision.Military Organization Active Alperian Land-operations Military Divisions  Army:\n--1st Elite Assault Division (CO: Major General Thurmore) \u201cReapers\u201d\n--2nd Elite Assault Division (CO: Major General Luevano) \u201cThe Reborn\u201d\n--1st Elite Armored Division (CO: Major General Lang) \u201cThe First\u201d\n--22nd Airborne Infantry Division (CO: Major General Bryant) \u201cBlood Hawks\u201d\n--27th Airborne Infantry Division (CO: Major General Sennis) \u201cAlpha Squadron\u201d\n--86th Airborne Infantry Division (CO: Major General Marshall) \u201cShrieking Doom\u201d\n--9th Infantry Division (CO: Major General Zambrano) \u201cDivision Primus\u201d\n--53rd Mechanized Division (CO: Major General Carson) \u201cSilent Scream\u201d\n--12th Mechanized Division (CO: Major General Zimmerman) \u201cDesert Warriors\u201d\n--98th Dedicated Mechanized Division (CO: Major General Meyer) \u201cValkyrie\u2019s Wrath\u201d\n--117th Heavy Armored Division (CO: Major General Thamos) \u201cTitan\u2019s Fist\u201d\n--156th Armored Division (CO: Major General Lees) \u201cSundering Hammer\u201d\n--331th Armored Division (CO: Major General Wegmeyer) \u201cLightning Bolts\u201d Breaker Corps:\n--1st Breaker Division (CO: Major General Pendelman) \u201cSea\u2019s Fury\u201d\n--2nd Breaker Division (CO: Major General Richelieu) \u201cDreaded\u201d\n--3rd Breaker Division (CO: Major General Kent) \u201cIron Gauntlets\u201d\n--4th Breaker Division (CO: Major General Blaisdell) \u201cMarines\u201d\n--5th Amphibious Armored Division (CO: Major General Perry) \u201cDreadnoughts\u201d\n--14th Shock Division (CO: Major General Galic) \u201cGrinders\u201d Special Operations:\n--STAS counter-terrorism unit\n--Special Operations Task Group\n----Elite Special Forces Operational Detachments (Alpha through Kappa)\n--Observation and Information Attainment Force\n--12th Strike RegimentMajor Active Alperian Air Force Commands  Air-Fleet Operations and Control Command (CO: General Robitaille)\n---1st Heavy Assault Air-Fleet (CO: Lt.

Currently the PCAS-238 is the standard-issue armor of the Alperian army, the Breakers use the PCAS-102 and its variants due to their need for increased mobility, and the 102 still sees occasional use in the army in specialized formations. However, as a whole; the total number of active PCAS-102s is very small, replaced by the 238 and heavy battlesuits. The torso keeps much of the same aesthetic found in the \u201clesser\u201d PCAS models (albeit several times larger and far more broad and deep); being heavily plated, angular and possessing an unnerving lack of any humanity but trades the two normal \u201cballerina\u201d legs for an X-shaped quadrupedal layout, each of the 4 legs possessing 3 joints (including the root joint) and resembling segmented slabs of metal; broad and stable. For terrain navigation and weight distribution the legs are tipped in a \u201cfoot\u201d consisting of 6 independently articulating multi-jointed pads spaced evenly in a hexagon-shape, each of the \u201ctoes\u201d can rotate 270 degrees and has extending phalanges on each of its edges, both for grasping objects (such as rock outcroppings) or to increase surface area for stability on soft ground. Much like the Fenrir battlesuit, the 238 is also capable of rapid travel via the tracks mounted on the undersides of its legs; allowing it to rapidly cover open ground. The upper torso is split into the primary and secondary hulls, the primary hull being the main hull that attaches to the leg nexus; where the operator is located along with most electronics, power subsystems and computer mainframes as well as the first arm socket on each side. The secondary hull is located further back and set up slightly higher than the primary (called the \u201cbackpack\u201d by foreign troops for its location and general shape), the secondary hull contains most of the modular ammo bins, feed devices, a few of the microfusion cells, the main heat distributors and the second pair of arms (these arms are slightly longer and are therefore parallel with the forward arms). The 4 manipulator arms are located with one folded along the back of the secondary hull and the remaining three folding into armored compartments on the front of the primary hull, these arms are more \"conventional\" robotic, 4-jointed arms with a 3-fingered, \"claw\" hand capable of dragging and lifting heavy objects. The 4 fine manipulators are collapsed inside ports on the side of the secondary hull and resemble a highly-segmented metallic tentacle that can extend over 20 feet in length, these arms are tipped with smaller and smaller, recursive, microfine \"fingers\" that can integrate with machinery, operate keyboards, and even perform delicate battlefield surgery or repair work. Pulse engine modules are located through the armor; mostly on the underside of the leg nexus and in the crevice under the secondary hull with control/maneuvering jets coming out of and sweeping back from the primary hull. Armored finer than any other battlesuit before it and possessing the absolute newest in defensive, offensive and terrain-navigation hardware and software the 238 is the ultimate vision of the Alperian military, however it had one problem\u2026its massive size and weight make it impossible to enter buildings without demolishing them and while automatic fire could be emptied into a building to clear hostiles or a smart-grenade fired through a window; which is both inaccurate and prone to possible civilian casualties. In response and in-keeping with Alperian demand for absolute military precision the PCAS-238 was designed to be a drone carrier; able to deploy not only clouds of nanomachine cameras but also a trio of small, flying helicopter-like Q-8b drones and a single UG-1a ground drone in event of a squads isolation from its more typical slaved platforms. The Q-8b is a small, skeletal, folding tri-rotor craft armed with accurate and silent 5.7mm flechette packs and weighing no more than 25 lbs, capable of flitting around a battlefield to spy on individuals inside buildings and take out targets hidden in possibly sensitive areas. The UG-1a is demonstrably larger and heavier, weighing closer to 220 lbs and resembling an over-fed scorpion with a high-powered 10.1mm machine gun mounted on its \u201ctail\u201d and possessing two large hydraulic arms capable of bashing open doors and breaking bones while 6 nimble legs allow it to scale buildings and overcome most obstacles. The UG-1a can also carry wounded troops, defuse bombs, weld and perform other duties tangential to its parent (even if the 238\u2019s manipulator arms are capable of this and more). Both of these drones can fold up into smaller packages, with the Q-8s fitting into sockets on the secondary hull and the UG-1 latching to the underside of the main leg joint in an armored compartment.Conventional powered armors  GKMS-10 mk. I\nClassification: Extreme mobility bodyguard armor\nMaterial: Ionic Electroactive Polymer Liquid Armor\nWeight: 306 lbs.\nStrength Augmentation: +3,000 lbs.\nRunning speed: 73 mph\nDrive type: Polymer muscle bundles arranged correspond to human muscle groups.\nProtection Rating: V\nProtection coverage: Entire body, helmet covers entire head\nPower source: Photovoltaic bioelectric battery\nDescription: Alperian power armor and battlesuits have a history of being bulky to say the least and are often unable to enter bunkers or field command centers and are not considered acceptable company around visiting dignitaries due to being giant lumps of metal and guns. As a response the GKMS-10 was developed to give a bodyguard or base-guard force unparalleled defensive and offensive capability wrapped in a package no larger than your average human. A pitch-black muscle suit constructed from though strips of brutanium over carbon nanoweave armor, covering a plethora of reactive polymer muscles corresponding to human muscle groups. A trained solider inside a suit can out-sprint a car, crush steel with his hands and climb the world\u2019s tallest building without issue, so great are its physical capabilities that only an Alperian solider could operate it; for without the armored bones, stronger connective tissue and a deep-tissue neural implant to control it the wearer would be crushed into a pool of blood within moments. Apart from the heavy body implants the suit requires another key feature to operate; the wearer has to train extensively with the static intelligence that inhabits the suit and will share the processing load while in-combat. Since these troops are not the lobotomized super-infantry that makes up the battlesuit force, they cannot be upgraded to the point that they can process the telemetry from the suit\u2019s myriad of sensors and processors; the SI needs to \u201chijack\u201d primary motor control in order to allow the wearer to keep up. This however takes serious physiological and physiological training, without it; the wearer could go psychotic, fall into a coma or just lock-up and be unable to move their limbs. This is combined with a somewhat dangerous \u201cdilator\u201d which combined synthetic adrenaline and a cocktail of classified chemicals which use the adrenaline as an accelerant. Active; it allows the \u201cuser\u201d to experience sensations a thousand times faster than a normal human, able to see (and therefore react) to circumstances and events before the action is even completed. The \u201cdilator\u201d is standard equipment for battlesuit operators (but even then it used sparingly), but for a relatively normal human it is extremely toxic and can only be used for extremely brief periods before it builds up scarring in the neurological system, however that limited time is often all the GKMS\u2019s wearer needs. At the end of the procedures the resulting individual is seemingly omnipotent; the suit has numerous radar, ladar, hypersonic and sonic sensors, trajectory and enemy weapon monitoring features that allow the wearer to literally be aware of the locations of every single person in a 100 yard radius, their psychological condition, any weapons they may possess, where their weapons are pointed and where their bullets will go. This allows bodyguards to seemingly doge bullets by placing themselves ahead of time to avoid most fire, with the suit absorbing the bits of small arms fire that makes it past. To an outside observer they move at superhuman speeds and fight with a fluid grace that is inhuman, neutralizing dozens of targets in seconds without pause. Most typically the GKMS is worn under a tailored suit with leather gloves intended to hide the armor's intimidating physique; leaving only the seamless, black polymer helmet visible.

While certainly no less advanced than any other piece of Alperian military equipment, the Surtr has a lot less of the \u201cfrills\u201d found on the more advanced battlesuits while also integrating several cost-effective features not found on those. The armor\u2019s expense to performance ratio is impressive, one of the ways this is accomplished is by having fewer weapons integrated into the system or by having those that are being modular and disposable (like the missile pods). The modified GSAS-10 gatling gun also cuts down on costs and has proven to have superior \u201cergonomics\u201d over designs that feature all-integrated weapons. The armor is incredibly agile for its size, able to run, jump, mantle, and manuver at incredible speeds; to bolster this is has also been given a Nidhoggr-derived jump system that vastly increases mobility in both open-combat and urban areas. In the end the Surtr captures the feel of a giant infantryman while providing the firepower of a squad for a comparable cost. The suit actually having detailed hand actuators means that the Surtur fills a secondary role in utility and repair work, hauling around and loading bombs onto aircraft or helping to perform heavy field repairs on tanks. Nidhoggr Demolition Armor\nClassification: Combat engineering and CQC battlesuit\nMaterial: Classified\nWeight: 20.2 tons\nSize: 16.4 feet\nOperators: 1\nStrength Augmentation: 176 tons\nSpeed: 48 mph, jump jets allow for extremely rapid bursts of speed into the air or horizontally\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nProtection Rating: Classified (far tougher than any PCAS variant or most vehicles)\nPower source: Microfusion cell racks\nWeaponry:\n-Specialized forearm-mounted chainsaws\n-Arm-mounted heavy flamethrowers\n-Demolition tape dispenser\n-Left shoulder-mounted 25mm GSAS-15 Komodo; 3-barreled rotary gauss cannon\n-Palm-integrated canister guns\nDescription: The Nidhoggr is a specially designed demolition armor that can also be used in close quarters combat. The primary weapons (really tools) on the suit are a pair of massive forearm-mounted vibro-chainsaws that allow it to cut through foliage, masonry, concrete, metals and solid stone like paper; the chainsaws also are capable of being superheated a series of jets (similar to a plasma cutting torch) along the length of the track allowing it to slice through dense metals and even tank armors with relative ease. These jets can only be activated for short periods of time due to the stress it places on the blade.\nOther tools such as flamethrowers used for burning down foliage and buildings, and the demolition tape dispensers allow it to place patches of various explosives for use in bringing down buildings, creating booby traps and blowing holes in tanks. The Nidhoggr is often also used for bomb-disposal, in-field repairs on armored vehicles and general construction tasks. Widely considered one of the most utilitarian armors in Alperian service; the Nidhoggr\u2019 equipment and \u201ctoolbox\u201d of hand attachments allow it to fill near-countless roles.\nAs much as the Nidhoggr is a multi-purpose 2nd-line engineering suit, it is a heavy combat armor; its flame throwers can light enemies aflame and the chainsaws and massive strength permit it to carve through enemy armor and messily slice through organic targets. The Nidhoggr is slightly slower, a bit clunker and harder to use than most of the other battlesuits but is heavily armored and extremely hardened so that it can survive massive impacts and the force of falling debris; making it frighteningly durable against enemy fire. The Nidhoggr also has numerous advanced physics projection computers, allowing it to take into account the result(s) of any action tasked by the operator, allowing for maximum efficiency in demolition. Nidhoggr\u2019 are typically issued at least 2 per tank battalion, in mechanized companies (most all Alperian infantry companies are mechanized) they are typically attached to weapons platoons (some platoons can have none, and others up to 3), with a few issued to rifle platoons and then the remainder put into exclusively Nidhoggr; Assault Engineer Squads. Hati Stealth Armor\nClassification: Commando battlesuit\nMaterial: Classified\nWeight: 14.4 tons\nSize: 16.1 feet\nOperators: 1\nStrength Augmentation: 254 tons\nSpeed: 63 mph\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nProtection Rating: Classified\nPower source: High-output ion cells and microfusion cell racks\nWeaponry:\n-1x shoulder-mounted 8-round TUA8 anti-armor missile pod\n-1x shoulder-mounted 75mm gauss mortar\n-1x left-forearm-mounted AII-303H 14.7mm gauss minigun\n-Cases for explosive charges storage\n-Generally modular design allows for easy altering from the standard payload\nDescription: Almost a paradox, the concept of a 16 foot tall robot running around like a ninja blowing up bases seems quite farfetched, which is exactly why the Hati was built the way it was; hoping to keep \u201cinformation\u201d of it reduced mostly to rumor or the \u201cdelusions\u201d of survivors left in its wake. Cloaked with the finest stealth technology Alperia possesses, the medium-sized battlesuit is capable of infiltrating in teams of 3 (the typical deployment number) into an enemy base...then proceed to rip into shreds so fine that you\u2019d need a magnet to find them. Using Alperian 3rd generation optical camouflage, sonic nullifiers, thermal countermeasures, and a plating of RADAR and ultraviolet-absorbing material mean the suit is all but completely undetectable to even the most advanced security measures. While a \u201csimple\u201d niche battlesuit of limited use, the battlesuit is extremely good at its specialized function and is projected to be extremely good at wreaking havoc behind enemy lines. Much like the Surtur and Nidhoggr, the Hati has articulate hands capable of performing utility work if pressed. Valkyrie Support Armor\nClassification: High-mobility airborne warfare battlesuit\nMaterial: Classified\nWeight: 26.1 tons\nSize: 20.6 feet\nOperators: 1\nStrength Augmentation: 133 tons\nSpeed: 31 mph running, 1951 mph flight speed\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles w/ articulated pulse thrusters\nProtection Rating: Classified\nPower source: Miniaturized nuclear fusion reactor supplemented by high-output ion cells\nWeaponry:\n-6x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pods implanted into the \u201cwings\u201d\n-4x AGM-214 multi-purpose guided missile pods mounted on shoulder and back\n-2x arm-mounted 2 MW point-defense lasers\n-Hand-held M730/x 17mm ultra-velocity, void-spaced gauss sniper cannon\n-DEMP device, chest-mounted (designed as an anti-missile system)\n-Joint-mounted defensive \u201cfrag-packs\u201d\nDescription: Nicknamed the \u201cAngel of Death,\u201d in an extremely short time this new model among the 3rd generation of Alperian battlesuits has grown to be one of the most popular devices among military commanders since the bullet. The Valkyrie is elegant, sleek, and almost calming, many have called it a work of art; the epitome of Alperia\u2019s mastery of war as an artform. Alone the battlesuit is beautiful, a near 21 foot tall stylized human form, however; the armor was designed for flight and accomplishes this with 6 graceful vectoring pulse engines shaped like great bird wings, overall this generates as appearance of an angel, one loaded to the teeth with firepower.\nThe Valkyrie was designed with flight being its primary mode of transportation, although the Ymir battlesuit is flight-capable it lacks grace and it still a ground-pounder, merely using its pulse rockets to quickly move about the battlefield, the Valkyrie is the exact opposite, out of its element on the ground, it can perform near impossible maneuvers and is nearly a ballet dancer in the air, using kinetic suspension fields developed for spacecraft to prevent the operator from being liquefied during insane maneuvers that would shred the airframe of most aircraft. The armor is designed to neutralize strike fighters, bombers, helicopter gunships and the like while also having potent ground-attack abilities as a support option. The suit also provides battlefield surveillance, using its multitudes of highly sensitive scanners and sensors to supply a wealth of data to the IAWNCL network.\nThe Valkyrie\u2019 primary armament is its immense M730/x gauss rifle, using some of the densest gauss coils found on Alperian weaponry, it can accelerate a 17mm slug to absolutely ludicrous speeds, so fast in fact that the slugs have to be made out of solid lathanium jacketed with brutanium and specially reinforced to prevent disintegration after leaving the barrel. The weapon can even punch holes in Protectorate superheavy tanks and will nearly vaporize lightly armored vehicles (such as aircraft). Supporting this weapon are numerous missile weapons and a pair of wrist lasers used at close range to conserve missile and rifle ammunition. The AGM-214 missiles are fairly typical multi-role thermobaric missiles effective against most targets and the ATY-6s consist of hundreds of micro-missiles stored in the \u201cwings\u201d effective against infantry and used as decoys for the more dangerous AGM-214s.\nSecondary to its combat role, the Valkyrie fulfills its namesake by also acting as a \"combat medic\" for critically damaged battlesuits; its ideal for ripping the brain-core out of demolished battlesuits, allowing them to be recycled into new suits. The suit is currently quite rare, second only to the Kraken in lack of numbers, however demand for the suit nearly surpasses the Ymir; ensuring that the future will be populated with plenty of these \u201cAngels of Death\u201d soaring over battlefields. Jormungand Assault Armor\nClassification: High-endurance assault battlesuit\nMaterial: Classified\nWeight: 37.7 tons\nSize: 23.4 feet\nOperators: 2\nStrength Augmentation: 210 tons\nSpeed: 57 mph\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nProtection Rating: Classified\nPower source: Miniaturized nuclear fusion reactor\nWeaponry:\n-2x twin-linked F-22 heavy plasma-based laser cannons, arm-mounted\n-2x shoulder-mounted Zeus-pattern \u201cmass-output\u201d plasma cannons\n-4 chest-mounted 1 MW lasers\nDescription: Considered a cheaper and in some ways more-effective version of the Ymir battle armor, this 3rd generation Alperian battlesuit is geared toward destroying heavily fortified defenses and armored units. Formerly the tallest battlesuit in production (now the tallest bipedal one), the Jormungand is also known as the \u201cArchdemon\u201d (in dichotomy to the angelic look of the Valkyrie) for its understandably frightening look based on heavy samurai O-yoroi armor and the accompanying menpo and kabuto. Lacking any form of flight or jump jets, which had to be traded for heavily reinforced and thickened armor, the battlesuit is still rather quick on its feet and can quickly close range with any target; not that it needs to. The Jormungand is a platform for numerous long-range plasma-based laser cannons, plasma guns and other energy weapons. The massive, overcharged fusion reactor that had to be moved into a large container on the suit\u2019s back is stretched to its limit providing power to the weapon systems. The high-focus plasma cannons and the directed nature of the lasers mean that the Jormungand has little for targeting large numbers of targets at once but is well calibrated to march through a battlefield turning armored vehicles into melted shells (the jury is still out on if using the lasers to punch through multiple clustered infantry counts as \u201ccrowd control\u201d). Although not modular in nature, the Jormungand\u2019s weapon systems are easily removed and repaired, this could lead to other variants being produced in the near future. While considered a \u201ccheap\u201d version of the Ymir, the armor is well respected by its operators and none can deny its effectiveness against armored targets. Ymir Battle Armor\nClassification: Extreme endurance assault battlesuit\nMaterial: Classified\nWeight: 41.2 tons\nSize: 20.3 feet\nOperators: 2\nStrength Augmentation: 356.8+ tons\nSpeed: 62 mph running, 416 mph flight speed\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nProtection Rating: Extreme (surpasses most known tanks)\nPower source: Miniaturized nuclear fusion reactor\nWeaponry:\n-Palm-mounted plasma arc manipulators\n-Directed electromagnetic pulse weapon\n(Apart from the above weapons, the Ymir has an ultra-variable weapons selection as detailed below)\nDescription: The poster-boy of Alperia's heavy battlesuits, the Ymir was the first developed, and while the newest mark of the armor is a far cry from its first iteration, it has lost no effectiveness since. The Ymir was designed as assault armor, and it does that with devotion; impeccably armored yet fast, flight-capable (to the extent \u201cflight\u201d can be applied to the grace of a semi-guided missile) and armed with an advanced modular weapons system that allowed Ymir teams to adapt to any situation or enemy on the fly. Originally the Ymir was built around a large \u201carmory\u201d carried by a specialized UAV assigned to a Ymir squad; when a rearm or overhaul was needed the craft would locate the squad and drop down so the weapon systems could be reconfigured or rearmed. However this suffered from a weak-link in the form of the UAV itself; as the Ymir is designed to operate at the very tip of the spear and would therefore often be unable to actually access its great armory. While the Ymir is one of the toughest battlesuits and possessed insane firepower no-matter the loadout; it defeated the purpose of a hyper-modular system in the long run. As Alperia\u2019s nanotech mastery advanced however the solution became apparent; the Ymir should be able to manufacture its own ammunition and weaponry on the fly using battlefield wreckages, scrap and debris fed into an onboard nanofabricator. While plans were startlingly expensive; the Ymir was a beloved armor that had grown to be loved by commanders and allied troops alike, it was as much a symbol as a weapon but had grown incapable of keeping up with the newest battlesuits so it was proposed that the new mark of the armor be an almost complete overhaul. The final design called for a back-mounted nanofabrication plant, resembling a \u201cfanny pack\u201d on the humanoid battlesuit (located beneath the massive ammo bins), with 4 connectivity points for weapon systems located on the forearms and \u201cshoulders\u201d of the Ymir. Building tentacles, micro and macro-constructors and nanite emitters remain hidden when not in use, but can quickly be found writhing around their respective build sites when a weapon needs to be deconstructed and repurposed or repaired. While the localized nanofabs keep the weapons operable, the back-mounted plant produces ammunition needed for the weaponry then shunts it to the hoppers. With a steady supply of ammunition, and polymorphic linkless feed chutes the battlesuit can supply almost any classification of projectile, chemical or even energy weapon (if supplied from the main reactor). While the ability to shuffle though hundreds of different weapons\u00a0 on a whim, constructed from collapsible and flash-manufactured parts would be enough for most, it was considered only the beginning for the Ymir\u2019s engineers; who at the behest of the AI Enyo, took it one step further. The Ymir was granted the ability to literally rip enemy weapons emplacements apart and take the weaponry and technology onto its self. The Ymir (using brute strength) can say; rip the main gun of an enemy (or allied) tank out and using the repair tentacles, temporarily attach it to a hardpoint. Electronics are supplied energy by flash-manufactured, compatible conduits; computers (such as integrated fire-control systems) are cracked by adaptive viral intrusion (hand-written by Enyo); and ammo is supplied by the nanofab when supplied even the wreck of a compatible round fed back into the nanofab\u2019s maw. State-of-the art computers and programs make this all possible, as they are able to pick apart every aspect of a weapon\u2019s machinery using the connection-tendrils to \u201cfeel\u201d the weapon and active hyperspectral scans, then coalesce that data into a method to make the weapon useable without it exploding. This whole feature was added to the armor because the nanofabbed weapons, while effective tend to be fragile; and sometimes your opponent is just using a good piece of equipment not in the nanofab\u2019s blueprint database. In-practice the method has also been applied to armor ripped from destroyed enemies, and Ymir often tear plating from enemy armor to increase their own already incredible survivability; creating a horrific golem of blackened metal and shattered composites; daring any to come make it pay for the destruction it has wrought. As an ensemble, the Ymir is more than able to keep up in the modern battlefield and is often described as a sort of grisly, mechanical trophy-taker; headhunting weaponry and gear from the strongest enemy units. Operators (chosen from the absolute best and most aggressive of the PCAS-operators) are known for deliberately hunting down elite detachments and dangerous armor columns in order to add their weapons and armor to the suit. Fenrir Artillery Armor\nClassification: Heavy fire-support battlesuit\nMaterial: classified\nWeight: 58.11 tons\nSize: 24.8 feet\nOperators: 2\nStrength Augmentation: N/A\nSpeed: 34 mph walking, 131 mph with Lucius tread drives\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nProtection Rating: Classified (known for making the Ymir look poorly-armored)\nPower source: Miniaturized nuclear fusion reactor\nWeaponry:\n-2x 5-gun FI/W-h-20c medium plasma-based laser rotary cannons (5 guns mounted together sharing simultaneous recharge, increases RoF considerably)\n-2x 105mm scram-gauss cannons\n-4x 20-round Mk. II dumb-fire rocket pods\n-2x 8-round TOC-1 multi-purpose guided missile launchers\n-2x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pods\n-2x 10.1mm machine guns\n-1x AnAusGes AA missile system (back mounted)\nDescription: One of the most ludicrously armed units in the Alperian military, the Fenrir is to Alperian battlesuits what the PCAS-110 model is to the standard PCAS-102. Technically speaking the Fenrir is a \u201chybrid vehicle-battlesuit\u201d as its unique 4-legged form goes against conventional battlesuit design, plus its ability to \u201clie down\u201d on its legs and quickly travel with the treads implanted in their undersides makes it more like an AFV that can walk than a normal battlesuit. The Fenrir\u2019s torso is also inhumanoid and was only given legs for rough terrain navigation in urban warfare and is thus expected to spend most of its time in \u201ctank form\u201d where it has superior speed. While still extremely heavily armored, the Fenrir sacrifices armor (or potential for armor) for firepower and is therefore one of the most frightening battlesuits currently in production; able to saturate an area in a blanket of laser, rocket, missile and cannon fire until nothing remains. The Fenrir uses several new or prototype designs in its weapons, such as the rotary laser cannons which help laser weapons compensate for their normally abysmal rate of fire or the lightweight gauss cannons which use a new series and layout of superconducting magnets. The Fenrir was built to provide support to Surtur battlesuit teams, mechanized infantry, and if-able 1st-phase Alperian air-assaults. One of the most expensive battlesuits (rivaling the Ymir) due to its extensive use of extremely light-weight nanoalloys, the Fenrir is nonetheless one of the most cost-efficient armors in the Alperian military. Kraken Specialist Armor\nClassification: Amphibious warfare/ambush battlesuit\nMaterial: Classified\nWeight: 22.1 tons\nSize: 9.0 feet (operator pod)\nOperators: 1\nStrength Augmentation: N/A\nSpeed: 52mph \u201cslithering\u201d, 60 knots underwater (with cavitation)\nDrive type: Magnetic electric pulse motors supplemented by high-tensile metal fibers, magnetohydraulic propulsors when underwater\nProtection Rating: Classified\nPower source: Miniaturized nuclear fusion reactor\nWeaponry:\n-Up to 8 externally-mounted TOC-88U underwater-capable multi-purpose guided missiles\n-3x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pods\n-2x F-13 light plasma-based laser cannons\n-Storage bay for explosive demolition charges\nDescription: The Kraken is another entry in the list of entirely inhumanoid battlesuits, greatly resembling its namesake and consisting of a central bullet-shaped operator pod to which 8 smaller metallic tentacles much like an octopus or squid (these are roughly 7 inches in diameter and can extend up to 24 feet) and 2 larger arms (roughly a foot in dimater and 30 feet long) are attached underneath. The arms are covered in numerous retractable \u201ctools\u201d; including micro-fine blades, adhesive patches for climbing, ultra-hot torches, laser-cutters and small manipulator tentacles. The Kraken is somewhat obviously designed for naval/amphibious warfare; quickly zooming toward a target, climbing up the sides of enemy ships and tearing them apart, or latching to submarines and cracking their hulls. One of Alperia\u2019s more exotic battlesuits, the Kraken is also covered in extensive optical camouflage but also integrates prototype miniaturized phase-prism hologram projectors like the Thundershock tank allowing it to also infiltrate positions from the sea and perform sabotage or information gathering. Perfect for ambushes and shock-attacks due to this; the Kraken is ideal for leading amphibious assaults in the few cases Alperia uses them, often going ashore long before the invasion even arrives to assist in weakening any sort of costal defense. For these same reasons it is exceptionally good at destroying warships; it can silently scale the sides then appear on deck, destroying comm equipment, weapons batteries, crushing the bridge, etc. before demolishing it with explosive charges. The battlesuit is also unique in that it requires a very special mind to operate, one that is fluid and capable of using the squid-like body both underwater and on land, a strangely rare attribute; and as such the program has an incredibly large drop-out rate.

II Unliving Warior system. Like the ULW; the Titan is a giant combat platform which contains the life support and uplink systems for a disembodied human brain, originally a proof of concept that would not be applied to the mainline Alperian force for several decades the first bearers of the armor were war heroes, generals and other extremely valuable military staff. If critically injured beyond saving, these individuals were offered a chance to have their heads removed and put into \u201cstasis\u201d using a specialized blend of nanites and chemicals. Later they would have their brains removed and installed into the Titan chassis, serving as their new body. However, unlike modern battlesuit pilots or even Alperian infantry from the past decade they lack excessive neuro-cybernetic enhancements and therefore cannot even come close to using the armor to its maximum potential as they can. In recent upgrades to the system however; the addition of a static intelligence was found to provide the necessary boost in combat performance. The original chassis was much like the earliest models of the Ymir; heavy armored and possessing modular weaponry but lacking the former\u2019s ability for flight since the suit was designed to perform a more \u201cceremonial\u201d and morale-centric role on the frontline; empowering Alperian troops by being a shining beacon of warfare. As Alperian troops started to more closely resemble machines in thought and purpose however, the Titans were reassigned to \u201coutreach\u201d and pure-command roles as military ambassadors, spokesmen, advisors/generals and advertisers of the Alperian military, it was they who came to represent the Alperian military and its strength on the global stage. To facilitate this change in role; the formerly irremovable brain in the Titan was granted the ability to leave in the form of a much more human-sized and shaped android that could interact at a more personal level rather than looming over any human. Despite this, it\u2019s rare to find Titans outside their armor; decades within the powerful shell has left them feeling weak and ineffectual in any form but their 20-foot chassis. In the modern era it is unfortunate that such powerful soldiers have begun to fill the role of politicians but all still feel the need for command and battle, as such; the Titans make up a massive portion of the highest echelons of Alperian command, and are permitted to take to the battlefield in select circumstances, where they may once-more feel the rush of combat alongside their troops. While technically the Titan program is no longer active and no more Titans are produced, it is surprisingly common to see \u201corganic\u201d career-generals and officers to seek similar life-extension technology (as the Titan\u2019s occupants are considered theoretically immortal) and be implanted into a mechanized frame; as such the term \u201cTitan\u201d has become a catchall for any high-ranking, non-operator military-employed transhuman. These units are and will be treasured as a walking library of tactical knowledge and combat styles and will be used as generals, veteran field commanders, and walking tanks for decades or even centuries to come as their knowledge will only grow with their \u201cascension\u201d. Titans always operate with two Nidhoggr battlesuit systems as bodyguards, and are often accompanied by a platoon of elite shock troops. Currently the number of Titans is between 400 and 420 platforms between all branches and models (the massive models described above numbering no greater than a dozen); the most famous of which being the war-hero Nathan Sabol, venerated as the living embodiment of the Alperian military and supreme commander of Alperia's military; alongside his 12 \"paladins.\"Developed PCAS-mounted Weapons  Note: All weapons designed for the most recent PCAS series are not conventional weapons such as rifles or pistols and are instead gunpod-like weapons systems designed to be mounted onto the PCAS at various hardpoints. Most are linked into an internal/external ammunition hopper through various means (usually a linkless armored belt) unless otherwise stated. Ammo counts for each weapon will vary heavily based on the size of hoppers and how they are arranged for each mission. KM-9 \u201cBayonet\u201d\nClassification: Multipurpose gunpod\nCaliber: 25x220mm gyrojet /10.1x71mm caseless\nOperation: Gas operated, closed rotating bolt; w/ magnetic acceleration assist\nOverall length: 143 cm\nBarrel Length: 104.5 cm/92.1 cm\nEffective Range: 4,600m+\nMaximum ROF: 120 rounds per minute/880 rounds per minute\nFeed device: Linkless electronic, dual feed/linkless electronic\nTotal Weight: 35.4 kg\nFeatures:\n-Two barrels firing different ammunition\n-The 10.1x71mm caseless is the standard issue rifle cartridge for armored infantry, and due to its size has multiple variants like a (5.3mm) sabot, sherdders, microexplosive and JIFI rounds\n-Multiple ammo types available for 25mm round including: APDS, HEDP, Thermobaric, HEIAP, and a variable setting CHE KM-11 \u201cThresher\u201d\nClassification: Gunpod\nCaliber: 10.1x71mm caseless\nOperation: Gas operated, closed rotating bolt; w/magnetic acceleration assist\nOverall length: 143 cm\nBarrel Length: 86 cm\nEffective Range: 1,200m+\nMaximum ROF: 4400 rounds per minute (counting all barrels)\nFeed device: Linkless electronic, 5-feed\nTotal Weight: 31.9 kg\nFeatures:\n-5-barrel suppression weapon KM-76 \u201cKingslayer\u201d\nClassification: \u201cBattle rifle\u201d gunpod\nCaliber: 14.2mm (maximum size of round)\nOperation: Electronic loader, gauss firing system\nOverall length: 173 cm\nBarrel Length: 140 cm\nEffective Range: 5,200m+\nMaximum ROF: 2,000 rpm 4-round burst (ideal)\nFeed device: Linkless electronic, dual feed\nTotal Weight: 50.1 kg\nFeatures:\n-Uses the same ammunition as the AII-303H\n-Extended barrel with additional magnetic accelerators KM-84 \u201cPerforator\u201d\nClassification: Magnetic \u201cscatter catapult\u201d gunpod\nCaliber: 62mm canister shot\nOperation: Motorized loader, gauss firing system\nOverall length: 143 cm\nBarrel Length: 81 cm\nEffective Range: 200m+\nMaximum ROF: 300 rounds per minute\nFeed device: Linkless electronic\nTotal Weight: 52.44 kg\nFeatures:\n-Automatic canister weapon designed for CQC suppression and use in areas where \u201ccollateral damage\u201d is irrelevant.

AII-303H \u201cWidow\u201d\nClassification: Heavy assault/support rotary machine-gunpod\nCaliber: 14.2mm (maximum size of round)\nOperation: Electrically driven 4-barreled gatling-style, gauss firing operation\nOverall length: 180 cm\nBarrel Length: 133.6 cm\nEffective Range: 4,000m+\nMaximum ROF: 1,200 rounds per minute\nFeed device: Linkless electronic\nTotal Weight: 135.2 kg\nFeatures:\n-Multiple ammo types available for the 14.2mm round, including: API, flechette, and a variable setting CHE. However the standard round is actually an 8.5mm solid slug (due to the gauss system being able to shoot anything 14.2mm or smaller) coated in a thin reactive film powered by a micro-capicator located in the base of the slug that can slightly alter the aerodynamics of the bullet and perform limited in-flight path corrections. This capicator is divided into sub-sections that also store kinetic energy from the firing procedure which can be released on impact, amplifying the impact damage to a ludricious level. CZW-130 \u201cLongeye\u201d\nClassification: Anti-material sniper cannon system\nCaliber: 40mm (maximum size of round)\nOperation: Motorized chain-loader, gauss firing operation\nOverall length: 202 cm\nBarrel length: 161.7 cm\nMaximum effective range: 15,000m+\nMaximum range: 23,500 m\nMaximum ROF: 62 rounds per minute\nFeed device: Linkless electronic, dual feed\nTotal Weight: 73.6 kg\nFeatures:\n-While able to fire endless types of ammo, the most common anti-armor round is a 40mm, foot long brutanium spike encasing a high-explosive.

The weapon uses low-power coils to fire the weapon at a lower velocity than most mortars, making it an effective support weapon as opposed to a full-power siege weapon. The weapon is recoilless due to the gauss operation, and is, unlike most mortars; disposable, having an integrated drum magazine, allowing a single infantryman to unleash a barrage of 12 103mm rounds before having to detach the system. The system self-cannibalizes upon detaching, consuming its self in a thermal overloading of its magnetic coils, melting the weapon into a grey goo. Unlike most PCAS weapons this one does not fit into the normal weapon sockets and is designed to simply be mounted on the back. SSRM-97 \u201cTank-buster\u201d\nClassification: Multi-purpose heavy missile pod\nMunitions Diameter: 200 mm\nOperation: Compressed-air \u201csoft launch\u201d w/electrically activated solid-fuel rocket\nLauncher Length: 1.75 m\nEffective Range: 5,900+ m\nFeed device: 10-barrel disposable missile pod\nTotal Weight: 58.1 kg\n-Suppressed smoke and flame firing allows for easy use in buildings\n-PCAS top mounts\nDescription:\nThe success of the PPY-55 disposable mortar system and its ability to drastically improve a squad\u2019s support options on the cheap led to the commissioning of a similar disposable top-mounted weapon to bolster a squad\u2019s anti-tank and long-range firepower. The SSRM is a cluster of 10 large-bore missiles mounted inside a detachable, 2-section rack; each missile has a large long-range propellant charge and a large warhead with numerous options allowing the rack to be filled with variable charges for numerous occasions. The SSRM-97 has a large enough bore to fit the experimental \u201cplasma-core\u201d warheads and miniaturized SDAI rounds, allowing it to deliver extremely powerful, exotic firepower to supplement the PCAS\u2019 already extensive anti-armor/fortification capabilities.

HISW-L (Heavy Infantry Support Weapon \u2013 Laser)\nClassification: Laser-based support gunpod\nOutput: 270 MJ plasma-based laser (maximum output)\nFiring style: Continuous beam (10 seconds max), single shot (900 RPM)\nPower source: Deuterium-fluorine-terrazide battery\nFocusing system: Synthetic boronized diamond lenses\nWeight: 74kg\nMaximum effective range: 2,350m (at 30% humidity)\nBeam diameter: 17mm\nDescription: Running off an array of chemical batteries mounted in an armored box on the external hull of the PCAS, the HISW has now evolved from a tripod-based infantry support weapon to an extremely powerful mounted weapon. Often mounted to the PCAS\u2019 right arm mount; this weapon has made a come-back as the most advanced mass-produced weapon currently available on the infantry scale. Firing a tightly focused beam, the weapon can easily melt flesh at even a low power setting (making projectile body armors useless) and can burn through concrete, metal, and even tank armor on higher settings. The variable firing settings are designed to deal with varying targets; the rapid fire \u201cmachine gun\u201d configuration can demolish infantry formations while the beam configuration is designed to melt through vehicle armor. The beam can easily bore through the armor on APCs and light vehicles, however; it is also effective against rear engine armor on tanks, where the heat can cause a catastrophic fuel explosion. DFP-3 Flamethrower system\nA PACS armor system integration weapon, this modernized flamethrower uses napalm-based fuels (most often Hellfire Napalm) contained in a pressurized, armored tank. The weapon can sustain several seconds of fire before overheating and the tank contains over 3 minutes worth of fuel. The fuel tank is fitted into where the ammo for any other weapon would be fitted, making it all but impenetrable. Fuel is pumped in small, extreme high pressure quantities using a hydraulic system and through the firing mechanism which is about 3 feet in length and is rooted in the standard KM-series gunpod. Despite the massive number of safety system integrated into the weapon it is still dangerous to use, most often Desolator squads are considered the bravest or the most psychotic by their brothers, due to their nature to charge into battle with reckless abandon and stretching the limits of the PCAS\u2019s hostile IDing system. FtY90 \u201cHaywire\u201d NNDEMP rifle\nThe Haywire is a weapon actually imported from the Grand Duchy of Verdun with its normal casing removed and the internal workings placed into a gunpod for mounting on the PCAS. The Haywire is a non-nuclear directed electromagnetic pulse weapon, primarily designed to disable enemy equipment as per normal Verdun RoE, which emphasizes minimal contact with and casualties on enemy personnel; instead aiming to disable all their hardware and ability to actually fight. The Haywire is a rather fantastic weapon even for its short range of 300m, capable of running off the standard power output of the PCAS, it fires busts of interfering electromagnetic energy with a tight-focused or widespread beam. NNEMPs tend to be erratic and while their reliability is never assured, the chances of the electronics of non-hardened equipment (wither it be a laptop or the equipment of a tank) surviving the focused beam are negligible, it therefore makes an excellent short-range anti-armor weapon also ideal for destroying electronic materiel targets. The wide-spread setting is shorter ranged (roughly 100m) and is less powerful but more adept at frying all the light electronics in an area, like \u201csimple\u201d computers, electronic firearms, radios, phones, etc. which make it great for stealth operations. The weapon has also found use as a piece of mine-disposal equipment, using the EM pulses to destroy and disable modern electronic and magnetic mines. DG-2 Electrolaser system aka \u201cThe Lightning Gun\u201d\nThe DG-2 is a multi-role specialist weapon that applies electrolaser technology to a unique feature to make a gun that sounds like something out of a bad sci-fi movie. The weapon is fueled by a generator similar to the one used in the W/AA M7 plasma rifle, the weapon its self is about 131 cm long and weighs around 15 kg. Like any electrolaser the gun uses a Laser-Induced Plasma Channel which is directed at targets to create a conduit in which a high-energy beam of electricity can travel efficiently. The gun is able to output over 10,000,000 volts of electricity at 700 amps, and will cause complete neurological destruction resulting in almost instant death, the power can also be set to different levels from lethal to stunning to a mild jolt. The weapon appears to fire a flash of lightning which has in a few cases been used in plausibly deniable fake lightning strikes; the weapon can also be used efficiently against anything that uses electricity, frying computers nearby and disabling vehicles through overloading their electrical transfer systems (like spark plugs in internal combustion engines). The weapon deviates from normal electrolasers however in that the LIPC can jump to targets that give off electricity if they are nearby (range varies based on the targets output) allowing the beam to link numerous targets using their electrical output to further fuel the beam making ideal against bunches of targets (including infantry). It does have its limits but the links are entirely determined by electrical current and distance. The initial beam has a range of 680 meters and a rate of fire of 100 rpm making it more of a marksman\u2019s weapon than a sniper or assault weapon. It\u2019s a hard to produce weapon and is quite delicate even with the case its mounted in being armored and filled with shock absorbers; meaning that only a few are currently in service until performance is adequate enough for the Alperian military to order mass production. W/AA M7 PBNR Plasma rifle system\nThe M7 is a limited-production; man-portable plasma weapon designed as a proof of concept in the future of directed energy weapons. The system consists of the actual weapon with a cable connecting to a modified version of the PCAS\u2019 microfusion cells which are replaced with a small fusion generator in order to fuel this weapon. The weapon has a large energy output (exact is classified), and fires a large bolt of collapsed supercharged-gas plasma that ionizes the surrounding air, appearing as a golden bolt as it travels (using gauss technology to focus and energize the plasma) toward a target at ranges of up to a few hundred meters. The \u201cfusion bolt\u201d is supplemented by an electron beam that is alone a lethal weapon, this was unintentional and actually a byproduct of electromagnetic energy condensing. The weapon is dangerous to operate when unarmored and being unprotected in the weapon\u2019s immediate area when fired can also have adverse effects (like burns, severe headaches, etc.) due to massive heat and electromagnetic output. The weapon has a fairly slow firing rate (30 rpm), however with the exception of anti-armor weaponry it is one of the most powerful infantry-portable weapons available anywhere; easily able to burn a man and those around him to cinders in a single shot and is even able to disintegrate tank armor fairly efficiently. The weapon is expensive, heavy, maintenance-intensive and requires highly specialized training; meaning it is only issued to elites or weapon specialists. The weapon is somewhat volatile and thus dangerous to use and has numerous emergency shutoffs and venting features but if the superconducting matrix is breached while fully energized the weapon has a tendency to explode. A few other weapons in service with only small sections of the military also exist.Developed Infantry Weapons  Note: These are weapons that have mostly been phased out due to the change in the PCAS\u2019 armament systems however they still find service among unarmored troops (like tankers and pilots), those using the older/different models of power armor, base guards who don\u2019t wear powered armor and among various Alperian PMCs.

The Vortex was developed in response to the generally disastrous performance of the SABSE; its predecessor in the \u201cspecialized anti-armor\u201d field. The SASBE was underpowered and overly-complex for its bloated cost-ratio and as stated; poor performance due to its almost nonsensical design. The Vortex however was tested to far higher standards is considerably more lethal, ultimately considered to be the most powerful AT round currently in existence. The Vortex is a \u201cfitted gauge\u201d round (in that it actually matches or comes close to matching the bore of its intended cannon) that consists of a 4-stage design with a small, ejecting ferric baseplate attached to the end (so the round can actually be fired using gauss coils). The Vortex\u2019s layers consist of a small brutanium penetrator followed by a pack of microfusion cells designed to overload upon impact and shattered between the force of the 1st and 3rd/4th stages, then a magnetic pulse generator and finally a weighted circle of solid-fuel jets arranged horizontal to the axis of movement; to top it off the shell is coated in an ablative shell consisting of tightly-packed carbon-based nano-blades and molecular hooks. Operation is centered around the hard penetrating tip forcing a fissure in enemy armored followed by the razor-coating drilling down as it breaks off; tearing apart the armor it touches, generating massive amounts of friction-heat, at this time the microfusion cells overload and are forcibly crushed, releasing a massive burst of explosive force, EMP, low-intensity radiation and plasma which is helped along by the already ultra-hot ablative razors; this combination of plasma and molten metal are then pushed forward by the magnetic burst generator, creating a metallic rod (the still-intact penetrator) backed by a molten jet of hellish consistency. All this is possible due to the 4th stage providing rear-force and rotation to generate the friction of the razor-shell. By extent this round is dangerous and highly lethal; able to blow through meters of material that would foil even a solid kinetic slug such as deep-ground bunkers and hyper-dense alloy armor.GPMLW rounds (Guass-Propelled Molecular Lathanium Web)  While the Vortex round is Alperia\u2019s premier specialized anti-armor/fortification round GPMLW rounds are the ones loaded most often for general combat. GPMLW are primarily a small solid kinetic penetrator constructed from brutanium and nanoalloys, often no bigger than 40mm even when used by the largest caliber cannons. This allows them to be accelerated to absolutely ludicrous velocities, capable of easily punching holes in tanks, even through reasonable sections of cities let alone single armored vehicles. However a simple small-caliber KP is rather ineffective, often causing minimal damage to enemy armor beyond an exit and entry wound, oftentimes splattering the crew over several hundred feet on the exit; this disables the tank but it could still be easily repaired and redeployed after being hosed out. To compensate for this, the kinetic penetrators were redesigned to deploy a large microfine net of lathanium-hybrid cable behind them in-flight. This trailing net is constructed of billions of mono-molecular hooks that dig into almost any material on the atomic level and forming an unbreakable cold-weld (allowed by the negative pressure wave of the gauss round\u2019s velocity) when tension is applied. When a GPMLW round impacts enemy armor the net wraps around the outside, and as it exits the cold-weld forms and the tank is forcibly ripped inside-out through its own entry-hole, often ending up an elongated pile of scrap unrecognizable as anything. The round also has anti-infantry applications, the microfine net can gather up and instantly rip apart concentrations of infantry; leaving a gore-stained area where the men once stood.N270 Thermobaric rounds:  The Alperian armored-level equivalent of high explosive rounds, the N270 is a simple shell version of a thermobaric bomb. Upon impact the shell releases a fine mist of a highly explosive chemical compound that then explodes when the right oxygen-fuel mixture is reached. The N270 has several times the effective explosive radius of standard HE rounds of a comparable size and the explosion lasts for longer making it highly effective against infantry and static structures. The oxygen-eating explosion and pressure wave also make it exceptional against tunnel structures and bunkers.VGLMC rounds (Variable Geometry Liquid Metal Canister):  VGLMC rounds are a unique multi-purpose round designed to counter infantry, light vehicles and even light tanks, however; it still makes an effective weapon against heavier armored targets. The VGLMC is a canister filled with a specially fabricated metal that shows high reactivity to electromagnetic fields, called Magnocite. The gauss coils on Alperian armored vehicles induce the metal to enter a liquid state with an extremely low viscosity. Based on how the firing coils are pulsed the metal can be broken down into droplets, formed into a sharp spear, or even take the shape of a rain drop before leaving the barrel, and as soon as it does it hardens back into a metal almost instantaneously. This allows the gunners to have a single round be canister shot, a kinetic energy penetrator or even a blunt round for smashing through structures. In recent times the tank-sized canister are rare and almost never produced, however infantry-sized canisters are still manufactured for various infantry-portable gauss weapons.SDAI rounds (Seismic Demolition & Anti Infantry):  These new rounds are designed to eventually replace HE rounds as the next generation of anti-infantry/structure rounds. Working like a concussion bomb on steroids, these rounds utilize the principles of charged shockwave cascade to maximum effect. Chambered specially and filled with classified explosives, these rounds explode in a horrifyingly powerful shockwave that can rip infantry and light vehicles into bits and collapse entire blocks of buildings. Designed to amplify the force of the explosion by an inconceivable amount, these relatively cheap rounds shake the earth and do damage with pure kinetic energy and no shrapnel whatsoever. They do have less effect against case hardened vehicles (like tanks); however in most cases a tank would fall apart after a direct hit. And even if that doesn\u2019t happen the crew could be seriously maimed, or at least severely disorientated to the point of being completely useless for a reasonable time. In due time and with more advanced technology they may become an all-purpose round of the future.Hellfire Napalm:  Hellfire Napalm is modernized napalm created using a refined compound that features among a number of classified substances; magnesium strips, thermite dust and phosphorous, increasing its burn temperature to allow it to dissolve metals (or flesh) on light and heavily armored targets alike. The substance is used in various Alperian weapons, and is incredibly dangerous (probably the most dangerous flame-based weapon ever developed), used in bombs, shells, grenades (called Type-8 grenades), and fired out of flamethrowers; it is feared greatly for its ability to melt anything and everything. Hellfire nepalm bypasses several NHC limitations on flame-based weaponry by burning so extremley hot that it kills faster than most firearms can.MPG-HEF/45 (MultiPurpose Grenade-High Explosive Fragmenting):  The 45 is the standard issue grenade for all Alperian launcher-equipped infantry, it consists of a cylindrical, fragmenting casing ringed with tungsten-cobalt flechettes and packed with Octonitroglyconitrate-RDX, an extremely explosive substance. Unlike most grenades, the 45 has a microcomputer and various sensors that make it capable of performing several different roles. The 45 can be set to detonate on impact indiscriminatley, use a brutanium \"wall\" to direct explosions (allowing to be launched say; near civilians yet target the hostiles around them), bounce (or fly) until it detects an optimum enemy concentration, lay dormant for use as a booby-trap, etc; the grenade is as useful as its user wants it to be. The 45 is very powerful but easy to produce due to the simple construction and lack of advanced electronics (by Alperian standards). The grenade weighs 14 ounces with a filler weight of 6.3 ounces; the weapon has a fatality radius of 11 meters and a causality radius of 32.2 meters but is capable of imbedding shrapnel in objects out to 348 meters over flat terrain. Its extreme fatality and casuality ranges are in-part due to the tungsten-cobalt flechettes which are rotated along two axes by two micro-engineered magentic centurfuges \"belted\" around the grenade which both \"rifle\" the flechettes and add additional range to their explosive propellant. These flechettes can be semi-prioritized with targets, in which the centerfuge spins the flechettes in such a way to direct them toward specific areas, increasing the chance for lethal penetration. Apart from pure lethality, the MPG has a number of interchangable cores that allow it to serve numerous roles, such as the MPG-SF, which creates a bright star flare; the MPG-EM, which is filled with a small, self-destrictive EMP generator; the MPG-S, which can mark a location with smoke in varying colors and numerous other variants.SAE-67 Thermobaric Grenade  The SAE-67 is a specialty grenade developed for the destruction of light vehicles, buildings and personnel in areas where the standard issue MPG-HEF/45 could generate too much collateral damage due to the grenade\u2019s massive payload. The 67 solves the problem of the unpredictability of most Thermobaric weapons by using a jet propelled mist of the powdered ultra-explosive fuel rather than letting it disperse naturally, combined with the small scale of the weapon (since most Thermobaric weapons are easily affected by weather), making a neatly spherical and highly predictable blast. The SAE-67 has an explosive radius of about 8 meters, but the lack of shrapnel removes the chance of accidental impact, coupled with the ability of power armor to calculate the damages and effect of each grenade launched make it very \u201csafe\u201d to use.Developed Defensive \u201cSystems\" BECFAA (Burtanium-Encased, Composite-Filled Advanced Armor)  The standard armor developed for all Alperian armored needs; BECFAA is exceptionally strong plating that has the highest mass-to-protection efficiency of all known passive defenses despite its immense mass. Exact composition is classified but BECFAA consists of an ultra-refined Brutanium casing filled with layers of Koltan (an advanced ceramic-like material)-metallic composite spaced with kinetics gel and capsules containing LiqBOS. All heavily reinforced with fullerenes and nanostructures designed to strengthen the existing material and improving heat distribution. Lathanium-iridium sheathing is also placed over the Brutanium base. The armor is then coated in laser/radar absorbing studs and radiation-absorbing plaques; drastically increasing the difficulty of enemy forces getting a missile lock.EDP-7 Anti-mine system  The electromagnetic detection and pulse anti-mine system is a fairly simple (theoretically) concept that allows Alperian tanks to safely traverse and defeat modern magnetic antitank mine fields. The EDP-7 generators are mounted in the fronts of Alperian tanks and emit a steady magnetic field that can identify the detector coils in magnetic mines. Upon discovery the EDP applies a directional magnetic pulse to force the mine to detonate prematurely and at a safe distance. The system\u2019s abilities are bolstered with a system using an earth-penetrating seismic \u201cRADAR\u201d than can detect the changes of density in the earth that a mine would cause. The mines can then be safely uncovered and removed. The EDP-7 is standard equipment on all Alperian tanks.Firewall-II active protection system  The Firewall system is a hard-kill active protection weapon designed to defeat modern guided anti-tank missiles and cannon rounds. The system has an integrated trajectory analysis computer that is fed information from the IAWNCL and onboard omni-channel sensors. After an incoming missile or shell is detected; the ring of cylindrical turrets on the roof of the vehicle come online and fire a small ultraviolet-wavelength laser beam that causes premature detonation of warheads and in the case of missiles; destroys guidance systems. The system has a reaction time of 200 milliseconds and is nearly undefeatable even at close range urban settings even with as many as 6 simultaneous projectiles. At least one system (ring of lasers) is installed on most heavy Alperian vehicles with individual lasers installed on lighter vehicles. Regardless, the system is in some way found on everything from aircraft to transport trucks in the Alperian military.AMAS-MRA preemptive active armor modules  Developed as a backup to the Firewall system (but also capable of functioning independently), the AMAS system is a secondary hard-kill active defense armor module. The AMAS consists of large independent blocks of concussive explosive stored in ceramic armored cases. The directional concussive explosive is slaved to the Firewall\u2019s targeting system and if the Firewall predicts a low chance of interdiction the explosive detonates when the projectile closes, releasing a blast of concussive force that can break-up, redirect or outright deflect the incoming munitions. The individual armor blocks are light, cheap and a very small number can cover the entire hemisphere around the vehicle, allowing for a broad range of options on any ground vehicle with a computer that can run their control drivers.Bastion electric reactive slat armor  Bastion armor is a type of vehicle armor designed to protect from anti-tank attacks. It functions like most slat armor; using a number of metal bars placed away from the hull creating a rigid barrier around the vehicle causing the warhead to explode at a relatively safe distance from the actual chassis. However unlike normal slat armor this armor is made up of a conductive tube inside another separated by an insulating material, creating a high-power capacitor. In operation, a high-voltage power source charges the armor. When an incoming body penetrates the tubes, it closes the circuit to discharge the capacitor, dumping a great deal of energy into the penetrator, which may vaporize it or even turn it into plasma, significantly diffusing the attack. A Bastion cage is standard covering for all cooling radiators and over vulnerable areas on all Alperian tanks and APCs.Chromatophore-based organic optical camouflage  The CBOOC is a fairly broad designation pertaining to any of the \u201ccoatings\u201d placed over Alperian armor that contain colonies of genetically engineered photosynthetic organisms that act like the chromatophore on numerous sea creatures skin that allows them to generate exceptionally high-quality camouflage. The CBOOC takes the abilities of chromatophore to the next level, allowing a unit equipped with the system to take to the surrounding area almost perfectly when stationary, far exceeding the abilities of traditional paint camouflage. Every single aircraft, tank, vehicle and infantry armor in the Alperian military has the basic CBOOC that permits them to generate camouflage from a set of patterns and color allowing the unit in question to change operation range without being repainted for a new mission. However; a few units in the military (such as the Talon III fighter) have the complete system that allows them to become completely invisible to the eye when stationary and very hard to see even when moving. The system is not without flaws, it can be defeated by exposing the unit to rapid changes in highly different lighting or texture, and the system also works with less detail at night due to the cell\u2019s photosynthetic nature, but these flaws while still there, are hard to use in effective countermeasures.\u201cHand of God\u201d Kinetic superweapon satellite grid  The \u201cHand of God\u201d is the Alperian answer to the nuclear weapons and stockpiles owned by some nations. All NBC weapons have been banned in Alperian warfare since the nation\u2019s foundation, allowing only for kinetic, energy and seismic (although restricted to a small scale) weapons to be developed. The Hand of God is a development of this restriction, and considered by many to be a far more useful and efficient system than any NBC weapon; it consists of a massive, hundreds-strong network of satellites that are little more than massive gauss cannons which maintain a semi-geosynchronous orbit above earth. Each satellite is armed with over 20 massive tungsten/Brutanium darts (certain ones are over 20 feet tall) in varying sizes and some armed with seismic payloads (but most are purely kinetic). The security system to prevent accidental firing is incredibly advanced and complex with each part not knowing the operations of the other parts, compartmentalization to prevent any abuse. After a launch is authorized; the survey of the battlefield is analyzed by a smart AI who then dictates which satellite to use, which size of dart and which firing speed, this data is then transmitted to the satellite which then cycles the round, charges the cannon and fires; this entire process can take less than a minute. The weapon is highly precise (with accuracy in the centimeters) and the variation on power means that the weapon can devastate an entire city or just a block, maximum blast power has never actually been tested but is simulated to devastate most surface targets in a 60 mile radius, with catastrophic damage to underground structures due to seismic upheaval rated as a flash 10 on the Richter scale with effects reaching out for hundreds of miles. It has been said that the blast crater and surrounding area after impact resembles \u201cland bombed until unrecognizable then torn up by the world\u2019s largest rototiller\u201d. The weapon has an advantage over NBC weapons in that there is no \u201cleftovers\u201d after deployment, meaning that the blast radius is \u201csafe\u201d afterwards and has no chance of inadvertently harming soldiers or civilians after initial damage.O8 \u201cSeraphim\u201d orbital support weapon grid  The O8 \u201cSeraphim\u201d support grid is a recent development similar to the Hand of God system although less powerful it is more generalized. The Seraphim grid uses a similar layout to the Hand of God, however; the gauss gun is replaced with a massive plasma-based laser of classified output. The grid has replaced the old GMDG-14 in its role of completely outdating all ballistic missile technology but also serves as a tactical weapon. The grid can provide precise laser-targeted firepower on a battlefield level able to scorch the earth it hits to glass and melt holes in any defense. The weapon is more easily deployed than the \u201cHand of God\u201d and doesn\u2019t need as much approval for deployment, with some squads having the ability to request use. Each satellite can sustain a single beam medium power for around 12 seconds on a single charge; allowing it rake across the battlefield destroying all in its path, reducing bunkers to charred rubble and armored divisions to misshaped melted husks. The Seraphim satellites are clustered in groups of three around each Hand of God satellite, performing defense for the satellites and making general defense for each weapons cluster cheaper and easier. For safety, both the Hand of God and Seraphim units are cloaked in some of the most advanced optical and electronic camouflage Alperia possess, making finding them all but impossible.Alperian Military Land Vehicles Tanks  AP-7f Cyclone\nClassification: Main battle tank\nWeight: 116 tons\nHull Length: 35.07 feet\nWidth: 15.2 feet\nHeight: 10.5 feet\nCrew: 3 (driver, gunner/commander, missile/electronics operator)\nArmor: BECFAA (classified thickness on all Alperian vehicles)\nPrimary armament:\n--1x 152mm M56 scram-guass cannon\nSecondary armament:\n--1x 30mm RCWS-9/B rotary gauss cannon\n--2x remote-mounted HISW-L turrets (top mounted)\n--2x TOC-1 multi-purpose guided missile launchers (internally-fed)\n--1x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pod\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\nEngine: AGT-1500C fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nTop speed: 94 mph\nMovement: 2 caterpillar tracks AP-402d Hurricane\nClassification: Assault and artillery tank\nWeight: 308 tons\nHull Length: 58.53 feet\nHull Width: 28 feet\nHeight: 16.6 feet\nCrew: 5 (driver, 2 gunners, missile/electronics operator, commander)\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament:\n--2x 220mm M86 scram-gauss cannons\nSecondary armament:\n--2x 30mm RCWS-9/B rotary gauss cannons\n--2x remote-mounted HISW-L turrets (top mounted)\n--AnAusGes AA missile system\n--3x TOC-1 multi-purpose guided missile launchers (internally-fed)\n--2x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pods\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\nEngine: AGT-3800G fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nTop speed: 80 mph\nMovement: 4 track pods (2 per side) AP-111c-M Brimstone\nClassification: Microwave/Electronic warfare tank\nWeight: 68 tons\nHull Length: 28 feet\nWidth: 12 feet\nHeight: 8.7 feet\nCrew: 4 (driver, gunner/commander, 2 technicians/EW officers)\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament:\n--1x Griffon III Heavy directed/non-directed microwave field emitter: The Griffon is a utility microwave weapon deployed for removing special targets. At \u201cpassive\u201d state the weapon emits a continuous field of microwave radiation (19-meter diameter hemisphere, however this can be adjusted) that can cook a man alive in moments or be used to clear foliage, interferes with missile guidance systems and damages unshielded electronics. When directed via a radiation-reflective \u201cmirror\u201d and focusing optics, the beam turns into a lethal and debilitating directed-energy weapon; capable of literally killing a man instantly (leaving nothing but a half-exploded, smoldering corpse devoid of any fat or water) even if they are the crew of an unshielded heavy armored vehicle. The microwave beam can also be directed at buildings and armored electronic targets to permanently disable them via annihilating delicate components.\nSecondary armament:\n--1x hull-mounted 25mm GSAS-21 rotary gauss autocannon\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\n--A complex electronic warfare suite rounds out the \u201carmament\u201d\nEngine: AGT-1700N fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nTop speed: 90 mph\nMovement: 2 caterpillar tracks XP-G7 Hellstorm\nClassification: Advanced energy weapons tank\nWeight: 135 tons\nHull Length: 38.07 feet\nWidth: 15.2 feet\nHeight: 12.6 feet\nCrew: 4 (driver, gunner/commander, missile/electronics operator, engineer)\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament:\n--1x F-200 ultra-heavy extreme-output plasma-based laser cannon\nSecondary armament:\n--2x F-57 super-heavy plasma-based laser cannon\n--1x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pod\n--1x remote, top-mounted HISW-L turret\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\nEngine: AMI-5TW-9VC72 fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nTop speed: 88 mph\nMovement: 2 caterpillar tracks\nDescription: Based on the AV-7 Cyclone\u2019s chassis; the XV-G7 is a new production-line of energy-weapon battle tank. While not designed to replace the Cyclone, it is designed to work alongside it, primarily to destroy high-armor vehicles and hardened structures. Using what is currently the most powerful ground-based plasma-based laser in production and an enlarged fusion reactor the tank can melt holes through shocking amounts of materiel (like\u2026several blocks of buildings). The weapon does have a slow capacitor recharge however, limiting its prolonged effectiveness. XP-G20 Firestorm\nClassification: Advanced energy weapons tank\nWeight: 371 tons\nHull Length: 58.03 feet\nWidth: 28 feet\nHeight: 18.1 feet\nCrew: 6 (driver, gunner, missile/electronics operator, commander, 2 engineers)\nArmor: BECFAA (and prototyped materials)\nPrimary armament:\n--\u201cThe Inferno Cannon\u201d a large cannon that uses gauss technology to fire a magnetically enveloped ball of collapsed and concentrated plasma generated as bleed-off from the nuclear fusion reactor using an ultra-dense, extreme-high-temperature, superconducting matrix capacitor bank, \u201cgrown\u201d using a classified molecular repositioning technique. The weapon has massive power, and can obliterate any known armored vehicle in one shot and demolish infantry companies and fortifications.\nSecondary armament:\n--2x F-57 super-heavy high-powered plasma-based laser cannons\n--2x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pod\n--1x remote, top-mounted HISW-L turret\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\nEngine: AMI-10TW-5TY78 fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nOperational range: unlimited\nTop speed: 75 mph\nMovement: 4 track pods (2 per side)\nDescription: Recently moved out of prototype testing and onto mass production. The Firestorm plasma tank (based on the Hurricane chassis with a new turret enclosure and larger reactor) is much like the Hellstorm; it\u2019s new, it\u2019s shiny but it\u2019s not designed to replace its predecessors just yet due to sheer expense and imperfections in the technology. Alperian energy-storage tech is still not to the point that rapid-fire energy weapons are fully feasible and therefore the Firestorm will remain a special-use weapon. The inferno cannon is currently THE most powerful land-based energy weapon in production and a decent range of 9 kilometers makes it ideal for cracking open sieges and well-defended cities.Self-Propelled Artillery  SPG-1400c Typhoon\nClassification: Self-propelled artillery\nWeight: 79 tons\nHull Length: 37 feet\nWidth: 19 feet\nHeight: 12 feet\nCrew: 2 (driver, gunner/commander)\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament:\n--300mm M222 \u201cMountain cracker\u201d gauss cannon\nSecondary armament:\n--8x 100mm mortars\n--1x remote-mounted HISW-L turret (top mounted)\nEngine: AGT-2500A fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nTop speed: 80 mph\nMovement: 4 track pods (2 per side) MMS-320a Blizzard\nClassification: Self-propelled MML/MRL artillery\nWeight: Varies\nHull Length: 39 feet\nWidth: 19 feet\nHeight: (variable)\nCrew: 2 (driver, gunner/commander)\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament: (3 most common load-outs)\n(Standard load-out)\n--2x 30-round TOC-1 multi-purpose guided missile launchers\n--2x 8-round AnAusGes AA missile systems\n(\u201cSaturation\u201d load-out)\n--3x 40-round 105mm Mk.

Despite the M74s cutting edge insides, the outside is hardly interesting, nothing more than a large boxy frame topped with 15 heavy ball turrets containing rapid-recharge lasers. The command cabin is similar to most Alperian tanks, however; unlike most tanks, the vehicle has no primary gunners, mainly relying on the AI implanted into the tank to control the turrets, rather; the \u201cgunners\u201d direct priority targets for the AI. The M74 uses burst-lasers designed to destroy incoming munitions, a short blast can destroy any missile and coupled with the tank\u2019s very advanced targeting system make it so that the only way to defeat the system is to overwhelm it with an absolutely enormous numbers of munitions; a number that probably isn\u2019t as cost effective as another option. The M74 is also very effective at destroying low-flying aircraft, enabling a few of the vehicles to create a nigh impenetrable shield in the airspace above friendly forces. However, the tank is quite vulnerable against infantry attack, as the turrets can point to a level where it might be able engage tanks, but are incapable of hitting anything below their height at close ranges. SWP-287b Thundershock\nClassification: Tank destroyer/assault gun\nWeight: 50.2 tons\nHull Length: 31 feet\nWidth: 23 feet\nHeight: 8 feet\nCrew: 3 (driver, gunner/commander, engineer)\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament:\n--SV-98 \u201cShatterer\u201d hard-sound cannon\nSecondary armament:\n--1x 40mm gauss autocannon\n--1x hull-mounted HISW-L\n--1x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pod\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\nEngine: AMI-4TW-1TU51 fusion reactor\nSuspension: N/A\nOperational range: unlimited\nTop speed: 56 mph\nMovement: Skimmer system\nDescription: The oval-hulled Thundershock is a return to the tank-preying destroyers of old; however advancements in Alperian technology, especially in camouflage have given this old concept a new purpose and level of lethality on the battlefield. The Thundershock is a brand new vehicle that only recently completed extensive prototype testing on the tank\u2019s numerous once experimental technologies. The primary weapon is a fixed position heavy sonic cannon, known as the \u201cShatterer\u201d, the weapon consists of 8 separate barrels each with its own synthetic resonance crystal, sound is piped down the barrels and is adjusted by the vibration frequency of the crystal in each barrel that can be set to millions of resonate frequencies for all sorts of materials. The 8 barrels then meet at the primary focusing chamber at the weapon\u2019s tip, where the sound is combined into a harmonized, compound wavelength beam of \u201chard-sound\u201d the weapon then directs this blast at a target. The wide ranges of frequencies stored in the Thundershock\u2019s computers allow it to shake apart everything from copper wire to titanium alloys in a single blast, making it as effective as a siege weapon as a tank hunter. This unique weapon\u2019s latent effect as hard sound is that soft-targets like infantry are affected in a matter similar to being hit with a wrecking ball flying at hypersonic velocities, regardless of the beam\u2019s current makeup. This weapon is only a small part of the Thundershock\u2019s innovative design; the tank is the first to utilize \u201cskimmer\u201d technology, allowing it to hover a few meters off the battlefield, bypassing terrain entirely. The skimmer uses advanced and extremely powerful turbofans, ground effect air currents, and a magnetic suspension system to hover up to 3.2 meters off the ground. As if the skimmer and hard-sound cannon weren\u2019t enough, the tank utilizes not only the chromatophore-based organic camouflage that Alperia has been using for years but also phase-prism hologram projectors, this allows the tank to disguise itself as a tree, boulder, or even an enemy vehicle, this disguise combined with sensor blinding stealth systems and an audio replicator will stand up to all but the closest scrutiny, and an advanced EW package allow it to propagate even more confusion and disruption. The Thundershock stands up to its name and heritage as the perfect ambush predator. HT-162 Thunderhead\nClassification: Super-heavy siege breaker\nWeight: 285 tons\nHull Length: 67.1 feet\nWidth: 32.1 feet\nHeight: 23.5 feet\nCrew: 6 (driver, 3 gunners, commander, loadmaster), 56 carried infantry\nArmor: BECFAA\nArmament:\n--1x 400 mm scram-gauss, rocket-assisted siege mortar (N270 rounds are standard)\n--2x 30mm sponson-mounted RCWS-9/B rotary gauss cannons\n--2x heavy flamethrowers (attached to RCWS-9/B sponsons)\n--6 roof-mounted heavy pulse laser ball-turrets\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\n--Frontal boring rams\nEngine: GE-6100M fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nTop speed: 47 mph\nMovement: 2 caterpillar tracks\nDescription: The M182 is a unique weapon designed to be deployed in one of the rarest situations that the Alperian military faces; an unbreakable siege. The M162 is an extremely heavily armored block capable of bashing straight through the thickest defenses, the vehicle\u2019s bulk, rams and high-bore cannon allow it to obliterate most fortifications and charge right past the rubble. After a breach is made by the tank a frontal gate opens and dozens of heavily armed Alperian infantry can pour into the area. The vehicle also has several roof mounted chemical lasers designed to defend against enemy artillery and missile strikes to some degree. The vehicles were invented during the disastrous military engagements in Nezumi, where it was proven that Alperia needed some kind of ultra-armored transport to brute-force its way past the guerrilla\u2019s constant ambushes (note that this was also developed before Alperia started to truly dominate in technology and powered armor).IFVs, APCs and Transports  HT-758/IF Persecutor\nClassification: Heavy infantry fighting vehicle\nWeight: 89.7 tons\nHull length: 53.92 feet\nWidth: 24.02 feet\nHeight: 15.65 feet\nCrew: 3 (gunner, commander/driver, computer tech), 16 armored infantry (standing)\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament:\n--1x 105mm gauss autocannon\nSecondary armament:\n--1x coaxial 55mm cannon\n--1x Longsword 180mm AT missile system\n--2x ATY-6 micro-missile scatter pods\n--2x remote-mounted HISW-L (top mounted)\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\nEngine: AGT-1400A fusion reactor\nSuspension: Active electromagnetic recuperative/hydropneumatic\nTop speed: 113 mph\nMovement: 4 caterpillar tracks\nFeatures:\n-An advanced onboard mainframe helps support infantry in the area by giving the interlinked IAWNCL computers among nearby infantry more \u201cthinking space.\u201d\n-Command network module, adds further security and \u201cresistance\u201d to the IAWNCL of nearby troops.\n-Seismic sensors\n-Multiple variants for special duties (engineering, AA, heavy gun system, mortar carrier, etc)\n-Fully amphibious using small hydrojets combined with the treads for movement GF-4 Hammerstrike AFTAV\nClassification: Armored Fighting & Tactical Artillery Vehicle\nWeight: 65 tons\nHull length: 45 feet\nWidth: 14 feet\nHeight: 11.7 feet (base hull w/o cannon)\nCrew: 5 (driver, 4 gunners); 6 carried armored infantry w/ APC package\nArmor: BECFAA\nPrimary armament: (standard configuration)\n--Independently turreted, scram-rail assisted 135mm howitzer/AT cannon\nSecondary armament: (standard config.)\n--2x GSAS-15/U Komodo rotary gauss cannons on independent remote pintles\n--2x HISW-L\n--1x 50mm automatic grenade launcher (rear pintle)\n--1x Longsword 180mm AT rocket system\n--4x 80mm defensive mortars\n--varying armament based on current mission package\nEngine: Proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell/thermo-synthetic hybrid engine\nSuspension: Hydropneumatic\nOperational range: 783 mi\nTop speed: 144 mph\nMovement: 8 wheels\nDescription: Designed to function as a \u201cdoes it all\u201d multi-role combat vehicle to keep up with 1st-phase Alperian assaults (if need be, it\u2019s primarily used in 3rd-phase). Blocky, heavy, fearsome, powerful, and with ridiculously thick armor, the Hammerstrike is designed to function well in both urban and open combat. Its 135mm turret can have the rail assist deactivated turning the powerful AT cannon into a howitzer/mortar, allowing it to shell targets within an urban environment. The other heavy weapons allow the Hammerstrike to crush infantry in urban combat and lay waste to many tanks. The Hammerstrike really shines, however; due to the modular main bay which was designed to have a number of mission packages, most of which can be swapped around with only a few hours in the mechanics. The Hammerstrike is built with a high degree of standardization, and designed to be maintained efficiently despite the vehicle\u2019s high level of complexity.\nPackages include:\n\u2022Armored personnel carrier\n\u2022Assault (piles on additional armor, a larger engine and large stores of ammo)\n\u2022Mobile Gun System\n\u2022Medical/Armored Infantry Recovery\n\u2022Electronic warfare\n\u2022Support (armory and additional ammunition storage)\n\u2022Combat engineer vehicle (replaces most weapons with a larger engine, cranes, dozer blades, 200mm rocket-assisted demolition mortal and other additions)\n\u2022Tri-barreled 180mm mortar system\n\u2022Anti-Air (replaces the weapons with numerous AA missile systems and the bay with targeting equipment, RADAR systems, and additional missile storage) MHMWV-94 Sentinel\nClassification: MRAP Medium Transport\nWeight: 20.5 tons\nLength: 28 feet\nWidth: 8 feet\nHeight: 8.5 feet\nTop speed: 178 mph\nCapacity: 10 passengers (automated driver, all LHMWV models have automated drivers)\nArmor: metallic composite\nArmament: None\nEngine: ACT M/E-12 low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell-powered electric engine\nSuspension: Magnetorheological damper\nMovement: 6 wheels\nDescription: A light, wheeled, closed vehicle designed to move non-combat personnel quickly through safe zones or speed specialists into light combat. With exceptional speed and decent armor they are also used in cities as attack and support vehicles. The 94-series are also designed to withstand IEDs, mines, other explosives, traps, and ambushes; substantially increasing the survival of occupants. The MHMWV-94 and its variants are not able to transport PCAS-armored troops.

MHMWV-96 Guardian\nClassification: MRAP Medium Armored Infantry Transport\nWeight: 18.6 tons\nLength: 28 feet\nWidth: 8 feet\nHeight: 7.7 feet\nTop speed: 178 mph\nCapacity: 6 passengers (automated driver)\nArmor: metallic composite\nArmament: None\nEngine: ACT M/E-14 low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell-powered electric engine\nSuspension: Magnetorheological damper\nMovement: 6 wheels\nDescription: Based on the MHMWV-94 base schematic, the 96 had some minor changes done to it to allow it to transport Armored Infantry, whose sheer size disallows them from using normal-sized transports. Among the most noticeable changes are the removal of the roof, transforming the vehicle into an open-top transport; normally a bad move on combat transports the durability of the PCAS makes this a negligible change. AUV-98 Razorback\nClassification: Internal Security Vehicle/VIP Transport\nWeight: 13 tons\nLength: 19.1 feet\nWidth: 7.8 feet\nHeight: 8.3 feet\nTop speed: 164 mph\nCapacity: 4 passengers (automated driver)\nArmor: metallic composite\nArmament: (optional; capable of mounting most PCAS-weapons in a modular turret)\nEngine: ACT M/E-5 low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell-powered electric engine\nSuspension: Magnetorheological damper\nMovement: 4 wheels\nDescription: While found in far greater numbers among Alperias varied PMCs, the AUV-98 still has a noticeable niche in the Alperian army where it serves as a transport for VIPs such as generals and theater-visiting politicians but also as a security vehicle to supplement MHMWV-transported medium power armor-equipped engineer teams and base defense. While light and lightly armored by frontline Alperian standards, the vehicle\u2019s metallic nano-armor and PCAS-derived modular weapons are more than capable of dealing with the minor threats it is most likely to encounter. Numerous other crew-serviced weapons, advanced field guns, light/recon vehicles, dedicated engineer units, earthmovers, bridge layers and support vehicles fill out the Alperian ranks.Unmanned Military Units  Note: While Alperia is famous for its huge array of unmanned vehicles, listed below are primarily \u201cheavy\u201d combat units. Meaning that \u201csmall\u201d UCAVs, UCGVs or transport vehicles are omitted. UFP-58B Tracker\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous tactical combat frame\nWeight: 5.2 tons\nHeight: 14.1 feet\nSpeed: 67 mph running\nLocomotion: 2 reverse-jointed legs\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nPower source: Microfusion cell arrays\nArmament:\n--2x 30mm BTI-63E rotary gauss autocannons w/ telescoping muzzle breaks/claws\n--1x 10.1mm medium machine gun\n--1x 6-round TUA8 anti-armor missile pod\n--1x 80mm defensive mortar\nDescription: The center of the Alperian kill-team may be the PCAS-238 but the Tracker plays a close second and it's rare to find a fully-loaded kill-team without atleast 1 or 2 Trackers assigned to each wetware platform. A perfect blend of armor, firepower and armor; the Tracker can easily keep pace with the PCAS-238 and other drones in all manner of terrain and lay down a withering barrage of shells. Running a copy of the \"Overlord SI-system\" developed by Paragon Peripherals for PCAS-linked drone teams; the Tracker is operated by an advanced military-grade static intelligence, class-C; that is more than capable of using somewhat inventive and surprisingly brilliant tactics and their renown as \u201cdumb machines\u201d is regarded as ill-deserved by most Alperian robotics techs (the Overlord system is also optimized for combatant-identification, and with most platform's onboard suites and psychophysiological scanners can easly identify hostiles or aggressors from non-enemies, often better than any organic soldier). While sticking strictly to basic concepts of battlefield maneuvers, the Overlord system uses shared-process networking with its command-unit and fragments of the wetware platform\u2019s own creativity and sapience; allowing it to be downright cruel in its planning capacities. The SI installed in the Trackers are known for utilitarian techniques that make use of the other drones in a wetware platform\u2019s complement, performing feints, trapping maneuvers and attempting to encircle and destroy an enemy utterly; the bestial intelligence driving them diverted from the command-unit\u2019s cruelty and anger. Possessing a wide breath of weaponry, the Tracker is an adept multi-purpose drone and is often considered their wetware-platform\u2019s \u201cNCO\u201d (atleast in the eyes of Alperia\u2019s allies); operating as the \u201cbrain\u201d of mission-independent drone forces. UFP-265A Hunter\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous tactical combat frame\nWeight: 12.2 tons\nHeight: 15 feet\nSpeed: 53 mph running\nLocomotion: 2 double-jointed legs\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nPower source: Microfusion cell arrays\nArmament:\n--1x 35mm GSS-63E rotary gauss autocannon\n--1x 80mm M117 HV gauss cannon\n--1x 3-round BGT-18 multi-purpose missile pod\n--1x 8-round TUA8 anti-armor missile pod\n--1x 10.1mm M223 minigun (coaxial to upper torso)\n--1x 80mm defensive mortars\nDescription: As the success of the Tracker brought the demand for more unmanned fire support platforms, the TacticaMotor Corporation; inventors of the original Tracker went back to the drawing board and developed a much heavier model, one suited to heavier work than the Tracker. While not much taller than its predecessor, the Hunter is considerably broader, more heavily armored and armed with a wider array of weapons. The driving-SI of the Hunters are designed to take hints from their command unit\u2019s will to defend their fellow soldiers; as such Hunters are known for their defensive style of combat; operating near the rear of a firefight and hammering enemies from arm\u2019s length with their fully battery of weaponry; the Hunters are the heavy fire support of the \u201cQuad Infantry\u201d (the nickname for the 4 heavy, legged UFP platforms built by TacticaMotor) but also act as a shield-wall in dire circumstances. Many tales have been hold by Warpian or Gridiron infantry who were saved by a Hunter standing in the way of an oncoming tank, or one diving in the way of a missile to protect another unmanned platform heedless of enemy fire. Oftentimes the Hunter\u2019s survive this bravado due to their armor and decentralized systems, and many allied infantry have come to take an interesting view on the drones bordering on camaraderie, assigning them nicknames and personalities if in extended conflict alongside a particular Alperian kill-team. UFP-41A Pursuer\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous tactical combat frame\nWeight: 7.1 tons\nHeight: 17.6 feet\nSpeed: 98 mph running\nLocomotion: 2 reverse-jointed legs\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nPower source: Microfusion cell arrays\nArmament:\n--1x 6-tube 90mm rocket pod\n--2x Mk. 21 55mm burst-fire gauss cannons\n--1x Chin-mounted Hellfire napalm flamethrower turret\n--1x 80mm defensive mortar\nDescription: If the Tracker is anger and leadership, and the Hunter represents willpower; the Pursuer definitely represents their commander\u2019s guile and intelligence. The Pursuer is intended to do what its name suggests, using its incredible speed to wind through the urban jungle; \u201chunting\u201d enemies, acting as scouts and rearguard for their kill-team. The Pursuer is renown as among the most advanced applications of the Overlord SI; Pursuers seem to possess an almost inhuman cunning, and are often found \u201ctoying\u201d with isolated squads of infantry, appearing and reappearing at random; picking off isolated elements and attempting to drive them into the more heavy-armed jaws of the kill-team\u2019s remainder. To accommodate their style of warfare; the Pursuers have a full-coating of the CBOOC and can take to the surrounding almost perfectly on almost all spectrum bands when running low-power, even teams armed with thermal optics may only see splotches of heat where the Pursuer\u2019s ground-directed radiators dispersed heat and oftentimes these footprints are used to further the drone\u2019s goal of trapping and exterminating an enemy force. The armament on the Pursuer is optimized for quick engagements against light vehicles and infantry; their flamethrower is often used for distraction or to generate a screen to retreat behind as well as an offensive weapon, and their gauss cannons are often loaded with armor-piercing flechette-shot that can punch through most body armors and soft-skinned vehicles. A tactical terror-weapon of high order, the Pursuer is very popular among kill-teams specializing in deep-territory raids and attacking/defending the flanks of a main attack force. UFP-393A Cerberus\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous tactical combat frame\nWeight: 15.31 tons\nHeight: 17.2 feet\nSpeed: 50 mph running\nLocomotion: 2 double-jointed legs\nDrive type: Synthetic electro-reactive polymer muscle bundles supplemented by hydraulics\nPower source: Miniaturized fusion reactor\nArmament:\n--2x F-13 light plasma-based laser cannons\n--1x F-22 heavy plasma-based laser cannon\n--2x HISW-L gunpods\nDescription: Currently the last in the UFP series from TacticaMotor, the Cerberus is the heaviest, most well-armored and well-armed version yet. Designed to mount exclusively energy weapons, the Cerberus is a dedicated-anti-armor support platform and can destroy armor several times its weight with relative ease. By far the most expensive variant, requiring an expensive miniaturized reactor, it is nonetheless one of the most favored for its impressive firepower and has been compared to a cheaper, unmanned Jormungand battlesuit. The Cerberus takes hints from the command-unit\u2019s overwhelming desire to crush the enemy and are powerful assault units that will rush to engage enemy armor or crush infantry beneath their feet. MCRV-1 Swordbearer\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous munitions and combat recharge vehicle\nHeight: 6 feet\nLength: 7.4 feet\nTop Speed: 120 mph\nMovement: 8 wheels\nArmor: classified\nArmament: AII-303H Widow rotary gauss gun\nDescription: While not anywhere near as \u201cintelligent\u201d as the UFP-series (just designed to follow a squad and stay out of trouble), the Swordbearer performs a key role unrivaled by any combat drone, resupply. Boxy and ugly, the Swordbearer is a tubby abomination of a drone, tagging along behind kill-teams, it allows teams sent on long-endurance missions to act independent of supply lines or support. Most of the internal space is taken up by a projectile munitions storage bay and a battery of tool-tipped arms allowing for the quick delivery of ammo. Due to the compartmentalized and hard-to-access nature of the PCAS\u2019 storage bays, these machines are essential for long-endurance or high-intensity missions where even the huge ammo hoppers on the PCAS may become depleted. While the PCAS suits and most battlesuits are known for limited self-repair systems, they cannot restore a crippled battlesuit to fighting shape, however with the assistance of a \u201cWarsmith\u201d drone, the Swordbearer can via their utility arms, a small nanofabber and compartments for spare parts and armor modules. In addition, the MCRV has the ability to replace the microfusion cells on the PCAS and most drones, increasing combat endurance into several consecutive days. For self-defense and to provide a measure of fire support the MCRV has a turreted Widow minigun attached to its top with its own independent fire control are target selection system. U/MT-B Roach\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous medium armored fighting vehicle\nWeight: 47 tons\nHeight: 7 feet\nLength: 20.1 feet\nWidth: 7.3 feet\nTop speed: 87 mph\nLocomotion: 2 treads\nPower source: Miniaturized fusion reactor\nArmament:\n--1x 120mm M39 high-velocity gauss cannon\n--2x 6-salvo internally-fed 90mm missile pods\n--2x 80mm defensive mortars\n--1x coaxial HISW-L\nDescription: The heaviest platform running an Overlord SI, the Roach is more or less a miniature tank designed to provide unrivaled firepower and armor for a kill-team. The removal of a crew compartment and necessary life-support allows the Roach to possess an oversized reactor, impressive armor and huge amounts of ammunition for its size. With a Roach or several in a kill-team, it transforms from a quick strike-team into a heavy line-breaking force, in which the Roaches act as the primary source of firepower; the PCAS\u2019 and other drones providing support fire, an odd change of role for most operators. Roaches are designed to be vanguards, especially in urban combat; where their more combat frame and shorter-barreled cannon allows them to outperform and outmaneuver contemporary tanks, while their missile launchers and plentiful point-defense systems allow them to be effective against infantry and aircraft as well as assisting kill-teams in defense against anti-armor attacks. Combat protocols for the Roach are balanced and it\u2019s rare to see one destroyed fully even outside direct control due to their large processing banks and ability to quickly analize a situation; playing aggressive but using their armor where it counts. Despite the Overlord system making the Roach ideal for PCAS-linked teams, it is large enough and heavily equipped enough to operate on its own and it\u2019s common to see independent squadrons of Roaches acting as a bodyguard force for APCs and other, more-vulnerable ground vehicles. In this role its armor is less notable (due to often engaging heavier forces) but its speed and accuracy often keep the Roach far ahead of the curve. VQ-1 Punisher\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous gun platform\nHeight: 5.2 feet (in \u201ccompact\u201d mode)\nDiameter: 4.8 feet (in \u201ccompact\u201d mode)\nTop speed: 113 mph\nLocomotion: 1x HGU-77 high-spread vectored pulse engine\nPower source: Microfusion cell arrays\nArmament:\n--2x AII-303H rotary gauss guns on independently-rotating armatures\n--1x KM-76 battle rifle on an independently-rotating armature\n--50x 31mm micro-missile tubes\nDescription: The Punisher is a flying ammunition cylinder propelled by a high-spread pulse engine and feeding a trio of heavy guns. The punisher is yet another in the long line of Alperian combat drones to use the Overlord SI system, and does so driven by its wetware-platform\u2019s spite toward the enemy. The drone is designed for \u201cheavy reconnaissance\u201d into areas the PCAS may not be able to reach, but are too heavily defended for lightweight UCAVs such as the Q-8b. It also serves as a high-mobility fire-support platform, where the multiple independent guns dangling from it can engage several targets simultaneously and mulch any infantry it can see. The VQ-1 is heavier than most UCAVs in the Overlord system, but as a hovering gun platform it has unmatched versatility and maneuverability and is therefore naturally used for hint-and-run attacks alongside any Pursuer drones to harass and cripple enemy forces. While heavily armed, the Punisher is lightly armored, both to keep it mobile and to allow room for the micro-missile launchers, as such it rarely stays still for any length of time and have been called \u201ctwitchy\u201d due to their constant movement; however their SI coordinates firing and movement between pauses in gunfire and the sighting of enemy weapons, assuring that the enemy has no bead while the drone itself maintains perfect accuracy. Q/AH-66 Raider\nClassification: Unmanned, semi-autonomous combat helicopter\nHeight: 11.2 feet\nLength: 40.9 feet\nRotor diameter: 36.7 feet\nTop speed: 213 mph\nLocomotion: Coaxial 6-bladed rotor\nPower source: Microfusion cell racks\nArmament:\n--1x NOV-2-42 25mm gauss autocannon (nose mounted)\n--4 hardpoints on fuselage/wing pylons for 5,100+ lbs of ordinance (typically guided missile pods)\nDescription: The U/AH-64 is currently the largest non-fighter UACV in the Alperian military and the most well-armed to boot despite its \u201carchaic\u201d design. While the rotor system has been considered outdated in the Alperian military for over a decade now, it is used on the Raider simply because it has one saving grace: it\u2019s very cheap. While it\u2019s not normally within Alperian principle to waste anything or consider a unit \u201cexpendable\u201d the Raider is designed to be sent on high-danger missions where survivability is low. The Raider\u2019s primary role is demolition of AAA in areas where it would be considered too dangerous to even send in a Talon III fighter. The drone is mostly autonomous (it is issued targets via the IAWNCL and then carries out the action on its own), capable of engaging targets and using its weapons under its own power but can also have control overridden by a human operator. Its secondary role is as the director for \u201cST-1 airborne suicide drones\u201d; tiny (about half as large as a human torso) flying robots that explode in proximity to priority targets, slaving them to the IAWNCL so they can be issued targets. FQ-45 Ghost\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous multirole fighter\nHeight: 9.3 feet\nLength: 39 feet\nWingspan: 49.5 feet (flying wing)\nTop speed: 2,346 mph\nLocomotion: 2x concealed Y2-99UD-Y pitch-thrust vectoring stealth pulse engines\nPower source: Miniaturized fusion reactor\nArmament:\n--1x F-13 light plasma-based laser cannon\n--2 internal-rotary bomb bays for 5 bombs/missiles each\nDescription: Built with utility in mind, the Ghost is an inexpensive alternative to the Talon III fighter for maintaining air-superiority in a combat zone; yet is able to fill a ground-attack role. The Talon III fighter is expensive; the most advanced aircraft ever built, and while having exceptional performance is few in number. Alperia doesn\u2019t typically use fighters except as strike-weapons; pinpoint targeting of important targets both near and far, expecting their over-armed gunships to also perform general anti-air roles. As such, the Talon is rare and in constant demand for destroying distant enemy targets or taking out AAA, therefore the Ghost was built to provide assistance if enemy aircraft are giving Alperian gunships too much trouble or to assist in ground-attack if that is not a problem. The Ghost is fully autonomous, capable of engaging enemy fighters and designated ground targets without any controller assistance. CQV-13 Harbinger\nClassification: Unmanned, fully-autonomous 2nd-line medium-capacity transport\nHeight: 18.6 feet (21.2 feet with landing claws extended)\nLength: 99.6 feet\nWingspan: 84.5 feet\nTop speed: 668 mph\nLocomotion: 2x AA I-9 omnidirectional pulse engines, 4x AA I-6 pitch-thrust pulse engines\nCapacity: 100,000 lbs cargo\nPower source: Miniaturized fusion reactor\nArmament: N/A\nDescription: Little more than a flat, flying square with a quartet of small wings; the actual fuselage is only a few feet thick with the engines and landing struts hanging from the edges. Designed strictly for a support role, the entire aircraft is a lift surface allowing the small aircraft to carry an extremely disproportionate weight in cargo containers which are connected to the bottom of the fuselage between the two landing struts. Said cargo containers are standard-use containers and the magnetic/GJSSC-compatible grapples can carry anything from individual ammunition drums to oversized shipping containers. Due to the lack of an actual fuselage the aircraft can\u2019t carry infantry or personnel unless they are in specialized, pressurized containers built for that purpose; also due to this when carrying cargo the Harbinger loses its aerodynamics and it noticeably slows down, as such; the Harbinger is mostly saved for short jaunts transporting supplies between mobile command bases and forward outposts rather than long-distance strategic hauling. The unmanned nature and sheer hauling capacity makes the Harbinger ideal for this purpose, however it is advised they are kept away from combat if possible due to their fragility and lack of armament.Alperian Military Aircraft Fighters  F-47C Talon III\nClassification: Strike and air-superiority fighter\nGeneral characteristics\n\u2022Crew: 1\n\u2022Length: 22.6 m (74 ft 2

constructed by humans, by an incredible margin; the Umbra is as much a symbol of the seemingly-endless Alperian air-power as it is a weapon of war. The Umbras were constructed in response to Alperia's ever-increasing size and strength in its air force, even large navy ships and aircraft carriers were becoming outdated due to the pulse engine giving aircraft effectivley limitless loitering times (barring routine maintainence), in the place of the somewhat limited aircraft carriers, Alperia needed a battlefield-scale command and control platform and warning system that could act as a mobile maintence bay and munitions depot, yet also be able to keep up with their air force as a whole and be able to travel anywhere. Thus; the Umbra, named for its massive size literally being able to blot out the sun; the Umbra was created to fill a role as an airborne aircraft carrier, able to store, repair and rearm massine numbers of aircraft (even ones not stored internally) throughout heavy combat in addition to maintaining and transporting ground forces. The Umbra is a marvel of aeronautical engineering, incomportaing many new composites, engineering techniques, nanoalloys and zero-gee metallurgy, to create an aircraft far larger than any would have thought possible. Underneath its massive wingspan is slung a maw-like hangar containing storage and mounting racks for aircraft when not deployed, automated rearming facilities and numerous fully-equiped sotrage bays equipped with all the machining and micro-production equipment to perform full repairs on even critically damaged combat and utility aircraft. The Hangar has 3 decks with elevators running between them, due to the precision offered by pulse engines and their VTOL capability, the hangar can be packed much more tightly than any normal airfield/hangar. The repair and rearming facilities allow the Umbra to loiter just outside a heavy combat zone, with aircraft either damaged by enemy fire or bingo on weapons able to freely land, get repaired (assuming the damage isn't too critican) or restrocked, and reengage in combat; signifigantly increasing Alperia's air-combat endurnace. While designed to stay out of combat; the Umbra is nonetheless armed extremley heavy with the very best in Alperian ECW suites, countermeasures, point defense weapons, anti-air missiles and assored \"flak\" guns. The massive investment that is each individual Umbra means they had to be armed with defensive tech to make them all but indestrictible, able to negate even the most amassed anti-air fire. Even with all the defensive weapons, the Umbra is still able to perform stand-off line-breaking and ground bombardment though its array of cruise missiles. The Umbra has vertical silos in both the 21-34 inch models (one of Alperia's most standard VLS systems for a wide array of missiles and warheads) and the huge silos housing the massive Stratosphere heavy multi-purpose cruise missiles; new weapons of mostly classified ability, what is know is that they are ultrasonic-capable medium-range cruise missiles of titanic size, armed with advanced prototype warheads such as prototype fusion warheads, seismic devastators and other classified munitions.

The Corona is is many ways a smaller Umbra, as it has its own hangar, rearming and repair capability and some long-range missile launch capability, however the Corona also has a very large number of point defenses (some classified), and heavier anti-aircraft laser turrets, its 1st and foremost role is to keep its Umbra mothership safe from enemy aircraft and battery fire by providing a withering barrage of defensive fire and advanced ECW systems. The Corona also performs electronic warfare duties on the battlefield scale and can do the job of several E-2 Aegis by its self. The Corona-class also acts as a command nexus for UAVs and UCAVs, and is often loaded with unmanned aircraft instead of manned aircraft, as it contains the crew facilities and special equipment to maintain and operate squadrons of drones at peak effeciency.

Resembling a brutal, sleek, flying wedge studded with heavy weapons on its bottom hull; the Radiance's purpose is to be the leader of close-range assaults of heavily fortified enemy structures or cities, leading a lance of Eclipse and Halo warships deep into the enemy line. Designed for sweeping away even the heaviest resistance with its battery of superheavy plasma cannons capable of vaporizing entire city blocks with each shot and a massive array of secondary weapons capable of engaging and destroying almost any target with precision firepower. Its advanced targeting systems allow gunnery to hit a single enemy combatant in a crowd of civilians from several thousand feet in their air or devestate any counter-strike of enemy AAA or enemy aircraft, not that enemy aircraft are a problem with its escort of other warships and hordes of assault gunships like the Peregrine and Goshawk. The level of bombardment coming from an entire air assault lance would be capable of turning even the largest megacities into dust and craters in minutes if commands for complete free-fire were given. Even with all its defensive systems miraculously disabled the Radiance is designed to withstand such an insane level of punishment that it could put a Warpian armored regiment to shame. Covered in advanced lathanium-derived plasma-treated nanoalloys, liquid-state armor matrices, crystaline soft-form shock absorbers and adaptive structural reinforcements; the Radiance's redundant armors, engines and electronic subsystems read out like the resources needed to construct an entire armored division and air-combat wing. As a frontline assault air warship, endurance is a key design feature, and many of the best Alperian defensive systems and cutting-edge armor designs were integrated into the blueprints (this is relativley true across all the aerial warships, but the assault ships are the \"best\" designed in that respect; the Radiance foremost), allowing it to take a beating betraying the normal fragility of non-Alperian aircraft and surpassing many naval or ground-based assets.

The Eclipse-class is designed to operate ahead of the main Umbra fleet alongside the regular fighters and gunships, providing an apocalyptic barrage of heavy weapons fire to enemy ground forces. Armored with a several feet of advanced armors in some places, this flying battleship can take a beating that would destroy even a naval warship, and it has to...unlike a naval ship; catasthropic damage leads to a crash in aircraft, not a slow sinking; therefore the Eclipse is covered in redundant systems, sectioned safe-storage, automated damage control, emergency thrusters and of course; thick armor (the P-series craft all posess massive numbers of saftey systems, the Eclipse just has among the most for its size). While there isn't much to say about the Eclipse other than the fact that it has a ludricous number of weapons, one can look at one of its weapons; the 4 XEW-1 shock cannons; advanced concussive/electrical-based energy emitters than can change a focus to fire \"bolts\" of energy along an electron stream at ground targets that explode in a flurry of lightning and kinetic shockwave, or be tuned for a high-spread shotgun-like blast used against aircraft. Just out of prototype-phase, the shock cannons are only found on the Eclipse and Prism-class aerial warships, primarily due to their vantage point being able to take maximum advantage of the weapon. The system has many similarities to a PEP emitter, but on a massive scale and possessing a unrivaled area-of-effect damage radius.

II designated anti-ship missile launchers\n\u2022[classified] AM/ADF-2 point-defense laser turrets Description\nThe Aurora is much like the Eclipse-class battlcruiser, its a massive airborne warship designated in its entirety for offensive firepower, however; unlike the Eclipse which is designed for direct-fire assaults on the front-line; the Aurora is designed to hang back with the rest of the fleet unleasing an endless stream of devestating cruise missiles and assorted long-range ballistic weapons. Resembling a 4-winged cigar with a v-shaped bottom, every inch of the Aurora's hull is covered in vertial launch tubes, missile pods or point defense systems. With a similar role to an arsenal ship in oceanic navies, the Aurora is not designed for direct conflict but still posseses a number of point-defense weapons and some of the most advanced targeting computers ever developed, using incredible amounts of data from the IAWNCL layered and picked apart by supercomputers and expertly-trained computer technicians to optimize missile flightpaths for ultimate effectiveness. The Aurora has the missile batteries to engage any target, from enemy aircraft, to tanks, to fortified bunkers, to submarines. Despite a miniscule service record, the Auroras have already gained an infamous reputation among enemy forces (primarily rebelous city-states Alperia intervenes in) for being a force of nature that cannot be stopped, its long-range artillery has often left entire battalions blown into a crater before they even know what happened and the craft are often kept just inside visual range during \"negotiations\" to assure enemy cooperation.

While massive, the ship is mostly hollow and consists of a tapered but bulging rear section containing the main reactors and secondary power systems along with most of the heavy plasma cannons, missile pods and the two shock cannon turrets connected to a massive skeletal barrel ringed with gauss coils, lasers, electrified arcs and other charging mechanisms. At the top of the \"joint\" between the reactor section and the cannon section juts up a short fin which the bridge is mounted on, kept safe and heavily shielded from the output of the Arc Cannon. The Arc Cannon or \"Nova Gun\"; offically the \"X-0 High-Speed Exotic Plasticized Mass Charging and Projection Cannon,\" the Arc Cannon is offically the most powerful singular non-orbital weapon in the Alperian arsenal and is, technically; capable of higher overall energy output than even a singular O8 Seraphim weapons platform; which it all condenses into a single shot, rather than spaces out over a several second beam. The weapon gets its name for its highly visible multi-stage charging mechanism; first a large \"torpedo\" of layered aerogels, plastics, Terrazide gas pockets and assorted semi-solid chemicals is loaded into the central 1st stage charging chamber where the first player of plastic is lazed with the right wavelength and frequency to bypass its aerogel insulator, while the plasma is kept contained via magentic fields. The lazing procedure is repeated by the next massive array of lasers to instantly ionize and charge each layer of the torpedo until the core layer is all that remains. The final stage is where the weapon gets its name; the core is now exposed to massive amounts of electrical energy via an array of 8 massive arc generators, this electricity charges the pockets of Terrazide gas and other chemicals inside the plastic torpedo until it expodes with massive force, turing its self inside out while being contained within extremley strong magnetic forces. The gauss coils then exert a huge amount of pressure until the now-amorphous blob of pseudo-stable plasma reaches a state of active metastability through creation of its own magnetic field. This entire time the ball is continually charged with more high-powered lasers and bolts from the arc generators until the ball approaces the internal tempature of an yellow star, the amount of energy needed to do this is utterly incomprehensible and the end result is in-effect a self contained miniature sun ready to go supernova. Launched via another series of magnetic coils, this miniature sun has theroretically limitless range and could possibly break gravitational pull and go flying off into space, the cannon is therefore always aimed at the ground, where upon impact it will \"bounce\" as its magnetic field collapses and it becomes a \"red giant\" before going supernova after traveling a few hundred more meters. Needless to say...nothing near ground zero will remain, anything present will simply cease to exist. At full power (IE, firing a full-sized torpedo) the weapon will utterly annihilate everything within several miles and produce cataclysmic damage for miles further, leaving a nice spherical crater surrounded by nothing but scorched earth and ash wastes. The release of electromagnetic energy, radiation and heat will disable any electronics (even heavily hardened ones), cause irreperable damage to even the most hardened pieces of equipment and can in some outlying areas leave ash-statues of anything organic (such as humans or forests, anything with high water-content) inside the blast radius. Due to the sheer overkill of this weapon, the Prism-class possesses a small battery of powerful plasma weapons just in-case the need to vaporize and entire section of the earth is unnecessary. The Prism is fairly lightly armored and moderatley slow, and it therefore spends nearly all its time at the rear of a fleet, lobbing bolts of plasma into the distance, and is usually provided a drone escort consisting of specifically designed drones that can resists huge electromagnetic outputs. It should be noted that the Arc Cannon's firing procedure cannot be interrupted once started, as part of a safety feature to prevent a catastrophic overload, therefore; once the charging sequence has been iniated, somebody, somewhere is going to have a very bad day.

As with the Eclipse the Halo is a flying block of armor and weaponry, designed to keep the Eclipse and Radiance-classes safe and provide a role in direct fire artillery and ground-assault backup. Unlike the Eclipse however the Halo possess a very small hangar for roughtly 10 to 15 gunships (depending on class), allowing it to put up a fighter screen for the defense of the Eclipse-led aerial assault squadron. The only setting the weaponry of the Halo apart from the Eclipse-class is that the Halo possesses a set of SV-164 sonic cannons, upscaled versions of the Thundershock assault gun's main weapon, it has similar properties, only on a far larger and more powerful scale. P-114/P-115 Dawn & Dusk-classes\nClassification: Aerial Advanced Support Frigates\nGeneral characteristics\n\u2022Crew: 60 officers and enlisted + several advanced static intelligences\n\u2022Length: 476 ft (145 m)\n\u2022Wingspan: 285.4 ft (87 m)\n\u2022Height: 216 ft (65.8 m)\n\u2022Powerplant: 4x banks of 4 T&F F65-PW-2000 pulse engines, 13x AeroTech CWAS-55-U7 pulse engines Performance\n\u2022Maximum speed: 568 knots (654 mph, 1,052 km/h)\n\u2022Service ceiling: classified Armament\n\u202227x twin-linked F-20b medium laser cannon turrets\n\u202216x A-74 Webspinner vertical missile launchers\n\u202244x Agent V AIM launchers\n\u20222x Basilisk-III Heavy directed-electromagnetic pulse emitters\n\u2022[classified] AM/ADF-2 point-defense laser turrets Description\nThe Dusk and Dawn classes of aerial warship are among the most dangerous of the P-series depite having extremley reduced armaments, this is not because of its firepower but because of what the pair of them can do for an air-fleet. While nearly-identical, the two classes have a completley different function and internal mechanics; the only similarity being a pair of phase-prisim hologram networks and emitters of unmatched weight and size that can create incredibly large volumetric displays. These huge devices take up most of the internal spaces of the Dusk and Dawn, constituting signifigant power draw and while they are running at full-capacity leave the ship unable to power all its weaponry. The Dusk-class is the stealthier of the twin-ships, its secondary-system is an array of advanced stealth suits, radiological mimicry devices, thermal compensators and LiqBOS nozzels. The Dusk's purpose is to shroud the core of its fleet from scanners; using its hologram projects to put up an artifical screen of mimiced clouds and sky which its fleet can hide behind (or rather the important parts), the radiation emitters, EW countermeasures and thermal compensators to scramble enemy RADAR and other sensors via destructive interference and negative or false returns, the LiqBOS to help mask any thermal emissions in the surrounding area and a coordination system to create useful flightpath data to miniamlize suspicion for non-cloaked craft. Ultimately the Dusk-class allows even a massive air-fleet to approach an enemy line unnoticed until its already too late. Unfortunatley, the hologram emitters and mimic-systems become useless once combat starts as they can't even come close to hiding a fully-powered fleet, retreating outside of visual range or shrouding its self and hiding behind the rest of the fleet. The counterpart to the Dusk-class, the Dawn-class performs the opposite role of its sister-ship, instead creating an artifical image of a secondary air-fleet with positional data copied over from the IAWNCL. While the visual mimic is a large part of the Dawn's function, its not the only part. Much like the Dusk-class, the Dawn posses several secondary systems, in this case; a fleet of small UAVs that deliberately create excess radiological, thermal and radar (some using a specially-engineered radar-reflective \"chaff\") signatures to simulate the cross-sections of the ships in the fleet, hiding inside their holograms at key locations to give the full impression of a second fleet. The Dawn often creates a false fleet while the Dusk hides the real one, since an adequately large fleet will rase suspicion even with the Dusk's systems running at full capacity, so giving them a ghost fleet may tip the enemy off to an attack, but atleast it will have them shooting at imaginary airships. Unlike the Dusk, which often retreats to the rear-line once combat actually starts and becomes mostly useless (it might de directed to help cloak wounded or retreating aircraft) the Dawn often starts really using its abilities, creating wraith-squadrons of gunships for SAM sites to fire at, forcing enemy retreat from a sector with a fictional or augmented force size, and generally putting false blips all over enemy maps, forcing them to waste precious ammunition and time chasing ghosts.

The smallest of the P-series, only slightly smaller than the Dawn and Dusk classes in terms of tonnage and length; the Mirage is covered in the best stealth technology Alperia possesses, many drawn of prototype Verdun technologies enhanced by dedicated Alperian engineering. The Mirage is promised to be the quietest and least visible aircraft in deployment with any airforce anywhere, even bypassing Alperia's own Talon III fighter despite a size rivaling many nation's naval cruisers. For obvious reasons this stealth is put to use dropping large special operations forces behind enemy lines and acting as a mobile headquarters for rear-echelon military action, the armament of the Mirage also allows it to act as direct or ranged fire support in dire situations but its still pirmarily designed for staying out of combat and loitering near the deployment zone for rapid deployment of extraction dropships. .Utility Aircraft  UC-27B Solar\nClassification: Ultra-capacity Strategic Airlifter\nGeneral characteristics\n\u2022Crew: 4: 2 pilots, 2 loadmasters, 1 class-A AI\n\u2022Capacity: 3,800 armored infantry w/ payload racks or\n\u2022Payload: 5,900,000 lb of cargo\n\u2022Length: 550 ft (167.6 m)\n\u2022Wingspan: 607.5 ft (185.2 m)\n\u2022Height: 77.2 ft (23.5 m)\n\u2022Powerplant: 20\u00d7 T&F F117-PW-100 pulse engines, 4x T&F F65-PW-2000 pulse engines Performance\n\u2022Maximum speed: 460 knots (530 mph, 850 km/h)\n\u2022Range: unlimited\n\u2022Service ceiling: unlimited Advanced Avionics\n\u2022Long range radar warning receiver\n\u2022Numerous advanced landing and defensive systems C-145E Taskmaster\nClassification: Strategic/Tactical Airlifter\nGeneral characteristics\n\u2022Crew: 3: 2 pilots, 1 loadmaster\n\u2022Capacity:\n----120 armored infantry or\n----40 litter and 58 ambulatory patients\n\u2022Payload: 520,000 lb of cargo\n\u2022Length: 182 ft (55.4 m)\n\u2022Wingspan: 179.8 ft (54.8 m)\n\u2022Height: 55.1 ft (16.8 m)\n\u2022Empty weight: 282,500 lb (128,100 kg)\n\u2022Powerplant: 4\u00d7 T&F F117-PW-100 pulse engines\n\u2022Fuel source: AMI-8TW-2847/A-6 miniaturized fusion reactor Performance\n\u2022Maximum speed: 750 knots (863 mph, 1,389 km/h)\n\u2022Range: unlimited\n\u2022Service ceiling: unlimited but the craft is not rated for pressure above 47,000 ft Advanced Avionics\n\u2022Long range radar warning receiver\n\u2022Numerous advanced landing and defensive electronicsSpecialized Aircraft  U-79 Phantom\nClass: High-altitude hypersonic delivery craft\nGeneral characteristics\n\u2022Crew: 3: 2 pilots, 1 loadmaster\n\u2022Capacity:\n----10 HAAIV-SIV2/Mk.

While the exact system is classified, the kinetic absorber is a high tech system using rapidly hardening electrostatic gel that hardens when an electric current is run through it. The HAAIV can be launched only from the U-61 aircraft, but delivers 2 infantry right into the heart of enemy concentrations without major threat of AA fire, wreaking havoc and sowing confusion if vital points of the enemy force are hit. This allows a single aircraft to deliver a large 20-man squad, or a few to drop whole platoons of well-armed and armored PCAS-equipped infantry. Currently the PCAS is required for a safe landing, and even so with a small chance of damage on impact. The system is designed mainly to hit heavily entrenched enemy forces right in a weak spot by simply bypassing the defenses, it can also be used to clear a landing zone for more conventionally transported infantry. The pod is reusable after certain plates and the gel is replaced. HAAIV-RWSV \u201dBladegrass\u201d Support Pod\nClassification: Experimental support droppod\nPayload:\n---dual 40mm chaingun or\n---125mm AT cannon or\n---Missile artillery system or\n---Archer AA system or\n---supply drop; can be loaded with almost any needed object of proper size\nDescription: The Bladegrass is an evolution of the HAAIV system designed it deliver not infantry; but a heavy fire support weapon on-demand. The Bladegrass is a modified HAAIV pod that contains a heavy weapon and its ammunition, the pod is launched to earth by the U-61, and upon impact unfolds and connects to a remote human operator who ordered the launch, the Bladegrass is then remotely operated like a turret and can unleash a withering barrage. The Bladegrass was designed mainly to showcase the advantages of an on-demand fire support option to bolster the already impressive automated Alperian military force. Currently the system is designed only to provide instant fortification and heavy-support to HAAIV-launched shock teams, however; it may soon become a large staple of Alperian military tactics. As with the HAAUV, the Bladegrass system is reusable.Alperian Naval Warships  Borealis-class (3 produced, the ANS Borealis, ANS Silence, ANS Justice, project finished)\n\u2022Classification: Supercarrier and amphibious assault/fleet headquarters\n\u2022Crew: 2,400+\n\u2022Displacement: lol\n\u2022Powerplant: 1 AP4 nuclear fusion reactor, 1 backup AP1 nuclear fusion reactor\n\u2022Propulsion: 8 screw propellers\n\u2022Maximum speed: 34 knots\n\u2022Range: unlimited\n\u2022Hull Length: 688m (2257.2ft)\n\u2022Deck Length: 702m (2303.1ft)\n\u2022Beam: 121m (397.4ft)\n\u2022Height: 60m (196.8ft)\n\u2022Armament:\n--41x AM/ADF-2 laser turrets, providing complete anti-missile and fighter coverage\n--18x Fathom-class surface-to-surface guided missile launchers (3 missiles per launcher)\n--8x 350mm surface bombardment artillery rail-cannons firing kinetic munitions\n\u2022Carrying capacity:\n--over 280 fighter-craft or a mix of fighters, bombers, dropships, gunships, some transport aircraft and antisubmarine warfare craft + additional UAV/UCAVs\n--an additional mechanized battalion or mechanized infantry battalion and needed amphibious transports\n--Has a sub bay located at the bottom of the hull, capable of maintaining most smaller Alperian submarines.

It is the first fully-automated Alperian warship and therefore has no crew or superstructure aside from a few sensor towers and balancing structures. The extremely minimal waterline and lack of a superstructure combined with stealth features and advanced electronic countermeasures make targeting the ship very difficult. Due to their nature as floating artillery batteries the ships are often far-removed from combat but still have a powerful point-defense system for protection against counter-battery fire.

While small, the Mechanis-class still is well into the tonnage of a destroyer, due to its dense armor and completely-packed interior; filled with missile launchers, reloading systems, reactors and powerful directed energy weapons. Direct-energy microwave weapons are not common on Alperian warships except as PD because they tend to interfere with crew performance due to the lack of heavy shielding, the Mechanis; being automated has plenty of excess room for shielding and needed countermeasures. Much like the Haymaker-class arsenal ship; the Mechanis-class has a nearly-nonexistant superstructure (but maintains the conventional tumblehome hull); increasing the fields of fire for its plentiful anti-air and point-defense systems.

The Garvon-class was developed to fill this need; a highly capable warship for its size, with decent firepower, high capacity for aircraft and land-forces and exceptional speed (all due to a trimaran design). The Garvon was designed with peacekeeping and patrolling in mind.

Alperian submarines are the epitome of stealth and speed, and are the main focus of Alperian naval warfare. I omitted amphibious warfare vessels due to their somewhat inconsequential nature in-combat; however Alperia still maintains a varied fleet of them for the Breaker corps.Megatron (Transformers Prime)  Name: Megatron (Originally D-16, changed to Megatronus and then shortened to Megatron) Origin: Transformers Prime Gender: Male Species: Cybertronian Affilation: Decepticons (Leader) Age: Unknown, likely several thousand years old FactPile Tier: Mid Superhuman Powers and Abilities: Superhuman strength, speed, durability, reaction time, stamina and agility, expert hand to hand combatant, immortaility (Type 1), transformation into a Cybertronian jet, flight | Increased superhuman physical stats and flight speed, regeneration, technopathy Weaknesses: Nothing noteworthy Lifting Strength: Class K+ (Starscream and Bulkhead were both capable of holding up the entire rooftop of a cave, Megatron is easily stronger than both of them combined.

The valleys are usually dedicated to farming operations, and only rarely for major cities, as usually the cities are placed on more easily defensible mountain sides.Government:  Ruled in a self-proclaimed Neo-Feudalism. The Primier is voted in ever 7 years by the Dukes of House Lrak. The Duke of the People and Duke of Science is filled by the Primier while the Knight of the Realm is voted in every 3 years by Lords of each of the territories. They work as advisors and advocates over each of their assigned areas. The Primier leads the nation into the future but has very little direct control. The trivumiate are the ones that put into action the Primier's policies. The Duke of the People over sees the Economy, the Welfare of the People, and Education. The Duke of Science over sees Usuage of Technology, Research Projects, and Nature. The Knight of the Realm represents the Common People in State Affairs. He has to have been in the Armored Soldiary for over 10 years to be alligable.Demographics:  While fairly diverse, it's primarily made up of English speaking peoples, with ethnicities ranging from Japanese to English.Economy and Sciences:  See themselves as rivals with the Alperian Tech, but really are no where near capable of matching their lofty heights... yet. While Alperia is tight lipped with it's advanced flight systems and battlesuit designs, the Lrak scientists have been diligantly working on their own flavor of heavy powered armor and more efficent airplane engines. This has come at cost in that it has left the majority of the other vechicles and aircraft lagging behind greatly. However the scientist contiunely promise breakthroughs are just around the corner. Having seen the despicableness of Anti-GSC forces, and the horrible monsters the Infor create; House Lrak eventually allied and submitted to the GSC mandates and began open trade with other GSC nations. Output is controlled by local Lords and Dukes, and with oversight by the Duke of the People has made the DGC's economy quite stable.Military Structure  The Military is focused around the Armored Soldiery. Whose primary vechicles are battlemechs, a less mobile version of Alperian battlesuits. All mechs of either deployable, or static treads to increase long-range mobility. Everything is dedicated to supporting the battlemechs, tanks and other vechicles are usually second-line at best, and even then, there are more artillery in use by the Lrak then there are tanks. The priority of the DGC's Military goes as follows: The Armored Soldiery is broken up into separate AS Sokogun (Armies) each of which control 5 Rentai. Each Rentai consists of 4 Shidans, and each Shidan is comprised of usually 8 Buntai. Buntai' are always either 3 or 4 mechs strong, and are usually but not by definition the same type of 'Mech. Though Buntai' can be substituted with Sapotos of tanks, infantry, or other supporting vehicles. For instance, an aerial assault Sokogun would replace at least two Buntai per Shidan with TsK-16 transports.**Military Doctrine**  Those who are fit enough to pilot Battlemechs have to go through very tough and very long training to be given the honour to ride such a machine into combat. Before you even go into any simulators, you have to go through at least 2 years of study and physical training. So that even before the pilots step inside a mech, they are already a powerful force. The next best thing to piloting a Battlemech, is to be a Dropship Commander. Because it is their duty to get the mechs in and out of combat zones in one piece. They go through even longer training with even more intensive simulations. Because even dropships are armed, the Dropship Commander must be a warrior in his own right.Armored Soldiery As-105 Assassin [1]  Class: Tactical Combat Mech\n Height: 7 Meters\n Weight: 70 Tons\n Armor: Lightweight Composite Armor, w/ Carbon fiber layers and Aluminum Substructure.\nSPEED\n -Walking\u00a0: 45kph\n -RK Drive\u00a0: 105kph (under ideal conditions)\nWEAPONS\n 1x Left Arm-Mounted 110mm High-Velocity Rifle\n 3x Right Arm-Mounted F-22 Heavy Solid-State Plasma-based Laser Cannons (SSPLC)\n 2x Shoulder-Mounted Chaff Launchers\n 2x Shoulder-Mounted 5-Shot Rocket Launchers The Assassin was the first Battlemech to used the breakthrough Roraken Tracked Drive System. It is still one of the most mobile 'mech designs available. Knights freqently use this mech even if their units usually field heavier mechs and often customize their mechs. While it's name is Assassin, the standard model does not employ any stealth systems. However should anyone be targeting the mech, it can use two chaff launchers on it's shoulders to hopefully scramble any attempts to lock on.Ka-144 Kanazuki [2]  Class: Close-Quarters Assault Mech\n Height: 7.5 Meters\n Weight: 140 Tons\n Armor: Heavy Composite Armor -Walking\u00a0: 25kph\n -RK Drive\u00a0: 70kph 1x Torso-Mounted 250mm Snub-Nosed Cannon\n 2x Arm-Mounted F-57 Reinforced SSPLC Created specifically to fight the Infor, it was known that the Infor a cowardly rats and thus hide like them too. So House Lrak needed to create a mech specifically for urban combat while being able to bust through any defense. Armed to the teeth, it features a large 250mm cannon in it's torso, however it wasn't given a full barrel so it's effective range is diminished, but it's power has not. Should a Kanazuki get in range of a hardened target, it's only a matter of time before it is torn to shreds. However the powerful kickback from the cannon means that the pilot must take care when firing it.Bx-55 Battle Axe [3]  Class: Frontline Assault Mech\n Height: 8.5 Meters\n Weight: 155 Tons\n Armor: Composite Armor -Walking\u00a0: 30kph\n -RK Drive\u00a0: 80kph 1x Left Arm-Mounted 155mm High-Velocity Rifle\n 3x Right Arm-Mounted F-32 Super-Heavy SSPLC\n 1x Torso-Mounted 15mm Heavy Minigun Created to be the backbone of the Armored Solidary, the Battle Axe is both well armored and well armed.

I'm looking for some people to start a nice wargame running on the forum here taking place in 2094 and long after all modern nations have collapsed (also the earth looks totally different but that's for another time). I can provide a timeline of the \"current\" era and a template for anyone willing to make a nation. Currently we need nations for both the LIN and IP alliances, the technology level is roughly \"twenty minutes into the future\" standard chemical propellant ballistic weapons dominate most armies, directed energy weapons are only used by the richest nations, advanced body armor, awesome tanks, etc, etc. However it is still more advanced than modern tech. -Timeline and Other Items of import are being modified.

March 15, 2015:\nIsrael and other west-supported/ing countries are attacked and heavily damaged by a combined arms task force of numerous Middle Eastern nations coinciding with tactical nuclear strikes for the first time in human history. This causes widespread panic about a nuclear war that never comes, instead the western powers begin mobilizing for a war with the east and the impoverished nations of the world (led by the example of challenging the established western order). 2015-2020:\nThe Third Great war rages across the world on a scale unlike anything ever unleashed upon humanity. Technology expands in a firestorm and numerous new weapons are advanced by the US and the world in general, namely in the field of seismic WMDs, directed energy weapons and magnetic weaponry. Late 2019:\nThe US unleashes their three prototype seismic bombs in the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, near the Himalayas, and Mediterranean sea; these detonations at fault lines causes an untold level of destruction on a world wide scale, actually forming new fault lines and causing a massive change in the world\u2019s geography, sinking landmasses, causing new ones to rise and accelerating the geological timescale by millions of years in mere months. Numerous nations are swallowed whole, killing untold millions. This becomes known as the \u201cThe Great Fault.\u201d July 4, 2020:\nAfter the US public learns of this horror, the US government is overthrown and replaced by a weak totalitarian state, bringing WW3 to an end. Countless nations no longer exist either through the economic effects or war or their total disappearance in The Great Fault and the effects of the global environmental changes. Mid 2020:\nThe remaining nations (mostly China, Russia, parts of Europe, and the US and Canada) are extremely weakened and isolationist, the new US more so than any other. Early 2026:\nAfter almost two decades of every nation falling apart, the last nation, China; finally falls. 2026-2038:\n\u201cThe Second Dark Age\u201d a period of minor technological drops and a chaotic run of \u201ccity-states\u201d forming before finally being ripped apart through conquest by rival states or internal strife. July 15, 2038:\nThe most successful of the City-States an Imperial monarchy called Drakite begins a conquest of the world after they conquer most of the surrounding area. Mid 20 2051:\nMost of the world has been conquered by the new \u201dDrakite Empire.\u201d The most major of the Drakite territories; Warpus, Alperia, Gridiron, Thorgun, and others are heavy developed and successful, and many other sections of the nation are well off. There are also poor, run down areas filled with anti-imperial militants. May 25, 2055:\nThe Drakite emperor is assassinated by an unknown party and the empire breaks, with each territory becoming their own nation. The 4 most powerful; The Warpian Protectorate (Warpus), Alperia (Alperia), The Peacekeeper Alliance (Thorgun), Gridiron (Gridiron) and others set off to claim as large a patch as they can set off to conquer the far weaker nations. 2055-2061:\nThe First Drakite war takes place; as the four new nations attempt to rule and the Drakite remnant attempts to reclaim their former power. December 7, 2061:\nThe Peacekeeper Alliance, Fearing that an invasion by the TWP and new Drakite Empire is imminent, launches multiple bio-weapons (including a Rabies-like mutagen causing what have been nicknamed \u201czombies\u201d) against the TWP and the Drakite Empire. Shocked by this betrayal, TWP and Alperia team up and crush The Peacekeeper Alliance under a combined arms attack force, this will cement the friendship that Alperia will share with the Warpians for decades to come. The government is removed and the nation is built up as a fellow superpower, however considerable anti-Alperian/TWP sentiment exists in the PKA, one that will come around to strike back at the allied nations. 2063:\nSeveral more nations have been able to form with help of TWP and Alperia via trade and political unification. What is left of Drakoria has been split into a southern and northern island. The northern half being very willing to help other nations and the Southern half being very isolationist and dangerously hostile to anyone approaching the island. April 4, 2069:\nThe PKA declares war on the other nations with the launch of several missiles loaded with bio-weapons which detonate over several capital cities, causing untold woe. TWP and Alperia managed to save themselves with anti-missile lasers that had long been constructed as a WMD deterrent. Despite this attack, many of the nations where unwilling to attack the powerful PKA, leaving most of the fighting to be done by the Nothern Drakites, Alperia, and TWP. A massive airborne and naval strike was initiated against the PKA, and after over a year of hard fighting the government was removed and the nation left to rebuild its self with extensive oversight from the newly formed Global Stability Council (the new UN). Infor, a GSC nation that had supplied the PKA with their bio-weapons are forcibly removed from the GSC and subject to severe economic sanctions, this causes them to retreat ever-further into the obsession with biology and eventually become the PKA and SDs number-one supplier of biotechnology and weaponry. This alliance soon becomes known as the Isenberg Pact, and extends its hand to all nations and city-states who are downtrodden and feel abused or forgotten by the powers of the GSC. April 9, 2074:\nWhile small wars and infighting continues among the less stable nations and controlled areas, along with interference from the larger GSC and IP nations via proxy wars. On this date the new Alperian Technocracy (renamed in honor of the final switch of the nation\u2019s government) and the Warpian Protectorate are the first signers of the New Holstice Convention, a bill passed by the Global Stability Council to reinstate a combination of the Geneva and Hague conventions modified to the present time. August 29, 2079:\nAlperia completes it militarization of space with the last node added to the //ANSS Mechanis//, making a total grid of over 20 manned space stations containing backup command centers, \u201cshield installations,\u201d infantry garrisons, research centers, and an asteroid belt mining command nexus; along with thousands of satellites from the \u201cHand of God\u201d (massive kinetic energy weapons), \u201cSeraphim\u201d (orbital solid-state chemical lasers, think Command and Conquer), and the \u201cHard-kill\u201d anti-ballistic missile grid (a grid of lasers finally making any sort of hostile ballistic missile strike futile, associated with the Seraphim system) weapon systems. All satellites are cloaked in both active-camouflage and extensive electronic stealth systems, making finding the units all but impossible. March 4th, 2080:\nThe charter for the League of Independent Nations is formally signed by nations such as Paradine, the Commonwealth of Ursaca and Firedonia, forming a 3rd faction that stands between the extremism of the GSC and IP and mainly seeking to just keep to its self in a world in constant danger of being overrun with madmen and mutated animals. 2082:\nAlperia and TWP unveil their system for mining the asteroids belts to the world, several major companies from both nations combined with government funding has started up a number of private and government-owned automated mining complexes in the Sol system\u2019s main asteroid field, turning almost legendary profit. 2082-2086:\nThe PKA has rebuilt its self and along with numerous nations that feel betrayed, neglected and abused by the richer GSC nations formalizes the creation of the Isenberg Pact (before it had been just a name). The Isenberg Pact stands in diametric opposite to the GSC in every way. The IP being a very loose and unregulated alliance mainly controlled through fear and money (both high exports of the PKA, SDs and Infor). The GSC becoming an ever-more withdrawn and rule obsessed \"gated community\" of rich and powerful nations who primarily help themselves rather than others. November 9, 2088:\nThe Northern Scottish Republic goes to war with the Knight's Order, both being GSC nations; this creates a huge political debacle that eventually leads to a betrayal by the NSR as it brings in numerous neutral and LIN nations to assist in invading the mountainous nation. Despite being drastically outnumbered the KO military easily defends its fortress-nation while the rest of the GSC formalizes invasion plans. The Invasion plans culminate in a 3-day long invasion of the NSR by the TWP which causes all other participating nations to instantly drop their invasion of the KO and accept unconditional surrender, leading to extensive reparations paid to the KO. Mid 2092:\nThe IP, more specifically the PKA, drop all financial support of the nation of Ignorma due in part to the Inforians using it as a testing ground for their new plagues and hyper-mutated fauna causing it to slide into a nature-overrun anarchy of never-ending bloodshed and entire cities being devoured or overrun in a single night. This trend is starting to become a giant issue over the entire planet; as Inforian bioengineered superfauna and superflora have replaced over 80% of the pre-fault environmental niches and expand at an incredible rate, mutating into entirely different \"species\" in the course of only a handful of generations. New hyperlethal viruses and bacterial plagues infect most city states and non-GSC nations and reports of mythical-sounding Inforian megabeasts (named the \"11 Great Ones\") regularly demolish entire areas of unclaimed land. The Earth is quickly becoming a tenuous balance between mankind's technology and the bioengineered monsters of the Infor, seeing as how even the \"least lethal\" of the new Inforian species tend to be far more dangerous than anything on pre-fault earth, combined with actively hostile plant-life that can grow miles a day...it's debatable if man can survive the second coming apocalypse. Early 2094:\nLet the games begin.Character Tiers  This section will show hopes to provide a clear classification for the characters and other elements that do battle within the Factpile Universe. While some categories have a very distinct advantage over others, it is well understood that some characters fluctuate in power levels depending on versions, setting, and other inherent variables. This means that a character that is generally considered to be within the Low Metahuman (T 5:C), could conceivably do battle against one within the High Metahuman (T 5:A), or even Low Herald (T 4:C), and still have very good chances of victory Note: also to be redoneCharacter Tiers God (Tier 0)  This Tier is composed of the Truly Infinite beings beyond all things and all beings. Examples (T 0) - The-One-Above-All,The Presence, and Mother of Existence.Abstract (Tier 1)  This Tier is composed of beings that are effectively incomprehensible. Most of the characters that fall within this tier have almost no weaknesses, or none that are known, and the limits to their abilities are also unknown. Most characters within this Tier are or Cosmic forces. Examples (T 1) - Eternity, Galactus, Chaos Gods, Krona,The Living Tribunal, Shuma-Gorath, ZeedMillenniumon, The Q, Onslaught, Mandrakk, Thought Robot,Pre-Retcon Molecule ManSkyfather (Tier 2)  Characters within this Tier are generally considered to be some of the most powerful dieties within their sphere of influence. Most of these beings are either close to Omnipotence, have dominion over numerous other godly beings. The limits of their power are generally unknown, but they do have some distinct weaknesses. Examples (T 2) - God Emperor of Mankind, Odin, Zeus, Gaia, Trigon, Doormamu,Son Goku(DBS)Sub-Skyfather (Tier 3)  This Tier is composed of characters that are considered to be close to Skyfather status, but have considerable limitations. These limits may be seen in the form of powerfull weaknesses, or other encumbering character traits. Most of these beings are still generally to be known as deities within their sphere of influence. Examples (T 3) - Amazo, King Thor, The Keeper, Space Marine Primarchs, Darth Nihilus, Apocalypse,Herald (Tier 4)  This Tier is composed of characters within a broad range of abilities that far excede those of even other supernatural beings, but they are not natural deities or otherwise be considered Gods within their sphere of influence (save perhaps in their own minds) Examples: High Herald (T 4:A) - Cyborg Superman, Abaddon-The Despoiler, Green Scar Hulk, Green Lantern (Hal, Kyle, Alan), Silver Surfer, Stardust, Son Goku (DBZ) Mid Herald (T 4:B) - Beta Ray Bill, Kharn, Flash, Black Adam, Savage Hulk, Wonder Woman, Black Bolt, Captain Marvel, Ares-God of War Low Herald (T 4:C) - Drax-The Destroyer, Super Skrull, Herald, Superboy, Tempest, Ultron, Spawn, Sephiroth, Ganondorf,DarquesseMetahuman (Tier 5)  Characters within this Tier are amongst the most numerous across the Factpile Multiverse. These individuals have abilities or other attributes that place them far above your average person. Many of these characters have even transcended onto higher Tiers at different points in their lives due to their exceptional powers. Examples: High Metahuman (T 5:A) - Samus Aran, Iron Man, Storm, Kratos, Dante, Gambit, T-1000 Mid Metahuman (T 5:B) - Cyborg, Cloud Strife, Sonic-The Hedgehog, Wolverine, Spider-man, Deadpool, Colossus, Terminator Low Metahuman (T 5:C) - Captain America, Master Chief, Boba Fett, Link, Iron Fist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, Daredevil, Beast BoyStreet (Tier 6)  This Tier collects characters that have no super-human abilities, or ones that are barely relevant for matches. Examples: High Street (T 6:A) - Batman, Elektra, Hawkeye/Ronin, Green Arrow, Solid Snake, Roland Deschain, Conan-The Barbarian Mid Street (T 6:B) - Mach IV, Misty Knight, Moon Knight, Nomad, Peacemaker, Punisher Low Street (T 6:C) -

He lived in the upper echelons of society and made his money primarily through blackmail, using his telepathy to extort the secrets from the wealthy. While conducting some business, Jace is attacked by creatures summoned by members of the Infinite Consortium. After a small amount of background research, Jace confronts the Consortium's master Tezzeret and learns that these attacks were in fact an \"invitation\" for Jace to join Tezzeret's Infinite Consortium. With some hesitation, Jace agrees and begins training with Tezzeret to hone his telepathy for the Consortium's use.\nJace is partnered with a blademaster by the name of Kallist, who by some coincidence looks remarkably like Jace, and together they begin to train each other in their own specialities between assignments. After a few years, Jace begins to realize how badly the Consortium's attitudes have impacted him, and starts to feel guilty, ironically, of not feeling guilty about some of the things he has done in the Consortium's name. Things begin to come to a head when a mission to Kamigawa ends spectacularly with the massacre of a Nezumi village. In punishment, Tezzeret has Jace beaten for failing, though the mission failed through no fault of Jace's.\nShortly thereafter, an agent of Nicol Bolas, the original master of the Infinite Consortium and Tezzeret's main rival, contacts Tezzeret over a mining dispute on an unknown plane. Tezzeret schedules a meeting with the dragon on an arctic plane and brings Jace along to insure that Bolas does not probe Tezzeret's mind. Jace becomes distracted while the dragon converses with them both, and his defenses, which were untested to begin with, fail. After fleeing for his life with Tezzeret, Jace succumbs to frostbite and loses a toe. This is the least of his injuries though, as Tezzeret uses a manablade to torture Jace for having failed despite his inexperience and the vast difference of power that Bolas possessed.\nFinally, Jace grows uneasy with Tezzeret's methods and lust for power, and after refusing a task which went against his very nature, he ultimately falls out of Tezzeret's graces. Jace takes Kallist with him and flees to the far reaches of Ravnica in hopes of escaping the Consortium's wrath. While trying to lay low, the pair run into the lovely necromancer Liliana Vess who flirts endlessly with both of them, finally settling into a torrid affair with Jace. Without Jace's knowledge, and a heavy heart, Liliana reveals where Jace and Kallist had settled to the Consortium. In a desperate attempt to save both their lives, Jace tries to absorb Kallist's mind and ends up switching bodies with the assassin.\nSix months later, \"Jace\" in Kallist's body dies and his mind returns to its original body with extreme trauma to Jace's psyche. Liliana takes him away to recover and urges him to pursue Tezzeret for his part in Kallist's death. This results in Tezzeret and Jace scheming against each other, Tezzeret trying to kill Jace for his insubordination and impudence, and Jace just wanting to finally be free from Tezzeret and the Consortium. Jace turns to Nicol Bolas for help in locating Tezzeret's sanctum, and he and Liliana assault the artificer's base. Ultimately, the attack fails, Jace is captured, and Liliana's treachery comes to light. Tezzeret spends months constructing an artifact to control Jace's mind without damaging his abilities, all the while having Jace tortured. Liliana approaches the captured Jace and tries to make him understand the reasons she'd done the things she did. She genuinely cares for Jace and betrays Tezzeret helping to free Jace and together they once again attempt to destroy Tezzeret. Ultimately, the two duel resulting in Jace wiping out Tezzeret's mind leaving the consortium without a leader. Jace made a vow to himself to help Liliana in any way that he could.\nIt is later revealed that Jace, despite his hesitance, has taken over the Ravnican cell of the Infinite Consortium for lack of any better option at the time.References  Things to Expect From Jace\n Mind Control Memory augmentation Event Rearrangement Terrain ChangeHelion Directorate The Helion Directorate  Drakite Wars Backing: League of Independent Nations (LIN) Motto: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Capital: Helios Largest City: Helios (Pop: 6,102,029) Official Languages: English, French, Irish, Swedish Government Type: Republican Directorate Population: 320,000,000 Total: 320,000,000 Economy: Social Liberal/Socialist Major Exports: Natural resources (Iron, Steel (See below), Metals), Genetic Technology, Wine, Potatoes, Cultural and Intellectual Produce (Movies, music, books, history), Medical Products Major Imports: Natural resources, raw materials and high-tech technological products. Currency: Credits and Social CreditsGeography and Environment  The geography of the Directorate is very varied, even though it is not massively large. Based on both a section of mainland, coastline and a considerable number of islands geography varies from the islands, which are lightly wooded, grassy with the occasional large hill in the middle, to the coast which is quiet temperate, (and in the south very temperate, almost Mediterranean) while as you go further inland, and north, the geography changes rapidly to dense forests and woods, larger and larger mountains towards the centre and north, quiet boggy in sections but with some plains as well. The far north is very heavily wooded, mountainous and rugged. The far south, and south eastern coast are very moderate, great for wine and olives.Government  The Directorate is split, like most countries, into three parts. The Executive, Judicurary and Legislature. However, there is a lot of difference between the manner in which elements of this government run, and the manner most governments run. First, the Legislature. Called the Assembly, it is filled with 250 Senators, elected from the 165 d\u00e9partement spread across the country, and 85 people randomly chosen from the populace (To be chosen one must fit a number of pre-requisites, and while taking your seat can be delayed for up to three years, one must eventually take their seat for a term). They do the majority of the governing, and the three main political parties (The names would be meaningless, so I shall refer to them by their political outlook) are the Socialists, Social Liberal and Bonaparists. It is rare for one to have over half the vote at any one time. The Assembly is structured quiet differently to other nations, in that while there is 'government', this government is not the Executive (Per-say), and can have most of their decisions overruled by the Executive. The Executive are 20 Directors. The system of Directors is rather complex, in how they are chosen and what their role is. I shall deal with both, one after another. First, the Directors are not elected. Instead, their ranks are filled from five sources: The government at the time may choose four Directors who serve out until the governments term finishes, three Directors are randomly chosen from the populace (Far stricter pre-requisites than to be a Senator), four Directors are semi-permanent with the position usually being filled by the choice of the retiring Director (With the support of the Assembly. More on this later), four Directors are chosen from the Intelligentsia (Intellectuals, scientists etc) by peer-review and five are chosen from what are called the 'five cornerstones of society' (By peer review): One member of the medical service, one person from the legal service, one teacher, one military officer and police officer. --- The powers available to Directors vary depending on the type of Director they are. I shall deal with each in turn. The governmental Directors, due to their relatively (When compared to the other Directors) short terms of office have less power than would be expected for their positions in the government. The four governmental Directors are usually the four leading members of the political party with the majority of the Assembly, and will oversee the Home Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Treasury. The three random Directors form three out of the five members of the Public Oversight Committee, who in conduction with Assembly have the responsibility of overseeing the entire political system and government, and have considerable powers of investigation and the ability to remove (Sometimes needing the support of elements of the Assembly) almost anyone from positions of power. --- The semi-permanent positions are the Ministry for Intelligence, the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry for Trade, Economy,Industry and Business and the Ministry for Transportation and Infrastructure. Each of these Directors have control over their respective ministry, and must obey to an extent the commands of the government, however they are still legally and politically independent and truly only answerable to the Assembly, the Public Oversight Committee and the general public (who can force a referendum on forcing the resignation of any member of the political system if they get 1/10 of the current population to sign document stating their unhappiness with him or her). --- The four Directors from the Intelligentsia are split into two. Two of them are on the Public Oversight Committee, while the other two jointly control the Ministry for Science, Research and Higher Education. The remaining five Directors, chosen from their respective careers, are in charge of the Ministries which oversee their areas of expertise (The military officer in charge of the Ministry for Defence, the doctor in charge of the Health Ministry, etc) --- Directors have numerous other powers, which you can find out out about by asking me (I could write a lot more on this political system) ---Demographics  The demographics of Helion are made up a number of the ethnic and cultural remnants of countries, almost all European. The main ones are Ireland, Britain and France, with considerable and large sections of Nordic countries, and a considerable minority of Canadians. This has given the demographic nature of Helion a unique flavour, with all the ethnic identities managing to mix while remaining separate, as part of the multicultural policy adopted by Helion, based upon the very successful policy of Britian. For the most part, the country is split into areas populated by one population in majority, and areas where they all mix. --- One of the major exports and international influences of Helion is its music, art and culture. Unlike most of the modern countries of the world, Helion has kept alive cultural traditions dating back hundreds if not thousands of years. French culture is alive and well, as is Irish, British and all the other cultures that made up modern Helion. This has made it a very, very popular tourist destination, and is one of, if not the cultural powerhouses in the modern world. --- Education, Medicine and Public Services: Helion has inherited the Nordic and French traditions of heavily socialized medicine, education and transport and offers world class standards of all, paid for by an intelligent tax system based upon the highly successful system's of Sweden and a number of other European nations. One of the distinct elements of the Helion system of public services has been called \"Social Credits\" {C The idea behind it is simple: All citizens of Helion have the right to a very good level of medical care, education and general welfare when they need it. However, serving the state should be rewarded. This gave rise to the system of social credits, that takes a number of forms. The first and most simple way of thinking of it is that its almost like a second currency. Higher levels of welfare can be accessed using it, and it is earned in a variety of ways. The first way is by working as a public servant, be that in the civil service, military, police or any other government run institution. Those who work for the government and then paid less wages than might be expected of such a state as Helion, however the difference is made up for in social credits, allowing employee's of the state to avail of a higher standard of welfare for themselves and their family in a number of forms. The next way it functions has been labelled as ingenious: In order to deal with the perceived and also real problems of long-term unemployed people draining state assets with no returns, Helion instituted a three part system to assist in dealing with the jobless. The first is that for every job they refuse without valid grounds, their welfare is reduced, until it reaches a set level at which they have to appear before a judicial committee and explain why they have not taken any work offered. If their excuses fail to live up to expectations, their welfare can and likely will be removed. The second part of the system is that those who seem to genuinely have fallen on hard times, are attempting to increase or change their skill-sets in order to find work are assisted heavily by the government, and earn social credits as they are educated. Another element of the system, the third part, is that does not working who are deemed viable for the scheme must take part in public works schemes, such as construction or other public services in order to avoid welfare cuts. The final part, the second section of this scheme, is that those deemed viable may be offered jobs within the public service, namely in the military, or if they have private sector skills such as mechanics or architects, could also be recruited to the public sector version of these jobs. Economy and Sciences: The economy of Helion is heavily industrialized, however it is industrialized in a manner different to most countries. Multi-level insutrial complexes make up the majority of the output of Helion, and a considerable number of these (Mainly those to do with military technology) are based underground, partly as a result of Helion's paranioa when it comes to foreign countries. The industrial output of Helion is concentrated mainly on products for domestic consumption, which are protected by a number of limited tariffs on foreign produce. However, in order to compete with the high level-high cost of Alperia products, and the low-level low cost of TWP's produce, Helion aims at a mid-level of good quality, sturdy and reliable products for the civilian and government market. The main unique industrial product of Helion is special Belifin Steel. Although not up to the standards of Alperia or Infor, Helion is still a leading member of the world's scientific community. They take a different approach to it than most other countries, however. While they still pursue most of standard, usual forms of science, they do have a speciality: In a similar fashion to Alperia, Helion scientists and philosophers seek to transcend basic humanity, and the tool with which they have attempted to accomplish this goal is genetic enhancement. However, it is very very different from that of Infor, who seem to the majority of scientists within Helion to just want to create the most disgusting monstrosities possible. {C Instead, the goals and results of Helion genetic enhacement can compared very easily to those of Alperia, and it is useful to use Alperia as the watermark. However, it not 'one for one' by any means, and the nature of the alternations make direct comparison hard. Its still easy to have roughly exchangeable levels of enhancement. One could call Helion and Alperia two sides of the same coin, one pursuing their goals mainly (Though not by any means entirely) by mechanical and robotic means, while the other pursues very similar goals with genetics. {C An average male Helion Citizen aged 40 would have a biological age in the 20s-30s (Achieved by a variety of genetic enhancements that slow ageing and increase the body's base levels of physical ability). Will have multiple basic genetic enhancements that most if not all the population have by the age of 4: A dramatic increase in strength, speed, brain power, memory and lung capacity among others. They will also be almost completely immune to most illness's, and have a vastly stronger bone structure. Cloned organs are rarely needed due to the low levels of organ failure among people, although its still possible for some who take part in this as a result of sudden catastrophic failure, and the medical system can create such organs when needed. {C Most people of this age will also have one to a few 'more exotic' enhancements, such as the ability to see in the dark, the ability to breath underwater or the ability voluntarily shut down numerous organs (Very helpful in achieving a near death/comatose state, the person can then return to normal at will) and there are a wide range of other exotic enhancements, however the majority of the much higher level stuff usually military or police. {C In recent years a vast quantity of work has been done on biological redundancy and healing, with people having the ability to recover at much faster rates from injury, exhaustion or dehydration and to survive a lot worse than normal humans with improved biologic systems. There is also a lot of ground-breaking work being done in the area of biological, or organic computers and computing parts that could be combined with humans, and an ever rising number of the average populace are taking part in this new enhancement besides the already high take up within the military and police. {C Foreign Policy: {C There are three parts to Helion Foreign Policy. Originally, the first one was a long-standing tradition of neutrality, as taken by many Nordic countries and Ireland. However, in recent years and decades it has become more and more obvious to population and government of Helion that policy will not work in modern times. However, when forced to pick a 'side' it soon became clear to Helion just how bad the options were. The GSC was little more than a useful tool to allow Alperia to better control its puppet nations and enforce its will, and clearly allowed Alperian exceptionalism to flourish. On the other hand, the Anti-GSC and latter, the IP were simply reprehensible war criminals, mad men and those seeking to drive humanity into the abysses. {C And so until the creation of the League of Independent Nations, Helion attempted to stay out of any conflicts that took place. However, Helion has recently (As of shortly before joining LIN) adopted a new philosophy of Foreign Policy: They will remain neutral and stay out of any conflicts, unless asked to intervene, UNLESS they feel that Helion's sovereignty or its rights as a nation were being violated, at which point no means were marked off for use to restore said sovereignty and rights. This has opened a sort of Pandora's Box as it is no longer clear when and when not Helion believes it within their rights to intervene, leading to intelligent world leaders to avoid actions that could lead to conflict without meaning for such an outcome. {C The second part of Helion's Foreign Policy is the manner in which they exert the most of their control and will upon the world: Diplomacy and Intelligence. I shall deal with these one at a time. Helion has one of, if not the largest Foreign Service staffs on the planet, with literally thousands of Helion's being employed by the Foreign Office in some form or another, and with Helion Embassies in every country in the world, as well Consulates in many cities around the world. Helion has proved time and again to be an impartial party in most international affairs, making their involvement in diplomacy often wanted in order to offer an objective element to discussion and debate. {C Then, we reach intelligence. Helion is strongly believed to have the largest Intelligence organisation in the world, in terms of numbers employed and government granted budget. The policy of the main agency, the Secret Intelligence Service, is \"Semper Occultus\" or \"Always Secret\" and very little information about them or their actives is officially known. However, there are rumours by the ton, the most believable of which are that SIS believe in 'keeping on eye' on all nations of world, friendly, hostile or indifferent. They actively infiltrate any organisations where it is believed they could be useful being. They are said to actively promote and protect the interests of Helion aboard, and there are plenty of conspiracies of people being 'removed' who stand in the way of furthering Helion's future. The final part of Helion's Policy is the simplest: The massive amount of culture they export. Helion doesn't, and doesn't need too, actively use this tool to do anything besides promote Helion as being an open-minded, liberal and accepting country. Military: {C The military forces of Helion are based very much upon quality over quantity, although no where near to the extent that Alperia has taken that description. The military believes strongly in a number of idea's of war (See below) and their military shaped to accommodate that. The size of the Helion's standing military is roughly 7 million, including sailors, airmen and support staff, with a reserve of around another 10 million. {C Military Doctrine: {C The military doctrine of Helion can be summed up with one word: 'Asymmetry'. The idea is simple; for every strength, there is a weakness. For every, challenge there is a solution. And for every military, there is war it cannot hope to the win. In the case of Helion their military command aims for that horrific 'impossible war' to be every war Helion's enemies fight against them. Helion military command knows that unless they where willing to sacrifice everything, total victory would be unlikely when faced with a lot of modern nations. However, it is a lot less difficult to simply make the conflict so difficult, so unrewarding and generally morale sapping of the enemy army and civilians that the hostile government sues for peace. With this in mind, the Helion army is split in three. The first section which makes up 1/2 military, is the basic 'normal' military. These are the marines, the army, the navy. They are all heavily genetically altered, utilise advanced combined arms military tactics and work within 'combined-arms forces' that consist of joint Airforce, Navy and Army Divisions. They use power-armour and power suits when it is needed, but are heavily trained in order not to rely on them too much. As you will see below, this section can be reconfigured at will depending on the conflict. The next section is the special forces section, making up 1/4 of the military. These consist of everything from the Special Air Service, to the Paratroopers and Long Range Reconnaissance Unit. More controversially are the Dust Devils, Urban Commandos Jungle Regiment. Each of these special forces are trained to know and make their respective environment their own. When and if Helion gets involved in a war in one of these environments Advisor's from these Regiments and the AWD will work together to re-configure the Special Forces and normal military to make best use of the area they are fighting in. {C Why these three military formations are so controversial is their well know 'open-attitude' to actions that could be, and likely would be considered terrorism in other countries. For example, the Urban Commandos would happily utilise destruction of civilian power grids and inciting riots to confuse and annoy their enemy, whom they can pick off at will as they attempted to restore order. {C The third and final section of the military is the Asymmetrical Warfare Division, made up of the remaining 1/4 of the military and the most controversial by far. Very secretive by nature, they are based upon their motto: \"Accommodandam Aut Mori\", aka Adapt or Die. They are known to be as close to an intelligence agency as they are a military formation. One of the few pieces of concrete information about them is that they have some of the world's most advanced stealth technology. They are believed to have 'plans' for all possible outcomes, or conflicts, which they constantly update. They are known to have a large section whose entire job is to study other countries militarises and devise strategies to defeat them. They are also believed to have the feared Documents X and Y in their possession. Rumoured government plans for what to do during the possible occupation of Helion or friendly countries respectively, they are supposedly based upon the idea of a continuous, non-stop insurrection against the foreign occupiers based around the three pillars of Resistance (Peaceful civilian and not), Insurgency and Direct Action (Up and including a systematic bombing campaign, or the like). With the support of a modern military power, with numerous genetic abilities at their finger tips it is completely unknown how exactly such a conflict would play out, besides it likely being very,very bloody. Actual concrete military numbers and figures will come laters.Commonwealth of Ursaca Commonwealth of Ursaca  This is the most 'Canon' Version of the Commonwealth of Ursaca at the moment and can be considered as the Commonwealth of Ursaca in the latest entry of the series Backing: League of Independent Nations (LIN) Motto: Work Harder. Work Smarter. Make it Better. Do it Faster. Make Ursaca Stronger. Independence Declared: 1st January 2070 Capital: District 1 Largest City: District 87 Official Languages: English Government Type: Autocracy (Dictatorship) Population: 192,476,172 Citizens Total: Around 200,000,000 (including those without Citizenship) Economy: Mixed Economy Economy: Capitalism Major Exports: Coal, Iron, Gold, Natural Gas, Semiconductors, Plastic materials,  Food, Computers, Steel, Alcholic Beverages, Movies, Books, A plethora of Watchtower Inc. Products, Military Arms and equipment. Major Imports: Sulfur and nonmetallic minerals, General Minerals (Firedonia), Various technological and commercial goods (Paradine), An Abundance of everything (Sig). Currency: Ursacan Credit($) (CUR)Geography and Environment  The geography of the Commonwealth is mostly grassland and desert, due to this most of the population lives in cities (called Districts) that are numbered according to the order inwhich they were built, thus District 1 is the Capital as it was built first, there are over 500 Districts. District 87 holding the most people (30 million). The national sport is URF (Ursacan Rules Football) which is run by the UFL (Ursacan Football League), URF itself is a more violent version of the old pre-fault Aussie Rules Football.Government  The Commonwealth is ruled by Father Harold, who has the ultimate say on anything to do with the Commonwealth, however one man cannot do everything alone and thus there are 5 City States each made up of 100 or more Districts, each state elects an Advisor who advises the Father. In an agreement with Paradine, Unity Lake City is the only place in the world where nations that do not have an embassy in Ursaca are able to speak to an Ursacan Representative. The only nations to currently have an embassy in the Commonwealth are the Republic of Paradine and Sig. All Foreigners are heavily monitored while within the Commonwealth (if they are even approved entry...) and citizens are not allowed to travel abroad unless specifically approved by the Government (they are heavily monitered upon their return for a 5 year period). Non-Citizens are not allowed to travel out of the District they live in without a Travel Permit.Important People Department of Defence Command Staff Demographics Economy and Sciences  The Commonwealth is highly advanced in all computer sciences. Universities turn out more software engineers, computer engineers and computer scientists then any other fields, although that's not to say other fields of science are neglected. Watchtower manufactures churn out things ranging from industrial machinery to luxury goods (The average toy factory for example will usually have 3-8 employee's and turnout >70,000,000 units every week due to major advances in computing and automation.) and the greatest thing you could give a child in the Commonwealth is the means to obtain successful job and to make money (education being a close second due to the correlation between Education and high paying jobs). The Ursacan's country wide internet is a fully semetic web, allowing an unparalleled ability for Ursacans to find and access information. Despite the ability Cybernetic Augmentation and Genetic Engineering is very uncommon, strictly limited to Prosthesis, Military Use, or removal of dangerous genetic defects or traits (Under Ursacan Law). Generally however those with bio or cybernetic enhancements suffer little discrimination or 'racism'. (The Ursacan Criminal Justice System and Laws institutionally treats Augmented Citizens (Bio or Cybernetic) exactly the same as they would Regular Citizens.) (Although no A.I. are known to reside official within the Commonwealth of Ursaca, they too would institutionally be treated as an Ursacan Citizen (if they qualified as a citizen; the easiest way is by being born in Ursaca.)) Notable Exceptions to the normal: Commercially available camera's able to perform Femtophotography (with high end cameras possesing exposure rates in the 100s of femtoseconds range) are available in the $5,000-$50,000 price range. A Semi-Common gaming console is Watchtower's Sigstation. Its the size of a medium bedroom and costs $4780 to install (or a flat $10,000 if you do not have a spare room of sufficient size). It features 5 HD TVs the size of a wall (one for each wall and the roof) and 6 sensors to convert all movements into data. The floor is akin to a multidirectional treadmill that can incline. All games for the Sigstation have 1:1 movement as a result.The Sigstation is also used by Watchtower Inc and the Commonwealth Defence Force for training purposes.

Watchtower Inc is also the largest commercial entity in the Commonwealth, 9 out of every 10 homes contain its products and its political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In the Public it is the nations leading supplier of Computer Technology, Medical products and Healthcare.Commonwealth State Security Force  Not part of the Commonwealth Defence Force (and thus not part of the Commonwealths Military) the CSSF is the intelligence agency of the Commonwealth. The primary function of the CSSF is to collect information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals, and to advise the Commonwealth on matters of National Security. The agency conducts covert operations and paramilitary actions. The Head of the CSSF is currently Father Harold. The CSSF maintains a force of around 900,000 (actual number classified) Operatives and an unknown(classified) amount of vehicles. It also has the ability to commandeer any force under the command of the Commonwealth. CSSF Anti-Cyber Terrorism: A Division of the CSSF that specialises in the following aspects of Information Warfare (iWar, Cyberterrorism, Cyberwarfare) .Department of Ursacan Wellbeing  Not part of the Commonwealth Defence Force (and thus not part of the Commonwealths Military) the DUW (headed by James Breadford) has the dual purpose of monitoring all non-citizens and all Civilian Communications. Of course monitoring all civilian communications in real time would take an impossible amount of manpower this is accomplished by an insane number of flagwords (which when mentioned at all flag the communication for later inspection.) All Communications are saved for a period of 1 year on one of a number of DUW databases. As mentioned before the DUW also monitor non-citizens (of which there are 7,523,828 living in the Commonwealth) This is to minimise unauthorised foriegn agents in the Commonwealth. The DUW frequently works alongside the CSSF.Military Doctrine  In accordance with Government policies, the Commonealth Defence Force aims to be, and be perceivedas being, a highly-trained, well-equipped, professional force, and one that operates within theboundaries set by domestic and international law and ethical standards. To achieve this, theCommonwealth Defence Force aims to develop and maintain high levels of professional warfightingmastery. In pursuing such mastery, our defence force deliberately focuses its training upon the mostdemanding and dangerous warfighting tasks, enabling it to perform lower level peacekeepingmissions with comparative ease. The priority task of the Commonwealth Defence Force is the defence of the Commonwealth. Our approach is shaped\nby three principles. First, we must be self-reliant, that is, be able to defend the Commonwealth without having to\nrely on another country\u2019s combat forces. Second, the Commonwealth must be able to control the air and sea\napproaches to our country. Third, whilst the Commonwealth\u2019s strategic posture is defensive, we would seek to\nattack hostile forces as far from our shores as possible. We also want the Commonwealth Defence Force to be able to play a positive role, in concert with the\nforces of other LIN member states (both limited and not), in promoting and fostering security within the LIN.\nIn addition, the Commonwealth Defence Force must be able to support the Commonwealth\u2019s wider interests and\nobjectives by being able to contribute effectively to LIN coalition forces to meet crises\nbeyond our immediate neighbourhood. As well as these objectives, there are a number of other tasks which the Commonwealth Defence Force may\nbe called upon to perform in order to deal with non-military threats to our security. These include\ncoastal surveillance, counter-terrorist response, emergency management, search and rescue and\ndisaster relief. Key warfare concepts for the Commonwealth include: The Commonwealths\u2019s approach to warfare focuses on coordinated joint operations across the physical\nenvironments of aerospace, undersea, sea and land. This is not to deny the particular demands of the\noperational environment in which each Service trains and fights, nor the Service values enshrined in\ntheir traditions. But, for the Commonwealth, the conduct of joint operations, rather than single-Service\noperations, is a matter of practical necessity. It is the effective integration of thought and action at all\nlevels of command to achieve the common goal that produces a synergy in the conduct of operations\nwhich is the strength of our joint warfare approach. The Government directs the Commonwealth Defence Force to conduct military operations in a political\ncontext. Post-conflict relations between nations will be influenced by their treatment of each other\nduring the conflict. Accordingly, when the Commonwealth Defence Force takes action to \u2018win the war\u2019, it\nmust be aware of its potential impact on the relationships between the Commonwealth and other members of\nthe international community in the longer term. There are two broad types of approaches to warfare \u2013\nmanoeuvre and attrition. \u2018Manoeuvre warfare\u2019 is the key strategic and operational concept influencing the way the Commonwealth\nDefence Force conducts operations. This involves the movement and placement of forces in a\nfavourable position relative to the enemy and the application of firepower such that the physical and\npsychological effect is sufficient to break an enemy\u2019s will to continue fighting or otherwise conclude\nhostilities on the Commonealth\u2019s terms. The Commonwealth Defence Force must try to avoid \u2018attrition warfare\u2019, which emphasises the destruction\nof weapons platforms, personnel, supporting infrastructure and other resources through the\napplication of overwhelming combat power. While attrition warfare may be effective in some\nsituations, it is inefficient, particularly above the tactical level, as it is too personnel \u2013 and resource\nintensive \u2013 as a form of warfare for the Commonwealth Defence Force to sustain. So for the Commonwealth, manoeuvre warfare is generally preferred. The Commonwealth Defence Force aims to use manoeuvre concepts to contain casualties,\nparticularly civilians, minimise collateral damage and achieve the desired outcome as quickly as\npossible. Manoeuvre and attrition are not mutually exclusive approaches to warfare however, as\nmanoeuvre warfare almost inevitably involves the use of attrition through the application of firepower\nand direct combat, at critical points. It is important for the Commonwealth Defence Force to be able to conduct coalition operations in support of\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s national security objectives, where required. This may be important for reasons of overall\nforce-effectiveness or for international policy reasons such as lending support to a particular cause or\nnation. To participate in, or to lead, a coalition, the Commonwealth requires detailed knowledge of coalition\npartners, including their military affairs and language, politics and culture, and also needs to maintain\na flexible and cooperative attitude. The Commonwealth Defence Force recognises the importance of leadership in maximising the operational\neffectiveness of the Commonwealth Defence Force approach to warfare. Accordingly, the Commonwealth\nDefence Force places a strong emphasis on cultivating leadership qualities in Commonwealth Defence\nForce members.\nCommanders and their staff set the example for others to follow, through their personal qualities of\nintegrity, courage, loyalty and compassion. Leadership by example helps the Commonwealth Defence Force\nmaintain morale, avoid wasted effort, and promote initiative in young leaders.\nIn most military operations, senior commanders will be in a position to convey only guidance, and\nwill rely on the initiative of their subordinate commanders to achieve the mission. The importance\nplaced on these attributes is a distinctive feature of the Commonwealth Defence Force approach to warfare\nand it will be important for the Commonwealth Defence Force\u2019s operational effectiveness that its training\nregimes continue to foster them. Technological advances, particularly in the areas of communications, computers, detection of forces and mass\ndestruction of forces, may result in the future in the Commonwealth Defence Force operating more and\nmore in small, dispersed combat groupings. This will place even heavier responsibility on our\nyounger leaders, and reinforces the importance of developing initiative and resourcefulness\nthroughout the Commonwealth Defence Force. An important requirement for commanders and their staff is having a sound understanding of the\nculture and values of friendly forces that may be participating in a coalition operation, and of neutral\nparties that may be caught up in the conflict. Commanders and staff similarly need a deep\nappreciation of the nuances of an adversary\u2019s culture and national values, as well as knowledge of\ntheir equipment, force dispositions and military command arrangements in order to \u2018get inside their\nthinking\u2019 and break their will to continue fighting. The Commonwealth Defence Force aims to cultivate and display certain core qualities in its personnel. And\nwhile these qualities may exist in other national armed forces, it is the way the Commonwealth Defence\nForce fosters these through training and experience that has shaped the Commonwealth Defence Force\u2019s\nesprit de corps and enabled it to develop its distinctive approach to warfare. These qualities, which\nare vital in combat situations, are: Professionalism. To achieve effectiveness and efficiency in military operations, there is no substitute\nfor professional skill and attitude. Professionalism is the level of competence displayed by individuals,\ncombat teams, headquarters, formations and units. Professionalism is about having high levels of\ntechnical skill and applying that skill with discipline, good judgment and adherence to ethical\nstandards. This professionalism is developed in the Commonwealth Defence Force through careful\nselection, thorough military training, ongoing education and experience. Trustworthiness. Operational success, morale and group cohesion all depend on trust. All Commonwealth\nDefence Force members need to have this vital attribute given the life-threatening situations in which\nCommonwealth Defence Force members may be placed during military operations. Commonwealth Defence\nForce members must act with integrity, regardless of the personal cost, and gain the trust of their\nfellow Commonwealth Defence Force members. In peacetime we help to build this sense of trust by\nnurturing and caring for our people through placing a strong emphasis on safety and the elimination\nof unnecessary risk from our training activities. Further, we seek ensure that their families are properly\nlooked after, particularly when they are not there to do this themselves. Morality and Legitimacy of Action. Combat operations inevitably involve death and destruction.\nNevertheless, all Commonwealth Defence Force members need to adhere to the Law of Armed Conflict and\nthe moral principles that underlie them, so that military operations are conducted in ways that ensure\nthe Commonwealth Defence Force retains its legitimacy as a fighting force. Teamwork and Initiative. Although the Commonwealth Defence Force emphasises the importance of\nindividual initiative, it does so in the context of the effect this has on enhancing teamwork. Only\nthrough good teamwork can the potential contribution of each individual member be maximised. Courage and Compassion. The Commonwealth Defence Force seeks to ensure that its members balance a\nstrong fighting spirit with a spirit of compassion \u2013 particularly towards non-combatants caught up in a\nconflict. Also, Commonwealth Defence Force leaders at all levels have a duty of care to those under their\ncommand. Fairness and Respect for the Individual. The Commonwealth Defence Force balances the need for a\nhierarchical structure for reasons of operational necessity and effectiveness with the recognition that\nall members of the Commonwealth Defence Force are of equal worth as human beings and are entitled to\n\u2018a fair go\u2019. Carefully Directed Effort. While the Commonwealth Defence Force seeks to achieve militarily decisive\noutcomes, it also seeks to do this in ways that avoid needless loss of life or property. Commonwealth\nDefence Force commanders and members therefore need to apply armed force with discrimination\nso as to achieve decisive military outcomes with as little collateral damage and wastage of resources\nas possible.Body Armors  B.I.B.A. (Basic Infantry Body Armor) The individual system is made up of seven sub-systems\u00a0: Clothing and armour Basic combat clothing has a full cut allowing free movement. Bellows pockets provide ample carrying capacity. The material (fabric) offers good mechanical properties but still allows good air permeability.The fibres (aramid/viscose FR) are flame- and wash-resistant. The flak jacket accommodates: The electronic jacket integrates the electronics (computer unit, manager unit, radio, man-machine interface, Map, Radar, cables and connector), flexible water bottle, weapon magazines and grenades, and optimizes weight distribution on the soldier.The equipment is autonomous and can be used alone. The RBC combat clothing is only issued when biological or chemical threats are expected, however gas masks are standard issue regardless. The permanent combat clothing is designed to allow combat phases to be carried out with the same efficiency as that achieved with conventional combat clothing. Camouflage There have been many rumours about introduction of a new camouflage pattern. Demonstrator models have been disclosed sporting DPCU (Disruptive Pattern Camouflage), flecktarn and an original spot camouflage pattern Portable electronic platform (PEP) The PEP lies at the heart of the BIDA system. Designed to utilise all the electronic resources found on the electronic jacket (computer, energy manager, peripheral equipment interfaces, user interfaces), The system is built around a USB 7.5. digital data bus. This choice of open broadband digital data bus and extensive connectivity gives the portable electronic platform, and hence the system, strong interoperability.Individual energy sources Peripheral equipment can be connected to the physical connection ports situated at the front of the battery units. Power sources is made of two rechargeable Sodium-air (1600Wh/kg) batteries The PEP also powers the portable tempreture modulator which keeps the wearer at a comfortable tempreture at all times. Helmet The helmet is composed of four components: head protection, communication headset, cognitive enhancement system and optronic equipment. The ballistic shell optimises protection and load-bearing ergonomics (weight distribution). It can accommodate various items required for the mission (facial protection screens) and its shape is compatible with all firing positions of the weapons used .A lightweight, integrated protective shield protects the infantryman from various threats (wind, rain, dust, UV). Non-linear earplugs afford auditory protection. The NBC mask can be equipped with a filter cartridge or linked to the ventilation powerpack. A tube built into the NBC mask can be used to take in liquids (water, food).The communication headset is linked to the radio. It holds the microphone and earpiece and works by bone vibrations (bone conduction transducer). It works independently from the helmet and can therefore remain in operation when the helmet is removed. The cognitive enhancement system can be used for 20 minutes at a time and enhances cognitive power by 1.3 times normal, however it is strongly advised that the soldier takes an hour break between uses or temporary blindness (usually for a period of one hour to one day) may incur. The optronic equipment is composed of mission interface overshell integrating the optronics, head camera (EBCMOS light intensification technology), image display units (OLED technology) allowing data and icons transmitted on the bus system to be displayed, images and video coming from the weapon or the head camera. The image display unit is integrated into the helmet visor: its screen can be brought into line with infantryman's eye or relocated around the visor. When not in use, it can be 'closed' so as not to hinder the soldier. The visor itself can be retracted into the helmet if wanted or required however the gas mask requires the visor to be extended to work at 100% effectiveness. BIDA information network The BIDA information network (RIF: Radio Information Network) allows information to be shared throughout the Platoon(I) or the Company (II) or if need be the entire Regiment (XXXX). Each radio can subscribe to three networks simultaneously. This offers the squad leader some flexibility in organizing communication networks in his section. Each network has an audio conference channel, with priority given to the squad leader, an alert channel from the infantryman to his leader, and a data transmission channel. Voice and data transmission is based on tried and tested DECT civilian technology (domestic cordless telephone technology). Each sub-network works from a base carried by the squad leader. As RIF sets are all identical, a soldier can replace his commander if necessary by configuring his set as base. The radio is configured by the BIDA computer, thereby limiting the number of control buttons needed on the set. Intergrated Combat Support System B.I.B.A uses an onboard computer that allows Soldiers to aim faster and better, throw grenades with a greater chance of killing or wounding enemy soldiers, allows the soldier to process new information of objections on the fly and is capable of tagging enemy positions for other units to engage. It also functions as an automatic ballistics calculator with integrated HUD Support. I.I.C.A. (Integrated Infantry Combat Armour) (Import version of ICA-4 Combat Armour from TWP) A NCB sealed suit forms the basis of the armour, with an integral cooling system powered by backplate mounted batteries. The undersuit is made from sheets of tightly woven carbon nanotube fibres, sandwiching an extruded graphene layer and lined with a synthetic layer which provides moisture wicking and a comfortable feeling against the skin. The backplate also contains a small air tank, which in combination with the rebreather in the helmet, allows the user to operate in an airless environment for up to 45 minutes. Segmented hard armour plates enhance the protection of the suit on important areas, which are made from laminated CNT and graphene, cored with boron-carbide disks. The exterior of the armour is covered in an organic chromatophore based adaptive camouflage which can mimic most environemental conditions. The helmet is able to be fully sealed to the suit and is equipped with a multi-function air filter, HUD, free flowing tactical coms net, multi-spectrum visual sensors, external microphones, an external speaker., a flashlight (IR/UV/Visible Spectrum) and laser designator.

Master! Master! One able to survive, or even thrive, in the wasteland. As long as there are differences, we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other. We need one race. Race! Race! One goal. Goal! Goal! One people . . . to move forward to our destiny. Destiny.- the Master, Fallout Name: The Technocracy of Ambrosia Motto: That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeon's even death may die. Capital: Y'ha-nthlei Largest City: Y'ha-nthlei Formation declared: 28th march 2075 12:01 PM Official Languages: R'lyehian Government Type:Technocracy presiding president chairman: Professor Harvard Ashford Important members of the political council: Dr Hebert West Professor Randolph Carter Professor Richard Azathoth Dr Juan Romero DRP James Fisherman Obed Marsh  The Government of Ambrosia is run by a mixture of extremely eccentric scientists, most of whom are far too busy with insane ideas of making a perpetual motion machine out of buttered toast and a cat to pay attention to much of the worlds activities. what they do pay attention to is generally scrutinised with a bit of suspicion before they go back to their wacky experiments in making a octopus moose. general expansion is more towards the South and Southwest rather than into any major nations borders. they plan on a defensive offensive technique, once reaching maximum size without invading anyone important and they sit back and relax while continuing the growth and adaption of the species. generally the borders with other nations are kept clean from their own invasive species to avoid diplomatic problems. their general goals are to adapt the humanity into an apex life form and to remove genetic and disease problems which plague normal humans. mostly the Ambrosians are not terribly bothered by other nations, they enjoy finding out much on them and generally view them as curiosities but overall don't have much interest in dealing in global matters. overall most opinions of other countries are of a non committal nature, most simply don't care or have no real opinions on the matter, beyond a shrug of the shoulders. Any intruding outsiders without any official recognition of there legitimate visit can count themselves lucky if they get killed immediately. probably because of the danger of traversing without a guide or papers is the worst idea possible otherwise they will enjoy a reasonably suitable welcome and much inquiries into the world outside due to the ambrosian semi isolationist nature. most find a reasonably polite nature to most Ambrosians but still get freaked out by the species that roam the forests. the council consists of over 300 representatives or more, one chairman and a a fluid number of political advisers to the chairman, it is multiracial due to the Ambrosian approval of their sentient creations being give their say in the political doings and goings of Ambrosia rather than isolating and repressing their views. Population: 34,000,000 Economy: Mixed Economy Currency: Ambrosian Chen Edenism: the belief held by many Ambrosian\u2019s is the belief in Edenism. Edenism consists of the total domination of the planet by Ambrosian wildlife and the mass development of apex fauna to cover this world. The belief itself is the return to paradise under the Ambrosian rule and to create a world harmonious with nature and man until both are equal , it is to bring about a lifestyle which would be considered the best possible for all people to live in. A heaven on earth as it were which provides for all life upon it, and with the Ambrosian\u2019s acting as stewards to its development and tending the species that walk, crawl and swim in its heavenly shores. However the offer only extends to those who willingly accept Ambrosian genetic adaption, normal humans will not have the necessary properties as a species to survive in the Ambrosian\u2019s new Eden and would be easily slaughtered by the wildlife. This belief extends to other planets, galaxies and solar systems and is viewed as being the ultimate goal of bringing all life to a biologically orderly nature. It is often combined with Adevemyth beliefs to bring about complete understanding of the Ambrosian ideology. Adevemyth ideology: the belief that the human race as it is, is inherently flawed and incapable to survive in an intensive and dangerous universe. The body of man is viewed as a weak tool and one only to build upon to create a more powerful and hardier race. This belief follows on the principles of the genetic and biologically uselessness and dangerous faults in the human body and the belief that we must adapt to create something purer and better than what we previously were. It is the belief that human life must change in order to properly survive and become a figure of absolute power despite the costs to our natural bodies. It focuses on bringing around genetic characteristics which benefit the being completely in any given environment through genetic engineering. It can be viewed as the mass genetic purification and guided evolution of man through science and its ideals are applicable to all Ambrosians.Geography, Environment and Demographics  Geography and Environment: in the deep caverns and coast lines of Devils Reef lies the silent realm of Ambrosia. A dark deep sea island and underwater realm, their cities scattered around the foggy cliff faces of terrifying height. Lit in cold blue bioluminescence the cities glow in the dark of the mist and deep alien animals lurk through the murky waters making it a strange inhospitable place. The buildings appear to be immensely old, although the country has been around for little more 20 years, the buildings appear aged and out of place in the modern world their Art Nouveau and Art Deco styling long since removed from the architectural styles of the world. There is also strange and disturbing non euclidean corridors and glass windows would cause much confusion to those not of the country, and the shocking terrible animals and human experiments which peer through the dark back at peoples searching eyes, is terrifyingly disturbing for some outsiders. The cities generally crowd around white cliff faces of the coast or within the deep inland regions of the islands, covered in mysterious and humid jungles of towering fungal structures. The environment of the nation is dark and oppressive and the sounds of the lapping of the ocean from which strange and alien noises can be heard leave visitors to some of the cities shivering in horror. The inland regions are even more bizarre crowded with massive forests of poisonous spore producing fungus, its like a scene from another world of alien qualities to our own. this scene of these massive jungles of tonic fungus is as beautiful and alien as it is deadly, as hundreds of types of fungus assault you with a deadly barrage of spores that infest and grow out of your skin and others which once inhaled ensure death within minutes. still others excrete acidic substances which burn into flesh and protective clothing alike. on top of that other plant life and fungoid structures may attempt to eat you as well as the mountains of violent brutal mega fauna that infest the alien landscape   Demographics: The people of Ambrosia are Isolationist and slightly suspicious of outsiders as well as being quite inhuman looking. Their origins and heritage of where they came from what people they were from originally has disappeared into the corners of history. Only the Ambrosians know their true origins and are unwilling to share with outlanders. This means much of their history is a complete mystery or subject to whispering myth and rumor. Those of learned nature have tried many times to persuade the Ambrosians to talk about their history but have been solidly rebuked by whom they talked to before the authorities became involved and they were escorted to the islands or lands outside of Ambrosian influence. Those who have tried more tenaciously have often or not disappeared while walking the dark corridors and backstreets of the dark cities. The people are strange and inhuman looking. Long, slender, lanky and hunched in height the most prominent aspect of their features is their long extended webbed hands and feet, their slow blinking glowing blue eyes , watery bluish coloured skin,their pustulating flapping gill like structures on their necks and the strange cephalopodic head structures of the common Ambrosian. They mostly seem to be of one race, no traces of their origins on the surface remain. To outsiders they are an alien people their almost unblinking eyes are deeply disturbing and their joy at swimming which much of the population do on a daily basis is peculiar. Some of the other population is even more disturbingly monstrous, a few more adventurous explorers of the open city of Re\u2019lah-ilei tell of strange tentacled horrors which roam the dark streets, or of weird gelatinous sounds crawling across the roofs of the houses during the perpetual night. Religion seems to play little part in the community and only a select few practice it. Even then, the religious are warped and mysterious cult like nature worshipping dark horrors of eldritch origins  The language of the people of Ambrosia is a strange complicated almost unearthly complex, because of the difficulty of learning it most Ambrosians speak in a slow archaic English to outsiders which adds even more to the wrongness of the strange whispering people. Adding to this they wear Ancient Egyptian style clothing typically the usekh, Shendyt, brass arm bracelets, sandals and optional loose upper body covering of silk (mainly due to the heat). Scientific clothing and that of most industrial work is the same though. Music as well is as old as the styles of their clothing and contains strange haunting melodies in their deep unearthly language. Blue collar Crime is almost non existent because most of those who are revealed to have taken part in it disappear, never to be seen again. even the people shudder at the idea of what happens to the missing criminals. the country is very orderly and lawful willing to take action against those who would dare disturb the peace of the nation. As mentioned before many of the Ambrosians have a deep dislike of outsiders who like to pry in matters not concerning them. only one city is open for outsiders to visit and no other cities locations are known by the outside world as they are so deeply hidden in the twisting tunnels of the cliffs.the above ground cities are extremely odd, their design of Egyptian Revivalism but put into a modern construction. large statues, small statues, temple like buildings and massive industrial building shaped like pyramids are extrememly common. as well as hieroglyphics which cover most of the surface of the buldings. Governers often have the eccentric habit of wearing ornamental and extremely detailed Nemes as well as the occasional false beard and biologically grown bone Khopesh as a sign of office. Economy and Sciences: The technology of the dark nation of Ambrosia is that of a dark history, indeed the very first mention of their nation in notable events of the world is the mention of an of the toxic jungle forming in the southern hemisphere. from then on the technology has constantly but slowly been refined and advanced for the past twenty years. their focus had always been the dark unpleasant murky creatures of the bottom of the sea and the constant development of Advanced aquatic human life. strange eel-like lower bodied humans and monstrous octopus\u2019s are only a few of the strange beings seen roaming those terrible seas, and bizarre buzzing horrors and eldritch monstrosities loom through the massive jungles of the land. Military: Military Doctrine: fear is the word best describing the tactics used by the Ambrosians. the military uses the countries enigmatic secretive nature to its advantage when dealing with serious trespassers on Ambrosian seas and lands,.the use of sudden swift and deadly attacks coming out of the blue and disappearing in seconds is common among the military to spread fear and paranoia among their enemies. it is not uncommon for Ambrosian soldiers to try and land on the bottom of enemy ships and sink them by placing highly powerful charges across the bottom of the hull. the usage of J\u00f6rmungandr is just as terrifying, the massive 60 meter long 130 metric ton sea serpent can crush small ships and buckle submarines armour its main purpose is the deep sea protection of military and industrial sites from enemy detection. as nobody really has any idea of where much of the important Ambrosian cities, military and industrial complexes are are, likely they would have to send down camera drones,submarines or scout teams to even have a hope of finding the complexes and military bases and attacking them properly which can be easily disposed off by the Ambrosian military and its Megafauna. the attempts to locate capital or important cities of Ambrosia would also be particularly hard as they would have to navigate a series of endless maze like tunnels filled with dark and evil abominations lunging from every shadow. History: Species:The Judgements Of Ambrosia  The Judges:  The Judges are vast 200 meter high biomechanical monstrosities of horrible proportions. They are the first of the designated judgements on those who decide to enter a genocidal conflict with Ambrosia; they are often viewed as some form of heavenly judge which acts out the will of the Ambrosian people as well as bringers of an apocalypse if they judge it necessary. Their brains are massive and the nerve impulses extremely fast as well as the overall brain design being intensely complex to increase intelligence to beyond human proportions. Their main weapon is a specially designed biomechanical machine device in the creature\u2019s mouth cavity, which is able to deliver intense and immensely powerful nuclear blasts via nuclear laser. they are also intensely radioactive and covered in plate armour of extreme biological strength, able to survive the most powerful of blows with little damage to itself before it begins to regenerate. The flesh underneath is even tougher, very little is able to properly penetrate it and neither acid, cold, heat or force has much effect on it. Wherever this titan steps things die and are eaten by massive amounts of feelers\u2019 and tendrils around the feet, this organic matter is quickly digested to its full capacity before complete annihilation due to the intensive digestion. It has a nuclear core which it feeds upon to provide the intensive energy required for the nuclear blasts, the natural amounts of uranium which are found in all plants, soil, rock and all life forms are added to this core to boldster the material and keep power levels reasonably high. Through its passing the land is also infected with the glow, (mentioned in plants section) which feeds and expresses the radiation which now contaminates the soil and which quickly grows to cover the land behind it in a matter of a day. The judges are overall of a humanoid shape, but immensely different in biology to an almost alien degree. Overall they are the first of the 5 judgements of which Ambrosia could permit upon its enemies.Massive Lizards, Snakes or Draconians  Amunhotep: the Amunhotep are huge Draconian creatures sixty feet in length and 20 in height. they are vastly intelligent due to being grown and having their brains swapped with the brightest Ambrosians making an excellent choice of tactician and governor . they are naturally flamboyant and like to wear lots of gold and jewels when relaxing in their homes. they fly by using their massive wings to propel themselves though the air, this is supplemented by the huge internal gas bag like structures inside the Amunhotep\u2019s body. they express a excessive curiosity and some of them are leading bio-engineers in the advancement of Ambrosian science. within their bodies they also have a large sac of flammable and corrosive fluids, which they are able to spray in a jet of fire over 50 meters in length and 20 meters across. their massive claws and immense strength can rip apart tanks and powered armoured soldiers alike, and their thick scaly armour and high resistance and regeneration makes them difficult to take down without major damage being done to the opposite side. they have a cousin race which inhabits the marshland and is an active ambush predator. most colours are that which can fit into their terrain or domain, like blue, green, red, orange stripes or something even more colourful due to the nature of most of Ambrosia\u2019s plant life. occasionally some have been bred for gold or metallic coloured scales but their beasts are rare. Sky Serpents: Giant 100 meter long creatures of massive muscle and crushing power, they are kept aloft by a series of biological gas bags which continue along the sides of the body and allow its massive length as well as its ability to travel through the sky. It is armored by a series of carapace plates of extreme lightness but of excellent resistance and strength. They are beasts of immense strength and could crush buildings with reasonable ease if it were necessary. A mass of tendrils cover the head of the serpent, forming a crest which functions as part of its sensory organs, allowing it to find out more about its environment with ease as well as acting as a lighting system during the night and drawing insects to the beast allowing it to feed upon them. The creature itself breathes nitrogen allowing it to survive the higher areas of the atmosphere were oxygen is not plentiful. it has a symbiotic relationship with a smaller type of serpent which cleans in between the scales of the massive creature and in return gain food from the beast.Mammal like Life Forms  Fenrir Wolves: a strange abominable beasts of the Ambrosian forests. they are massive 3 meter long and 2 meters high wolf like creatures which have been genetically developed by the Ambrosians to serve as mobile scouting forces. they can run as fast as 80 miles per hour and can keep it up all day as long as they get a large meal at the end. they can digest food and gain energy extremely efficiently as well as store it and keep it in reserves for extremely long durations of time. jaws can extend themselves by a foot from the bone, allowing them to clamp onto prey with a quick snapping movement. their jaws have enough strength in them to crush combat armour and break powers as well as spines. they could hold human horizontally in their mouth and just crush their stomach, armour and spine in one extremely powerful bite. they have high damage resistance and their skin is thick and tough and makes it difficult for small rounds to piece deeply into their flesh. they also have two medium sized sacs of flammable fluid which the beast can excrete and incinerate its prey with. along with having a club like tail the beast also has large jagged spines which it uses to brain enemies nearby with. the beast has either deep black or brown fur and is vicious to all but the ambrosians, who know how to handle them. The Warboaria: a giant, omnivorous, 40 foot high slab of solid muscle, tusk and hair, the Warboaria is a beast genetically engineered from a pig to serve as an Ambrosian substitute for bacon and which serves its purpose with a delectable taste. In its natural state Warboaria are almost impossible to kill and difficult to harm due to their tough and thick leathery hides. Their tusks are terrible and terrifying gouging weapons which could rip apart trees with ease, and they have massive sharpened neurotoxin filled spines which cross their back like fur. Their hooves are massive and dangerous, easily causing large dents in tank armour and crushing stone with measurable ease. They have a long thick tail and acidic saliva, the tail is barbed with hundreds of thick spines which could easily bludgeon an enemy to death and the saliva burns on contact. They stand on six legs and males have a fearsome temper, due to genetic alterations giving them the testosterone of bull sharks. Overall a delicious but terrifying animal.Plant Life  Super Massive Shoggoth Really-  Bio Cities: massive 40 mile and beyond creatures, designed to grow and house the people of Ambrosia as well as serve as a moving industrial device for spreading more Ambrosian life forms across the worlds it covers. It could be considered a universal mother to almost all species on Ambrosia if not for the children of this species being able to breed and develop within themselves without interaction from the City. Depending on whether it is on land or not the creatures it produces in biological sacks beneath the main housing complex will vary. It is also a place where new life forms are developed by the Ambrosians before being introduced to the city and produced and it functions as a giant science station as well as a home. It has no real set form, like the shoggoths but with as much intelligence as a powerful AI and can mold its form into something more suitable if the need arise. It is also covered with a vast array of armor of which huge interlocking plates make it almost impossible to attack the flesh beneath. The armor itself is highly resistant to most weaponry and even if breached the flesh beneath will quickly begin to reform the armor plating within a matter of a minutes. The production of wildlife is also extremely fast, it can produce most creatures in a matter of days and the small insects in a couple of hours. Larger beasts may take longer but are produced incredibly fast despite this. The attacking measures are also rather impressive, considering it can fire hundreds of projectiles from biological rail guns at speeds with are close the fastest speeds of a jet and with extreme accuracy and differs in projectile from simple boney spikes which are meters long, to flaming balls of biological napalm or acid. It also has other defenses, using pheromones to guide the wildlife to go on the attack and annihilate any enemy that is not of Ambrosian Origin, not to mention the masses of Bio-jet creatures it uses for fast attacks on planes and other things.  The general defense force of a city consists of millions of creatures\u2019 variating in size and shape as well as species all acting as a military force for this massive creature. On top of it all, like the judges it also has the ability to use a biological nuclear laser if need be, as well as being able to defend into the earth to deep levels with ease if it comes to the crunch. The only way to destroy them would be multiple successive strikes by extremely powerful WMD\u2019s and even that is not likely to destroy all of it. Very likely it could house millions of Ambrosians and sustain them with ease as it travelled across the planet. the Sea of Corruption The forests are of a dark and terrible nature, the fungus is extremely fast growing and can often reach a height of 3 meters within one day, the spores they expel to spread their species are even more horrific. Born from the vats and testing grounds of Ambrosia the spores are highly toxic to inhale, and can kill within minutes. Others attack exposed skin and infect it with its seeds of death which quickly spreads all over the body and poisons the blood, killing people in horrific agony. Still others excrete acid once they land on something, burning through flesh and protective clothing alike. Another infests the host and takes over the brain, reducing the person to a state of zombification and spreading all over the contagious fungus further across the lands. still more leech acidic fumes into the air, covering the jungles in a corrosive mist which damages enemy aircraft. Other repulsive entities such as the eldritch carnivorous Murkmarsh which has a tendency to remove peoples limbs with a vicious vice like structure of spikes. Other structures sense the movements in the ground and launch giant spore infested spikes towards their target. The only things able to go in unmolested by this barrage of horror without protective equipment are the Ambrosia's animals and people who are genetically adapted to deal with the harsh environment, but even Ambrosians find it unpleasant to not go inside the jungle without a protective mask stopping the spores not getting into their lungs. The forests consists of thousands of species of fungus each with its own way of spreading and each with their own protective measures and offensive weapons making even on a base level, invading the forest almost impossible without horrific losses. The Fungus also works symbiotically with some species of Ambrosian wildlife, where the fungus covers them to a degree which provides ample camoflage as well as allowing the species to spread even further and into new territories of unoccupied land. Blood-weed: (also Known as Red weed) is a substitute for grass with a nature for carnivorous activities as well as plant like activities. Blood-weed has a tendency of growing absolutely everywhere across all terrain and in all types of climates and is extremely dangerous when encountered. as well as gaining energy from the sun, the mass of blood-weed has a tendency to move. it is a strange vine-like growth on the ground, sort of like the arteries of a huge animal, it can grow into numerous thick clumps and when sliced produces a poisonous ichorous type of liquid which is deadly to humans and tastes distinctly like iron and blood. the weed is deadly due to its nature of sensing vibrations on the ground and moving itself over before completely engulfing the target. and excreting enzymes to digest the being into edible matter. Lunar Triffid: a huge muti-headed organism which is similar to its original species, it has grown to massive proportions and has generated multiple heads to deal with multiple adversaries as well as allow for a greater gain in likelihood of succession in catching prey. it is able to uproot itself and travel across the jungles in a shuffling like motion. it also has large whip like stems of which it can slash its prey with and inject deadly neurotoxins. it also has the ability to propel a large amount of boiling hot acid at its prey to demobilise it, this acid can be used multiple times and can often or not melt through steel if left on long enough. if its prey escapes then it has the intelligence to follow it until it finds it dead due to the injection of neurotoxins and deadly boiling acid. if the prey is seized by one of the heads then the plant can exert enough strength to crush the air out of its preys lungs before digesting it in a pit full of enzymes. these deadly creatures glow green faintly in the dark to attract Ambrosian Insects such as the Reapers before snapping them up with a quick bite. the teeth of the plant heads are so sharp that they can pierce and impale humans repeatedly, as well as go through the toughest skeletons in Ambrosia, making them a fatal enemy to fight. during a full moon the plant glows like a strange pure white for its every pore and releases millions of tiny little spores, thus giving it it's name as the Lunar Triffid Bloat Fungus: Bloat Fungus is a strange brain-like fungoid structure which sits on a singular thick stem. it\u2019s head is covered in a mass of spike like quills containing neurotoxins. when it feels the earth move due to a passing animal, the Bloat Fungus responds my mixing two volatile chemicals together and violently exploding, unleashing a rain of spikes in every direction. mostly the neurotoxin is harmless to normal Ambrosian wildlife, and will not affect them much appart from a mild irritation due to the spines being lodged in their skins or carapaces. however the explosion can be devastating to unprepared humans, often killing them with sheer force or at least violently throwing them through the air. the fungal spines which are not particularly deadly to most Ambrosian wildlife are deadly to humans and can kill in minutes if not seen to with an antidote immediately. the actual spines are a way of propagating itself and it uses the animals of the forests to disperse them across all of Ambrosia when the animals eventaully remove them. The Glowing Destruction (The Glow): a part of the fungal forests that are the most terrible, the Glowing destruction is part of the Sea of Corruption that deals with Organisms which excrete deadly Radiation and whos general purpose is to destroy all that it encounters while spreading its abismal spores. Glowing like beacons these terrible creations grow extremely fast (7 meters per day), even for Ambrosian wildlife, and are completely deadly and are possibly the most dangerous collection of species ever to be encountered within Ambrosia. Only the Ambrosians and certain types of Ambrosian animals/plants have been designed to deal with it. Every part of the Glow excrete radiation, even the smallest and most unimposing fungus is a potentially fatal on so many levels. Only those who are Ambrosian or have Efficient Radiation protection could ever survive in this place. On a side note, the Glow does produce the most delicious fruit in all of creation, so you are unlikely to die without a good meal (thats if you survive long enough to eat the fruit)Sea and Swamp Creatures  The Grimvice Crab: A giant crab which often lurks within the depths of the watery Marshes that often feature within the fungal forests of Ambrosia. Often mistaken for a large bolder covered with mushrooms and poisonous fungus the Grimvice Crab is a ambush predating semi-arthropod which can tear appart tank armour and resist high calibre weaponry with its reinforced thick shell. The measure at a length of 20 meters across and 15 meters long just on its main body its titanic 3 meter thick outer claws and its 2 meter thick inner claws can crush and sever anything in its path, on top of this it can release a high amp electric shock from two antenna like mandibles which can disable and kill enemy prey. As said before they are quite slow due to their size and can only move as fast as 15-22 miles per hour. They are almost impossible to kill with light calibre weaponry except at certain points which the crab instinctual defends with great care. As well as having an exoskeleton, the body has also been reinforced with an inner skeleton to create a more stable life form due to its gigantic size Darnazt: a dog sized amphibious creature which spends its time being eaten or generally running around the place eating other creatures. A Darnazt is one of the lowest on the food chain but is an incredibly difficult animal to deal with. It can run at speeds surpassing a cheetah and has a razor sharp trail of spines which it can use as a defensive measure. Usually the Darnazt are pack animals and follow a strict hierarchy of the biggest and most aggressive Darnazt, they use their sheer numbers to bring down many of the medium sized creatures that infest Ambrosia's dark forests. They have several rows of needle like poisonous teeth and a tongue in their mouth which can be used to suck up peoples blood, as well as paralysing them. They are of minimal threat on their own but a large pack (which would normally consist of about 30 of them) can be hellish to deal with. They are excellent swimmers and often lay ambushes for prey by hiding them in the thick marshland which covers a large portion of Ambrosia.. Jormungandr (Sea Serpent Orbis Terrarum Hydrus) intelligence level: Animalistic, capable of advanced animal tactics however non sentient. Age of Maturity: 9 years Maximum Age: 50 years length: 60 meters in length when fully grown, 4 meters across when fully grown weight: 130 -145 metric tons ways of attack: constriction and a strong powerful bite to the back of the preys neck in an attempt to sever the spinal cord. deepest ever found: 3 kilometers - 9640 ft behaviour: with smaller creatures of the sea the Jormungandr is mostly very nonchalant unless provoked viewing them as too small a meal to be bothered with, however shoals of fish are an easy target for the massive beast just as much as the great angler whales of the deep sea. when they are taken out of the water, their movements become very erratic. They crawl awkwardly in these situations and can become quite aggressive, striking wildly at anything that moves. occasionally there has been reports of fishermen entangling a juvenile Jormungandr in their nets while trawling for fish and the unfortunate repercussions on the trawlers for such actions. when courting a female the pair enter an spiraling dance into the deep, forming a sort of double helix shape as they speed downwards into the abyss. the speed and agility of the male is the determining factor in the dance, if he is able to keep up with her and will stay with her to the deepest possible depths she can reach however it is a long and drawn out process sometimes taking several hours before completion. the dance is extremely swift and because of such it is also a test of endurance, some dances have at some points been more than thirty kilometers per hour. when there is competition over a mate the two beasts entangle themselves with each other and try to assert dominance by using their heads as clubs, bashing the other into submission before chasing him away from his female. fights are usually non lethal and their appear to be instinctual rules of engagement no biting or attempts at constriction are made as neither wishes for serious damage to impair them.  when hunting their prey Jormungandr generally attempt to attack them from beneath or from somewhere hidden and dark where they can ambush. once their plan is in action they attack at a deadly speed and twist their bodies around their prey and attempt to constrict them so that the pressure of constriction causes a rise in the pressure in the prey's body cavity greater than the heart can counter, resulting in immediate cardiac arrest. the snake then uses its powerful jaws and razor Sharp teeth to slice the corpse into manageable chunks of flesh which are then swallowed. Jormungandr enact territories in the sea regions which expand and contract like normal species with the bountifulness of food, each territory usually has a cave system or coral reef which they use as an area to go into a digestive semi-sleep in which they are usually very much inactive between 4-8 hours depending on the size of the meal being digested. territory sizes can range between 40-70 miles in size depending in competition from rivaling territorial males and as said before, the availability of food. physical appearance a long eel like body of green with an endless line of terrible glowing bioluminescent patterns of blue, its head crowned by many tendrils, each with luminous lanterns of angler fish like similarities on the tips which swirl around its head like stars which the Jormungandr can control the intensity of the light of quite easily. they have one long fin like structure which forms a single ribbon running along much of the length of the animal and their eyes glow a vibrant and unearthly green. they have a very strong and powerful jaw and an array of teeth of sabre like quality to slice and rip through the flesh of a kill. normal prey: whales, large fish, Angler whales.... submarines  Name: Shoggoth Colossal deep sea Protoplasm Proto Gigantis intelligence level: same level as the normal Amoeba (except from specially made cases currently not in the wild ), its only goals are to eat and reproduce and continue onwards, however have shown some very basic tactics in catching food. Age of Maturity: immediate maturity Maximum Age: technically immortal, when it reproduces part of the original splits off to form a new Shoggoth meaning that it will literally \u201clive\u201d through its descendants.  length: 15-20 meters across when in sphere weight: 30 metric tons ways of attack: When Shoggoth come into contact with food, the receptors on the Shoggoths surface will bind to them. This binding will lead to the engulfing of the food by the Shoggoth. once in the main body of the Shoggoth it separates the creature into a compartment where it then excretes an extreme amount of powerful acid into it, dissolving and killing the target whilst providing a nutritious soup for the Shoggoth, the acid is then stored and then slowly secretes the deadly acids into the surrounding area. deepest ever found: 130,000 ft behaviour: acts like any other Amoeba, eat, grow, reproduce and repeat. physical appearance: a massive amoeba-like creature who\u2019s flesh appears to bear resemblance to a mixture of tar and oil slick like substance, with multiple green glowing sensory organs on the surface which monitor light intensity, temperature and humidity among other things. They are \"protoplasmic\", lacking any default body shape and instead being able to form limbs of liquid like flesh at will and being able to squeeze through extremely tight crevices and pipes. it can also exert tremendous pressure when trying to force its way through doors or equally halting obstacles and can cave them in when applying a certain amount of tenacity. normal prey: fish and many of the remaining natural speciesThe Swarm  Hell-fury Locusts (The Scourge): based off the original locust with an semi locust-ant like mentality, the Hell-fury are most definitely more controllable by their Ambrosian masters. Unlike the original locusts they are a hive like species each functioning with under a military warrior caste. They do not normally swarm and generally are passive apart from taking down prey to bring back to the hive. They are separated into two castes, The Warriors are the largest species of them and generally defend the hive and eggs within with vicious fury against intruders. The worker Locusts are more common and smaller, working as a foraging force for the edible plant life of the jungle or small animals. generally hives of the can reach hundreds of thousands in population. They share a symbiotic relationship with the Reapers, and the two species often intermingle their hives for the sake of increased defense and pooling resources. however a violent change happens when these seemingly harmless insects receive signals to swarm. The Reaper queen sends out pheromones to her followers which the Locusts also follow. One they have moved into a swarm mode they begin to adapt thick dark black carapaces, sharper claws and the activate the before innate ability to spit acidic poison as well as going into a breeding frenzy. Many then latch on to the Reapers which form carriers as they head on their destructive migration instinctually towards lands outside the fungal forests (this mega swarm can be directed in a certain direction by Ambrosian military by the usage of pheromones). The newly formed swarm the combines with the other swarms of Reapers and Locusts forming a mega swarm of hundreds of millions of bugs. The swarm then moves towards lands outside of Ambrosia chewing up and destroying the native plant life and other insects as well as smaller animals. The Reapers take down the bigger creatures and quickly the swarm devours all in their path. Eventually many of the locusts will die out, but that in turn spreads the sea of corruption (due to spores caught in their carapace) ensuring a nutrient rich soil, fertilised by their corpses on which the terrifying fungus will grow. some others will survive and revert back to their normal states and set up new colonies in the newest addition to Ambrosia's jungle. Reapers: Reapers are giant dinner-plate sized insects with a vicious tendency to swarm and slice peoples heads of with their scythe like limbs. They function as the minor heavy infantry of the aerial insect forces during the swarming period and are intensely dangerous due to there large numbers and the speed of which they attack. They are ruled by a hierarchy of queens who produce the new reapers, they can have as many as three to four queens per colony. They work in unison with the Hell-Fury Locusts and often provide them a carrier base for them to use as transport as well as combining hives to make a much heavily protected base. The Queens are generally provoked into a swarming after the hive gets too large and by the usage of chemical agents specially created by Ambrosia. The queen then starts to produce a pheromone which she then spreads across a large area, causing more Reapers and Hell-fury Locust hives to swarm. They are then driven towards the edges of the forests by the usage of chemical signals by the Ambrosians and instinct. the swarm then builds up in the millions as they cross the border and combine into one massive super swarm of hundreds of millions and begin to destroy all in their path in one insatiable pestilence. Another minor trait of them is the ability to spit bony spikes at incredible speeds towards a target effectively impaling them, it doesn't help that the spike is covered with several different poisons and acids. The Bloominberg: a large spore infested insect, as big as a horse and fitted with 4 pairs of massive wings which keep it aloft. It has a set of large pincher's and a massive abdomen filled with highly flammable chemicals which it spews in a long jet towards an aggressor. These flammable jets can reach as far as 30 meters and are extremely corrosive when encountering armour or flesh, with armour it can cause excessive damage if not removed quickly as it begins to weaken and corrode the armour on immediate impact. When coming into contact with flesh the substance can melt parts of the body off and cause extreme pain and an agonising death if not removed immediately. Even which immediate removal the chemical mix can cause debilitating injuries. In its natural form the chemical mix is not flammable, but when mixed with certain enzymes within the insects body it reacts violently and causes the violent projection of fire. The large pincher's are also dangerous in close combat , they overlap and the Bloominberg has enough strength in there claws to disembowel an enemy in its grip. Its third weapon is two movable blade limbs raised in the air they can achieve massive damage with repeated sharp stabbing motions which can repeatedly impale opponents with a vicious fury. Due to its size it is quite slow in the air but this is made up by its ability to control Reapers and Locusts and send then towards enemy forces, distracting the enemy while the Bloominberg gets closer before telling them to disengage with chemical signals before spraying its deadly payload. On the ground the Bloominberg moves quickly for its size and can achieve the same speed as the average humans ability to run but with greater endurance. It has the ability to take massive damage before succumbing to its wounds and is a terrifying enemy for any armed soldier to face Varian Insects:Varian Insects are four-legged bugs approximately two to three meters long and are colored as to the terrain, such as jungle insects will be green with brown stripes. The rearmost pairs of legs are much longer than the two front forelegs, and serve as the primary locomotion, the forelegs being 1/3 shorter. Varian Insects are quite agile and fast, they can climb and burrow. These bugs utilize a powerful pincer-like mandible that is capable of crushing rock, metal and severing limbs as a means of attack. The two upper forelegs or \"side mandibles\" are utilized in the manner of swords for attack as well as defense. They are devastating in this role as they reach out to well over a meter, 2 feet further than their forelegs or 3 feet further than its actual mandibles. It is said that they can lose a limb and still fight with 86% efficiency. They also have very tough exo-skeletons, being able to take a large amount of fire before they succumb to their wounds. they habitually swarm in large numbers and are able to overwhelm enemy forces by the sheer amount of them there are. they can reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour and can quickly outrun humans and attack with great swiftness. Blanks: CLASSIFIEDBlashyrkh Blashyrkh  Backing: LIN Motto: The shadow of Blashyrkh spreads, with it's masses of PEERMAAFROOOOSST!!!! Capital: Ravendark Largest City: Ravengate Independence declared: 2084 Official Languages: English and Swedish Government Type: Unitary Constitutional Monarchy Population: 124,650,000 Economy: Mixed Economy Currency: KorneGeography and Environment  In the Northwest, Blashyrkh has some fertile plains, which is used mainly as farmlands. The Northeastern part is very hilly and is used for raising livestock for food. Given the two differing landscapes Blashyrkhans built their major city in the southern part, while using the northern part to farm and raise livestock. The Mountains of Might is a mountain range that runs from the southern coast 2/3rds of the way to the northern coast, nearly splitting Blashyrkh in half. The largest mountain in the range is Mount North, located 1/4 of the way from the southern end, called thus for being directly north of the Capital Ravendark. There is a large pass southeast Mount North which is used to connect Ravendark to Ravengate. Government: The current king of Blashyrkh is King Abbath. The current Prime Minister is Demonaz. Although the king is mostly only a ceremonial position, he still is Commander-in-Chief. He is also able to veto laws that have passed through the Parlement, which must then be passed with 75% agreement to overrule the king's decision. A term in Parlament is for eight years. Every two years, there are elections for a quarter of the Parlament. Every year the major positions, besides Prime Minister which is every two, inside of Parlament are voted on by the Parlament. Demographics: Due to the Government Regulation of the economy, there are always openings for any unemployed people in Blashyrkh. Whether it is as working on the farm in the Northwest or mining or factory work in Ravengate. Due to this, unemployment is low in Blashyrkh. Although there are lots of opportunities for employment farming or working in Ravengate, the focus of Blashyrkh is research and education. Besides Ravengate, Blashyrkh cities have many colleges. Tuition is fairly inexpensive for the students that were able to pass through primary school. The colleges in Blashyrkh are also open students from other nations, offering discounts to other LIN nations. Economy and Sciences: While most of the cities in Blashyrkh are full of colleges and research facilities, Ravengate is almost purely industrial. It is also where a large portion of the population of Blashyrkh lives. Mining is very prevalent in Ravengate, with the Mountains of Might being rich in ores and coal. Tuition from foreign students also brings in a large amount of revenue. Due to Blashyrkh's recent independence, it does not have much of it's own weaponry research. However, Ursaca has given Blashyrkh a manufacturer's licence on their weaponry. Giving them a template for production and improvement. The weapons produced can be for personal use or for export. Most current military research is going into naval purposes. Blashyrkh is also putting in research for improving farming in their harsh landscape to be able to feed a larger population.Military  Due to having a Manufacturer's License from Ursaca, Blashyrkh uses many weapons and vehicles from Ursaca.Ursacan Weaponry  F88 Bullpup Assault Rifle\nManufacturer: Commonwealth Defence Industries\nWeight: 3.6 kg\nLength: 800 mm\nBarrel length: 480 mm\nCartridge: 7.62\u00d751mm\nAction: Gas-operated, rotating bolt\nRate of fire: 750 RPM (Selective fire: Semi, Burst, Full-Auto)\nMuzzle velocity with Overpressure Rounds: 1120 m/s\nEffective range: 200 meters\nMax Effective range: 900 meters\nMaximum range: 3129 meters\nFeed system: 45 round magazine or 200 round Drum Magazine\nCompatible with the F100 Series F14 Infantry Automatic Rifle\nManufacturer: Commonwealth Defence Industries\nWeight: 3.6 kg\nLength: 840 mm\nBarrel length: 420 mm\nCartridge: 7.62\u00d751mm\nAction: Gas-operated, rotating bolt\nRate of fire: 700 RPM (Selective Fire: Burst(3 round), Full-Auto)\nMuzzle velocity with Overpressure Rounds: 1236 m/s\nEffective range: 200 meters\nMax Effective range: 1000 meters\nMaximum range: 3647 meters\nFeed system: 50 Round Magazine or 100 Round Beta-C Magazine\nCompatible with the F100 Series\nAble to be used with the F99 F54 Designated Marksmans Rifle\nManufacturer: Commonwealth Defence Industries\nWeight: 4.5 kg\nLength: 1,118 mm\nBarrel length: 559 mm\nCartridge: 7.62x51mm\nAction: Gas-operated\nRate of fire: Semi-Automatic\nMuzzle velocity with Overpressure Rounds: 1400 m/s\nEffective range: 600 meters\nMax Effective range: 1500 meters\nMaximum range: 4000 meters\nFeed system: 5, 10 or 20-round magazine\nCompatible with the F100 Series F56 Anti-Material Rifle\nManufacturer: Commonwealth Defence Industries\nWeight: 4.5 kg\nLength: 1,118 mm\nBarrel length: 559 mm\nCartridge: .50 BMG\nAction: Gas-operated, rotating bolt\nRate of fire: Semi-Automatic\nMuzzle velocity with Overpressure Rounds: 1579 m/s\nEffective range: 600 meters\nMax Effective range: 1500 meters\nMaximum range: 6000 meters\nFeed system: 5, 10 or 20-round magazine\nCompatible with the F100 Series 'F51 Car Alarm' Anti-Light Armour Rifle\nManufacturer: Commonwealth Defence Industries\nWeight: 20 kg\nLength: 1,168 mm\nBarrel length: 780 mm\nCartridge: 30 x 78 mm SABOT or 30 x 78 mm HEAT\nAction: Semi-Automatic\nRate of fire: Semi-Automatic\nMuzzle velocity with Overpressure Rounds: 2476 m/s\nEffective range: 1000 meters\nMax Effective range: 4600 meters\nMaximum range: 8000 meters\nFeed system: 1 round breech loaded\nCrew: 4 (1 'Sniper' 1 Spotter 1 Loader 1 Bracer) *Spotter and Bracer also serve as Crew Security\n*Can be used without a bracer and a loader, however efficiency is reduced tremendously\nDescription: A Large Crew Served Weapon that requires heavy bracing before fire.

Bellows pockets provide ample carrying capacity. The material (fabric) offers good mechanical properties but still allows good air permeability.The fibres (aramid/viscose FR) are flame- and wash-resistant. The flak jacket accommodates: The electronic jacket integrates the electronics (computer unit, manager unit, radio, man-machine interface, Map, Radar, cables and connector), flexible water bottle, weapon magazines and grenades, and optimises weight distribution on the soldier.The equipment is autonomous and can be used alone. The RBC combat clothing is only issued when biological or chemical threats are expected, however gas masks are standard issue regardless. The permanent combat clothing is designed to allow combat phases to be carried out with the same efficiency as that achieved with conventional combat clothing. Camouflage There have been many rumours about introduction of a new camouflage pattern. Demonstrator models have been disclosed sporting DPCU (Disruptive Pattern Camouflage), flecktarn and an original spot camouflage pattern Portable electronic platform (PEP) The PEP lies at the heart of the BIDA system. Designed to utilise all the electronic resources found on the electronic jacket (computer, energy manager, peripheral equipment interfaces, user interfaces), The system is built around a USB 7.5. digital data bus. This choice of open broadband digital data bus and extensive connectivity gives the portable electronic platform, and hence the system, strong interoperability.Individual energy sourcesPeripheral equipment can be connected to the physical connection ports situated at the front of the battery units. Power sources will be made of two rechargeable Li-ion batteries Helmet The helmet is composed of three components: head protection, communication headset and optronic equipment. The ballistic shell optimises protection and load-bearing ergonomics (weight distribution). It can accommodate various items required for the mission (facial protection screens) and its shape is compatible with all firing positions of the weapons used.A lightweight, integrated protective shield protects the infantryman from various threats (wind, rain, dust, UV). Non-linear earplugs afford auditory protection. The NBC mask can be equipped with a filter cartridge or linked to the ventilation powerpack. A tube built into the NBC mask can be used to take in liquids (water, food).The communication headset is linked to the radio. It holds the microphone and earpiece and works by bone vibrations (bone conduction transducer). It works independently from the helmet and can therefore remain in operation when the helmet is removed.\nThe optronic equipment is composed of mission interface overshell integrating the optronics, head camera (EBCMOS light intensification technology), image display units (OLED technology) allowing data and icons transmitted on the bus system to be displayed, images and video coming from the weapon or the head camera. The image display unit is fixed to the helmet: its screen can be brought into line with infantryman's eye. When not in use, it can be folded away so as not to hinder the soldier. BIDA information network The BIDA information network (RIF: Radio Information Network) allows information to be shared throughout the infantry section. Each radio can subscribe to two networks simultaneously. This offers the squad leader some flexibility in organising communication networks in his section. Each network has an audio conference channel, with priority given to the squad leader, an alert channel from the infantryman to his leader, and a data transmission channel. Voice and data transmission is based on tried and tested DECT civilian technology (domestic cordless telephone technology). Each sub-network works from a base carried by the squad leader. As RIF sets are all identical, a soldier can replace his commander if necessary by configuring his set as base. The radio is configured by the BIDA computer, thereby limiting the number of control buttons needed on the set.Developed Aircrafts  Unsilent Storm  Mk1 Type: Naval Bomber\nModel Number: 1\nManufacturer: Blashyrkh Military Industries\nCrew: 4\nWing Span: 34.2m\nMaximum speed: 750 m/s\nArmament: 4x 23mm Autocannons, Bomb Bay capacity for 75 Bombs or Torpedoes (of varied Yield), 6 Anti-Ship Missiles Wrath From Above Mk1 Type: Close-support aircraft\nModel Number: 2\nManufacturer: Blashyrkh Military Industries\nCrew: 2\nWing Span: 13.5m\nMaximum speed: 819 m/s\nArmament: 2x 40mm Autocannon, 6 Air to Air Missiles (Guided, Lock- On), 4 Anti-Ship Missiles (swapped for Air to Ground when not used on the sea), 4 290mm Bombs (or Torpedoes) Heart of Winter Mk1 Type: Strike FIghter\nModel Number: 3\nManufacturer: Blashyrkh Military Industries\nCrew: 1\nWing Span: 12.1m\nMaximum speed: 832 m/s\nArmament: 2x 23mm Autocannons, 8 Air to Air Missiles (Guided, Lock- On), 4 Anti-Ship Missiles (swapped for Air to Ground when not used on the sea) Norden Type: Unmanned Aircraft\nModel Number: 4\nManufacturer: Blashyrkh Military Industries\nCrew: 0\nWing Span: 11.67m\nMaximum speed: 795 m/s\nArmament: 8 Air to Ground (Anti-Ship when used over water) Missiles (able to be Guided or Heatseeking or Designated), 4 Air to Air Missiles (able to be Locked on), 1 23mm Autocannon Solarfall\nType: Transport Helicopter\nModel Number: 5\nCrew: 2\nCapacity:\n80 troops or\n40 litters and 5 attendents\nArmament:\n2x door mounted .50 machineguns\n(some also include a ramp mounted .50 machinegun)Developed Armor Black Frog Armor Mk 1  Lightweight Power Armor Armor: The armor is a fully sealed suit able to carry its own weight while also increasing the carrying capacity of the wearer by 300 lbs while retaining full efficiency. The suit also allows the wearer to sprint at speeds up to 40 mph. The suit also has a detachable hydrojet backpack allowing for underwater travel at 4 knots. The suit has a built in air tank to be used underwater or in hazardous environments. The helmet of the suit provides the user with protection from most small arms fire and shrapnel. The visor comes equipped with normal, thermal, and nightvision. The visor also contains information on the objectives, remaining air in the tanks, and the wearer's vitals. The helmet also contains both short and long range communication devices. The Bodysuit provides both protection to the chest and abdomen from rifle caliber bullet rounds such as the 7.62mm round with the hardened plates on it's chest, the upper arms, and upper legs from shrapnel. It has three layers to protect the chest and abdomen from bullets. It also features an on-board physiological and medical sensor suite that would collect and monitor information regarding vital signs such as body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, hydration and stress levels, and sleep status. The lower legs and shins feature less armour to keep mobility to optimal levels, however they are resistant to shrapnel and 9mm pistol rounds. The Power system includes hydrogen-electric battery cores stationed throughout the body in the inner area to keep the cores from harm (the battery cores can last up to 18 days before the batteries need to be re-charged) and Polymeric nanofiber battery patches embedded in the headgear and upper shoulders provide backup power for 4 hours. The suit is made for the Sons of Southern Darkness use.Military Doctrine  The military of Blashyrkh is mainly an aquatic force with a standing land based army for protection on the land. Blashyrkh has a combined Naval and Air Force, with most of their aircrafts being stored on carriers. They also have a small Marine force that is used to set up a safe landing point for the army when attacking a mainland. The Marine Force is also used to conquer smaller islands without support from the army. Army Navy Marine Force The Sons of Southern Darkness are the elite force of the marines. They are equipped with the Dark Frog Armor to be able to make a swift first strike and scout while the rest of the marines follow behind them.Juggernaut The Character  Name: Cain Marko Origin:\u00a0Marvel Gender: Male Height: 8'0 (2.45 cm) Weight: 1 Ton Species: Human/Mutant Classification: Mysticall Empowered Human Age: Middle aged (If anyone has specfics, please update.)Powers and Abilities  Superhuman strength, speed, durability, reactions and stamina, immortality (Types 3, 4 and 6), regeneration (at least low-mid), does not need food, water or oxygen to live, immune to psonics due to his helmet, enourmous willpower (was flayed to a skeleton and kept fighting due to sheer hatred keeping him alive), teleportation due to his portals to the Crimson Dimension, forcefields, virtually unstoppable once in motion to anything short of cosmic beings Weaknesses: Vulnerable to telepathic attacks when his helmet and skullcap are removed, not very intelligent.

The area is close to 11 million square kilometres and contains huge mountain ranges covering the northern and eastern coasts as well as a massive range running through the heart of the nation. The majority of the mountainous parts of the nation are forested, while in between the mountain ranges large expanses of rolling, lightly wooded grasslands and plains dominate. Over 40 major rivers flow through the Protectorate, crisscrossing the nation and, in conjunction with many major canals, provide easy transport over the country. While the Protectorate stretches over such a vast area, it's weather is quite uniform, in one respect: it is bitterly cold for much of the year. This is most true in the northern sections of the Protectorate, where almost all food production is done in heated hydroponic farms, as the growing season above ground lasts only 3 months. Cities of the Protectorate are massive and sprawling affairs, dominating the landscape with concrete and steel towers housing tens of thousands of people. The layout of most cities in the Protectorate follows a rigid grid pattern, with large, multi-lane thoroughfares crossing through them at regular intervals and raised light rail networks running between buildings. Subway systems link them further, with at least one stop per block. A common sight in the core of such cities is VTOL landing pads and airports jutting from the upper stories of larger buildings, housing upwards of twenty private aircraft. To keep citizens living in these mega cities happy there are numerous parks dotting them, along with roof top gardens. Indoor water features are also common, often consisting of small ponds and circulating streams in public spaces of housing complexes. The largest such water feature is the Vista, a five story atrium featuring a three full waterfalls, nine hundred feet of streams and brooks and a two acre lake, all of which is topped with a curved screen recreating the sky and with walls which make the room appear to be in a valley. The Vista contains over 150 trees and masses of other vegetation and is host to four cafes and two five-star restaurants, one of which, Fallsview, has been rated as Wyvern's top restaurant for the past eight years.Government:  The Protectorate is divided into 135 states, which each elect a Senator from the members of their House of Representatives. The House of Representatives is made up of 100 Representatives elected by popular vote from each of the 50 Districts that make up a State. A President is elected by the Senate and serves for a term of 3 years. The President picks a cabinet of 11 members and the Governor Militant as their advisers. The Governor Militant is appointed by the military high command and is the President\u2019s military adviser in times of peace. In times of war, the Governor Militant assumes the position of head of state of the Protectorate. During this time the Governor Militant is given the powers to conscript civilians into the army, assume control of industrial production, limit travel and bring citizens or foreign travellers in for questioning for up to 72 hours without charge. As the powers are so extreme the Senate must vote every three months to determine if the Protectorate is still in at war, with a 70% majority, or the President replaces him/her as the head of state.Demographics:  Its citizens are a hard working and compassionate, hailing from dozens of different countries. There is no standard citizen of the Protectorate, no one appearance that declares one as a \u201cWarpian\u201d. Since the founding of the Protectorate, no single race or nation has been supreme and all portions of the Protectorate have had more or less equal shares of power and equal chances at success. The one way in which the Protectorate has been effected by the old nations which it originated from is in it's language. Since the bulk of the Protectorate's original territory was part of Old Russia, Russian language has made itself a major contender for the language of the Protectorate. However, since English was making so much progress around the world, before the fall, it had become common in almost all areas, leading to it's primacy. However, with such a high percentage of the original population speaking Russian, it has managed to carry on as an unofficial secondary language, even as far as being used in the nicknaming of many Protectorate vehicles. Since the diversity is so great there is no single religion in the Protectorate. However, the main religion practised is technically nameless and has no official structure, but is often referred to as simply Conflict. Its practised in many ways, by people from every walk of life. There are three facets to the religion, each with it's own views and codes. There is Strategy, which lends itself well to long term planning, for people such as accountants, architects, engineers and people with similar types of long term views. People who practice Strategy tend to take longer to make decisions, but the wait is usually worth it, as they have thought out every possible scenario and made considerations for them. The second facet of Conflict is Tactics, which, while similar to Strategy, differs in it's focus on the best short term results, while maintaining flexibility. While a person practising Tactics may get things done rapidly, there is more chance that something will be left unaccounted for, however, their on the go decision making leaves them in a position to fix whatever problems crop up. The third face is War, which takes aspects of both Strategy and Tactics, but adds a focus on achieving goals, no matter what the cost, to you or others. A CEO who leads a hostile takeover of a rival company would likely be practising War, as his or her actions will likely lead to lost jobs for the rival company, which shows his or her ruthlessness in pursuit of their goals, while showing long term planning in that the market their company works in has been consolidated in their favour. Due to the Protectorate's policies regarding new territories and of abolishing tyrannical governments, citizens of the Protectorate are some of the most devoted in the world, which has lead to enormous recruitment rates for all branches of the armed forces. To most, service in the armed forces isn't seen as a duty, but more as a privilege and honour, especially in the newer states which have only recently been freed from oppressive governments, dictators or outright genocidal psychopaths.Economy and Sciences:  While lagging behind its closest ally, Alperia, the Protectorate is still a leader in the fields of heavy combat mechanics. The heaviest of the Protectorates tanks weigh in at as much as a battleship and have defences tough enough to take direct hits from nuclear warheads while staying in the fight. Along with super heavy tanks, the Protectorate has a soft spot for artillery, which in combination with their massive armoured units has lead to mobile artillery that makes the old railway cannons, such as the Dora, look like pea-shooters. The Protectorate's massive population makes for a thriving economic market, ranging from industrial machinery to luxury goods. A major factor in the Protectorate's dominance as an industrial juggernaut is the manufactory bunker complexes that are scattered all across the nation. Built on or near major resource deposits they are dug deep, a legacy of the Drakite Wars and the need for defence which sprung form them. They span many kilometres in all directions and contain everything from mines and smelters to hydroponic farms and bio fuel production plants. In essence, they provide any goods imaginable and are each a near impregnable fortress, usually with upwards of a regiment of the Protectorate Army stationed at them.Military:  The Protectorate military forces form a battle-hardened juggernaut, capable of crushing any foe. Protectorate soldiers are deployed en mass, using numerical superiority, overwhelming firepower, and massively powerful armoured units to crush their enemy under a mountain of blood, flesh, boots and steel. As it possesses the largest military in the history of man, the Protectorate is seldom subtle in it's use of force and favours \u201clarger hammer\u201d solutions, as a rule. A notable testiment to the effectiveness of Warpian armoured units is the kill counts of the Protectorate's two top tank aces. The top ace team, Major Desya Hale Kuznetsov and his crew, has a total of 524 confirmed and over 300 probable kills, while the second ace team of Major Yakim Illarion Zolnerowich and his crew has 152 confirmed and 35 probable kills (these only count enemy vehicles or biologics over 1,700kg). An oddity of the Protectorate military is thr freedom which is given to tank commanders, in regards to customization of their vehicles with additional armour, replacement weapon systems and other such various modifications. Explosive reactive armour is such a common choice that it is nearly standard equipment, while ultra hardened glacis addons and cage armour can be found on at least one in three vehicles. Pulse rifles and rotary pulse guns are often added in place of standard machine guns, due to their added punch. One Armoured Regiment, the 33rd, is quite fond of rear racks loaded with multiple deployable Shrike missile pods which they scatter in their wake to provide rear coverage.Military Doctrine:  Armoured thrusts, lead by brigades of multi-thousand-ton monsters, preceded by artillery barrages that fall as thick as rain and followed by columns of infantry that swarm like ants from a nest, the Protectorate\u2019s army isn\u2019t a subtle thing. On rare occasions black-ops work is needed the 1 Spetsnaz Brigade is deployed, the lead commando units clad in power armour, gifted to the Protectorate by Alperia. Of course, the Protectorate military being what it is, the armour is suitably modified to fit the mindset of the Protectorate, ending with each suit being near twice the size and toting \u201cbattle rifles\u201d more akin to gatling anti tank cannons.-----------------------Infantry Equipment--------------------- -----------------Unpowered Armour-----------------  ICA-3 Infantry Combat Armour Weight: 45 lbs\nProtection levels:\n--Head: Lv III\n--Chest: Lv IV\n----Sides: Lv IV\n----Back: Lv III\n----Neck: Lv IV\n--Thigh: Lv III\n----Groin: Lv IV\n--Calf: Lv III\n--Shoulder: Lv III\n--Bicep: Lv III\n--Forearm: Lv III\nNotes:\nMade of a segmented, hard synthetic-composite sheath over a layer of kevlar, then overlapping ultra hard ceramic disks, followed by a second kevlar layer.

CDA-4 Classification: Dozer Blade\nArmour: 30-200mm (Fullerene enhanced Warpian steel)\nNotes: Multiple hardened chisel tip teeth provide ground breaking ability, allowing it to dig into hard surfaces. Made in various sizes to accommodate all TWP armoured vehicles. Can be raised to aide mobility when the dozer is not in use. Troika ADS Classification: Active Denial System\nNotes: A modular active denial system for use on TWP armoured vehicles. The level of the system can be increased, based on the size of the platform and the need, mission to mission. Each system is based around a core group of detection systems, using radar, ultrasonic, infrared and magnetic sensors placed around the vehicle. The sensors report to a primary control computer, situated in the crew compartment, which determines the threat and an appropriate response. The PCC then sends the command to any of the Denial Modules and any linked weapons systems, which then engage the target in a multiply redundant, overlapping sweep of a mixture of fragmentation rounds, lasers and linked gatling guns. Each Denial pod is capable of engaging and destroying up to five threats over a seventy degree, conical area. Arena CAMP Classification: Computer Aide Master Processor\nNotes: Arena is a system of remote sensors, connected to a central computer in the crew compartment which aides the crew in various tasks, such as targeting information, navigation, fire tracking, friendly force locations and various other tasks. The system is technically a low grade \u201cdumb\u201d AI, yet even though it lacks the full capabilities of an AI, it's assistance dramatically improves the lethality of any vehicle it's mounted on.--------------------Military Aircraft--------------------  Mi-45 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b Classification: Aerial Infantry Fighting Vehicle\nWeight: 14 tonnes\nLength: 55

The Shiva has the ability to \"eat\" enemy vehicles by stepping on them, using heavy duty grinders built into it's feet to convert their materials into ammunition, via an internal foundry. Speaker systems boom inspirational mottos and commands to the troops near it, goading Warpians into greater feats of bravery, coming from the embodiment of their gods. Near impenetrable layers of advanced armour composites, electronic warfare systems and active interception systems make the Shiva nearly indestructible.\nBasically...run.
