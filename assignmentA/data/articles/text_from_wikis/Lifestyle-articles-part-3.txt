It is named after the Southern African ethical ideology Ubuntu (philosophy) (\"humanity towards others\") and is distributed as free and open source software with additional proprietary software available. Ubuntu provides an up-to-date, stable operating system for the average user, with a strong focus on usability and ease of installation. Ubuntu has been selected by readers of desktoplinux.com as the most popular Linux distribution for the desktop, claiming approximately 30% of Linux desktop installations in both 2006 and 2007. Web statistics from late 2009 suggest that Ubuntu's share is between 40 and 50%. Ubuntu is composed of multiple software packages, of which the vast majority are distributed under a free software license also known as open source. The main license used is the GNU General Public License which, along with the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL), explicitly declares that users are free to run, copy, distribute, study, change, develop and improve the software. Ubuntu is sponsored by the UK-based company Canonical Ltd. , owned by South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth . By keeping Ubuntu free and open source, Canonical is able to utilize the talents of community developers in Ubuntu's constituent components. Instead of selling Ubuntu for profit, Canonical creates revenue by selling technical support and from creating several services tied to Ubuntu. Canonical endorses and provides support for three additional Ubuntu-derived operating systems: Kubuntu , Edubuntu and Ubuntu Server Edition. There are several other derivative operating systems including local language and hardware-specific versions. Canonical releases new versions of Ubuntu every six months and supports Ubuntu for eighteen months by providing security fixes, patches to critical bugs and minor updates to programs. LTS (Long Term Support) versions, which are released every two years, are supported for three years on the desktop and five years for servers. The 12th release of Ubuntu, 10.04 [[Lucid Lynx]}, was released on April 29, 2010. Maverick Meerkat 10.10 released was on 10 October 2010. It is 13th release of Ubuntu. It is supported until April 2012 10.10.History and development process  Ubuntu is a fork of the Debian project's code base. The original aim was to release a new version of Ubuntu every six months, resulting in a more frequently updated system. Ubuntu's first release was on October 20, 2004. The New York Times reported in January 2009 that Ubuntu had over ten million users.. In June 2009 ZDNet reported, \"Worldwide, there are 13 million active Ubuntu users with use growing faster than any other distribution. On 4 March 2010 Ubuntu, announced a new style for Ubuntu with the theme \"Light\" with the release of Lucid Lynx 10.04 LTS on 29 April 2010 and it will define the look and feel for several years.

Edubuntu. A complete Linux-based operating system targeted for primary and secondary education. It is freely available with community based support. The Edubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Edubuntu Manifesto: that software, especially for education, should be available free of charge and that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities. Since version 8.04, Edubuntu has now been named Ubuntu Education Edition and has been made as an add-on for the Ubuntu operating system. Gobuntu. Gobuntu was an official derivative of the Ubuntu operating system, aiming to provide a distribution consisting entirely of free software. It was officially announced by Mark Shuttleworth on July 10, 2007, and daily builds of Gobuntu 7.10 began to be publicly released. The project ended around the release of 8.04 and has since merged into mainline Ubuntu as a 'free software' option.

It was released in Japan in February 2012 on PC. Koei has not made any plans to release the game overseas. In December 2012 Wii U and PlayStation 3 versions were released in Japan, but not in Europe and the US. The game is designed to be played on low-end pc\u2019s and features a simple 2D world map, 2D cities and 2D battlefields. The game can also be played on touchscreens and tablets. 481 characters appear in this game, which is a lot less than in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI, but all characters do have new (high quality) portraits, which was not the case in XI. In 2016 it's successor was released; Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII.Gameplay  The gameplay basically consists of two phases; the managing phase and the battle phase. In the managing phase you build buildings in your cities through which you gain money, food, fame and troops, or through which you can build up your defense, increase your army\u2019s strength, defense, range and speed and research special plans and build siege weapons. The managing phase is turn-based. The battle phase is where you put all your acquired officers, troops, siege weapons and researches into action in hopes of either gaining new territory or not lose any territory. The battles in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XII are real-time, but can be paused at any minute to give orders or use special abilities.Managing Cities  There are four different types of cities: Agriculture, Commerce, Normal City and Big City. An agricultural city raises the effectiveness of farms by 1,5, a commercial city raises the effectiveness of markets by 1,5, a normal city does not raise effectiveness of anything but usually has more building spots and a big city has the most building spots of all city types and slightly raises effectiveness of farms, markets and barracks by 1,2. In every city buildings can be places on building spots. There are eight types of buildings: farms, markets, barracks, guard stations, plots, smiths, finders and academies. Farms and markets will get you food and money. Food and money is both for your troops, but money is also needed to build or upgrade buildings, creating siege weapons and researching. A barrack will get you new troops. The more barracks you have the higher your draft. A guard station raises your fame, which will attract more officers, but it will also increase your city defense. At a smith you can build rams and catapults, with the latter being the most expensive but the more effective one. Before you can build siege weapons, you need to do a research at your academies. You need to place two Academies in a city to be able to let officers research there. Finally, the finder lets one of your officers recruit new officers or search for valuable items. Early on it\u2019s recommended to quickly acquire more troops and officers, so you should build a finder in a couple of cities and two or three barracks per city. The remainder of the building spots can be filled up with farms (one per city is more than enough), markets (the more, the better), one or two smiths and two academies in a big city. All cities that are adjacent to enemy territory should have a Guard Station and a Plot.Battles  Battles in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XII are real-time. A battle can be triggered by deploying an army on an adjacent enemy territory. It is possible for both factions to request reinforcements. Victory or defeat is determined by a number of factors, such as the base strength of the officers involved, their special abilities, officer's LEAD, WAR and INT (which can be upgraded), troop size and army variety. When defending it might be wise to send archers and spearmen into battle. Archers can shoot arrows from your city wall, while spearmen can throw rocks. Enemy attacks are limited to special abilities (Fire) or archers, granting an advantage to defenders, while a city's gate is not destroyed (which often takes a while depending on its strength (Guard Stations) and the enemy's siege power). Horsemen can be valuable when used in quick ambushes on the enemy main camp as they are the fastest unit-type. While being on the attacking side it might be better to focus on siege weapons and infantry. Both of these units excel at taking down the enemy wall. One downside of the game's battle system is the lack of depth. Pikemen have been removed, the battle maps are usually rather small and on most maps the enemy camp can only be attacked from one or two sides. The battles are further hampered by the 800-second time limit, which makes a lot of battles pretty straight forward. Battles in which one team only has a slight upper-hand over the other, might not even reach a conclusion before the timer reaches 0. Despite all this, the game is still an enjoyable experience and should get an overseas release. If not retail, then as a download via the PlayStation Store or Xbox Live Marketplace.Fan-made English Patch  Some fans are currently busy creating English patches for the game.

So Misza would have to write a specialized importing script to import the content, which wikia would not do. Hope this helps explain, a little. ---Hockeyben 15:18, May 20, 2011 (UTC) @Hockeyben I don't understand, why are we importing stuff from Wikicars? - Isn't it a spam wasteland? And can't we import it manually? I don't feel like staying at ShoutWiki as Zantam says it is a poor wiki farm. Then I get cyber-harrased and Jedi0 and Jack Phoenix don't do jack sh*t about it. If anyone can find a host that's better than Wikia or ShoutWiki, I'll consider moving there. --Knightrez 15:22, May 20, 2011 (UTC) @Knight How many times do i have to tell you this?! Autopedia WILL NOT be recovered. Do any of us want to import 36,000 files manually? NO! This is the last time I'm telling you this, as you cannot seem to understand it. Unless you wanna start from scratch, getting Misza to do this is the only option thats the least bit reasonable. ---Hockeyben 20:30, May 20, 2011 (UTC) According to skizzerz, there is around a 1% chance of ap being recovered. So we'll almost certainly have to go to plan b. -Hockeyben 14:24, May 21, 2011 (UTC) He can. So no reason to be upset, knight.-Hockeyben 13:51, May 22, 2011 (UTC) This is plan b. There is no way to exclude the spam. And we DO NOT want to manually import 40,000 pages/images/templates. Sorry man, but this is the harsh truth and is the best we got. -Hockeyben 16:44, May 22, 2011 (UTC) We re-create autopedia sw. And have misza import to there. Just let me handle this.-Hockeyben 03:22, May 23, 2011 (UTC) Do I have to tell you this over and over? Misza is the only one who can import wikicars and we are NOT doing another manual import. After misza imports wikicars, then we can think about a new host. Get it?-Hockeyben 12:33, May 23, 2011 (UTC) I don't think any of the hosts can import databases larger than 2.1 mb. Without us doing something like a php import script or mediawikidumpertool, which both look extremely complicated. So we might be screwed and stuck with shoutwiki. Believe me. If any sized data dump could easily be uploaded, is be gone from sw now. -Hockeyben 12:51, May 23, 2011 (UTC) Looks like misza importing script may be done soon... First good news for autopedia in MONTHS! ---Hockeyben 14:22, May 30, 2011 (UTC) @Knight Remember Coolow, Bluezilla, Vegavairbob. They are part of the community, assuming they return when AP is back up. I may try msging them on wikicars. I own the Grandcherokee account there. ---Hockeyben 15:55, June 3, 2011 (UTC) And one minute after I post... Autopedia has a new message! It looks like the script may be done soon. (I'm just guessing here). ---Hockeyben 15:59, June 3, 2011 (UTC) The importer script for wikicars will not work, as their mediawiki software is outdated. Autopedia is doomed. So are rm's four years of dedication. I feel like crying as I type this.-Hockeyben 14:19, June 6, 2011 (UTC) I don't know how Knight's doing. I came online after he went off. Red marquis said he's done with autopedia, so that hurts, too. No other farms can help, as the reason the importer script doesn't work is because of technical issues with wikicars outdated mediawiki software not matching shoutwiki's (nor any other farms). So, basically, autopedia is screwed. I've asked staff to re-import the outdated wikia version, and we (me at least) will go from there. ---Hockeyben 22:09, June 6, 2011 (UTC) Thanks, I may join wikipedias car project, as it has 7300 articles, more than wikicars. Not to mention thousands more (Like formula 1) that wikicars also covered.-Hockeyben 14:46, June 7, 2011 (UTC)Autopedia  I've moved autopedia to wikkii\u00a0! We can now finally start working! btw, congrats on reaching 10k edits on GCM! ---Hockeyben 00:45, June 20, 2011 (UTC)Sengoku wiki  Hey there, how's it going? hope everythings fine! The wiki looks awesome by the way! I just came to say that I'm back on working on the Sengoku Peried wiki again since I finished my exams and all. If you don't mind could you remind me the codes to make templates next to each other on the front page (similar to yours)I kind of forgot most of them over the year lol\u00a0:P Yukimurasanada 09:19, June 29, 2011 (UTC) It looks less chaotic now\u00a0:-) What do you think? Imo: the font-type is better, but not really my kinda thing. The font-size is a bit random though. For example \"Links\" has a larger font-size than \"Welcome To...\". And the tables/templates on the mainpage are placed a bit messy. Perhaps you should try to make use of columns\u00a0;-) And there's that \"retrieved from...\" stuff at the bottom of the page. Why's that there? ---Zantam03 10:42, July 8, 2011 (UTC) I still think you should change the headers\u00a0:-P Mine have a width of 300px and I think that's the standard. Yours are 400px (Spotlight and Featured Image). If you wanna keep the column at the bottom, you should make them smaller, because right now the columns at the bottom still exceed their width, thanks to those large headers. I don't know what image-editting program you use, but GIMP is a pretty good (free) alternative for Photoshop. -Zantam03 20:37, July 10, 2011 (UTC) The one from the Sengoku link? It's Papyrus ---Zantam03 16:51, July 11, 2011 (UTC)Autopedia  Wikkii has been good for Autopedia... But nobody seems to feel like editing the new site, Red marquis, Knight (now Cavaliere) and myself don't really have the motivation after all that we have lost. Sorry, i've haven't had time to edit on here for quite a while now, I still have those portals to finish... Maybe within the next week. Shoutwiki is down again, as they are moving to a new server, after another outage. Sign up for an account on Wikkii Autopedia, and I can give your sysop rights back.\u00a0:) ---Hockeyben 00:48, June 30, 2011 (UTC) The main page was quickly thrown together by me when we moved, as the gallery-slider and mainpage-endcolumn only work on wikia, so it was useless. As for the shoutwiki one, knight did it, and I'm not sure the code he used, maybe I can re-create something similar - as I can't say I like the current main page either. As for who's going to import the pages, Knight has lost interest (1 edit in 2 weeks) I don't have the time with my hockey site, even with the sw outage, I use a text-file to write some new stuff) Red Marquis had made 7 edits since the move, and doesn't seem interested. So who's left? Seems we'll never return to our old glory. Shoutwiki had a minor crash, and finally said screw it, and are moving to a new, better server. The wikis are currently in read-only mode, so that's not a huge issue. If you wanna sign up on the new autopedia, I can give you your rights back, right now, we're in desperate need of users. -Hockeyben 04:29, July 8, 2011 (UTC) I quickly moved to wikkii after the plan for the importing script didn't work out. It's the best farm other than wikia/shoutwiki, so maybe no consensus but people are fine with it. Just sign up if you feel like it, I'm not going to push you.-Hockeyben 15:00, July 8, 2011 (UTC) We are currently in contact with wikia. They may be able to import all of Knight's and Red marquis edits from wikicars. At least there's hope. ---Hockeyben 18:49, July 16, 2011 (UTC)Fonts  Where do get these font pictures? I'd like to use them. Also, do you have Special:Chat here? --Knightrez 11:06, July 15, 2011 (UTC)Autopedia/SW  SgoutWiki is still down, and I'm getting incredibly annoyed. At least I've been able to edit some on the English Wikipedia.\u00a0;) Wikia is probably going to be able to import all of Knight's, Red marquis, and TristanT's edits, possibly within the next week, so Autopedia may be able to return to its former glory. We can always hope!!! ---Hockeyben 23:33, August 1, 2011 (UTC)Chronicle Three Kingdoms  Hallo Zantam03, my Name is Paulus and I am very fond of three kingdoms. I have red that you have a copy of \"The Chroncle of the Three Kingdoms\" of Achilles Fang as PDF. Can you send me a copy please? My email: waeregut@hotmail.com Thanks a lot. PaulusThe Lost Bladesmen  I rented and watched The Lost Bladesmen from Blockbuster yestarday. Guan Yu and the movie is so popular in Taiwan that the blockbluster guy told me they'd been all rented out when I was there. --Knightrez 11:51, August 7, 2011 (UTC)Backups  There are now backups for every single Shoutwiki site available to the public. I finally feel safe with my wiki on SW, even though the site is still down. Shame this wasn't put in place earlier, or Autopedia could have been saved. Btw, what do you think of Wikia's new user profiles? ---Hockeyben 15:06, August 22, 2011 (UTC) 4,500 pages and 26,000 images have been imported from Wikicars to automobile.wikia! The five month crisis is finally over! Can you change the link to autopedia on GCM's main page?---Hockeyben 16:38, September 2, 2011 (UTC)Jiang Wei  Jiang Wei is completely copied from Wikipedia. It should be deleted. ---Hockeyben 17:11, September 6, 2011 (UTC)Personage Layout and Qiao Xuan  User Vvill just wrote a bio about Qiao Xuan and he used Layout Personages for this. I think Layouts suck man and it comes with flaws too. If ya wanna make changes to his article you have to do it using that layout, which sucks, try it out for yourself and you'll see. btw, Vvill's only source for his Qiao Xuan article is the biographical dictionary and imo it's almost an exact copy. --3KingdomsMaster 11:24, September 8, 2011 (UTC)By Chance?

What do you think?--Hockeyben\u00a0 19:01, October 1, 2011 (UTC)Navigation bar  I noticed that your wiki's top navigation bar looks different from mine. How do I get it to look like yours? --Rayous 08:02, October 6, 2011 (UTC) Some bad news for Autopedia, Red marquis has decided to semi-retire from the site, which is a major blow to us. On the bright side, Autopedia is growing very fast, and currently has 8,300 articles! --Hockeyben\u00a0 14:53, October 11, 2011 (UTC)Siteground  Hey. I was wondering if you could give me some advice. I'm at a loss at what to do with my hockey site. ShoutWiki has now been down for ages, and I feel that they are very unreliable even once they come back. During the downtime, I have moved lots of the more notable articles to Wikipedia, and some of the less notable ones on a back up site here on Wikia. As most of the European and Asian hockey articles can be found on those two sites, I'm wondering whether to create a new site on Siteground, and copy over the International hockey articles. The biggest drawbacks to siteground are that it is a paid host ($4/month), and you have to install MediaWiki yourself. The positives are that the service is very reliable, you can choose the skins you want, and customize more things than on a wikifarm. My other option is to copy more stuff to the backup Wikia site, and my final option is to just stick with ShoutWiki (I will still be keeping the wiki regardless).--Hockeyben\u00a0 15:41, October 17, 2011 (UTC)Message Wall  Hi Zantam! We're ready to expand the Message Wall test to some of the other wikis who've requested it. Are you still interested? Keep in mind that it's still buggy and not everything's been developed yet, so being an early tester means helping your community members understand that. We'll definitely appreciate any feedback you can offer, though, and we've found that most test wikis have had no trouble adjusting to it. Respond on my talk page to let me know if you'd still like it enabled! --Dopp  23:21, November 1, 2011 (UTC)Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Zhao Yun - SF.jpg Description  Zhao Yun \u8d99\u96f2 in Fury Mode.Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Four Beauties  The Four Beauties or Four Great Beauties (\u56db\u5927\u7f8e\u5973 s\u00ec d\u00e0 m\u011bin\u01da) are four ancient Chinese women, renowned for their beauty. According to legend, they are the most beautiful women of ancient China. Using their beauty they exercised influence over kings and warriors. Three of the four beauties even brought kingdoms to their knees. The four beauties lived in four different dynasties. The four beauties were:Xi Shi  Xi Shi \u897f\u65bd was said to have lived during the end of the Spring and Autumn period in Zhuji, the capital of the ancient State of Yue. Her beauty was said to be so extreme that while leaning over a balcony to look at the fish in the pond, the fish would be so dazzled that they forgot to swim and gradually sunk away from the surface. Xi Shi's Story\nKing Goujian of Yue, king of Yue, was once imprisoned after a defeat in a war by King Fuchai of Wu, king of the State of Wu. King Fuchai was a sexaddict and could not resist beautiful women, so Goujian's minister, Wen Zhong, suggested training beautiful women and offering them to Fuchai as a tribute. Goujian's other minister, Fan Li, found Xi Shi and Zheng Dan and gifted them to Fuchai in 490 B.C. Fuchai was bewitched by the beauty of Xi Shi and Zheng Dan. Because of it, he forgot all about his state affairs and on their instigation, killed his best advisor, the great general Wu Zixu. Fuchai even built Guanwa Palace (Palace of Beautiful Women) in an imperial park on the slope of Lingyan Hill, about 15 kilometers west of Suzhou. The strength of Wu dwindled, and in 473 B.C. Goujian launched his strike and put the Wu army to full rout. King Fuchai lamented that he should have listened to Wu Zixu, and then committed suicide. Death\n Each of the Four Beauties died under tragic or mysterious circumstances. The latter would apply to Xi Shi, however there is one disputed account of her fate, it was written that Goujian ordered Xi Shi to be drowned by being thrown into a lake, to avoid being tempted by her as Fuchai was. In Remembrance\n Xi Shi is remembered by the Xi Shi Temple, which lies at the foot of the Zhu Lou Hill in the southern part of the city, on the banks of the Huansha River.\n The West Lake in Hangzhou is said to be the incarnation of Xi Shi, hence it is also called Xizi Lake, Xizi being another name for Xi Shi, meaning Lady Xi.Wang Zhaojun  Wang Zhaojun \u738b\u662d\u541b was born to a prominent family of Zigui, Nan county (now Xingshan county, Hubei) in the south of the Western Han empire. In a legend, Wang Zhaojun left her hometown on horseback and began a journey northward. Along the way, her horse neighed, making Zhaojun extremely sad and unable to control her emotions. As she sat on the saddle, she began to play sorrowful melodies on a stringed instrument. A flock of geese flying southward heard the music, saw the beautiful young woman riding the horse, immediately forgot to flap their wings, and fell to the ground. From then on, Zhaojun acquired the nickname \"fells geese\" or \"drops birds.\" Wang Zhaojun's Story\n She entered the harem of Emperor Yuan probably after 40 BC. During her time in the Lateral Courts, Wang Qiang was never visited by the emperor and remained as a palace lady-in-waiting. When choosing a new wife, the Emperor was first presented with portraits of all the possible women. Wang Zhaojun\u2019s portrait was either never viewed by the Emperor, or was not in its true form, and therefore the Emperor overlooked her.In 33 BC, Huhanye visited Chang\u2019an on a homage trip, as part of the tributary system between the Han and Xiongnu. He took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law. Instead of honouring the chanyu with a princess, Huhanye was presented with five women from the imperial harem, one of them who was Wang Zhaojun. A story from the History of the Later Han relates that Wang Zhaojun volunteered to join the Shanyu. When summoned to court, her beauty astonished the emperor\u2019s courtiers and made the emperor reconsider his decision to send her to the Xiongnu. Wang Zhaojun became a favourite of the Huhanye shanyu, giving birth to two sons. Only one of them seems to have survived, Yituzhiyashi. They also had at least one daughter, Yun, who was created Princess Yimuo and who would later become a powerful figure in Xiongnu politics. When Huhanye died in 31 BC, Wang Zhaojun requested to return to China. Emperor Cheng, however, ordered that she follow Xiongnu levirate custom and become the wife of the next shanyu, the oldest brother(or her stepson, born by her husband\u2019s first wife) of her husband. In her new marriage she had two daughters. Wang was honoured as Ninghu Yanzhi (\u5be7\u80e1\u95bc\u6c0f \"Chief-Consort Pacifying Hu\"). Death\n In legend, she commits suicide after her husband dies, seeing it as her only resort in order to avoid marrying his son. Historically, it is not known how or when she died. In Remembrance\n Wang Zhaojun was a symbol of the cohesion for the Chinese nation. Her deeds are respected by the later people. Her tomb is repeatedly renovated by the later generation in memory of her. And the story of Zhaojun going out of the frontier strongly attracted numerous artists of every dynasty, who created thousands of works based on her story in a variety of artistic forms, such as music, painting, poetry, drama and novels.Diaochan  Diaochan \u8c82\u87ec was said to have been born in 161 or 169 AD, depending on the source. However, unlike the other three beauties, Diaochan, as we know her from Romance of the Three Kingdoms, does not appear in any known historical writings, and is mostly a fictional character. Legend has it that when Diaochan paid offerings to the moon at midnight, Chang'e (the Chinese Moon Goddess) hurried to hide in clouds, for this beautiful lady made her feel inferior. The phrase \u201coutshines the moon\u201c in the beauty-describing idiom \u201cBeauty which outshines the moon and shames the flowers\u201c has Diaochan as the very subject. This legend embodies in an exaggerated way Diaochan\u2019s beautiful appearance in the eyes of the Chinese people. Diaochan's Story\nDiaochan appears in the classic novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms in a plot involving the warrior L\u00fc Bu \u5442\u5e03 and the warlord Dong Zhuo \u8463\u5353. Wang Yun \u738b\u5141 married Diaochan to L\u00fc Bu and later Dong Zhuo. This created jealousy between the two who were father and son since L\u00fc Bu had entered Dong Zhuo's service and eventually L\u00fc Bu killed his adoptive father. According to historical records, L\u00fc Bu did have relations with a maid of Dong Zhuo\u2019s. However, there is no evidence that this person\u2019s name was Diaochan. In fact, it is extremely unlikely that it was Diaochan, because \u201cdi\u0101o\u201d was not, and is not, commonly used as a Chinese family name. \u201cDi\u0101och\u00e1n\u201d likely referred to the sable (di\u00e0o) tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas (ch\u00e1n), which at the time adorned the hats of high-level officials. Some people are of opinion that Diaochan, because of it's meaning, would not have been an uncommon name for a palace-born girl. Death\n There are different stories concerning Diaochan's death. There is a folktale that Diaochan was captured by Cao Cao \u66f9\u64cd after Xiapi. When Cao Cao was trying to keep Guan Yu \u95dc\u7fbd in his service, he sent Diaochan to seduce Guan Yu. Guan Yu suspected that he was being tricked as he knew how she had betrayed L\u00fc Bu and Dong Zhuo so he killed her to prevent her from hurting anyone else. A second version of this story is that years after Xiapi, Liu Bei \u5289\u5099, Zhang Fei \u5f35\u98db and Guan Yu all wanted to marry Diaochan and the three argued bitterly over her. To end the strife between them Guan Yu cut her in half. In one Yuan Dynasty play, Diaochan is introduced to Guan Yu by his sworn brother Zhang Fei after the death of L\u00fc Bu, but instead of accepting her as the spoils of war, Guan Yu decapitates her with his sword. This event does not appear either on the history records or the novel itself, but is propagated through mass media such as operas and storytelling. There is also another idea of what happened to Diaochan; a source that says she did meet Guan Yu, but he let her become a nun. After hearing this, Cao Cao wanted to take her as his own. When the news reached Diaochan, however, she committed suicide. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Records of the Three Kingdoms, Diaochan is not mentioned after L\u00fc Bu kills Dong Zhuo. In Remembrance\n According to scholar Meng Fanren's textual research, Diaochan is a real person in history. She was living in Muzhi village, 3km south of Xinzhou city in Shanxi Province and her real name was Ren Hongchang \u4efb\u7ea2\u660c. In the village still stands a stele written with \u201cDiaochan\u2019s Hometown\u201d as well as her tomb and temple. They were built for commemoration of this respectable woman who sacrificed herself for the country.Yang Guifei  Yang Yuhuan \u694a\u7389\u74b0 often referred to as Yang Guifei \u694a\u8cb4\u5983 was said to have lived during the Tang Dynasty. She was an imperial concubine of Emperor Xuanzong and commonly called Imperial Concubine Yang. She was also known briefly under her Dao\u00efst nun name Taizhen \u592a\u771f. Yang Guifei's Story\n Yang Yuhuan was born in an old, well-known official family. She was naturally beautiful with a docile character. She was gifted in music, singing, dancing and playing lute. These talents, together with her education, made her stand out among the imperial concubines and win the emperor\u2018s favor. Yang Yuhuan was also known for being slightly overweight, which was a much sought-after quality at the time. Misinterpretation of quotes describing this in the West has often led to her being described as \u201cobese\u201d. The term \u201cobese\u201d, when used to describe Yang Yuhuan, must not be viewed in its modern context of someone who is extremely overweight. She was often compared and contrasted with Empress Zhao Feiyan, the beautiful wife of Emperor Cheng of Han, because Consort Yang was known for her full build while Empress Zhao was known for her slender build. This led to the Four-character idiom yanshou huanfei, describing the range of the types of beauties. Emperor Xuanzong, a fan of music, ordered his musicians to play the music Song of Rainbow Skirt & Feathered Dress composed by him to express his cheerful feeling of seeing Imperial Concubine Yang. Latterly, Imperial Concubine Yang was banished twice from the palace, for her envy peeved Emperor Xuanzong. However, Xuanzong, who was so hard to forget her, called her back every time at the end. Death\n In 755 A.D. when the military insurgence \u201cAnshi Insurgence (Anshizhiluan)\u201d was launched by the local forces of the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Tang Xuanzong, together with Imperial Concubine Yang, fled from Chang\u2019an. When they arrived at the Mawei Slope, the army refused to march, for the army thought that the reason of this rebellion by An Lushan was that Imperial Concubine Yang\u2019s behavior of attracting emperor ruined the state and that her cousin Yang Guozong colluded with the enemy. To appease the army, Emperor Tang Xuanzong had no choice but to order Yang to commit suicide at the Mawei Slope. In the following generation, a long poem, \u201cSong of the Everlasting Sorrow\u201d, was written by the poet Bai Juyi describing the Emperor\u2019s love for her and perpetual grief at her loss. It became an instant classic, known to and memorized by Chinese schoolchildren far into posterity. The story of Yang Yuhuan and the poem also became highly popular in Japan and served as sources of inspiration for the classical novel \u201cThe Tale of Genji\u201d which begins with the doomed love between an emperor and a consort, Kiritsubo, who is likened to Consort Yang. In Remembrance\n Today, there is a tomb of Yang Yuhuan in Xingping of Shaanxi, in front of which stands her white marble statue.The Fifth Beauty  Yu Miaoyi \u865e\u5999\u5f0b, also known as Consort Yu (Y\u00fa J\u012b \u865e\u59ec), and since the Qing Dynasty as \"Yu the Beautiful Lady\" (Y\u00fa M\u011bir\u00e9n \u865e\u7f8e\u4eba) lived during the Qin Dynasty. She was the treasured lover of Xiang Yu \u9805\u7fbd, a prominent military leader and political figure during the final years of the Qin Dynasty. When Yu Miaoyi met Xiang Yu she fell in love with him, became his concubine, and followed him on his campaigns and refused to be left behind. In 202 BC Xiang Yu was at Gaixia by Han forces. To prevent Xiang Yu from being distracted by his love for her, Yu Miaoyi committed suicide with Xiang Yu's sword. Tales of Yu Miaoyi's beauty began during the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912). The story goes that her looks could cut through the chaos surrounding her lover. Because of her tragic love story and her mention in historical sources many people in China argue she should replace Diaochan's spot in the Four Beauties.Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Cao Cao \u66f9\u64cd  Cao Cao \u66f9\u64cd was the father of Wei's first emperor; Cao Pi. A central figure of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao laid the foundation for his sons empire and for this was posthumously titled Emperor Wu of Wei. Aside from being a warlord, Cao Cao was also an author of many war journals and was skilled in poetry.Biography  A man from Qiao in Peiguo. Cao Cao was born the son of Cao Song, the adopted son of Cao Teng, The \u2018Great Prolonger of Autumn\u2019 Regular Palace Attendant. Cao Cao is a descendant of Cao Can, former Han Chancellor of the State. When Cao Cao was young, he was clever and ingenious and could adapt himself to any situation. Sometimes, however, he took the law into his own hand, and was casual or frivolous, and he paid little attention to his duties. Few people of that time saw anything remarkable about him, and only the Grand Commandant Qiao Xuan and He Yong of Nanyang thought him unusual. Once, Qiao Xuan said to Cao Cao the following: \"The empire will fall into disorder and only a man with ability to command the age will be able to deal with it. You are the man that will restore the peace.\" An interesting ruling, that actually eventually saw some sort of truth. When He Yong saw Cao Cao he sighed and said: \"The house of Han is falling, and this is the man who will give peace to the empire.\" Qiao Xuan said: \"You have made no name for yourself yet. You should get in touch with Xu Zijiang.\" Xu Zijiang, given name Xu Shao, was fond of grading people and had an appreciative eye for others' good qualities. Cao Cao went to see Xu Shao and asked him: \"What kind of person am I?\" At first, Xu Shao refused to give Cao Cao an answer, because he despised the man. Cao Cao pressed again and Xu Shao replied: \"You? A good servant in time of peace, a dangerous chieftain in time of trouble.\" Cao Cao left feeling very pleased.Yellow Turban Rebellion And After  In 184 A.D. Cao Cao was summoned to reinforce the Han forces. As Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Cao Cao reinforced Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun in the fifth month. Cao Cao combined his force with Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun and the three officers returned to the attack. They completely defeated the rebels and cut off heads by the tens of thousands. In the eigth month of the year 188 A.D., Cao Cao, who was Gentleman-Consultant at that time, became Colonel Who Arranges the Army. In 189 A.D. the Regular Palace Attendants' influence in the Imperial Court was planned to be halted by He Jin and Yuan Shao. Cao Cao, however, predicted that their armed means of ending the eunuch influence would surely fail saying: \"There has always been a need for eunuchs, but the rulers of our time should never have granted them such authority and favour as to cause this trouble. To solve the problem, they need only punish the ringleaders; just one jailer would be enough for that. Why such a fuss, calling in soldiers from outside? If he plans to kill them all, the affair will certainly leak out. I can already foresee his failure.\" He Jin ended up being beheaded by eunuch ally Qu Mu, but his forces slaughtered the eunuchs and ended up as victorious.Campaign against Dong Zhuo  Despite protest, He Jin had summoned Dong Zhuo to aid him in subduing the eunuchs. After the eunuch massacre Dong Zhuo took power in the Imperial Court and set Emperor Xian on the throne, using him as his puppet. At one point, Dong Zhuo tried to keep several warlords at peace, by giving them ranks and titles. Yuan Shao was promptly appointed as Grand Administrator of Bohai, with enfeoffment as Marquis of Kang District, Yuan Shu was appointed as General of the Rear. Yuan Shu was afraid of Dong Zhuo and fled east, to Nanyang. Cao Cao was appointed as Colonel of Resolute Cavalry. However, he too fled to the east following a minor road, in disguise and under a false name. At one point he passed through Zhongmou and the local chief became suspicious of him. He arrested Cao Cao and brought him to the prefect. Fortunately a local recognised him and pleaded on his behalf, as a result o this, Cao Cao was released. When Cao Cao reached Chenliu, he sold all his family property and with the money he enlisted righteous troops, preparing to campaign against Dong Zhuo. This was in the twelfth month at Yiwu. In the first month of the year 190 A.D., a coalition was formed to oppose Dong Zhuo. This coalition was named the Guandong Coalition and Yuan Shao was appointed as its leader. The members of the coalition spread themselves over several locations east of the passages. Cao Cao, along with Liu Dai, Bao Xin, Yuan Yi, Zhang Miao, Zhang Chao and Qiao Mao, was sent to camp at Suanzao, a location at the south bank of the Yellow River and directly east of the capital.The Battle of Xingyang  When Dong Zhuo heard of the coalition, in the second month, he coerced the Son of Heaven to transfer the capital to Chang\u2019an. He himself remained in Luoyang and razed the palaces and offices of state. At that time Yuan Shao garrisoned Henei; Zhang Miao, Liu Dai, Qiao Mao and Yuan Yi garrisoned Suanzao; Yuan Shu garrisoned Nanyang; Kong Zhou garrisoned Yingchuan and Han Fu was at Ye. Dong Zhuo\u2019s troops were strong, so Yuan Shao and the others dared not approach. Cao Cao said: \"You have raised loyal troops to destroy oppression and disorder, and a great army is already collected. Why do you hesitate? At the beginning, if Dong Zhuo had relied on the imperial house, occupied the old capital [Luoyang] and turned east to take the offensive against the rest of the empire, then even though he was acting as a criminal it would still have made things difficult. But now he is burning palaces and houses, and he has kidnapped the Son of Heaven and sent him away. All within the seas is in disorder and no-one knows where to turn. This is the time he is condemned by heaven. One battle and the empire is settled.\" Cao Cao then led his army west to occupy Chenggao. Zhang Miao send his general Wei Zi with a division to aid Cao Cao. They advanced to the Bian River at Rongyang where they met Dong Zhuo's officer Xu Rong at Xuantu. Cao Cao's force was badly defeated and Cao Cao himself was struck by an arrow. His horse was wounded under him. Cao Cao's cousin Cao Hong than offered his own horse to Cao Cao, who first refused to accept, but when Cao Hong said: \"The empire can do without me, but it cannot do without you.\", Cao Cao accepted the horse and Cao Hong followed him on foot. Seeing that Suanzao would be hard to take, Xu Rong withdrew.Family Notes Fact vs. Fiction Sources Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Three Kingdoms (2010)  Three Kingdoms is the latest Chinese television series based on Luo Guanzhong's novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The series is directed by Gao Xixi and features a total of 95 episodes. The Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants Battle will be skipped, thus the series starts with the Anti-Dong Zhuo campaign, precisely at Cao Cao's failed assassination on Dong Zhuo. It will end shortly after Sima Yi's death, skipping Jiang Wei's Fourth Invasion and the fall of the Empires.Story  Three Kingdoms tells us the story of Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms in a rather unique way. Unlike the 1994 TV series which mainly tries to re-tell the events from the novel, the 2010 TV series focusses more on how the characters went through all the battles and events described in the novel. This results in more dialogue and more emotions.Characters and Cast Main Cast External links Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Zhao Yun - Chibi2.jpg Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI Portraits Gongjin's Campaign Memorials L\u00fc Bu \u5442\u5e03  L\u00fc Bu \u5442\u5e03 was a military general and minor warlord during the later Han dynasty. He was highly skilled in horse-riding and archery. He was nicknamed \u201cThe Flying General\u201d.History of the Later Han biography  \u3000L\u00fc Bu, style name Fengxian \u5949\u5148, was a native of Jiuyuan county, Wuyuan commandery. Known for his martial prowess, he took a position in Bing province. Ding Yuan \u4e01\u539f, Inspector [of Bing province] and concurrent Commandant of Cavalry, posted his troop in Henei and appointed L\u00fc Bu as Registrar (zh\u01d4b\u00f9 \u4e3b\u7c3f), because the latter stood highly in the former's favour. Emperor Ling of Han passed away before Ding Yuan led his troop towards Luoyang to secretly conspire with He Jin \u4f55\u9032 [for the elimination of the Regular Attendants]. At the time, Ding Yuan was appointed as Chief Commandant [of Cavalry] (j\u00ed d\u016bw\u00e8i \u9a0e\u90fd\u5c09). Unexpectedly, He Jin was killed [by the eunuchs], and Dong Zhuo \u8463\u5353 exploited this fact to lead his troops into Luoyang, intent on staging a war against Ding Yuan to take in the latter's troops. However, the fact that L\u00fc Bu was a trusted man to Ding Yuan prompted Dong Zhuo to induce the warrior to do away with his rival. It turned out that L\u00fc Bu killed his patron and took the severed head as a token of introduction for his new lord, who accordingly appointed him as Commandant of Cavalry and lavished favors upon him as if how a father treated his own son. L\u00fc Bu excelled in horsemanship and marksmanship with supernatural arm power, thus earning him the name \u201cFlying General\u201d. \u3000Before shortly, he was recommended as General of the Household (zh\u014dngl\u00e1ng ji\u0101ng \u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07) and titled as Marquis of a Chief Village (d\u014dut\u00edng h\u00f3u \u90fd\u4ead\u4faf). Dong Zhuo was aware of his own over-arrogance in fear of being trapped that he kept L\u00fc Bu as his bodyguard in case of any eventuality. Moreover, Dong Zhuo was narrow-minded and fiery-tempered that he threw a halberd (j\u01d0 \u621f) toward L\u00fc Bu just because of a small annoyance. L\u00fc Bu deftly dodged it and later apologized to Dong Zhuo for this to calm down the latter. But a resentment grew on L\u00fc Bu and he established an illicit relationship with a maid (b\u00ec \u5a62) of Dong Zhuo when he was ordered to guard Dong's harem. However, such covert deed made him live in constant fear [of being discovered]. Before L\u00fc Bu was well employed by Ding Yuan, Wang Yun \u738b\u5141 treated L\u00fc Bu with full courtesy for the latter's physical strength over that of all in Bingzhou city. Since L\u00fc Bu's resentment over Dong Zhuo, he paid Wang Yun a visit and related how he was nearly killed by Dong Zhuo. At that moment, Wang Yun was deliberating with Sun Rui \u5b6b\u745e, Deputy Director of the Secretariat (sh\u00e0ngsh\u016b p\u00fay\u00e8 \u5c1a\u66f8\u50d5\u5c04) in secret how to do away with Dong Zhuo. L\u00fc Bu's timely visit made him a suitable collaborator within. However, L\u00fc Bu was somewhat reluctant, \u201cHe were a father to me, how could I bear to kill him?\u201d Wang Yun replied, \u201cYour family name is L\u00fc, he is not your father. Now you must kill him to save youself. No more of such silly talk!\u201d L\u00fc Bu finally conceded and killed Dong Zhuo, this event is recorded completely in the biography of Dong Zhuo. After that, L\u00fc Bu was appointed by Wang Yun as General Who is Firm and Exerts Effort (f\u00e8nw\u0113i ji\u0101ngj\u016bn \u596e\u5a01\u5c07\u8ecd) with credentials to command, a status equaling that of three elder lords. Later he was recommended as Marquis of Wen (W\u0113n h\u00f3u \u6eab\u4faf) for the joint handling of court affairs. \u3000Wang Yun was too adamant to impose amnesty upon Xiliang unit, which caused Li Jue \u674e\u5095, Guo Si \u90ed\u6c5c and other generals leading respective troops to march towards Chang'an. L\u00fc Bu was so outmatched in the field that rebellious troops stormed Chang'an. With a retinue of several hundred men, L\u00fc Bu was forced to march out via Wu Pass to seek refuge with Yuan Shu \u8881\u8853. Such plight happened no more than two months after Dong Zhuo's death. Yuan Shu denied L\u00fc Bu a helping hand, knowing the latter's disloyalty despite the latter killing the tyrant to satisfy his vengeance, much to the latter's disappointment. L\u00fc Bu had to lead his men to seek favor with Yuan Shao \u8881\u7d39 in the northern land, who took him in for the joint attack on Zhang Yan \u5f35\u71d5 in the Chang Hills. Zhang Yan had the command of more than 10.000 picked soldiers including several thousand cavalries. L\u00fc Bu rode a good steed named Red Hare (Ch\u00ect\u00fa \u8d64\u83df) in the field where he fought with his trusted generals including Cheng Lian \u6210\u5ec9 and Wei Yue \u9b4f\u8d8a heartily to rout his enemy troop. L\u00fc Bu took advantage of the victory to enlarge his troop, followed by his men's frequent pillages which caused Yuan Shao's suspicion and hatred. Later L\u00fc Bu sensed Yuan Shao's displeasure before entering the latter's presence to ask for departure. Yuan Shao responded with approval but quickly realized that L\u00fc Bu's departure might do him harm, so he dispatched several stout men to kill L\u00fc Bu secretly in the night, only to receive the report that L\u00fc Bu was not found. L\u00fc Bu got informed of the abortive murder and hastily arrived in Henei commandery to joint hands with Zhang Yang. Yuan Shao was intent on killing L\u00fc Bu with sending his soldiers, who dared not close in for the kill. \u3000Zhang Miao \u5f35\u9088, style name Mengzhuo \u5b5f\u5353, was a native of Shouzhang county in Dongping commandery. He was so noted for his gallantry and generosity in earlier days that many bold spirits were willing to work for him. Cao Cao \u66f9\u64cd and Yuan Shao were his friends. He was appointed by the court as Commandant of Cavalry thanks to his brilliant work, and before shortly was appointed as Grand Administrator of Chenliu \u9673\u7559. It was Cao Cao and Zhang Miao who first launched a war against Dong Zhuo, who led his unit to march into Chang'an to make troubles. Zhang Miao sent his general Wei Zi to fight with Cao Cao in the battle at Bian River. Yuan Shao was often criticised by Zhang Miao for his over-arrogance in the capacity of the leader of the allied army. Cao Cao refused to kill Zhao Miao despite Yuan Shao demanding him to do so. Instead Cao Cao berated Yuan Shao, \u201cMengzhuo is such my friend that anyway I should accommodate him. Moreover, now the realm is being convulsed with rebellious troops. How could we engage in the internecine feud!\u201d Zhang Miao, learning of Cao Cao's plead, held the latter in more esteem than ever. Cao Cao told his families before leading the punitive expedition against Tao Qian, \u201cIf I perish in the field, all of you can seek refuge with Mengzhuo.\u201d It turned out that Cao Cao returned victorious and then met Zhang Miao with tears in both's eyes. This was how they interacted with each other. L\u00fc Bu, leaving from Yuan Shao, came to Zhang Yang before paying Zhang Miao a visit when they plighted mutual faith. Bitter anger flooded Yuan Shao's chest after he learned of it. Zhang Miao lived in constant fear of Cao Cao, sooner or later, doing away with himself for Yuan Shao. \u3000In the first year of Xingping \u8208\u5e73, Cao Cao launched a fresh war against Tao Qian \u9676\u8b19 when the younger brother of Zhang Miao, Zhang Chao \u5f35\u8d85, Chen Gong \u9673\u5bae serving under Cao Cao, Deputy Director of the Secretariat, Xu Si \u8a31\u6c5c and Wang Kai \u738b\u6977 were discussing about how to turn back on Cao Cao. Chen Gong persuaded Zhang Miao, \u201cNow the realm is being divided up by many warlords. Your Excellency has many territories and soldiers, only to be attacked from four sides; Your Excellency is worthy of a paragon, only to be controlled by others. Is it not a disgrace? Now Yanzhou City stands defenseless thanks to the better part of troop there being on the eastern campaign. Moreover, L\u00fc Bu is valiant in combat. Now welcome him to occupy the vulnerable City with us, bid our time and act according to the circumstance, and our great cause may be consummated!\u201d Zhang Miao nodded in approval. Cao Cao, on the point of leading the eastern campaign, entrusted the part of soldiers to defend Dongjun in Chen Gong's control. Accordingly, Chen Gong led these men to support L\u00fc Bu as Protector of Yan province and then to occupy Puyang. In the end, neighboring counties quickly fell into L\u00fc Bu's hands except for Ye city, Dong'er and Fan county. \u3000Cao Cao reversed his troop to fight L\u00fc Bu fiercely at Puyang, only to lose the upper hand, but neither prevailed after more than one hundred days' stalement. There was a time when a major drought reigned, followed by the locust plague and a famine. Faced with such misery, people were forced into cannibalism. L\u00fc Bu had to march eastward into Shanyang. In no more than two years, Cao Cao recovered the every lost land and then defeated L\u00fc Bu at J\u00fcye. L\u00fc Bu had to flee eastward before finally taking refuge with Liu Bei \u5289\u5099. Zhang Miao fleed with L\u00fc Bu and ordered his younger brother to defend Yongqiu with his families entrusted in care. Cao Cao besieged Yongqiu for several months before the seizure of it, followed by the massacre including Zhang Chao and his cared families. Zhang Miao turned to Yuan Shu for relief. Unfortunately, he was killed by his subordinates before entering Yuan Shu's presence. \u3000At that time, Liu Bei proclaimed himself as Protector of Xu province and stationed his troops at Xiapi, confronting Yuan Shu at Huai River. L\u00fc Bu made Liu Bei as Inspector of Yu province and sent the latter to station at Xiaopei though he once stormed Xiapi, where latter's wives and children lived. The loss of Xiapi forced Liu Bei flee to Haixi. Yuan Shu sent an envoy with two hundred thousand bushels of grain and a secret letter describing his plan, thinking highly of L\u00fc Bu who once killed Dong Zhuo to redeem the burning shame of the Yuans having been publicly executed as well as being defeated Cao Cao at Puyang and Liu Bei at Xiapi. Jin Yuanxiu whom Cao Cao once defeated at Fengqiu was also mentioned in Yuan Shu's letter. \u3000After that, Yuan Shu ordered his general Ji Ling \u7d00\u9748 to lead more than thirty thousand men, infantry and cavalry to attack Liu Bei, who had to seek help from L\u00fc Bu. Some commanders said to L\u00fc Bu, \u201cgeneral, you have long wished to get rid of Liu Bei. Now Yuan Shu is doing exactly what you want.\u201d L\u00fc Bu reasoned, \u201cNot necessarily, if Yuan Shu occupy Xiaopei and then ally with Mount Tai commanders to the north, our position will be untenable. This is why I have to aid Liu Bei.\u201d Therefore L\u00fc Bu led thousands of foot soldiers and two hundred riders swiftly towards Xiaopei. Ji Ling got informed of this rescue before recalling his troops. The reinforcement was camped to the southwest of only one Li away before their leader sent someone to invite Ji Ling and his subordinates for a banquet, where guests and hosts were dining and wining with unbound delight. L\u00fc Bu said to his guests, \u201cXuande is like my younger brother. Since he was attacked by all of you, how could I not come to his rescue. I prefer resolving conflicts to fighting.\u201d Thus, L\u00fc Bu ordered an attendant to have his halberd planted in the ground before the camp and said, \u201cIf I hit the small side blade with one shot, both of you must call up the war; if I miss, both of you are free to return to the camps and prepare for battles.\u201d Words still ring in the air, L\u00fc Bu fitted the arrow to the bow and shot, a sure target. Commanders present marveled at his supernatural marksmanship. On the morrow, L\u00fc Bu continued to feast with other commanders before calling up the war. Yuan Shu wanted to ally with L\u00fc Bu to serve his own purpose by marriage-sealed alliance to which L\u00fc Bu agreed. \u3000Chen Gui \u9673\u73ea, Chancellor of Xiaopei (P\u00e8i xi\u0101ng \u6c9b\u76f8), feared that marriage-sealed alliance would aggrandize their power and then wielded his persuasive power upon L\u00fc Bu. The talk was in essence, \u201cCao Cao receives Emperor's mandate to be in charge of court administration and to pacify the realm by force. You, general, should work with him for the peace at large. But your marriage-sealed alliance with Yuan Shu would reduce you to a dishonorable fellow to your detriment.\u201d On hearing this, L\u00fc Bu recalled Yuan Shu's denial which led him to deny that marriage by demanding his daughter back and binding Han Yin \u97d3\u80e4 on yoke and in chains. Later this envoy was sent under guard to Xuchang for the public execution. \u3000Chen Gui intended to send his son, Chen Deng \u9673\u767b as an envoy to seal the alliance between Cao Cao and L\u00fc Bu, but L\u00fc Bu disapproved of this proposal. At that moment, an envoy sent by Cao Cao arrived to appoint L\u00fc Bu as General on the Left (zu\u01d2 ji\u0101ngj\u016bn \u5de6\u5c07\u8ecd) by Emperor's mandate. L\u00fc Bu overjoyed in spite of himself and ordered Chen Deng to start the journey with a letter describing his gratitude to Xuchang. Chen Deng entered Cao Cao's presence and suggested Cao Cao do away with L\u00fc Bu quickly by describing the warrior as a foolhardy and disloyal sort. Cao Cao responded, \u201cL\u00fc Bu harbored a wolf-like ambition who must be gotten rid of sooner. You are the right person to do this.\u201d Immediately Cao Cao raised Chen Gui's annual pay to two thousand bushels and appointed Chen Deng as Grand Administrator of Guangling (Gu\u01cengl\u00edng t\u00e0ish\u01d2u \u5ee3\u9675\u592a\u5b88). On the departure, Cao Cao held Chen Deng's hands and said, \u201cI entrust all the affairs of the eastern region to your care.\u201d Chen Deng was ordered to sow dissention among L\u00fc Bu's troops to coordinate within. At first L\u00fc Bu wanted to be appointed as Inspector of Xuzhou through Chen Deng's good offices, only to receive a negative feedback.How could he not be angered? He broke the corner of the table with his halberd and cursed, \u201cThat your father proposed the alliance with Cao Cao led to my breaking the marriage-sealed alliance with Yuan Shu. Now I am least benefited while you and your father rise to the power. I was took in! Tell me how you turned in good words for me when you met Cao Cao?\u201d Chen Deng remained composed, \u201cwhen I saw Cao Cao, I told him to provide for you as to provide for a tiger that needs eat its fill of meat lest hunger drive him to bite someone.\u201d \u201cNot necessarily\u201d Cao Cao smiled with an answer, \u201cI must provide for L\u00fc Bu as if he were a hunting hawk that needs be kept hungry when hares and foxes are running about. Well fed, he will just soar up contented.\u201d This is how we talked about you. Thus, L\u00fc Bu was pacified. \u3000Yuan Shu got informed of L\u00fc Bu denying that marriage as well as killing his envoy before joining forces with Han Xian \u97d3\u66b9, Yang Feng \u694a\u5949 and other warlords against L\u00fc Bu under the head of his general Zhang Xun \u5f35\u52f3. L\u00fc Bu alarmed and rebuked Chen Gui, \u201cSince you bring upon such disaster, you have to settle it down!\u201d Chen Gui responded, \u201cthis is just a work without a careful and well-coordinated plan like scattered chickens. Just send my son, Chen Deng to disintegrate them.\u201d L\u00fc Bu adopted this countermeasure to talk Han Xian and Yang Feng out of helping traitorous Yuan Shu by commending his merit of killing Dong Zhuo, instead joining forces with him to attack Yuan Shu on the condition that the wherewithal including weapons is provided by him. Thus, Han Xian and Yang Feng fought with L\u00fc Bu to take Zhang Xun a great toll, Yuan Shu's wounded and drowned men beyond reckoning. \u3000At the time Mount Tai commander Zang Ba \u81e7\u9738 and others stormed Ju city \u8392\u57ce after promising to bribe L\u00fc Bu. The promise, however, was undelivered in time, which prompted L\u00fc Bu to demand in person. Gao Shun \u9ad8\u9806, a general under L\u00fc Bu remonstrated: \u201cYour Highness's military prestige is felt throughout the realm. Whatever will be yours for Your Highness's asking. Why come to demand bribes in person? If failure incurs, Your Highness's reputation will be spoiled.\u201d To this advice L\u00fc Bu paid no heed. Upon L\u00fc Bu's arrival at Ju city, Zhang Ba and others dishonored their promise by mounting tight defense, which led to L\u00fc Bu's fruitless visit. Gao Shun is a man of honesty, dignified and tacit, leading his unit in good array to fight every victorious battle. However, his lord, L\u00fc Bu, was fickle-minded. Gao Shun advised him once and again: \u201cYour Highness lacks enough deliberations before making any move, and is swayed by considerations of gain and loss. Futher, Your Highness is not wary of speeches. How could failures be less?\u201d L\u00fc Bu knew of his loyalty but seldom took his loyal advice. \u3000During the third year of Jian'an, L\u00fc Bu again followed Yuan Shu, and ordered Gao Shun to attack Liu Bei at Xiaopei. The battle's victor was Gao Shun. Thus, Cao Cao dispatched Xiahou Dun \u590f\u4faf\u60c7 to relieve Liu Bei. Gao Shun again emerged as a victor. Cao Cao led a punitive expedition against L\u00fc Bu to siege the latter at Xiapi. Before mounting intensive attack, Cao Cao sent a letter to L\u00fc Bu in which advantages and disadvantages were meted out. L\u00fc Bu intended to submit to Cao Cao, but Chen Gong and others, on bad terms with Cao Cao, deemed the surrender a bad move and advised L\u00fc Bu: \u201cCao Cao's force having come a long distance could not hold on too long. It is in the best interest of Your Highness to lead cavalry out of the city while I mount tight defense inside. If Cao Cao's troops attack Your Highness, I will attack them behind; if they attack the city, Your Highness will raid their camps. In this way, in no more than several months, their supplies will be used up, vulnerable to one attack.\u201d L\u00fc Bu approved of this plan. However, L\u00fc Bu's primary wife cautioned: \u201cOnce Cao Cao treated Chen Gong with all sincerity, only to see him turn to Your Highness. Now Your Highness lavished less favor upon Chen Gong. Entrusting the safety of the whole city including Your Highness's wives and daughters in his care before leading troops outside would be the worst move to make. If any eventuality occurred, I, Your Highness's humble wife would not remain chaste!\u201d Thus, L\u00fc Bu dismissed that life-saving plan. Instead L\u00fc Bu sent an envoy to seek relief from Yuan Shu while he led thousands of riders out of the city as a cover, only to be driven back. L\u00fc Bu had no other choice but to mount tight defense. The hope of relief from Yuan Shu seemed less and less likely. \u3000Cao Cao diverted Xi and Si River to overwhelm the city for such three months that L\u00fc Bu was alienated from his subordinates. His general Hou Cheng redeemed his prized horses which were grazed and stolen by the guests. Hou Cheng intended to celebrate by drinking brewed wine and eating meat with several commanders, and first came to talk to his leader: \u201cIt all depended on Your Highness's prestige that the stolen horses were recovered. The brewed wine for celebration of several commanders is first presented to Your Highness.\u201d L\u00fc Bu angered: \u201cHow dare you brew wine for celebration on the heels of my ban! Do you intend to inebriate me for ulterior motives?\u201d Hou Cheng was so seized with fright and hatred that he collaborated with several commanders to bind L\u00fc Bu as well as Chen Gong and Gao Shun for submission. Thus, L\u00fc Bu was marched toward White Gate Tower. Shortly Before, the city was on the verge of the fall, when L\u00fc Bu's commanders felt reluctant to sever their leader's head as a token of submitting to Cao Cao. L\u00fc Bu said to Cao Cao: \u201cThe realm would be soon pacified.\u201d Cao Cao asked his chief prisoner to elaborate who offered a suggestion that his willingness to serve as a cavalry commander while Cao Cao led infantry to unite the realm. L\u00fc Bu looked around to see Liu Bei and said: \u201cToday you are an honored guest while I am a captive. Why not turn in a good word for me?\u201d L\u00fc Bu complained of being tightened up. Cao Cao smiled: \u201cTo tie a tiger like this,\u201d and ordered the rope loosened. Liu Bei said: \u201cIt can not be done. Have you forgotten what had happened to his past patrons, Dong Zhuo and Ding Yuan?\u201d Cao Cao shook his head. L\u00fc Bu looked at Liu Bei and cursed: \u201cLong ears villain of all most faithless!\u201d Cao Cao said to Chen Gong: \u201cFor all your shrewd plans, how could you fall into my hands?\u201d Cheng Gong pointed at L\u00fc Bu: \u201cHad he taken my advice, we might never have been captured.\u201d Cao Cao said: \u201cWhat of your mother and your wives and children?\u201d Chen Gong respond: \u201cI heard that the one who governed with filial piety would not injure others' parents, and the one who ruled humanely would not cut off the sacrifices from others' descendents.\u201d Chen Gong strode brusquely down the tower without turning back and stretched his neck for the execution. Cao Cao had such lingering affection for his past friend that he wept over the death. L\u00fc Bu, Chen Gong and Gao shun were together strangulated and then beheaded, their head being hung up in the Xuchang's market as a warning.Conclusion [to HHS 75]  \u3000It was not necessarily to be honored as a Protector for the blessings to follow, nor to be bound to illusory gains. Yuan Shu was too dying to become an Emperor while L\u00fc Bu was so disloyal and unhonourable that he fell at White Gate Tower.Notes Fact vs. Fiction  Historically\u2026References Sources Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce  Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce (\u771f\u30fb\u4e09\u570b\u7121\u53cc MULTI RAID Shin Sangokumus\u014d Maruchi Reido) is the first entry in the Strikeforce series, a spin-off series of Dynasty Warriors.

In 221 A.D. Liu Bei followed in his ancestors footsteps by founding his own empire.Biography  Liu Bei was born in Zhuo commandery in 161 A.D. His family claimed descent from Emperor Jing of Former Han through the kings of Zhongshan and a short-lived fief in Zhuo commandery held by a cadet lineage. His grandfather, Liu Xiong, was a country magistrate and his father Liu Hong held office in the local administration. Liu Bei lost his father when he was still young and Liu Bei lived a poor life. His mother maintained the family by selling straw sandals. In a corner of their small property there was a mulberry tree over fifteen feet tall, shaped like an umbrella of the chariot. The tree held some superstitious value, people who saw it from afar took it as a sign of future fame and honour. Liu Bei agreed on this, but his uncle Liu Zijing suggested that Liu Bei would only bring his family to ruin.Studying under Lu Zhi  In 175 A.D. Liu Bei was sent to study by his mother. He took lessons from Lu Zhi, a distinguished man of the commandery who was an Academician at the University of Luoyang.Family Notes Fact vs. Fiction References Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Diaochan \u8c82\u87ec  Diaochan \u8c82\u87ec, or Ren Diaochan \u4efb\u8c82\u87ec is a fictional character who appears in the fictitious novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. She is based on a maidservant mentioned in L\u00fc Bu's biography in Records of the Three Kingdoms, Book of Wei 7. Diaochan is also often regarded as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Unlike the other four beauties however, Diaochan, as we know her from ficitious accounts, never existed. She is therefore sometimes replaced by Yu Miaoyi \u865e\u5999\u5f0b.Biography  Historically not much is known about Dong Zhuo's maid, fictionally named Diaochan (her real name is not recorded). Diaochan's stories in Sanguo zhi pinghua, Romance of the Three Kingdoms or any of the videogames are all fictional.Affair with L\u00fc Bu  During the Campaign against Dong Zhuo, \"the maid\" served Dong Zhuo as his maid. She was most likely of young age. She met L\u00fc Bu when Dong Zhuo had ordered him to guard the palace doors. \"the maiden\" was presumably a girl of pleasant appearance, because whenever she passed by the palace doors, L\u00fc Bu would attempt to seduce her, eventually succeeding. In 192 A.D. \"the maid\" and L\u00fc Bu had an affair. The affair unsettled L\u00fc Bu. Once, Dong Zhuo had tried to kill L\u00fc Bu by throwing a lance aimed at his head for a minor offence. L\u00fc Bu always feared Dong Zhuo would do something like that again, given Dong Zhuo's temper. Presumably, he feared that the chances of something like that happening again would become bigger if Dong Zhuo found out about his affair with \"the maid\".Wang Yun's involvement  Minister over the Masses Wang Yun \u738b\u5141 had noticed the changes in the relationship between Dong Zhuo and L\u00fc Bu (which had changed partially because of \"the maid\") and used it to set L\u00fc Bu up even further against his adoptive father, which ultimately resulted in L\u00fc Bu killing Dong Zhuo. What happened to \"the maid\" after this is not known.Family See also Notes Fact vs. Fiction  Historically...References Sources Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Yellow Turban Rebellion  The Yellow Turban Rebellion (Hu\u00e1ngj\u012bn zh\u012b lu\u00e0n \u9ec3\u5dfe\u4e4b\u4e82) is often regarded as the conflict that marked the beginning of the end for the Han Dynasty. It was instigated by the religious brothers Zhang Jue \u5f35\u89d2, Zhang Bao \u5f35\u5bf6 and Zhang Liang \u5f35\u6881. Though initially their intentions were arguably purely religious, the rise of popularity of their teachings known as the Way of Great Peace (T\u00e0ip\u00edng D\u00e0o \u592a\u5e73\u9053) may have aspired to greater ambitions as the Zhang brothers started creating their own secret agenda. An unfortunate betrayal forced Zhang Jue to launch his rebellion earlier than planned, on a date highly unfavorable for the Yellow Turbans.The Battle  The origin of the battle can be dated back to the early 170's, when the Zhang brothers instigated their religious movement known as the Way of Great Peace. The brothers appointed themselves with titles. They equipped themselves with staves with nine knots \u4e5d\u7bc0\u6756. They gathered hundreds of thousands of followers with most of them being very loyal to the Zhang brothers\u2019 ideals.Han-China during the Reign of the House of Liu  It was early in the 170\u2019s when great epidemics started occurring regularly and give rise to vigorous movements. One of these movements was the Way of Great Peace, founded by the brothers Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang in about 174 A.D. Zhang Jue was an adept of the popular cult of the Way of Huang-Lao (Hu\u00e1ng-L\u01ceo D\u00e0o \u5949\u4e8b\u9ec3\u8001\u9053) and thus a man with experience when it comes to Daoism, the basic religion for his teachings along with Buddhism. Patients were ordered to kowtow before one of the Zhang brothers, or other teachers and reflect on their sins while the teacher would recite magic formulae over some water and hand it to the patient to drink. Strangely enough many of the patients were cured. They started to believe the Zhang brothers possessed divine powers and began to worship them. Because major epidemics were reported almost every second year, the teachings of the Zhang brothers were highly relevant and may have been the reason of the success of the Way of Great Peace. Throughout the 170\u2019s the Way of Great Peace acquired wide popularity.Causes of the Rise of Popularity and Rebellion  Decades before the Yellow Turban Rebellion took place, China was already experiencing a constant series of natural disasters, a growth of population, frequent barbarian incursions, eunuch influences and other factors that, throughout the years, have been considered possible causes for the quick rise of popularity of the Way of Great Peace. In this chapter we will list all factors and possible causes; It is also believed that these factors were not only the cause of the rise of popularity of the Way of Great Peace, but also the reason why it was founded. This, however, seems unlikely to us. We have chosen to go with Paul Michaud who stated that the Zhang brothers\u2019 initial goals were purely religious and without any ambition of overthrowing the Han Dynasty.Barbarian Incursions  Later Han, like most Chinese dynasties, suffered at times from economic dislocations caused by foreign wars and raids of border tripes. Between 100-184 China was surrounded by various barbarian tribes: The relation with these tribes was not always peaceful and throughout the reign of the Later Han the dynasty witnessed various destructive incursions, especially its frontier provinces. The most dangerous of these tribes were the Qiang. From 86 to 169 there was a state of recurrent warfare between the Qiang and the Han. This was not one continuous war though, but can be divided into four distinct phases. The first was the rebellion of the Qiang chieftain Mitang \u8ff7\u5510. It consisted of a series raids staged in cooperation with his allies in the province of Liang, and a series of punitive expeditions against the rebel leader. Neither of the forces was uniformly victorious and uniformly defeated, though the tide of victory rode with the Han forces. Mitang seems to have held some kind of grudge against the Han Chinese and he wasn\u2019t bribable. His rebellion lasted until 102. Thereafter his son and the remnants of his people surrendered to Han. The second was the most violent Qiang outbreak during the Later Han dynasty. It was ignited by Qiang living within the confines of China who objected to being conscripted for the wars against the western countries. Soon after it spread to all the Qiang who became unified under a common cause. Their initial success emboldened their leader, a man by the name of Dianlian \u6ec7\u96f6, and in 108 he proclaimed himself emperor in the northern lands. Dianlian died in 112, but until then the Qiang kept inflicting several crushing defeats on the Han armies sent against them. However, when his son Lianchang \u96f6\u660c, who was young In both years and experience, succeeded him, the tides seemed to turn. A man named Langmo \u72fc\u83ab became his strategist and one Du Jigong \u675c\u5b63\u8ca2, a Han renegade, was made a general. There were successes for both sides, but starting in 117, when Tu Chi-kung was murdered, the Han hired murderers to kill all the Qiang leaders. Lianchang was also stabbed to death in 117 and in 118 it was the turn of his strategist. The second outbreak was then defeated; it had lasted more than ten years, it had cost more than 24.000.000 cash to the treasury and had caused incalculable loss in life and property in the provinces of Bing and Liang. During 119-126 there were only a few short-lived outbreaks, which were dealt with by the Han general Ma Xian \u99ac\u8ce2. The third phase of the Qiang-Han conflict began in 134 and it lasted until 145, when the Han official Liang Ping \u6881\u4e26 enticed the Qiang to surrender by means of kindness and favour. It was not as violent as previous Qiang outbreaks, but it lasted for about 10 years and had necessitated expenses well over 8.000.000 cash. The fourth and final outbreak began in 159 and lasted until 169. Perhaps one of the most striking features of the conflict was the alliance between the Xianbi and the Eastern Qiang in 166. This presented a special danger to the provinces Yu, Ping and Liang. One year later, a great victory by Dong Zhuo \u8463\u5353 eliminated that threat. The rebellion could have ended in 167, but the general Duan Jiong \u6bb5\u71b2, who had taken an active part in the struggle, convinced the emperor to fight to the finish against the Eastern Qiang, the only Qiang that had not been dealt with yet. He was assigned to lead the mission and did so successfully. He fought 180 battles, beheaded 38.000 Qiang and captured in excess of 427.000 head of cattle, horses, sheep, mules and camels. His total expenditures had amounted to 4.400.000 cash and he had lost more than 400 officers and men. The Qiang had come to an end; they submitted to the Chinese.Decline of the House of Liu  A decline of the House of Liu appears to have started in 89 A.D., with the coming of Emperor He of Han \u6f22\u548c\u5e1d. The new emperor was so young (10 years at the time of ascension), that it necessitated a regency to be established. The Empress Dowager Dou \u7ac7\u7687\u540e assumed the functions of regent and, as a rule, relied on her family for help and support. Her brothers Dou Xian, Dou Du, Dou Jing \u7ac7\u666f and Dou Gui \u7ac7\u7470 all became powerful officials, though they had only relatively menial titles before. So when the Emperor He came of age, he was faced with powerful factions. It appears Emperor He and following Emperors were all born with relatively weak personalities. They also seem to have been bitterly resentful of their relatives' power. Their desire to do away with their relatives' power helped give rise to the palace eunuchs. The struggle between the various factions confined within the walls of the palace. It did not precipitate any civil war.Epidemics  Epidemics seem to have been a rather constant factor throughout the reign of the House of Liu, however around the time of the foundation of the Way of Great Peace there was an increase in the frequency of reports of major epidemics. They were now reported almost every second year; in the spring of 171, the winter of 173, the spring of 179, and the winters of 182 and 185 A.D. Especially the ones in 171 and 173 may have helped the Zhang brothers tremendously building up a base of loyal patient. Those who were cured believed in the teachings of the Zhang brothers and started to worship them. According to Rafe de Crespigny it appears very likely that a new, and thus virulent disease began affecting humans. Since the Zhang brothers were healers, this factor is highly relevant to the success of their teachings.Eunuch influence in the Imperial Court  Eunuchs, or more specifically Regular Palace Attendants and Junior Attendants of the Yellow Gates, which were the highest eunuch positions, originally served under the Minister Steward, but became largely independent during Later Han. There were two instances which really helped the eunuchs gain individual power. The first was when Liu Zhao \u5289\u8087, alias Emperor He \u6f22\u548c\u5e1d, ascended the throne in 88 A.D. Liu Zhao ascended the throne at the young age of ten. Though that was not uncommon during Later Han, the emperor was born with a weak personality and therefore relied heavily upon the help of others, such as the eunuchs, who, from that moment onwards, were allowed to meddle in state affairs. The second instance came in the 120's, during Emperor An's \u6f22\u5b89\u5e1d reign. Emperor An placed a lot of trust in his wetnurse Wang Sheng \u738b\u8056, his wife Empress Yan Ji \u95bb\u59ec and the two eunuchs Jiang Jing \u6c5f\u4eac and Li Run \u674e\u958f (both Junior Attendants at the Yellow Gates and later made Regular Palace Attendants). All four of them, however, were corrupt in intentions and they abused the Emperor\u2019s trust to seize power and wealth for themselves. In 124 A.D. Jiang Jing and Empress Yan Ji were involved in falsely accusing the then nine-year-old Crown Prince Liu Bao \u5289\u4fdd of crimes and wanted the Emperor to depose him. The following year, 125 A.D., Emperor An suddenly died. Prince Bao was Emperor An's only son and thus the only legal heir to the throne. Empress Yan Ji, however, abused this momentum to put Liu Yi \u5289\u61ff on the throne. She thought he would be easier to control given his young (but unknown) age. Later that year Liu Yi, alias Emperor Shao \u6f22\u5c11\u5e1d, became seriously ill and later passed away. Afraid that Empress Yan Ji would again bypass Prince Bao, the eunuch Sun Cheng \u5b6b\u7a0b, a \"good\" eunuch, championed the cause of the Crown Prince Bao by entering into a conspiracy with nineteen other eunuchs. Their first move was an attack on Li Run, Jiang Jing and the other eunuchs of the ruling clique. Li Run was kept alive because of his influence, and was forced, by knife-point, to escort the new emperor and take control of the imperial Secretariat. When Prince Bao was finally enthroned he richly awarded those to whom he owed his throne. Several years later, in 135 A.D. he even allowed eunuchs to adopt children, which also meant that those adopted children would inherit their fathers wealth and titles. Some years later, during the reign of Emperor Huan \u6f22\u6853\u5e1d from 147 \u2013 167, the eunuchs became a powerful individual faction. In 168 A.D. there seemed to have been founded some sort of a eunuch clique, with Cao Jie \u66f9\u7bc0 being the most influential of them. They enjoyed great favour and influence, which was shown by Emperor Huan\u2019s indifferent behavior towards memorials attacking the eunuchs. Around the year 168 A.D. after the passing of Emperor Huan, sixteen years before the rebellion began and five or so years before the Way of Great Peace was founded, the eunuchs began to act somewhat as a cohesive political group. It was around this time that a first struggle against the eunuchs began, with Dou Wu \u7ac7\u6b66 secrectly plotting against Cao Jie and his faction. In 181 A.D. Cao Jie passed away but not much later the eunuchs Zhang Rang \u5f35\u8b93 and Zhao Zhong \u8d99\u5fe0 became strong influential individuals and seemed to have somewhat formed their own clique at court. According to several sources, such as the Zizhi Tongjian \u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9452, they had contact with the Yellow Turbans.Growth of Population  It is considered that a continuous growth of population caused economical problems. In the year 2 A.D. the recorded population of China was 59.594.978 individuals. This was the highest figure preserved for the two Han dynasties and will be used as a base for this part of the article. In 9 A.D. Wang Mang \u738b\u83bd usurped the throne and established his own dynasty; named the Xin Dynasty \u65b0\u671d. In 23 A.D. his dynasty was attacked by Red Eyebrow rebels (chimei \u8d64\u7709) and Wang Mang was killed during the battle. In 23 A.D. the Han dynasty was restored by Liu Xuan \u5289\u7384, alias Emperor Gengshi of Han \u6f22\u66f4\u59cb\u5e1d. Two years later, in 25 A.D., Liu Xuan was strangled to death by Xie Lu \u8b1d\u797f. After Liu Xuan\u2019s death it was Liu Xiu \u5289\u79c0, a descendant of the former imperial clan, who ascended the throne, restored the dynasty and became the founder of the Later Han Dynasty. As Emperor Guangwu of Han \u6f22\u5149\u6b66\u5e1d he spent the greatest part of his reign waging wars against rebels such as the Red Eyebrows. In 57 A.D., two years before his death, the population is reported to have shrunk to 21.007.820. Almost 1/3 of the figure of 55 years earlier. Not too much can be attached to this figure. People, for example, could\u2019ve avoided a census taken for the purpose of tax collection due to the many civil wars that had kept the empire occupied. It remains safe to say though the population did undergo a decrease throughout those warring years. In 105 A.D., however, reports say the population had increased and was now 53.256.229 individuals. Probably due to Emperor Guangwu\u2019s successes during his wars which resulted in pacifying the empire. In 140 A.D. the population had again decreased, this time because of a number of disasters such as floods, droughts, floods and plagues of locusts. There were also several barbarian uprisings. The population in the year 140 A.D. was reported to have been 49.150.220. Sixteen years later though, population had again increased to a total of 56.486.856, which was the highest figure for the Later Han Dynasty and also the last recorded figure for the dynasty. In short: in 100 years (57 \u2013 156 A.D.) the population went up from roughly 21 million to roughly 56 million. It remains hard to determine what this caused the Han.Natural Disasters  In researching this factor we are handicapped. Historical sources are inadequate and record only the date and location of a certain natural disaster, they do not tell us the range of the damage it caused or if it caused any damage at all, nor do they tell us if civilians suffered from this. To try to get an impression of these catastrophes and what they might have caused we will first list all the sorts of catastrophes that occurred. We are told that only the years 126, 134, 136, 141-143, 150, 160, 163 and 170 were free of any catastrophes. So it seems these factors were constant and therefore it seems safe to assume that this did not directly cause a rebellion. However it should be noted that at that time the Chinese believed that natural disasters were caused by misbehavior of the emperor. Looking at the frequency of the catastrophes the Chinese would\u2019ve believed the emperor misbehaved on many occasions.Tax Increases  Harsh tax increases at a time of natural disasters and epidemics were said to have stripped people of their hope. Properties were damaged and destroyed and households suffered from the epidemics making it very tough to earn the money needed to restore their property and would\u2019ve been made impossible if taxes were harshly increased. However, historical sources list only one instance of remission of field tax since Emperor Ling ascended the throne in 168 A.D. Therefore it seems unlikely this factor had much or anything to do with the rebellion.Causes: Conclusion  From listing these factors we can draw a conclusion for what seems probable causes for the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans. It should be noted, though, that no surviving documents of the Yellow Turbans themselves exist. Therefore we had to rely on what is written in works such as Sanguo zhi, Hou Han ji and Hou Han shu about the Yellow Turbans and the years preceding the rebellion. Because of these works the following conclusions are made. It seems improbable to believe that the people rebelled because of an economical crisis. The factors which could've caused an economical crisis (natural disasters, barbarian incursions, population problems, etc) appear to have been constant and therefore it seems unlikely that these could've caused an economical crisis. A political crisis seems more likely. Based upon what is written above, the following arguments seem probable: Meanwhile, Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang had a rather good understanding of what was really going on and spread various omens throughout the country which they presented to the people as concrete evidence that Heaven had withdrawn its mandate to rule from the Emperor, further decreasing the people's faith and strengthening their loyalty towards the Way of Great Peace. For example there was an omen which respresented eunuchs meddling in state affairs and an omen which represented bearers of the colour Yellow would replace the Han.Propagation of the Way of Great Peace  From the above we have learned that either the foundation of the Way of Great Peace coinciding with a series of epidemics, or economical hardships seriously helped Zhang Jue and his brothers in gathering followers. Zhang Jue further increased the amount of his followers by sending eight disciples to convert the people of the eight provinces Qing \u9751, Xu \u5f90, You \u5e7d, Ji \u5180, Jing \u8346, Yang \u626c, Yan \u5157 and Yu \u8c6b to his teachings. The people passed his words from one to another for more than ten years. With success, as there were some who sold up all their property and left their homes to follow him and his brothers. People blocked the roads in their rush to join Zhang Jue. About 10.000 people failed to reach him, because they died of illness along the way In 178 A.D. Zhang Jue introduced a host of omens which he presented as concrete evidence that Heaven had withdrawn its mandate to rule from the emperor. Examples of omens are a black mist in the form of a dragon and a hen transforming into a rooster. The latter symbolized the emperor allowing eunuchs to meddle in state affairs, which was in fact true.Ignorance of the Government  The officials in the commanderies and government offices had noticed the flocking of their people, but they did not really understand what was going on. Instead, they reported that Zhang Jue was reforming men with his fine teachings. For some years the Han Excellency Yang Ci \u7993\u8cdc had been concerned at the development of the Zhang brothers\u2019 movement. In 180 A.D. he and his Senior Clerk Liu Tao \u5289\u9676 had been discussing the possible threat of the Way of Great Peace to good order. During the discussion Yang Ci said to Liu Tao: Liu Tao encouraged Yang Ci to write these words down in a memorial and send it to Emperor Ling of Han. But because Yang Ci left office soon after sending the memorial the matter was simply pigeon-holed. Liu Tao then joined the Censorate as an Imperial Clerk and in 183 he, jointly with the Commandant of Equipage Yue Song \u6a02\u677e and the Consultant Yuan Gong \u8881\u8ca2, sent in another memorial in which Yang Ci\u2019s earlier memorial was cited and added that: But the advice was again ignored. Around that time Liu Tao was commissioned to compose the commentary Chunqiu tiaoli \u6625\u79cb\u689d\u4f8b on the Spring and Autumn Annals.Preparing for Rebellion  In the meantime Zhang Jue had amassed \"hundreds of thousands\" of followers. A frequently given figure is 360.000 followers, which Paul Michaud confirms. Zhang Jue then set-up 36 Divisions (F\u0101ng, \u65b9). There were two kinds of Divisions: Small Divisions and Large Divisions. A Small Division had 6.000 ~ 7.000 men. A Large Division had over 10.000 men. Every Division had an appointed Division Leader, who in his turn could appoint a \"Gang Leader\" (q\u00fa shu\u00e0i \u6e20\u5e25) (perjorative term) to a selection of his troops. In 180 A.D. they spread the word that: Then, the followers of the Way of Great Peace used white clay or white chalk to write the hanzi for 'jiazi', \u7532\u5b50, on the walls of the capital, the gates of the government offices and provincial and commandery yamens. The year jiazi was the first year of a new cycle. A cycle consisted of 60 years. For a millenary doctrine such as Zhang Jue's, this was a most suitable omen for the beginning of the rebellion. In theories of the Five Powers \u4e94\u884c, the colour yellow, which is referred to in the Yellow Turbans slogan (Yellow Heaven) and their clothing style (yellow turbans, scarves, bandannas, etc), was the symbolizing colour of the Power of Earth, which would succeed the Power of Fire, which was the Han's reignpower. The colour Yellow also referred to the Yellow Emperor, who held an important position in the doctrines of the Zhang brothers.Ma Yuanyi  By 183 A.D. Ma Yuanyi \u99ac\u5143\u7fa9, a Large Division Leader (d\u00e0 f\u0101ng \u5927\u65b9) and leader in planning for rebellion, had, together with others, collected \"several tens of thousands\" of men from the provinces of Jing and Yang and they had arranged a date for a rising at Ye city, which was the administrative center of Wei commandery and Ji province. Meanwhile, Ma Yuanyi made frequent trips to the capital city Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d, which lay about 200 kilometers southwest and upriver from Ye city. There, he compiled confidential reports and claimed adherents, even among the palace eunuchs. With the Regular Palace Attendants Feng Xu \u5c01\u80e5 and Xu Feng \u5f90\u5949 (and possibly more) Ma Yuanyi arranged an attack from within the palace that was to coincide with local risings throughout the country. The date for the attack and the coincided rising was set at the fifth day of the third lunar month, which was 3 April 184.Zhang Jue Betrayed  And so the date was set. On 3 April, third month of the first year of the new cycle the Zhang brothers and their followers would all rise and attempt to overthrow the Han Dynasty. However, before the appointed day, in spring of 184, a disciple of Zhang Jue, a man from Ji'nan commandery in Qing province named Tang Zhou \u5510\u5468, sent a memorial to the court in which he revealed the plot. The reasons for this are unknown. According to History of the Later Han 69/59 it was He Jin \u4f55\u9032 who exposed the plot of Ma Yuanyi. Subsequently Ma Yuanyi was arrested and torn into pieces by chariots in Luoyang. An edict then ordered the Three Excellencies and the Colonel Director of Retainers to arrest an question all those attendants and guards of the palace and the common people of the capital district who were followers of the teachings of the Way of Great Peace. Over a thousand people were executed. Orders were sent to Ji province that Zhang Jue and his followers should be arrested. They had already realized that their plans had been discovered though, and Zhang Jue had sent messengers to all thirty-six Divisions. They rode day and night to tell the Divisions that they should all rise together.The Yellow Turban Rebellion  In preparation for their rebellion, Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao, Zhang Liang and their followers all wore pieces of yellow cloth, as means of identification and as a sign of the Yellow Heaven to come. People called them Yellow Turbans (Hu\u00e1ngj\u012bn \u9ec3\u5dfe), or Yellow Turbans Ash. They were also known as \"Ant Bandits\" (because they were so numerous) and \"Moth Bandits\".Second Lunar Month of Jiazi  February 29 \u2013 March 29\n The brothers gave themselves titles. Zhang Jue proclaimed himself Lord of Heaven General (ti\u0101ng\u014dng ji\u0101ngj\u016bn \u5929\u516c\u5c07\u8ecd), Zhang Bao proclaimed himself Lord of Earth General (d\u00edg\u014dng ji\u0101ngj\u016bn \u5730\u516c\u5c07\u8ecd) and Zhang Liang proclaimed himself Lord of Man General (r\u00e9ng\u014dng ji\u0101ngj\u016bn \u4eba\u516c\u5c07\u8ecd), presenting themselves as symbolic embodiments of heaven, earth and man, the all-embracing triad. It is said that Zhang Jue killed a man to propitiate Heaven just before he rose in revolt. Though it should be noted that \"official\" historical texts were not required to be 100% factual and it seems more plausible that this was added to give the Yellow Turbans a more evil and barbarian character. Around 20-25 March the Yellow Turban Rebellion had begun; everywhere they were the followers of Zhang Jue and his brothers burned down and destroyed government offices and looted the villages. Provincial and commandery administrations were compelled to abandon their offices and most of the officials ran away. Within a few weeks the whole empire had responded to the rebellion. The capital was in fear and trembling. In the kingdoms of Anping and Ganling people seized their kings and made cause with the rebels. Probably, many of the Yellow Turban rebels were poorly equipped, taking pitchforks, scythes and the like into battle. When they attacked and took over commanderies they probably took over their equipment as well. Thus they might've eventually fought using proper weaponry and armour as well as horses. It should be noted that it seems plausible that not all of Zhang Jue's \"hundreds of thousands/360.000\" followers responded and that the number of followers actually going into combat may have been fewer. When Zhang Jue sent messengers riding day and night to tell all Division Leaders to rise together they had to travel hundreds of kilometers to reach the most distant Divisions. Messengers of Han could have preceded the messengers of Zhang Jue, or Zhang Jue\u2019s may not have reached the most distant Divisions. In short, either of the following could have happened:  The Yellow Turbans had three main centers of rebellion.Third Lunar Month of Jiazi  30 March - 27 April\n On the day wushen, which corresponds to 2 April, the capital city of Luoyang was placed under martial law. The brother of the Empress He \u4f55, He Jin, who was Intendant of Henan at that time, was now made General-in-Chief (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd) and enfeoffed as Marquis of Shen. Hou Han shu 69/59 says He Jin received the marquisate for exposing Ma Yuanyi's plot. Possibly the memorial that Tang Zhou had sent to the court had fallen into He Jin's hands either directly or through one of his men. He Jin took command of the guards of the divisions of the Right and of the Left and of the Feathered Forest Troops, together with the five regiments of the Northern Army and led them to camp at the Capital Hostel.  There, they prepared weapons and equipment to keep order in the capital. Chief Commandants were appointed for each of the Eight Passes leading to the capital city of Luoyang. According to the biography of Huangfu Song in Hou Han shu these events occurred some ten days after the immediate rising of the Yellow Turbans.On the Eight Passes  The Eight Passes lay in circle around Luoyang, for more detail about their location, click on the picture. Emperor Ling had summoned all his ministers to a council. The Inspector of Yu province Wang Yun \u738b\u5141 said that the proscription of the Men of Faction should be ended so that disaffected gentlemen could join the insurgents.Huangfu Song \u7687\u752b\u5d69, the Grand Administrator of Beidi commandery and nephew of Huangfu Gui \u7687\u752b\u898f, had the same suggestion, and added that there should be a greater distribution of the resources of the palace treasure and of the horses in the Western Garden stables to equip the army. Emperor Ling asked the \"good\" Regular Palace Attendant L\u00fc Qiang \u5442\u5f37 what he thought of the proposal. L\u00fc Qiang said: It frightened the Emperor, who then accepted the policy. On the day renzi, which corresponds to 5 April, an amnesty was issued for all the Men of Faction in the empire and those who had been exiled were allowed to return home. Only Zhang Jue was omitted from the amnesty. Trained soldiers were raised from the Empire and general summons were sent out, requiring all provincial and commandery administrations to gather horses and crossbows, and instructing them to recommend the sons and grandsons of former military officers and those among the common people who had some understanding of warfare, so that they might attend at Luoyang for possible appointment. Probably at the same conference on 5 April a pacification campaign was initiated; He Jin's army consisted of: Huangfu Song's and Zhu Jun's army consisted of roughly 40.000 men and the following officers: Lu Zhi's army consisted of: Furthermore there were was also an army led by Zou Jing \u9112\u9756, whose army consisted of: Not much is known about Zou Jing and his men. They fought \"Yellow Turbans in the north\" (Zhuo commandery?), but we do not know when Zou Jing was ordered to do so. Could be at the same time as Huangfu Song, Zhu Jun and Lu Zhi, or perhaps later. Sooner seems highly unlikely.  At this time the Regular Palace Attendants Zhao Zhong \u8d99\u5fe0, Zhang Rang \u5f35\u8b93, Xia Yun \u590f\u6689, Guo Sheng \u90ed\u52dd, Duan Gui \u6bb5\u572d and Song Dian \u5b8b\u6bbf were all enfeoffed as marquises and treated with great favour. The Emperor would often say: From this, the eunuchs became very confident of their position. They built great houses that rivaled even the Imperial Palace. However, when Feng Xu and Xu Feng were found out, the Emperor became furious and said: The eunuchs kowtowed and replied: Later, they also blamed the \"good\" eunuch L\u00fc Qiang, who was subsequently put in jail, where he later killed himself. The Regular Palace Attendant Xiang Xu \u5411\u6829 and the Gentleman of the Palace Zhang Jun \u5f35\u921e both sent memorials to court in which they criticized the Regular Palace Attendants. Both of these men were imprisoned and killed.  Preparations for the campaign must have taken a good deal of time, because it was not until the fourth lunar month (beginning on 28 April) before the Han forces first met with those of Zhang Jue. Lu Zhi left the capital city, either via the Meng or Xiaoping Crossings, and headed towards Julu commandery in Ji province. He was assisted by the General of the Gentlemen of the Household Protecting the Wuhuan, Zong Yuan, who had brought with him non-Chinese auxiliaries to assist Lu Zhi against the Yellow Turbans. Lu Zhi himself lead a force composed of soldiers of the Northern Army, militia levies and strategic reserves. Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun left the capital later than Lu ZhiThey left from the capital, probably entering Yu province through the passes Huanyuan or Taigu, or both and they marched south along the Wei and Ying rivers respectively. Nanyang commandery. On the day gengwu, which corresponds to 23 April, the Yellow Turbans of Nanyang commandery, led by Zhang Mancheng \u5f35\u66fc\u6210, attacked and defeated the Grand Administrator of Nanyang commandery Chu Gong \u891a\u8ca2. Luoyang city, Henan commandery. Near the end of the month, Emperor Ling asked the Grand Commandant Yang Ci for his opinion about the Yellow Turban outbreak. Yang Ci's reply was very straight-forward and straight to the point. It did not please the Emperor. Sometime later, the Emperor was on a visit to the Southern Palace where he was browsing amongst various old documents. Amidst those documents he found the memorials written by Yang Ci and Liu Tao in which they warned the Emperor about Zhang Jue. He enfeoffed Yang Ci as Marquis of Linjin and Liu Tao as Marquis of Zhongling District. When Huangfu Song was sent against the Yellow Turbans in Yingchuan commandery, Fu Xie was made his Major. Fu Xie had long disapproved of the eunuchs at court and as he was about to leave he sent the emperor the following memorial:Fourth Lunar Month of Jiazi  28 April ~ 26(?) May  Yingchuan commandery. In this month the Imperial Army of Han made for the first time contact with the rebels. Zhu Jun was first to encounter the rebels when he, somewhere north of Yangdi city, the administrative center of Yingchuan commandery, faced one of the largest Divisions of Yellow Turbans which was led by a certain Bo Cai \u6ce2\u624d. Surprisingly it was Zhu Jun who was beaten and he was forced to retreat. There are no details on this battle, but Bo Cai had probably already captured the city and used it to his advantage. Also, we are told that Bo Cai commanded one of the largest Divisions, this makes it plausible that he was a Large Division Leader and his army probably matched Zhu Jun's size-wise. When Huangfu Song heard of the defeat of Zhu Jun, he must've realized he was at a disadvantage and he advanced to Changshe city. The victorious Bo Cai went on to besiege Huangfu Song. The troops under the command of Huangfu Song were in fewer numbers than those of Bo Cai and Huangfu Song's men were afraid. Huangfu Song exhorted his soldiers not to lose hope, supporting his argument with relevant historical precedents. Meanwhile the enemy had set up a camp amidst the high and dry grass (or actually made a camp out of the grass and bushels, as some sources suggest). When, during a night, a strong wind came to blow, Huangfu Song executed a plan to defeat the rebels. Some of his men were sent to mount the walls with grass in their hands. Another party was sent over hidden paths to slip past the siege-lines. There, they set fire to the high grass surrounding the enemy camp (or the encampment itself) and sounded their battle-cries. The men on the walls raised their torches in reply. Huangfu Song then led soldiers from the city. Supported by drums and battle-cries they charged the enemy lines. Bo Cai's army was terrified and they fled in disorder. They fell back westward to Yangdi. Just as the enemy lines were shattered, the Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Cao Cao \u66f9\u64cd of Pei kingdom, arrived with reinforcements. Runan commandery. Yellow Turbans in Runan commandery (Yu province) defeated its Grand Administrator Zhao Qian \u8d99\u8b19 at Shaoling county. Guangyang commandery. The rebels in Guangyang commandery, which was the administrative center of You province, had killed the provincial Inspector Guo Xun \u90ed\u52f3 and its Grand Administrator Liu Wei \u5289\u885b. In addition to this, the Yellow Turbans controlled their headquarters area in Julu commandery. If one draws lines in Ji province between the most important locations and the locations which controlled significant forces, a result as seen in the map on the left is seen.Fifth Lunar Month of Jiazi  27 May \u2013 25 June\nYingchuan commandery. Huangfu Song, Zhu Jun and Cao Cao combined their force and met Bo Cai's Division at Yangdi. Bo Cai was defeated and killed. Some rebels survived the encounter and they apparently tried to slip the flank of the combined force of Huangfu Song, Zhu Jun and Cao Cao, who were pursuing them southeastwards. Perhaps they were trying to escape north to Zhang Jue's headquarters. Julu commandery. Lu Zhi encountered the, what must have been the main force of the Yellow Turban rebels, which were under the personal command of the Lord of Heaven General Zhang Jue. The date of this encounter is not known, but it is known that Lu Zhi \"soon made contact\" after departing. Lu Zhi left during the third month and the last of his encounters with the Julu rebels was before the sixth month. It appeared that Zhang Jue was no match for Lu Zhi and he was beaten in one battle after another. During those battles he had lost over 10.000 men to Lu Zhi. Zhang Jue and his followers fled to take refuge in the county city Guangzong.Sixth Lunar Month of Jiazi  26 June ~ 23(?) August (leap month)\nRunan commandery. The combined force of Huangfu Song, Zhu Jun and Cao Cao caught up with the fleeing rebels at Xihua in Runan commandery, just northeast of Shaoling county. They were now led by a certain Peng Tuo \u5f6d\u812b. After a battle he was defeated and destroyed. The rebels had made a fatal error for not attempting to escape to Wan city in Nanyang commandery, where the Yellow Turbans led by Zhang Mancheng had been very successful in holding off Imperial troops. According to Sun Jian\u2019s biography in Sanguo zhi (with comments by Pei Songzhi \u88f4\u677e\u4e4b), Sun Jian was following up on success and he had gone a long way in advance. Near Xihua they had the worst of it in an encounter. Sun Jian was wounded and fell from his horse. His men under his command were scattered. His horse, a piebald, galloped back to camp, pawed at the ground and neighed impatiently. Some officers and men followed the horse to some bushes where they found Sun Jian. He was brought back to the camp and after two weeks his wound was sufficiently healed and he went out to fight again.Merits of Fu Xie  During the Yingchuan campaign, Fu Xie was sent to serve under Huangfu Song as a major. We are told that the Yellow Turban leaders Liang Zhongning \u6881\u4ef2\u5be7 and Zhang Bo \u5f35\u4f2f were both killed by him when he led a troop of Huangfu Song\u2019s army. Dates are unknown, but we do know that Zhang Bo was killed in Yingchuan commandery. The location of Liang Zhongning\u2019s death is not known, but as he was born in Yingchuan he probably fought there as well. The Yellow Turbans suffered some serious losses. The remnant rebels either surrendered or scattered and the three commanderies of Yingchuan, Runan and Chen were pacified. Huangfu Song then sent a report to the throne in which he gave credit to Zhu Jun for his work. Subsequently Zhu Jun was advanced in fief to be Marquis of Xi District and was transferred to appointment as General of the Gentlemen of the Household Who Maintains the Rebels in Order. An imperial edict ordered Huangfu Song to attack Dong commandery in Yan province and Zhu Jun to attack Nanyang commandery in the north of Jing province. Nanyang commandery. For about 100 days the Yellow Turban rebel Zhang Mancheng was able to camp in the vicinity of Wan city. The Grand Administrator of Jiangxia commandery, Qin Xie \u79e6\u9821, was made the new Grand Administrator of Nanyang. He led Jiangxia troops to Wan where he attacked Zhang Mancheng and managed to kill him. The rebels, yet undaunted, selected one Zhao Hong \u8d99\u5f18 as their new leader and their strength in numbers again increased. Around this time Zhu Jun and a force of the Inspector of Jing Province, Xu Qiu \u5f90\u7486, had both arrived and joined in a siege of Wan city. Xu Qiu was commanding provincial troops and together they are reported to have commanded 18.000 men. The Yellow Turbans under Zhao Hong were said to have \"multitude gradually augmented to more than 100.000\", but one (or both) of these figures were deliberately distorted to make it look like the imperial forces won against overwhelming odds. It seems more logical to believe that the imperial forces were stronger in numbers than the Yellow Turban rebels and that they just struggled against them because they had used the captured cities to their advantage. In any case, Zhu Jun, Xu Qiu and other local commanders started attacking Wan city in this month. Julu commandery. Earlier Lu Zhi had scored some victories against the Julu rebels commanded by Zhang Jue (or Zhang Liang) Early in the sixth month Lu Zhi surrounded them, built a siege-wall, dug a moat around the city, and constructed scaling ladders. He was ready for the final attack against the most important group of rebels. At Luoyang, meanwhile, the Emperor had sent the eunuch Zuo Feng \u5de6\u8c50, a Junior Attendant at the Yellow Gates, to see how Lu Zhi was doing. Someone told Lu Zhi that he should prepare a bribe for the eunuch, but Lu Zhi was unwilling. When Zhuo Feng returned to the capital he told the Emperor:  Angered, the Emperor sent a cage cart to bring Lu Zhi back to the capital. He was sentenced to death commuted by one degree. The General of the Gentlemen of the Household of the East (\u6771\u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07), Dong Zhuo \u8463\u5353 of Longxi commandery, replaced him. During the same month, Dong Zhuo, assisted by Guo Dian \u90ed\u5178, the Grand Administrator of Julu commandery, attacked the rebels in Julu. Apparently Guo Dian fought more energetic than Dong Zhuo and, by doing so, embarrassed Dong Zhuo. There exists (at least) two different accounts on what happened when Dong Zhuo attacked the Yellow Turbans.Theory 1  According to Carl Leban, who references to HHS A8:11b and HHSJJ B61:3a, Dong Zhuo attacked Lord of Earth General Zhang Bao at the Zhang brothers\u2019 headquarters in Xiaquyang city in Julu commandery, but could make no headway and retreated. He was condemned for his failure. Guo Dian, meanwhile, kept on fighting the rebels. He pressed the attack morning and night so that Zhang Bao held the city and dared not emerge.Theory 2  According to Rafe de Crespigny Dong Zhuo attacked the Lord of Man General Zhang Liang, who had maintained the defence of Guangzong city when Zhang Jue was taken ill during, or after Lu Zhi\u2019s attacks. When Lu Zhi was taken back to Luoyang and replaced by Dong Zhuo, the imperial troops may have lost some morale and moreover allowed the rebels to fortify themselves in a stronghold in Guangzong. Dong Zhuo could make no headway against Zhang Liang and was condemned for his failure.Seventh Lunar Month of Jiazi  24(?) August ~ 21(?) September\n Southwest of Luoyang, in Ba commandery of Yi province, a man named Zhang Xiu \u5f20\u8129 had been curing peoples illnesses in a way similar to the teachings of Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang. The price to pay for treatment was five dou of rice and the movement became known as the Way of the Five Dou of Rice (W\u01d4 D\u01d2u M\u01d0 D\u00e0o \u4e94\u6597\u7c73\u9053), or Five Dou of Rice sect (W\u01d4 D\u01d2u M\u01d0 \u4e94\u6597\u7c73). In the seventh month Zhang Xiu gathered followers and rebelled in Ba commandery. They raided the commanderies and counties and the people started to call them the Rice Rebels. Historian Henry Maspero believed that the Five Dou of Rice sect, because of its similar style and rising in the same year, was essentially the same as the Way of Great Peace. But more recent historians believe, and provided convincing theories, that the Way of Great Peace and the Way of the Five Dou of Rice were two independent movements.Eight Lunar Month of Jiazi  10(?) September ~ 9(?) October\nLuoyang. Some senior officials memorialized that Zhu Jun should be recalled. It was two months ago that he attacked the Yellow Turban Zhao Hong at Wan city, but so far he had achieved no success. The Excellency of Works Zhang Wen \u5f20\u6e29 wrote to the Emperor: So the Emperor kept Zhu Jun in his command. Nanyang commandery. Zhu Jun, now pressed by the events at Luoyang, attacked Zhao Hong. The Yellow Turban leader was defeated and lost his head in battle. His army, however, was far from defeated and was now led by Han Zhong \u97d3\u5fe0, who re-occupied Wan. Zhu Jun tried a diversionary attack on the southwest, complete with drums and battle-cries. All the rebels rushed southwest to deal with the attack, but in the meantime Zhu Jun personally led 5.000 picked troops secretly to the northeast. They climbed the walls and got into the city. Han Zhong fell back to defend the inner wall of the city and asked to negotiate a surrender. All officers thought they should accept this plea, but Zhu Jun said: So Zhu Jun continued to press his attacks. The rebels then stiffened their resistance and Zhu Jun could make no progress. He then broke off the siege. Zhu Jun climbed a hill of earth to look over the scene. He turned to his Major Zhang Chao and said: So they opened the siege and Han Zhong did come out to fight. The imperial troops attacked him and completely defeated him and they took \"more than ten thousand heads.\" Han Zhong then surrendered, apparently without conditions. Qin Xie, the Grand Administrator of Nanyang commandery, then killed Han Zhong. The remaining rebels chose one Sun Xia \u5b6b\u590f as their new leader and once again encamped in Wan. Dong commandery. Almost two months after Huangfu Song received the edict which told him to advance to Dong commandery, a troop of Huangfu Song, commanded by Fu Xie encountered the Yellow Turban local leader Bu Si \u535c\u5df3 at Cangting village. He fought, captured and killed the rebel. This is the sum of information concerning this phase of the campaign available to us. Given the location of Cangting village (south of Guangzong, see the map), it could\u2019ve been an important base of the Yellow Turbans. Following the victory Huangfu Song received an edict on the day yisu (25 September), which ordered him to advance to the Yellow Turbans in Julu commandery.Ninth Lunar Month of Jiazi  10(?) October ~ 8(?) November\n Nothing significant happened in this month. Huangfu Song was on his way to Julu commandery. Zhu Jun was still fighting the Wan rebels. Liu Xu \u5289\u7e8c, the King of Anping, was found guilty of impious conduct and was executed and his kingdom was abolished. Earlier in 184 he was kidnapped by Yellow Turbans. A ransom was levied from the people of the state and he was restored to the throne. Later the state Chancellor Li Xie \u674e\u71ee argued that Liu Xu had failed to maintain the principles of a true vassal. At first he was overruled and sent to prison for insulting the imperial clan, but a few months later Liu Xu was indeed found guilty.Tenth Lunar Month of Jiazi  9(?) November ~ 8(?) December\nJulu commandery. Winter. Huangfu Song fought with Zhang Jue's brother Zhang Liang at Guangzong. Earlier, according to theory 2, Dong Zhuo could make no progress against Zhang Liang and Huangfu Song actually started in similar fashion. Zhang Liang's forced were well-trained, spirited and brave and Huangfu Song could make no progression. The next day, he kept the gates of his camp closed and rested his troops and watched for a change in the enemy's camp. He realized that the enemy's determination had abated slightly, and so during the night he prepared his men for a sortie. At cock-crow, under the cover of darkness, he mustered his troops and rushed the enemy-lines. They fought the entire morning and until late afternoon. They completely defeated the rebels, taking \"30.000 heads\" while another \"50.000 rebels had rushed into the Yuan river where they drowned\". During the fighting Zhang Liang was killed; his head was cut off. Earlier, Zhang Jue had died of the illness that had befallen him during/after his fight with Lu Zhi. The Imperial Army dug up his grave, broke open his coffin, decapitated the body and sent the head to the capital.Eleventh Lunar Month of Jiazi  9(?) December ~ 17(?) January\nJulu commandery. With Zhang Liang and Zhang Jue dead, only Zhang Bao remained. About the battle with Zhang Bao, there are (at least) two theories:Theory 1  Guo Dian was still fighting Zhang Bao at Xiaquyang city, or at least was still near the city with a force. When Huangfu Song defeated Zhang Liang, he promptly joined Guo Dian in attacking Zhang Bao at Xiaquyang. The rebels were low on morale and completely defeated. Zhang Bao died in the slaughter.Theory 2  According to this theory, Zhang Bao fled, with his Yellow Turbans, to Xiaquyang in the north of Julu commandery, after Zhang Liang was defeated. Huangfu Song pursued them and beaten them at Xiaquyang. Zhang Bao died in the slaughter.Apparantley \"100.000 rebels were killed\" and a mound of bodies, covered with earth, was erected south of the city. By standing upon it, one could see the capital city of Luoyang.personal opinion on these theories  Theory 1 says that Dong Zhuo attacked Xiaquyang, but why would he do so when Lu Zhi had beaten Zhang Jue/Liang one a series of battles and was preparing himself for the final battle? Perhaps, as Theory 2 said earlier on, the rebels were now fortified and Dong Zhuo opted to attack Xiaquyang instead.\n Theory 2 indicates that Zhang Bao was actually with Zhang Liang in Guangzong city, or at least near him. Could Huangfu Song really beat a combined force of Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang? Besides, if we count the numbers of the forces (though not reliable) we have 180.000 rebels (100.000 + 50.000 + 30.000), with the majority belonging to Zhang Bao. In Rafe\u2019s theory we also learn that 50.000 rebels fled to drown in the Yuan river after Zhang Liang\u2019s defeat. Why would they do that if they could\u2019ve joined Zhang Bao in fleeing towards Xiaquyang? Together they would\u2019ve had a total of 150.000! Earlier, Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun had a combined force of 40.000 men. If they would split up, they would each have roughly 20.000 men. In my opinion, I\u2019d go for theory 1 on both occasions. When word of Huangfu Song's victories spread out, relieved peasants composed a ballad:  \"Great chaos in the empire,\nThe markets were desolate.\nMothers could not protect children,\nWives lost their husbands.\nDepending on Huangfu,\nAgain we live in peace.\" Nanyang commandery. The Assistant Major Sun Jian was able to climb the city walls and on 11 January 185 A.D. they stormed Wan city. Sun Xia fled and was chased as far as the Jing Hills in Xi'e, where he was finally defeated and killed. Another \"10.000 heads were cut off in the process\". The last major rebel force was defeated. The Zhang brothers were dead and the Yellow Turbans were scattered. Remnants were dealt with by the provincial and commandery governments.Twelfth Lunar Month of Jiazi  18(?) January - 18 February\n About mid-February of 185 the government issued a proclamation of celebration, changing the reign title from Guanghe (\"Brilliant Harmony\") to the slogan Zhongping (\"Pacification Achieved.\") The Han had scored a remarkable achievement in defeating the Yellow Turbans so quickly. However, the cost was high. Many government offices had been destroyed and magistrates were killed. The enemy had been slaughtered, but their wives and children were left either homeless or without income. Unrest remained and bandits (some of them claiming affiliation with the Yellow Turbans) appeared in almost every district.Events Left out of the Main Article  This is a list of events left out of the main article (\"The Battle\"), because the sources used for this article do not give us a date of these events, thus they could not be implemented in the article.Post Jiazi Yellow Turbans  After the Yellow Turbans were crushed, bandits would emerge throughout the country and claim affiliation with the Yellow Turbans.

She was part of a marriage pact with Liu Bei, but later fled back to Wu.Biography  Lady Sun was the sister of Wu's first emperor, Sun Quan, and the only recorded daughter of Sun Jian and Lady Wu. Although history records no given name for Lady Sun (or her sisters) she is, in legends, commonly referred to by the name Sun Shang Xiang. She was a woman of strong personality as shown in events throughout her life. Fa Zheng\u2019s biography in Records of Three Kingdoms compares her courage and energy to that of her brothers.Marriage pact with Shu  In 209 A.D., she was given to Liu Bei in marriage as part of an alliance between Sun Quan and Liu Bei. At the time Lady Sun was a little over twenty years old and a woman of pleasant appearance and unique character, but as a result of the marriage she took general control over his household along with guardianship over his son and heir apparent, Liu Shan \u5289\u79aa. This is because both of Liu Bei\u2019s former wives, Lady Gan \u7518 and Lady Mi \u7cdc, had already died of natural causes. Because Lady Sun preferred to be accompanied by more than a hundred female attendants, all of whom were capable of bearing arms, whenever Liu Bei visited her he trembled for his life. They are not recorded as having had any children.Return to Wu  However, two years later in 211 A.D. the Sun-Liu alliance was badly weakened due to disputes over Jing Province. It was at this time, after being contacted by an agent from Wu, that Lady Sun returned to her brother\u2019s court. According to Zhao Yun\u2019s secundairy biography, the Zhao Yun biezhuan\u00a0\u8d99\u96f2\u5225\u50b3, Lady Sun attempted to take Liu Shan with her but was stopped by Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei \u5f35\u98db (who were presumably sent by Zhuge Liang). It was through heavy negotiations that Lady Sun surrendered the young heir to the two generals before she journeyed downriver to the Southlands. It is through this event that the marriage and alliance effectively ended.Family Notes Fact vs. Fiction Sources Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Lady Zhen \u7504\u6c0f  Lady Zhen (Zh\u0113n sh\u00ec \u7504\u6c0f) was the first wife of Wei emperor Cao Pi \u66f9\u4e15.

During the Jian'an period, the northern warlord Yuan Shao obtained her for his middle son Yuan Xi. The two married in about 198 A.D. Later, but probably before 200 A.D., Yuan Xi became Inspector of You province. The Lady Zhen, however, remained at Ye city to care for Yuan Xi's mother, the Lady Liu \u5289\u592b\u4eba.Meeting Cao Pi  The Lady Zhen was a kind and beautiful woman and was greatly favoured. When Cao Cao massacred Ye in 204 A.D., his son Cao Pi was with him. Yuan Shao was defeated at the Battle of Guandu in 200 A.D., and died in 202 A.D. After his death, his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang became involved in internecine struggles over their father's vast domain. Cao Cao played the two brothers off against each other and eventually conquered all of the Yuan's territory. In 204 A.D. he attacked Ye city, accompanied by his son Cao Pi. When the city wall was breached, Lady Liu and Lady Zhen sat together in the main hall of Yuan Shao's residence. Cao Pi entered the residence and saw the two ladies. Lady Zhen was terrified and put her hand on the lap of her mother-in-law. Lady Liu instinctively held her with her hands. Cao Pi said: When the Lady Liu did what she was asked, Cao Pi approached the lady Zhen and looked at her. Seeing that she was of extraordinary beauty, he sang her praises. Later Cao Cao brought her back as Cao Pi's wife, after he learned how he felt for her.Meeting Cao Pi - Another theory  There is a slightly different theory on the first meeting between the Lady Zhen and Cao Pi. When Cao Cao subjugated Ye city, Cao Pi was first to enter Yuan Shang's compound. Behind the Lady Liu there was a woman with dishevelled hair and a dirty face shedding tears. Cao Pi asked about her and Lady Liu replied: She then turned around to gather the woman's hair and rubbed her face with a kerchief. Her good looks were matchless. When the Lady Liu was finished, she said to the Lady Zhen: She was taken in marriage and was favoured. The two theories are a little different, but agree on the main points; Cao Pi enters the compound, finds the Lady Zhen behind the Lady Liu and is stunned by her beauty, later marrying her. In the Qunshu zhiyao Cao Pi himself tells about his stay at the compound:Marriage to Cao Pi  Eight months later, she gave birth to Cao Rui -- leading to incessant gossip that Cao Rui was actually biologically Yuan Xi's son, not Cao Pi's, although that appeared to be rather unlikely given that Yuan Xi had been away from Ye city for quite some time before the marriage. As wife of Cao Pi the Lady Zhen was admired for her kindly nature and for her devotion to her mother-in-law, the Lady Bian. However, a woman named Guo N\u00fcwang used the rumours of Cao Rui being Yuan Xi's son to increase tension between the Lady Zhen and Cao Pi.Death  On 11 December 220 A.D., Cao Pi ascended the throne as Emperor Wen of Wei and afterwards he was presented with two daughters from the Duke of Shangyang, the former Emperor Xian, in marriage to the Wei ruling house.. He set up his capital in Luoyang, but did not summon the Lady Zhen from Ye to join him. The two daughters, together with the Lady Guo N\u00fcwang and the Honourable Ladies Li and Yin were all loved and favoured. This increasingly discouraged the Lady Zhen and made her quarrelsome. On 4 August 221 A.D., Cao Pi sent an envoy to order her to commit suicide. She was buried in Ye city. After the Lady Zhen's death, the Lady Guo, who later became empress, suggested that she should buried with her dishevelled hair covering her face and her mouth filled with chaff - so that even after her death she would be unable to complain.Later Developments  After 226 A.D. Guo N\u00fcwang was made Empress-Dowager. In 227 A.D., after Cao Rui had become emperor, the Lady Zhen was granted posthumous title as empress and great favour was shown to her family. Guo N\u00fcwang, his adoptive mother, was made Empress-Dowager, but in 235 A.D. she died under controversial circumstances. Cao Rui had questioned the role she had played in his mother's death and according to some rumours he might have been involved in Empress-Dowager Guo's death in some way. It is said she died of anxiety. When she was buried, she was buried the same way as Lady Zhen; her dishevelled hair covering her face and her mouth filled with chaff.See Also Family Notes References Sources Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Romance of the Three Kingdoms XII Artwork Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Sun Jian \u5b6b\u5805  Sun Jian \u5b6b\u5805 was born the son of a merchant, however, after some early military success he was promoted to a post of some importance. He played an active role in the Yellow Turban Campaign where he once again excelled and was promoted to the rank of Marquis. When a campaign was called against the warlord Dong Zhuo, Sun Jian joined the powerful Yuan Shu and was one of the few military officers to score a success against Dong\u2019s forces. After the coalition went their separate ways, Sun Jian stayed as a subordinate of Yuan Shu\u2019s and died in a campaign against the governor Liu Biao. He left behind a wife (Lady Wu), four sons (Sun Ce, Sun Quan, Sun Yi, and Sun Kuang) a legitimate daughter (Lady Sun) and one illegitimate daughter (Lady Sun-better known as Sun Shang Xiang). According to legend he is a descendant of the legendary Sun Tzu, author of \u2018The Art of War\u2019.Biography  The Sun family had long lived in Fuchun \u5bcc\u6625 county in Wu commandery and had burial grounds east of the city for their family. Repeatedly strange lights and auroras were seen other the graves rising up into the heavens and stretching for several li. The people all went to examine the strange signs, the elders thought it to be an extraordinary omen and that it meant the Sun clan would prosper. When Sun Jian's mother was pregnant with him, she dreamt that her intestines burst forth from her body and encircled the Chang \u660c Gate of Wu. She awoke and was fearful, she rushed to her neighbours mother and asked her thoughts on the dream. She said: After Sun Jian was born, he was noted as not being of ordinary appearance; and he was generous and distinguished by nature, and liked proper conduct.Early Career  While it is yet to be proven that his father was a merchant there is folklore to support the theory. Such as the saying \u2018Sun Zhong offers melons\u2019 (Sun Zhong being his father). Whether it is true or not is unimportant as he still secured a job as a county official \u2018li\u2019 at the age of 15 or 16. At age 16, Sun Jian was travelling with his father to Qiantang \u9322\u5510 by boat. It happened that at that time the pirate Hu Yu \u80e1\u7389 and his associates were plundering merchants of their property, and at that time they were on the river bank distributing their spoils. All of the travellers had stopped, and none dared to risk the journey. Sun Jian said to his father: But his father said: But Sun Jian ignored him and went anyway, he clutched his sword and climbed the river bank, he gestured east and west as though he were giving orders to divisions of soldiers behind him so as to establish a dragnet around the pirates. The pirates saw Sun Jian's behaviour and thought there must be government soldiers coming to arrest them, they immediately cast aside their stolen loot and scattered. Despite being alone, Sun Jian went in pursuit and only returned after having beheaded one of them. Sun Jian's father was incredibly surprised. Due to his actions here, Sun Jian's illustrious reputation began to spread and the county offices summoned him and installed him as a county commandant.Lady Wu  The future wife of Sun Jian, Lady Wu \u5433\u592b\u4eba, was orphaned young, and so she left Wu and, with her younger brother Wu Jing \u5433\u666f, went to live with relatives in Qiantang. Sun Jian heard of her talent and beauty and desired to take her as his wife. However, her relatives of the Wu clan, presumedly of higher status than the Sun clan, objected to the marriage on the grounds that Sun Jian was not accomplished and crafty. Sun Jian was humiliated and resentful, but Lady Wu said to her relatives: And she managed to convince her family to take the chance on marrying Sun Jian. With whom she would bear four sons and one daughter. Xu Chang \u8a31\u660c of Kuaiji \u6703\u7a3d was a heretical rebel who rose up in Juzhang \u53e5\u7ae0, he proclaimed himself Emperor of the Brightness of Yang and his father King of Yue. With his son, Xu Shao \u8a31\u97f6, he incited several commanderies to action and soon had several tens of thousands of people up in arms. At this time, Sun Jian was serving the commandery as a Major. He recruited over 1,000 elite and valiant men and together they joined the provincial forces and put down the rebellion. Sun Jian's exploits garnered the attention of Inspector of Yang Province Zang Min \u81e7\u65fb, who passed them on and soon and official decree appointed Sun Jian as an Assistant in Yandu \u9e7d\u7006 county. After a few years he moved to Xuyi \u76f1\u7719 county to serve as an Assistant there, and then later he moved to Xiapi \u4e0b\u90b3 county to serve there in the same capacity. Wherever Sun Jian was stationed, Sun Jian garnered the praise of the officials and populace, and they were all close to him. And at each place he was stationed, old friends from his hometown and youths looking for opportunities would flock to Sun Jian, always several hundred in number. Sun Jian would receive and entertain and support them as if they were his sons or younger brothers.Yellow Turban Campaign  In 184 A.D., Zhang Jue \u5f35\u89d2, the self-proclaimed Lord of Heaven General and commander of the Yellow Turban rebels rose up in Wei commandery. He dispatched eight envoys across the kingdom in order to spread his teachings to the masses, while secretly they planned anarchist events. On a single day they all sprung into action, burning down commandery and county offices and murdering senior government officials. The Han government dispatched General of Chariots and Cavalry Huangfu Song \u7687\u752b\u5d69 and General of the Gentlemen of the Household Zhu Jun \u6731\u5101 to take control of the army and put down their rebellion. Sun Jian's past exploits must have resulted in some renown because Zhu Jun requested that Sun Jian be appointed as his Associate Major in the Army. Sun Jian left his family at Shouchun \u58fd\u6625 and responded to the summons. The old friends and youths whom flocked to Sun Jian all willingly followed him to join the government forces. Sun Jian also managed to enlist various merchants and troops from along the Huai and Si rivers, adding a further 1,000 men. Sun Jian joined up with Zhu Jun and fought the Yellow Turbans to the full extent of his power, wherever he went, none could withstand him. Sun Jian took advantage of the allied forces' momentum to push deeply into Xihua. However, he was wounded in battle and fell from his horse into some long grass. His forces scattered and fled back to their camp, none knew where Sun Jian was. The piebald horse Sun Jian had been riding galloped back to the camp, it pawed at the ground and cried out. The officers and soldiers followed the horse back to where Sun Jian had fallen and brought him back to camp. About a month later, Sun Jian's wounds had sufficiently recovered and he returned to the battlefield. Huangfu Song was sent against the Yellow Turbans in Dong commandery while Zhu Jun was sent against those in Nanyang \u5357\u967d. The Yellow Turban forces, numbering over 10,000, under the command of Han Zhong \u97d3\u5fe0 were occupying Wan \u5b9b city. Zhu Jun had 18,000 men under his command, but he didn't really have enough soldiers to successfully assault the city and they had already been there for over two months. Zhu Jun had the majority of his forces at the southwestern side of the city and had them vigourously beat drums in order to feign an attack, meanwhile, with the enemy forces all focused on the southwest, Zhu Jun took command of 5,000 elite troops at the northeastern flank ready to climb the city walls. Sun Jian led the charge on the city walls and was the first over, his forces following him like ants. Having breached the city, Han Zhong's forces were easily beaten and he was forced to surrender. Zhu Jun reported Sun Jian's conduct and he was promoted to Major with a Separate Command.Rebellion to the North  The peace did not last long and soon Bian Zhang \u908a\u7ae0 and Han Sui \u97d3\u9042 were making disorder in Liang Province. Towards the end of 185 A.D., Zhang Wen \u5f35\u6eab was appointed General of Chariots and Cavalry and dispatched westward to deal with them. Zhang Wen also requested that Sun Jian be his Advisor to the Army and they garrisoned at Chang'an \u9577\u5b89. General Who Smashes the Caitiffs Dong Zhuo \u8463\u5353 and General Who Terrifies Criminals Zhou Shen \u5468\u614e, also under the command of Zhang Wen, along with a further 10,000 soldiers, all garrisoned at Meiyang \u7f8e\u967d. Bian Zhang and Han Sui advanced on their position but no ground was gained either way. At some point, Zhang Wen summoned Dong Zhuo, but Dong Zhuo took a long time to respond to the summons, and when Zhang Wen chastised him over this, Dong Zhuo was not contrite in his response. Sun Jian was in attendance with Zhang Wen at this time. With both the recent failure to defeat the enemy and Dong Zhuo's attitude on his mind, Sun Jian wanted Dong Zhuo executed as an example to the men, he came forward and whispered to Zhang Wen: But Zhang Wen replied to him: To which Sun Jian replied: But Zhang Wen did not have the heart to carry out this sentence so he said: Sun Jian then rose and went out. Despite Sun Jian's reservations about Dong Zhuo, he soon scored an impressive victory against Bian Zhang and Han Sui and beheaded several 1,000 men. Defeated, Bian Zhang and Han Sui fled to Yuzhong \u6986\u4e2d city. Dong Zhuo wanted to take a contingent and sever the enemy's supply lines, but Zhang Wen instead sent him to attack the Qiang of Xianling \u5148\u96f6. Zhang Wen assigned Zhou Shen 30,000 soldiers and sent him in pursuit of the enemy. Zhou Shen wanted to assault the city, but Sun Jian said to him: However, Zhou Shen did not listen to Sun Jian's advice and assailed the city himself. Zhou Shen hurriedly sent an envoy to Zhang Wen requesting he come too, while Zhou Shen's forces fought from dawn till dusk. Zhou Shen managed to destroy part of the city's outer walls, but Han Sui and Bian Zhang managed to flee. However, they doubled back and struck at Zhou Shen's supply lines. Panicked, Zhou Shen abandoned his baggage train and fled the field.Duties in Changsha  Sun Jian was later conferred the rank of Gentleman-Consultant. At that time, Ou Xing \u5340\u661f of Changsha \u9577\u6c99 titled himself a General. He had managed to rally over 10,000 men to him and they had begun attacking and besieging cities. Thereupon, Sun Jian was appointed Grand Administrator of Changsha and sent to deal with him. Sun Jian arrived at Changsha and personally saw to commanding the soldiers and establishing battle plans; and within 10 days to a month, he had managed to overcome and defeat Ou Xing and his followers. Those within the commandery quickly submitted to Sun Jian, and he in turn employed competent and good officials. He wrote an official order saying: Mountain bandits Zhou Chao \u5468\u671d and Guo Shi \u90ed\u77f3 rose up in Lingling \u96f6\u9675 and Guiyang \u6842\u967d, and they both joined Ou Xing. Despite not having authority to cross commandery borders, Sun Jian sought out the bandits anyway and finished them off. Some time around November Guan Hu \u89c0\u9d60 from Lingling proclaimed himself 'General Who Pacifies Heaven' and invaded Guiyang, and Sun Jian attacked and killed him too. At that time, Grand Administrator of Lujiang Lu Kang's \u9678\u5eb7 nephew, the Chief of Yichun \u5b9c\u6625, was being attacked by bandits and he sent an envoy to Sun Jian to request aid. Sun Jian assembled his forces to assist him, but Sun Jian's Reigstrar admonished him for overstepping his authority. But Sun Jian said to him: Thereupon he advanced his forces. Hearing Sun Jian was coming the bandits fled. Through Sun Jian's actions, Changsha and its two neighbouring commanderies were settled. The Han court recorded Sun Jian's achievements from start to finish and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Wucheng \u70cf\u7a0b.The War Against Dong Zhuo  On the 13th of May 189 A.D., Emperor Ling \u9748\u5e1d died. Dong Zhuo had all but assumed control in the capital and the young Emperor Xian had been reduced to a figurehead; Dong Zhuo's oppressive and barbaric actions had resulted in numerous warlords raising soldiers in order to oust him. When Sun Jian heard, he sighed and said: In 191 A.D., Sun Jian also raised loyal soldiers and headed north. On his way he encountered Inspector of Jing Province Wang Rui \u738b\u53e1. Wang Rui had first encountered Sun Jian several years previous during the business with the bandits of Lingling and Guiyang, Wang Rui considered Sun Jian to be no more than a military man and not suitable for civil administration. At this time, Wang Rui also raised soldiers to attack Dong Zhuo, but in the past had issue with Grand Administrator of Wuling \u6b66\u9675 Cao Yin \u66f9\u5bc5 and planned to kill him. Cao Yin was dreading this so he forged a dispatch and had a man pretend to be an emissary for the Imperial Household Grandee in order to sway Sun Jian. It admonished Wang Wui's faults and ordered that he be arrested and face punishment. Sun Jian immediately assumed the dispatch was genuine and forced his soldiers to raid Wang Rui's position. Wang Rui heard the approach of soldiers and climbed a tower to see them, he dispatched someone to ask what they wanted and why they were there. Sun Jian's advance division said: Wang Rui was confused and said: So Wang Rui opened up his storehouses and inspected their contents himself to ascertain whether compensation had been given, however he realised that it had been. He went back to the tower and saw Sun Jian approaching, alarmed he said: Sun Jian said: Wang Rui said: Sun Jian said: Wang Rui knew he had no more options so he scraped gold, drank it, and died. On reaching Nanyang \u5357\u967d, Sun Jian's forces had expanded to several tens of thousand thanks to annexing those belonging to Wang Rui. Sun Jian requested military provisions for his army from Grand Administrator of Nanyang Zhang Zi \u5f35\u54a8, but Zhang Zi was advised: However, because Zhang Zi did not supply military provisions to Sun Jian, Sun Jian killed him. As for the exact circumstances around Zhang Zi's death, there are two accounts, one recorded in Sun Jian's SGZ and another in the Progress of Wu which is cited in the SGZ. According to Sun Jian's SGZ: Sun Jian presented alcohol and cattle to Zhang Zi as a sign of courtesy and the next day, Zhang Zi responded by visiting Sun Jian. They were drinking merrily when Sun Jian's Registrar entered and informed Sun Jian that nothing had been provided for the army and that the roads had not been maintained. Zhang Zi wanted to flee but he was surrounded and summarily executed by the camp's gate under military law. And from that point forward all Sun Jian's requests were met. According to Wu li (Progress of Wu): Zhang Zi refused to meet Sun Jian. Sun Jian desired to advance his soldiers but was afraid Zhang Zi would become a threat to his rear so wanted to deal with him. Sun Jian feigned illness and his army was shaking with fear. To perpetuate his ruse and make him seem desperate, he invited a shaman to cure him and offered sacrifices to the hills and rivers. Sun Jian dispatched some relatives to convince Zhang Zi of his plight, they said his illness was distressing and he desired to hand over his soldiers to Zhang Zi. Zhang Zi couldn't resist the bait and immediately lead 500-600 footmen and cavalry to Sun Jian's camp in order to acquire them. Sun Jian continued feigning illness in order to meet with Zhang Zi, however as soon as Zhang Zi attended him, Sun Jian jumped up, grabbed his sword, condemned Zhang Zi, and finally, beheaded him. Sun Jian continued north to Luyang \u9b6f\u967d to serve under General of the Rear Yuan Shu \u8881\u8853. With the death of Zhang Zi, Yuan Shu assumed the position of Grand Administrator of Nanyang and began occupation of the land. Yuan Shu recommended Sun Jian as Acting General Who Smashes Caitiffs and Inspector of Yu Province, and had him command the soldiers of Jing and Yu province from Luyang. Responsibility of the province and supply chains was given to Gongchou Cheng \u516c\u4ec7\u7a31 and he was set back to oversee them. Before he left, a tent was set up outside the eastern city gate and a banquet prepared for Gongchou Cheng, attended by many of the junior officers. Dong Zhuo had begun dispatching his officers to plunder and take prisoners from the surrounding regions, several tens of thousand were heading Sun Jian's way. As the banquet was under way, several dozen scouts arrived. Sun Jian continued drinking, chatting and laughing, but sent an official order that his retainers should marshal the troops but have them remain in formation and not do anything reckless. As more of Dong Zhuo's troops arrived, Sun Jian slowly got out of his seat and guided the soldiers back into the city; he then explained his actions to his attendants: Dong Zhuo's soldiers saw how disciplined Sun Jian's forces were and did not dare attack the city, thus they withdrew.  Sun Jian then advanced his camp east of Liang \u6881 county. There, he encountered one of Dong Zhuo's officers, Xu Rong \u5f90\u69ae, whom dealt a severe blow to Sun Jian's forces. Sun Jian's forces were routed and he only had a mere handful of cavaliers accompanying him. Sun Jian was known to wear a red, woolen cap, thus he shed his cap and ordered one of his officers, Zu Mao \u7956\u8302, to wear it and draw off the pursuers. Xu Rong's cavalry vied with one another in pursuit of Zu Mao whilst Sun Jian was able to quietly head down a sideroad and find freedom. Zu Mao was stranded and distressed, but he put the cap upon a grave stone and then set fire to a post before concealing himself within some long grass. Xu Rong's cavalry were drawn to the burning post and several layers of men encircled the area, slowly advancing on Zu Mao. However, as they got closer they realised what it was and called off the hunt. Whilst Zu Mao found freedom, others were less fortunate. The Grand Administrator of Yingchuan \u6f41\u5ddd Li Min \u674e\u65fb was captured and boiled alive and others were bound with cloth and thrown before Dong Zhuo and Dong Zhuo killed them by pouring boiling lard over them. And by the second month, despite the defeat, Sun Jian collected his scattered forces and managed to garrison Yangren \u967d\u4eba. There, he was attacked by two more of Dong Zhuo's officers, Grand Administrator of Chen \u9673 commandery Hu Zhen \u80e1\u8eeb and Commandant of Cavalry L\u00fc Bu \u5442\u5e03, along with the 5,000 footmen and cavalry under their command. Hu Zhen was to serve as the chief commander and protector of the army while L\u00fc Bu oversaw the cavalry. However, Hu Zhen was disliked by his subordinates and they planned to sabotage him. L\u00fc Bu first convinced Hu Zhen that enemy forces had left the city and that they should forced-march the troops so they could catch them. They advanced by night, but Sun Jian's forces had already prepared defences so they couldn't even raid the city. The soldiers were starving, thirsty and fatigued, so they took off their armour and took a rest. L\u00fc Bu then panicked the troops by crying out that the enemy was coming. Dong Zhuo's forces had not even prepared fortifications or a moat so they were very panicked and rushing all about, abandoning their armour and leaving their horses. Seeing the disarray in the enemy ranks, Sun Jian struck and routed them, in the process killing Dong Zhuo's Chief Controller, Hua Xiong \u83ef\u96c4. At that time, someone tried to sow discord between Sun Jian and Yuan Shu by convincing Yuan Shu that Sun Jian could become a greater threat than Dong Zhuo ever was, saying: Yuan Shu seemed swayed by their words and suspicious of Sun Jian, hence he stopped sending military provisions. Yuan Shu was still in Luyang at this time, but Sun Jian rode the 50 km expanse throughout the night in order to visit Yuan Shu. Sun Jian drew his stratagem on the ground and said: Yuan Shu was embarrassed by his actions and immediately re-established the supply lines. Dong Zhuo dreaded how fierce and strong Sun Jian was so around this time he also dispatched General Li Jue \u674e\u5095 to try and establish an alliance with Sun Jian. He promised to recommend Sun Jian's family members for positions as Inspectors and Grand Administrators. Sun Jian replied: Despite threatening his clan, Sun Jian allowed Li Jue to leave unscathed. With his supplies secured and his position firmly stated, Sun Jian continued to Dagu \u5927\u8c37 Pass. Dong Zhuo himself came out and did battle with Sun Jian amid the various mausoleums of the past Emperors, Dong Zhuo was defeated and he fled back to Mianchi \u9efd\u6c60. Sun Jian continued to push forward to the city and entered through the Xuanyang \u5ba3\u967d city gate; there, he met L\u00fc Bu's forces and put him to flight as well. Despite having reached the capital, it was a hollow victory. Feeling the pressure from the east, Dong Zhuo had decided to resituate the capital to Chang'an \u9577\u5b89. He pillaged the people, plundered the graves of the Emperors and set fire to everything he couldn't bring with him; Luoyang was bare and devoid of life; for more than 100 km it was a wasteland, there were no signs of habitation. Sun Jian was forlorn and wept when he saw the desolation. He then proceeded to sweep up the ruined ancestral temples and halls, closed up those that Dong Zhuo had disentombed, and offered a sacrifice. Sun Jian then sent a detachment out the Hangu Pass \u51fd\u8c37\u95dc to the area between Xin'an \u65b0\u5b89 and Mianchi in order to threaten Dong Zhuo's rear. Dong Zhuo then stationed his various generals at various locations west of Luoyang to continue resisting the forces from the east. Dong Zhuo spoke to Chief Clerk Liu Ai \u5289\u827e regarding Sun Jian: But Liu Ai said: Dong Zhuo then said: Sun Jian had camped his forces by some offices south of the city where there was a well from which to draw water. At dawn, a rainbow burst forth from the well; the army was alarmed and bewildered by the event and no one dared water from the well. Sun Jian ordered a man descend into the well and he uncovered the Han Great Seal of State. However, with all the chaos in the imperial court, Sun Jian's commander, Yuan Shu, desired to supplant the Emperor. Having heard that Sun Jian had recovered the Great Seal of State, Yuan Shu thought it would lend some credibility to his ambition, so he held Sun Jian's wife hostage as a way to coerce him into handing over the seal.Feud of the Yuans  With the capital desolate, Sun Jian withdrew back to Luyang. Unfortunately, the campaign against Dong Zhuo wouldn't go any further. The noble intentions behind the allied forces had begun to dissipate as Dong Zhuo seemed farther out of reach in Chang'an and many of the other warlords seemed uninterested in putting the effort into pursuing him. Instead, the warlords begun focusing on gathering allies and seizing territory in an effort to improve their own power bases; and as Yuan Shu planned to usurp the imperial title, Yuan Shao tried to convince Liu Yu \u5289\u865e to become Emperor. The complete breakdown in the alliance occurred when Yuan Shao thought to take advantage of the turmoil by dispatching his officer Zhou Xin \u5468\u6615 to take Yu Province, which had been promised to Sun Jian by Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu was furious, he struck Zhou Xin and put him to flight. Relations began to worsen between the two Yuans as, in a letter establishing a alliance with Gongsun Zan \u516c\u5b6b\u74da, Yuan Shu called Yuan Shao not a true Yuan and merely a family slave. Yuan Shu's disparaging remarks found their way to Yuan Shao who was understandably furious. Sun Jian was at that time garrisoned at Yangcheng \u967d\u57ce so as to resist Dong Zhuo, so in retaliation to Yuan Shu's comments, Yuan Shao dispatched his officer Zhou Ang \u5468\u6602 and his brother Zhou Xin \u5468\u6615 to steal Sun Jian's territory. Sun Jian sighed and said to his men: Gongsun Zan also sent his cousin Gongsun Yue \u516c\u5b6b\u8d8a with a small contingent of cavalry to assist Sun Jian, but during the fight Gongsun Yue was shot and killed. This effectively ended the alliance against Dong Zhuo. With the two Yuans at one another's throats, battle lines started being drawn up; Gongsun Zan blamed Yuan Shao for the death of his cousin and allied with Yuan Shu. With Gongsun Zan to his north and Yuan Shu to his south, Yuan Shao was forced to ally with Inspector of Jing Province Liu Biao \u5289\u8868 who was south of Yuan Shu.Battle of Xiangyang  In 192 A.D., Yuan Shu dispatched Sun Jian south to attack Liu Biao. Liu Biao responded by dispatching his officer, Huang Zu \u9ec3\u7956, north of the Han river between Fan \u6a0a and Deng \u9127. Sun Jian struck Huang Zu's forces and then pursued him south across the river to Xiangyang \u8944\u967d city. While Xiangyang was still being besieged, Sun Jian hunted some of Liu Biao's forces who were in the Xian hills \u5cf4\u5c71; unfortunately, caught in a night-time melee, Sun Jian was shot and killed by an arrow. He died aged 36. The exact reason as to why Sun Jian was in the Xian hills is not clear and each source seems to tell a different story. According to Dianl\u00fce: Liu Biao had sent Huang Zu out by night to try and catch Sun Jian unawares, but this failed and Sun Jian capitalised on his momentum by pursuing Huang Zu into the Xian hills. But Huang Zu's forces had secreted themselves inside a bamboo grove and ambushed Sun Jian. According to Records of Heroes and Champions: One of Liu Biao's officers was in the Xian hills outside the encirclement of Xiangyang. Sun Jian took a contingent of light cavalry to attack them and the soldiers threw down rocks upon Sun Jian's forces, killing Sun Jian.Legacy of Sun Jian  With Sun Jian's death, his forces withdrew from Jing province and Sun Jian's nephew, Sun Ben \u5b6b\u8cc1, took command of his forces. Sun Jian's sons would go on to establish and strengthen the kingdom of Wu; and when Sun Quan took the imperial title for himself, Sun Jian was posthumously titled 'Ardent Martial Emperor'. Sun Jian was also considered the 'First Ancestor' of Wu.Family  Ancestor Wife Sons DaughterNotes Fact vs. Fiction  Historically...Sources External links Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Chibi MMO Artwork  The category to store Artwork for the MMO Chibi.Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Zhao Yun \u8d99\u96f2  Zhao Yun \u8d99\u96f2 was a general of Liu Bei and played a great part in the establishment of Shu-Han.

During the time when Liu Bei was pursued by Cao Cao\u2019s forces at Dangyang Changban, Liu Bei abandoned his wife and child to flee south. Zhao Yun carried the young child, who was Liu Shan and also protected Lady Gan, the mother of Liu Shan, hence all of them were able to escape the dangers. Zhao Yun was later appointed as YaMen JiangJun (General of the Standard). While Liu Bei entered the Shu region, Zhao Yun remained in Jingzhou.Family Notes Fact vs. Fiction  Historically\u2026References Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Xiao Qiao \u5c0f\u55ac  Lady Qiao \u55ac, or perhaps more famously known under her Koei alias Xiao Qiao \u5c0f\u55ac, is a woman renowned for her peerless beauty. She was born as the daughter of Qiao Xuan and later married Zhou Yu, famous strategist of Wu.Biography  Xiao Qiao, along with her older sister Da Qiao \u5927\u55ac, were born in Lujiang as the daughters of Qiao Xuan, a high official of Eastern Han. As Xiao Qiao grew into adulthood, she became a very attractive woman and she would eventually be remembered as one of the greater beauties of ancient China. During Sun Ce's conquest of Wu territory, at Wan, she met Sun Ce and Zhou Yu. Sun Ce kept her older sister for himself and gave Xiao Qiao to Zhou Yu. The two would eventually marry and give birth to two sons; Zhou Xun and Zhou Yin. In the year 210 A.D., Zhou Yu fell ill and died. What happened to Xiao Qiao after this is not known.Family Notes Fact vs. Fiction Sources Gongjin's Campaign Memorials Campaign against Dong Zhuo  The Campaign against Dong Zhuo (D\u01d2ng Zhu\u00f3 t\u01ceof\u00e1 zh\u00e0n \u8463\u5353\u8a0e\u4f10\u6230) was a battle fought between the forces of Dong Zhuo and the Guandong Coalition, led by Yuan Shao. After the Regular Attendants battle, Dong Zhuo managed to set Liu Xie upon the throne and used him as a puppet. The Guandong Coalition was formed to stop him.The Battle  Turmoil did not cease, following Han victories in the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Eunuch massacre. The General-in-Chief He Jin \u4f55\u9032 had summoned Dong Zhuo \u8463\u5353 to aid him in his struggle against Zhang Rang and The Regular Attendants, despite warnings of Dong Zhuo being cruel and having no honour.Dong Zhuo's Ambitions  Dong Zhuo arrived shortly after the eunuchs were slaughtered and Zhang Rang and followers had drowned themselves in the Yellow River. When Emperor Shao suddenly saw Dong Zhuo appear at Bowang slope, he became frightened and cried. The Excellencies who were with Dong Zhuo said to him: \"There is an imperial order to withdraw troops.\" Dong Zhuo replied: \"You may be high ministers of state, but you could not keep the royal house in order and you have made the Emperor a homeless wanderer. What is this about withdrawing troops?\" Dong Zhuo went to speak with the Emperor and asked him what had happened, but he gained no clear answer. He then asked the Emperors younger brother, Liu Xie, about the events. Liu Xie told him everything that happened and nothing was left. This impressed Dong Zhuo and since he had been brought up by the Empress-Dowager Dong, and since Dong Zhuo himself claimed to be of the same clan as the Empress-Dowager, he took it in mind to depose the Emperor and set up the King. On this day, September the 25th, the Emperor returned to the palace. There was an amnesty for the empire and the reign-title Guangxi was renamed Zhaoning. The Imperial Seal was lust during the eunuch slaying. All six other seals were recovered. Following the Emperor's return to the Imperial Capital Ding Yuan was made Bearer of the Gilded Mace. Bao Xin, the Chief Commandant of Cavalry, had lately returned from raising troops in Taishan. He talked with Yuan Shao about Dong Zhuo and said: \"Dong Zhuo has a strong army and will be inclined to rebellion. Unless you take precautions you will certainly fall into his hands. Now that he has just arrived, his men will be weary and exhausted. If you attack him by surprise, you can take him.\" However, Yuan Shao was afraid of Dong Zhuo and he did not dare to act against him. Bao Xin therefore returned to Taishan. Dong Zhuo, a while later, reached the capital. With him were only 3.000 foot-soldiers and horsemen and he thought this might be too few to gain any respect. Therefore, in the first few days after his arrival, Dong Zhuo had his men go out quietly each night to camp nearby, returning at dawn in great array of flags and drums to look as if more troops had come from the west. For some reason, nobody in Luoyang ever saw through this trick. In a short time, He Jin and He Miao's troops, who were leaderless since their generals' deaths, turned to Dong Zhuo.Acquiring Ding Yuan's Master of Records  Ding Yuan had one man he greatly trusted, the Master of Records L\u00fc Bu, nicknamed \"The Flying General\". He was a man from Jiuyuan in Wuyuan Commandery, an adept archer and rider and unmatched in arm strength. In secret, Dong Zhuo arranged for L\u00fc Bu to murder Ding Yuan and take over his forces. L\u00fc Bu followed through, killed Ding Yuan and went to Dong Zhuo with his former leaders' head. At arrival, L\u00fc Bu was bestowed with the title Chief Commander of the Cavalry by Dong Zhuo. Being so fond of each other, L\u00fc Bu and Dong Zhuo also swore to be as father and son. With L\u00fc Bu and Ding Yuan's forces enlisted, Dong Zhuo's army became much stronger. Then, on grounds that it had been raining a long time, Dong Zhuo criticised the Minister of Works Liu Hong before the court, implying that he should be dismissed. The order was duly issued, and Dong Zhuo took the vacant post. Dong Zhuo also summoned Cai Yong. Cai Yong had lived in exile near the Yangzi and the sea for twelve years after the Grand Administrator of Wuyuan, Wang Zhi, reported that Cai Yong had insulted the court. When Cai Yong received Dong Zhuo's summons, he pretended to be ill and would not come. An angered Dong Zhuo threatened: \"I can destroy a man's clan\". Cai Yang, now afraid, obeyed the order. When he arrived he received provisional appointment as Libationer in the offices of the Minister of Works. He was graded First Class, and in the space of three days he passed through all Three Terraces, and was then made a Palace Attendant.Dong Zhuo's Plan  Sometime after this, Dong Zhuo talked to Yuan Shao about the Emperor: He drew his own sword from his belt, gave a curt salute, and went out. Dong Zhuo did not dare to harm Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao came from an esteemed family and Dong himself had only just taken some power. Yuan Shao hung his insignia of office on the Upper East Gate and fled to Ji province. In September of 189 A.D., day 27, Dong Zhuo called a great assembly of the officials. He raised his head and said: \"The Emperor is ignorant and weak. He is not capable of maintaining the imperial temples nor acting as master of the empire. I intend to follow the examples of Yi Yin and Huo Guang, and set [Liu Xie] the King of Chenliu upon the imperial throne. What is your opinion?\" All the present Excellencies, ministers and men of lower rank were frightened and confused. They didn't dare to speak against Dong Zhuo, who then continued: \"In former times, when Huo Guang settled policy, Tian Yannian held the sword. Anyone who seeks to impede the grand design will be dealt with by military law.\" All those who were present were shaken. Only Lu Zhi, the Master of Writing, said: \"In former times, Taijia held position but lacked understanding, and the faults of [the King of] Changyi were more than a thousand, so there were reasons for the depositions. Our present Emperor, however, is rich in years, and his actions have shown no lack of virtue. There is no parallel with the past.\" Dong Zhuo was furious, left his seat and wanted to kill Lu Zhi. Cai Yong pleaded for him and Peng Bo also argued \"Master of Writing Lu is a leading scholar of the empire. People look up to him. If you harm him, the whole country will be disturbed.\" Dong Zhuo stopped and got a hold of himself and did no more then simply dismiss the Master of Writing. Lu Zhi, however, left Luoyang and fled to Shanggu, where he lived in seclusion. The next day, the 28th of September, Dong Zhuo again summoned all officials for an assembly. This time, at the front apartments of the Hall of Exalted Virtue. This time Dong Zhuo compelled the Empress-Dowager to issue an edict dismissing the Little Emperor: \"In mourning, the Emperor lacked the feelings of a true son, while his dignity and conduct are unworthy of a ruler. We now depose him to be King of Hongnong and we establish Liu Xie, King of Chenliu, as Emperor.\" After this, Yuan Wei, uncle of Yuan Shao, removed the Emperor's seal and ribbon and presented them to the King of Chenliu, who was then escorted to the body of the hall and there he faced north to acknowledge himself as subject. The Empress-Dowager muffled her sobs and the ministers restrained their grief. No-one dared to speak. Dong Zhuo then announced: \"The Empress-Dowager made the Lady of the Palace of Perpetual Joy [the Empress-Dowager Dong] uneasy and miserable, and even caused her to die of grief. This is contrary to the proper behaviour of a daughter-in-law to a mother.\" He transferred the Empress-Dowager to the Palace of Perpetual Peace. Following these events, an amnesty for the empire was held and the reign-title changed from Zhaoning to Yong-Han.Following Liu Xie's Ascendancy  On 30 September 189 A.D., Dong Zhuo had the Empress-Dowager He killed by poison. When her burial ceremony was being held, the Excellencies, ministers and lower officials did not wear linen clothes, but simply wore white clothes, while the ceremony was carried out. Dong Zhuo also dug up the coffin of He Miao, took out the body, broke up the joints and left it on the side of a road. He killed He Miao's mother; the Lady of Wuyang, and threw her corpse into some brambles in a park. Following this was an edict which called for the sons and younger brothers of Excellencies, ministers and lower officials to be appointed as Gentlemen. By doing, replacing the eunuchs at the palace. 10 October 189 A.D.; Grand Commandant Liu Yu was appointed as Commander-in-Chief and enfeoffed as Marquis of Xiangfei. Dong Zhuo made himself Grand Commandant controlling the affairs of the General of the Van. He also took the Staff and Insignia, Battle-Axe, Ceremonial Axe and Gentlemen Rapid as Tigers, and changed his fief to become Marquis of Mei. On the 11th of October, Yang Biao, who Grand Palace Grandee at that time, was made Minister of Works. On 19 October Huang Wan, Governor of Yu province, was made Minister over the Masses. Dong Zhuo also ordered the Excellencies to present memorials to justify the actions of Chen Fan, Dou Wu and the men of Faction. Their titles and ranks were restored envoys were sent to offer mourning sacrifices to them, and their sons and grandsons were selected for office. In the winter, in the tenth month on 29 October they buried Empress-Dowager He of Emperor Ling. She was posthumously awarded with the title \"Thoughtful\" and was given the honour of burial with her late husband Emperor Ling. His tomb was named Mound of Accomplishment, hers within that complex, was called Mound of Accomplished Display During the same month, the Bobo bandits ravaged Hedong. Dong Zhuo sent his officer Niu Fu to take care of the matter. During the eleventh month Dong Zhuo was made Chancellor of State, with the right to perform obeisance without calling his own name, to enter court without hastening step, and to stand in the hall of audience with sword and shoes. In the twelfth month, 19 February 190 A.D.; Huang Wan, who had recently been made Minister over the Masses, was now made Grand Commandant and Yang Bao, the Minister of Works, became Minister over the Masses. Xun Shuang, the Superintendent of the Imperial Household, was now Minister of Works.Attempting To Gain Heart  Before these events, the Master of Writing; Zhou Bi of Wuwei and the Colonel of the City Gates; Wu Qiong of Runan had suggested an idea that would gain Dong Zhuo the hearts of the people. The idea was that Dong Zhuo should reform the government of Emperors Huan and Ling and appoint famous scholars to office. Dong Zhuo followed the advice. He commissioned the men Zhou Bi, Wu Qiong, Zheng Tai and He Rong to seek out the dishonest and wicked men and those who had been neglected unjustly in the past. Several people who had received no official rank were summoned. These men were: Xun Shuang, he was first appointed as Chancellor of Pingyuan, but while he was still on his way there, he was transferred to Wanling. There he became Superintendent of the Imperial Household, but after attending to the duties of that position for three days he was promoted to be Minister of Works. All-in-all, since his first summons it took ninety-three days to his appointment as an Excellency.\nChen Ji became General of the Gentlemen of the Household for All Purposes.\nHan Rong became Grand Herald. There was a fourth man, named Shentu Pan, who also received Dong Zhuo's summons. Unlike the other three men however, he dared to refuse the summons and simply laughed. Dong Zhuo tried, but could not compel him. Shentu Pan was an old man, over seventy years of age. He died of old age. Further appointments were made later on: Han Fu, who was Master of Writing at that time, became Governor of Ji province.\nLiu Dai, the Palace Attendant, became Inspector of Yen.\nKong Zhou of Chenliu was made Inspector of Yu.\nZhang Miao of Dongping was made Grand Administrator of Chenliu.\n And Zhang Zi of Yingchuan became Grand Administrator of Nanyang. Dong Zhuo's favourite men were appointed only as Generals of the Gentlemen of the Household, or Colonels and were not given important posts. An edict abolished the three reign-titles Guangxi, Zhaoning and Yong-Han, making the current year count as the sixth of Zhongping.Cruel Ambition  By nature, Dong Zhuo was a cruel and vindictive man. All of a sudden he came to supreme power and had control of all the arms and treasures of the empire. His authority shook the empire and his ambitions knew no limit. He said to his retainers: \"It is written on my countenance that I should gain the highest honours.\" The Attendant Imperial Clerk Raolong Zong went to Dong Zhuo to make a report, and he failed to take off his sword. He was immediately flogged to death. At this time in Luoyang the mansions of the nobility and the imperial relatives stood one beside the other, every house filled with treasure of gold and silk. Dong Zhuo let his soldiers loose to break into these buildings, to plunder the property and to force into marriage the wives and daughters of their families, regardless and unsparing of high position or connection to the throne. The spirits of the people were fallen in terror and there was no security from dawn to dusk.The Guandong Coalition  190 A.D. - in the first month all the provinces and commanderies east of the passes raised troops to attack Dong Zhuo. Yuan Shao, Grand Administrator of Bohai, was elected as leader of the covenant, named as The Guandong Coalition. He named himself General of Chariots and Cavalry, and his associates also awarded themselves temporary commissions. The coalition members spread themselves over several locations east of the passages. Each of these armies contained several ten thousand men. Eventually, most of these leaders turned against Yuan Shao. Bao Xin talked to Cao Cao about this and said: \"The ability to make plans is not common, and you are the only one who can end confusion and restore order. Though our forces may be strong we shall achieve nothing if the wrong man holds command. You, however, are like a sign from heaven.\" On March the 26th, Dong Zhuo had the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace Li Ru poison and kill Liu Bian the King of Hongnong after hearing one last song from his favourite concubine Tang Ji. Dong Zhuo was considering to attack east of the mountains with a great levy of troops, but his Master of Writing, Zheng Tai, said: \"Government lies in virtue, not in armies.\" Dong Zhuo was not pleased and replied: \"When you talk that way, do you mean that soldiers are useless?\" \"I did not mean that,\" replied Zheng Tai, \"but I do not believe there is any need to send a large army against the east of the mountains. \"You are a man from the western provinces, you commanded soldiers when you were still young, and you are well trained in the arts of war. Yuan Benchu [Yuan Shao] is a descendant of great officials. He was born at the capital and he has always lived there. Zhang Mengzhuo [Zhang Miao] is an old man from Dongping. All he knows is the right way to sit in halls of audience, not glancing to left or right. Kong Gongxu [Kong Zhou] has pure conversation and impressive talk, so eloquent he can bring withered things to life just by breathing on them. None of them, however, are any use in dealing with military matters, and now they have taken up arms against you they are simply not in your class. Those men, moreover, hold no authority from the Emperor, and their ranks are in complete disorder. Each will rely upon his own strength, and store up resources till he can assess the situation. They will never agree on plans or co-operate in attack.\" \"Besides this, east of the mountains there has long been peace and the people have no experience of war. West of the passes they have lately suffered the ravages of the Qiang barbarians, and even women and girls can carry a bow and fight. The men of Bing and Liang, and the barbarian auxiliaries, are feared throughout the empire, and they are your teeth and claws. It will be like driving tigers and rhinoceros against dogs and sheep, or calling up a violent wind to sweep away dead leaves. Who will dare oppose them?\" \"If, on the other hand, you make an unnecessary levy of troops to frighten the empire, then you will cause all the people who are afraid of being conscripted to collect together and rebel. You would be abandoning virtue to rely on force, and that way you would lose both authority and prestige.\" Dong Zhuo now accepted the argument.Plans To Shift The Capital  Because of the strength of the Guandong Coalition, Dong Zhuo had plans to shift the capital west. The Excellencies and officials disagreed with Dong Zhuo, but they didn't dare to speak against him. Dong Zhuo recommended that Zhu Jun, the Intendant of Henan, became Grand Coachman and act as his Assistant, but when a messenger brought these summons to office, Zhu Jun excused himself and refused to accept. He said: \"If the Emperor moves west, he will surely destroy the hopes of the empire, because he will be confirming the rift with the east of the mountains. I see no advantage in that.\" The messenger said: \"You were invited to take an appointment and you have turned it down. Nothing was said about shifting the capital, and yet you raise the matter. Why is this?\" Zhu Jun replied: \"Assistant to the Chancellor, that is not a position I am competent to fill. Shifting the capital is ill-considered, and that is something important. I excuse myself from what I cannot manage, and I speak of things that are important: that is the duty of a subject.\" Zhu Jun was not made Assistant. Dong Zhuo called a great assembly of the senior officials and said: \"Gaozu set the capital within the passes, and eleven generations later Guangwu made his palace at Luoyang. Now another eleven generations have passed. According to the Shibao prophecies we should shift the capital to Chang'an to follow the will of heaven and man.\" All the officials remained silent, except Yang Biao, the Minister over the Masses. A discussion ensued between the two men. Yang Biao said: \"To shift the capital and to change the laws are great affairs of the empire. In ancient times Pan'geng moved to Bo and the people of Yin all resented it. In former times, the land within the passes suffered from the ruin and destruction of Wang Mang, and so Guangwu changed the capital to the city of Luo.\" \"For many years the citizens have been at peace and contented here. If you now, without good reason, make plans to abandon the temples of the imperial clan and to leave the imperial tombs, then I am afraid the people will tremble in fear and there will surely be confusion like a boiling broth. The Shibao prophecies are superstitious, apocryphal works. How can you trust them?\" Dong Zhuo replied: \"The land within the passes is rich and abundant, and that is why Qin was able to conquer its rival states. Moreover, timber is produced west of Long Mountain and there are the pottery kilns of Emperor Wu at Duling. If all combine their efforts, we can manage the work in a day. As for the people, who needs to consult them? If anyone is reluctant I shall set my soldiers onto them, and I could make them go all the way to the sea!\" Yang Biao replied: \"It is easy to stir up the empire, but very difficult to soothe it down. Please think again.\" A colouring Dong Zhuo demandingly asked: \"Would you obstruct the affairs of the state?\" Huang Wan, the Grand Commandant, interfered: \"This is a question of national importance. Should you not pay some thought to Lord Yang's argument?\" Dong Zhuo did not reply. Xun Shuang, the Minister of Works, noticed that Dong Zhuo had already made up his mind. He feared that Dong Zhuo might harm Yang Biao and his supporters and therefore said to Dong Zhuo, in placatory fashion: \"Can the Chancellor of State enjoy this situation? The soldiers east of the mountains are in rebellion. We cannot put them down immediately, so we shift the capital to deal with them properly. This is just like the time of Qin and early Han.\" This somewhat cooled down Dong Zhuo. Huang Wan then left the assembly, but he remained against the proposal. In the second month, on 28 March, Dong Zhuo memorialised that because of disasters and strange happenings, Huang Wan, Yang Biao and others should be dismissed. Zhao Qian, The Superintendent of the Imperial Household, was made Grand Commandant and Wang Yun, the Grand Coachman, became Minister over the Masses. The proposal to shift the capital received strong criticism from Wu Qiong, the Colonel of the City Gates, and Zhou Bi, the Colonel Who Controls the Army. This made Dong Zhuo very angry and he said: \"When I first came to court you two urged me to employ fine scholars. I accepted your advice and all these men came to office, but now they take up arms against me. You have betrayed me. How can I use such untrustworthy people?\" Several days later, on 2 April, Dong Zhuo had Wu Qiong and Zhou Bi arrested and beheaded. Huang Wan and Yang Biao were scared to death and immediately went to apologise to Dong Zhuo. Then Dong Zhuo was sorry he had killed Wu Qiong and Zhou Bi, and he recommended that Yang Biao and Huang Wan be restored to office as Imperial Household Grandees. Dong Zhuo summoned the Intendant of Jingzhao, He Xun, to be Gentleman-Consultant. At this time the General of the Left Huangfu Song held command of thirty thousand soldiers at camp in Youfufeng, and He Xun had made secret plans with him to attack Dong Zhuo. Soon afterwards Dong Zhuo also called Huangfu Song to the capital to take appointment as Colonel of the City Gates. Liang Yan, Chief Clerk to Huangfu Song, said to him: \"Dong Zhuo ravages and plunders the capital city, he has dismissed one emperor and set up another simply on his whim. Now he has sent a summons to you. If things turn out badly, you will suffer danger and ill fortune, and at the very least you will surely be humiliated and miserable. Take the opportunity now, while Dong Zhuo remains at Luoyang and the Son of Heaven is coming to the west. Lead your men to receive the Emperor, accept his orders to attack the rebels, call up additional troops and gather leaders. Then the Yuan will be pressing on the east as you attack from the west. That will catch him!\" Huangfu Song did not accept this advice and instead went to obey that summons. He Xun's forces were to weak all by themselves and therefore he too went to the capital district. Dong Zhuo made him Colonel of Elite Cavalry. The Intendant of Henan, Zhu Jun, spoke with Dong Zhuo on military matters, but Dong Zhuo cut him short, saying: \"In a hundred battles I have gained a hundred victories. I have made my decision. Stop this nonsense or I shall dirty my sword on you.\" He Xun said: \"In ancient times, Wuding was a brilliant ruler, but he still sought wise rebuke. This is yet more true for someone like you, but you want to force men into silence.\" Following this, Dong Zhuo sent his army against Yangcheng county, which was in Yingchuan commandery, Yuan Shu's position. There, all people had gathered for a ceremony at the local altar and the soldiers beheaded all the menfolk.After the massacre, they took heavy carts, loaded the women and girls, bound the heads to the shafts, and returned singing and shouting to Luoyang with the claim that they had attacked bandits and taken a great number of prisoners. Dong Zhuo set fire to the heads and burnt them, and he gave the females to his soldiers as servants and concubines.Emperor Xian Sent West  On 9 April 190 A.D., the Emperor moved west. After the Emperor left, Dong Zhuo arrested all the wealthy men put them to death for wrongdoing and confiscated their property. The amount of dead people was too much to be counted. The millions of remaining people were sent to Chang'an. While being hassled forward by horsemen and foot-soldiers. They trod one another down in confusion. Starving and hungry they scavenged and robbed. Piled-up corpses clogged the roads. Dong Zhuo remained at camp in the Jade Sceptre Park. He burnt all palaces, temples, government offices and private houses. In a range of 200 li, every building was destroyed and not even a dog or chicken remained. Following this, he sent L\u00fc Bu to to break open the tombs of the emperors and the burial mounds of the Excellencies, senior and lower officials, and collect their treasure. Dong Zhuo captured some soldiers from the east of the mountains. He took lard and daubed it on a dozen rolls of cloth, then bound the cloth to their bodies and set light to them, beginning at the feet and going up. In the third month, 27 April, the Emperor arrived in Chang'an, where he stayed in the official residency of Jingzhao commandery. Only later were the palace buildings put into sufficient repair that he could live in them. Dong Zhuo had not yet arrived, and the imperial government in matters large and small was left to Wang Yun. Outwardly, Wang Yun always acted quietly and tried to smooth things over when Dong Zhuo made an error. However, in secret he was loyal to the Han and had the ambition to aid the Emperor. He possessed all the abilities that an official was expected to have and everyone looked up to him; from the Son of Heaven to the courtiers. Wang Yun always hid his feelings and Dong Zhuo trusted him and treated him well. On 10 May 190 A.D., Dong Zhuo killed Yuan Wei, the Grand Tutor, Yuan Ji, the Grand Coachman and their families, from babies up. In total over 50 people were killed in this act against Yuan Shao.Wang Rui, Sun Jian And Cao Yin  A while earlier, Wang Rui, who was the Inspector of Jing province, joined Sun Jian, the Grand Administrator of Changsha, to attack bandits in Lingling and Guiyang. Wang Rui spoke sightingly of Sun Jian, because he held a military position. Wang Rui was resentful of the success and honour which had been given a simple fighting man such as Sun Jian. He mistakenly expressed his opinion in public. This was in the year 187 A.D. Three years later, when forces were gathering against Dong Zhuo, Wang Rui and Sun Jian also raised troops. However, Wang Rui had quarrelled with Cao Yin, the Grand Administrator of Wuling, and he announced his top priority: kill Cao Yin. Cao Yin feared his own safety and forged an order from an officer of investigation and sent it to Sun Jian. The order listed Wang Rui's crimes and faults and authorised Sun Jian to arrest him, execute him, and then submit a report. As soon as Sun Jian received it he led his forces against Wang Rui. Not much later, Wang Rui learnt of the arrival of these troops. He climbed a tower and looked out and sent to ask: \"What do you want?\" Sun Jian's Advance Division replied: \"We have long been suffering the toil of fighting and labour, and we have come to ask you for some recompense.\" But then Wang Rui noticed Sun Jian and was alarmed. Wang Rui, in distress and despair, scraped gold, drank it and died. As Sun Jian moved forward to Nanyang his army already numbered twenty or thirty thousand men. Zhang Zi, the Grand Administrator of Nanyang, refused to grant them supplies, but Sun Jian tricked him and took off his head. In the commandery there was fear and trembling, and he was given everything he asked for. Sun Jian continued to Luyang to join Yuan Shu, thus Yuan Shu gained control of Nanyang. He recommended Sun Jian as Acting General Who Routs the Caitiffs and Inspector of Yu province.The Battle Of Xingyang  Dong Zhuo was still at Luoyang. Yuan Shao and the armies of the Guandong Coalition had gotten afraid of the strength of his armies and no one dared to go forward. Cao Cao said: \"You have raised loyal troops to destroy oppression and disorder, and a great army is already collected. Why do you hesitate? At the beginning, if Dong Zhuo had relied on the imperial house, occupied the old capital [Luoyang] and turned east to take the offensive against the rest of the empire, then even though he was acting as a criminal it would still have made things difficult. But now he is burning palaces and houses, and he has kidnapped the Son of Heaven and sent him away. All within the seas is in disorder and no-one knows where to turn. This is the time he is condemned by heaven. One battle and the empire is settled.\" Cao Cao then led his soldiers west with the intention to occupy Chenggao. Zhang Miao sent his officer Wei Zi with a detachment of troops to follow him. They advanced to the Bian River at Rongyang where they met Dong Zhuo's officer Xu Rong at Xuantu. A battle ensued. Cao Cao's men were defeated and Cao Cao himself was hit by a stray arrow and the horse he rode was wounded. Cao Hong, younger cousin of Cao Cao, wanted to give his horse to Cao Cao, but Cao Cao would not accept. \"The empire can do without me, but it cannot do without you.\" said Cao Hong. He then followed Cao Cao on foot and they withdrew by night. Xu Rong observed the few soldiers Cao Cao had under his command, yet they maintained the battle all through the day. Xu Rong then withdrew, realizing an attack on Suanzao would be difficult. When Cao Cao returned to Suanzao, all the allied armies, which consisted of hundreds of thousands of men, held feasts and laid out wine every day, however, no plans for another attack were made. Cao Cao reproached them, made plans and said: \"Here is what I propose. Let the Grand Administrator of Bohai [Yuan Shao] take the Henei army forward to Meng Crossing, while the commanders at Suanzao blockade Chenggao, occupy the Ao Granary and close Huanyuan and Taigu, so all the passes are held. Then General Yuan [Shu] can lead the armies from Nanyang through Dan[shui], Xi and into the Wu Pass to threaten the Three Adjuncts. In each case, we prepare strong-points, and position ourselves behind high walls and deep trenches. We avoid any actual fighting, but we make it appear that we are on the move, and it will appear to all the world that we are the righteous men destroying rebels. Then things will settle themselves. Our men have come to us because the cause is just, but if we hesitate and delay we shall lose the hopes of the empire, and I would be ashamed for you.\" But, Zhang Miao and others mentioned in Cao Cao's plan would not accept this. Then, Cao Cao went with the major Xiahou Dun. of Pei state and others to Yang province, where he made a levy of troops. He gathered more than a thousand men, and took them to camp in Henei with Yuan Shao, meaning Cao Cao abandoned his association with the group of commanders at Suanzao.Problems In The Coalition  Soon after this, the armies at Suanzao ran out of food and the allied forces dispersed. Liu Dai was on bad terms with Qiao Mao, so he killed him and appointed Wang Gong Grand Administrator of Dong commandery. The Inspector of Qing province, Jiao He, also raised troops to attack Dong Zhuo. He made every effort to catch up with the other leaders in the march to the west, but he had prepared no defences for his own people, and as his soldiers crossed the Yellow River the Yellow Turbans were already within his borders. Up to this time Qing province had been prosperous, and well protected by armed men. Whenever Jiao He caught sight of the rebels, however, he would always retreat, and he had never tried the winds and dust of campaigning nor the clash of banners and drums in battle. He liked divination, and he believed in ghosts and spirits. When you visit a man like that you find Pure Conversation to reach the clouds, but when you look at his administration you find rewards and punishments confused, the province bleak and desolate, and everywhere a wasteland. Soon afterwards Jiao He took ill and died. Yuan Shao sent Zang Hong of Guangling to govern Qing province and maintain order. In the fifth month, Xun Shuang died. He was the Minister of Works. In the sixth month, 21 August, Chong Fu, who was Imperial Household Grandee, became Minister of Works.Latter Months of 190 A.D.  Dong Zhuo sent the Grand Herald Han Rong, the Privy Treasurer Yin Xiu, the Bearer of the Gilded Mace Humu Ban, the Court Architect Wu Xiu and the Colonel of Elite Cavalry Wang Gui to negotiate with Yuan Shao and his allies, and make peace with the east of the mountains. Humu Ban, Wu Xiu and Wang Gui came to Henei. Yuan Shao sent Wang Kuang, who captured all of them and then killed them. Yuan Shu also killed Yin Xiu. Only Han Rong escaped, because he was known for his virtue. Dong Zhuo destroyed the Wushu currency and minted smaller coins. He melted down the statues of Luoyang and Chang'an, such as the Bronze Men, the Zhongju, the Feilian and the Bronze Horses, to cast the new money. So the currency was devalued and goods became dear: the price of a single shi of grain rose to several ten thousand cash. In the winter Sun Jian was holding a drinking party with his officers, east of Luyang city. Suddenly, twenty to thirty thousand of Dong Zhuo's horsemen and foot-soldiers appeared, but Sun Jian didn't give an inch when he noticed the army. Instead he continued to pass the wine around and talked and laughed with his men. Then, he gave ordedrs for his men to form up in their divisions, but refused to let them do anything reckless. More enemy horses gradually came up and Sun Jian left his seat calmly and led his men back into the city of Luyang. He then explained: \"The reason I did not get up straight away was that I was afraid the soldiers would rush and trample one another, and you would not be able to get in.\" Witnessing such discipline, Dong Zhuo's forces turned back. Not even venturing an attack. Wang Kuang was camped at Heyang Crossing. Dong Zhuo made a surprise attack and completely defeated him. The General of the Gentlemen of the Household on the Left Cai Yong recommended that \"All the emperors since Xiao-He who possess the temple-name 'Exemplar' should have them removed, to show proper respect for the original tradition.\" This was done. Gongsun Du was recommended to Dong Zhuo by his General of the Gentlemen of the Household, Xu Rong. Gongsun Du was a man from Xu Rong's own commandery at Xuantu and a former inspector of Ji Province. Dong Zhuo appointed him Grand Administrator of Liaodong. When Gongsun Du took up his post, he punished by law and wiped out more than a hundred of the great and famous families in the commandery, and the whole territory trembled for fear. Then he attacked Gaogouli in the east, and in the west he attacked the Wuhuan. Gongsun Du spoke to those closest to him, Liu Yi, Yang Yi and some others and said: \"The reign of Han is coming to its end. I ask you to join me in making plans for a kingdom.\" He divided Liaodong to form Liaoxi and Zhongliao commanderies and appointed a Grand Administrator to each of them, while across the sea he collected all the counties of Donglai and set up an Inspector of Ying province. Gongsun Du appointed himself Marquis of Liaodong and Governor of Ping province. He set up temples to the two Han ancestors ,Emperor Gao and Emperor Guangwu, he took the authority to hold state sacrifice to Heaven and Earth and to Plough the Field, he rode in a Phoenix Chariot with a team of four horses, and he established Cavalry of the Feathered Forest with Standard-Bearers of Ox-tail Banners.Opponents Rise  Dong Zhuo had set his sights on Yuan Shao. He offered him rewards in trying eagerly to capture him. Zhou Bi and Wu Qiong argued with him: \"To dismiss one emperor and set up another, these are matters of moment, quite beyond the comprehension of ordinary men. Yuan Shao could not appreciate such a great action, and he ran away simply because he was frightened. If you chase him too anxiously, however, the situation will certainly change. That family has been distributing favours for four generations, so they have clients and officials who have served under them throughout the empire. If Yuan Shao calls up fighting men and raises an army, then bold warriors will join him in rebellion and you will hold nothing east of the mountains. It would be much better to pardon him and give him appointment as administrator in some commandery. Yuan Shao will be glad to escape punishment and will certainly cause no trouble.\" Dong Zhuo agreed and made a change of plans; he promptly appointed Yuan Shao as Grand Administrator of Bohai, with enfeoffment as Marquis of Kang District. He also appointed Yuan Shu as General of the Rear and Cao Cao as Colonel of Resolute Cavalry. Dong Zhuo's plans had an opposite effect. Yuan Shu was afraid of Dong Zhuo and he fled to Nanyang. Cao Cao also fled east, disguised and under a false name As he went through Zhongmou, however, the chief of a village became suspicious: he arrested Cao Cao and sent him to the county office. They had a letter from Dong Zhuo [ordering his arrest] but only the Officer of the Bureau of Merit recognised him. He thought it wrong for one of the leading men in the empire to be imprisoned when the world was in such disorder, so he advised the prefect to release him. When Cao Cao reached Chenliu, he sold off his family property and recruited five thousand soldiers. Many warriors of the empire had plans to rebel against Dong Zhuo. Yuan Shao was one of them, but Han Fu, the Governor of Ji province, sent several Attendant Officials into the commandery to keep him under control. Yuan Shao was unable to make a move. In the meantime, Qiao Mao, the Grand Commandant of Dong Commandery, forged letters as if sent by the Excellencies in the capital to the provinces and commanderies. The letters listed faults and crimes of Dong Zhuo and went to say: \"We are oppressed and can do nothing to help ourselves. We look eagerly for loyal troops to free the state from danger and harm.\" One of the men who received this letter was Han Fu, who then asked the members of his staff: \"Do we support the Yuan clan or the Dong?\" Li Zihui, Han Fu's Attendant Official at Headquarters replied: \"If you raise troops on behalf of the state, how can there be any question of Yuan and Dong?\" Han Fu blushed in shame. Li Zihui continued: \"War is bad and you should not be the first to begin it. Wait and see what other provinces do. If they take action you can join them, and since Ji province is one of the most powerful, the chiefs of other provinces will never be able to rival you for the leading position.\" Han Fu agreed. So he wrote to Yuan Shao, discussing the crimes of Dong Zhuo, and giving tacit consent to his levy of troops.Fading Coalition  In February of the year 191 A.D., a general council was held among the leaders east of the passes. It was observed that the Emperor was young and weak and under the control of Dong Zhuo. The men of the council were far away from Luoyang and didn't even know if the Emperor was still alive. Liu Yu, Governor of You province, was worthy and able and a member of the imperial clan. It was therefore proposed he be set up as ruler. Cao Cao said: \"When we raised loyal troops, all the people supported us, and the reason was that our cause is just. Now we have a young ruler who is feeble and weak, in the power of an evil minister. These are not the faults for which [the King of] Changyi [Liu He] forfeited his imperial throne.2 If we make a sudden change, who in the empire can be at ease? You may look north [to Liu Yu], but I turn west [to the Emperor at Chang'an].\" Han Fu and Yuan Shao wrote to Yuan Shu: \"The Emperor is not a true son of Xiao-Ling. We want to act like [the Marquis of] Jiang and Guan [Ying] in former times, when they punished and deposed a puppet ruler, and welcomed the King of Dai to his place. We plan to set up the Commander-in-Chief Liu Yu as Emperor.\" Secretly, Yuan Shu desired the throne for himself, but he realised that if the state had a stronger ruler, attaining his desire would become difficult. Because of this, Yuan Shu argued, on the best principles, against the proposal. Yuan Shao wrote to Yuan Shu again: \"Now in the west there is a young ruler who has the name [of an emperor], but has no blood relationship to the imperial clan, while all his officials, high and low, are supporters and flatterers of Dong Zhuo. How can we continue to trust them? We need only send troops to camp at the passes and strategic points, and all [the supporters of Dong Zhuo and the Emperor] will be cramped and die. If a sage ruler is set up in the east, then we may hope for great peace. How can you still have doubts? Moreover, the people of our clan have been slaughtered. Do you not recall [the example of] Wu Zixu? How can you still accept this ruler?\" Yuan Shu replied: \"The Emperor is wise and capable, with the nature of King Cheng of Zhou. The bandit Dong Zhuo has taken advantage of a temporary confusion and compelled the officials to obey him, so this is a moment of difficulty for the house of Han. Now you say the Emperor 'has no blood relationship,' but that is simple slander. You say, 'the people of our clan have been slaughtered,' and 'how can you still accept this ruler?' But this was Dong Zhuo's work, certainly not the Emperor's. \"It is with the utmost loyalty that I seek the destruction of Dong Zhuo, I refuse to think of anything else!\" Han Fu and Yuan Shao had send Zhang Qi, the former Grand Administrator of Lelang, to offer Liu Yu the imperial title. Zhang Qi, however, rebuked Liu Yu and his colleagues sternly when he saw them and said: \"The empire has fallen into disorder, and the ruler is forced into exile. I have received great favours from the throne, but yet I cannot clear away the disgrace from our state. You hold provinces and commanderies, and you should join all your forces to save the royal house. Instead, you have made plans of rebellion, and you seek to involve me in your shameful dealings!\" Liu Yu firmly refused them. Following this, Han Fu and his associates asked Liu Yu to take control of the imperial secretariat, with authority to grant enfeoffments and make appointments. Still, Liu Yu would not hear of it and he threatened to take refuge among the Xiongnu, to cut himself off of these proposals. Yuan Shao and the others gave up the idea. On 25 March, Dong Zhuo was appointed Grand Master. This ranked him above kings.Sun Jian's Advance  Before this, Sun Jian relinquished his title as Grand Administrator and accepted the authority of Yuan Shu. Following Yuan Shu's joining of the Coalition Sun Jian volunteered to take the vanguard in the attack against Dong Zhuo as Yuan Shu\u2019s Chief Lieutenant. Sun Jian shifted camp to the east of Liang. There he met the forces of Li Meng and Xu Rong, Dong Zhuo's General of the Gentlemen of the Household, but was defeated in a great battle and forced to flee for his life. Thanks to his officer Zu Maohe was able to escape. Zu Mao took the red cap that Sun Jian usually wore as a mark of distinction, and so attracted the enemy pursuit. Sun Jian then managed to break out of the lines that were encircling him, and made his escape. Some of Sun Jian's men were less fortunate. Li Min, the Grand Administrator of Yingchuan, was captured by Xu Rong's forces and executed by being boiled alive, while other soldiers of the rebel forces were killed with hot oil. Zu Mao managed to escape. In the meantime, Yuan Shao sent the Grand Administrator of Henei, Wang Kuang, to press an advance along the Yellow River towards Luoyang. He camped at the Meng Crossing, which lied northeast of the capital. Dong Zhuo sent soldiers against him, and Wang Kuang's army was completely destroyed. So Dong Zhuo's defence had been successful on both fronts, and the attack by the main force east of the mountains was quite broken down. Sun Jian was south and gained no support or co-operation from the allied armies near the Yellow River. However, Dong Zhuo's attack on Wang Kuang and the focus on the troops near the Yellow River gave Sun Jian the time he needed to reassemble his troops after his defeat by Xu Rong. In the first month of 191 A.D. he headed to camp at Yangren, northwest of Liang and laid camp there. Though Dong Zhuo had defeated Wang Kuang, all was to be done again to defeat Sun Jian. Dong Zhuo now sent his Grand Administrator of Dong commandery, Hu Zhen, with 5.000 horsemen and foot-soldiers to attack Sun Jian. Along with Hu Zhen were the already famous L\u00fc Bu, in command of the cavalry, and Hua Xiong, who held the low rank of Chief Controller. The trio attacked Sun Jian's fortified camp at Yangren, but were completely routed. Hu Zhen and L\u00fc Bu fled. Hua Xiong was killed in battle. Someone said to Yuan Shu: \"If Sun Jian captures Luoyang, you will not be able to control him. This is to destroy a wolf and obtain a tiger.\" This made Yuan Shu concerned and he then ordered that the supplies should no longer be sent to Sun Jian. Following this, Sun Jian rode fast by night to see Yuan Shu, drew on the ground to show his plans and spoke: \"The reasons I have taken service with you are that above I am attacking a rebel for the Emperor, while below I give some help to your family in a private feud. I have no thought for my own interests, and no personal enmity for Dong Zhuo. Yet you now pay attention to slander and for no reason at all you are suspicious of me!\" Yuan Shu became embarrased and he immediatly sent supplies to Sun Jian's camp. Sun Jian returned to camp and Dong Zhuo sent his officer Li Jue to treat with him, make peace and make an alliance. He told Sun Jian to recommend junior members of his family as Inspectors or Grand Administrators and promised to urge their appointment. Sun Jian replied: \"Dong Zhuo opposes Heaven and defies the law. Until I have killed you and all your clan and shown your heads to the four seas, I shall not be able to die in peace. How can there be alliance with you?\" After this, Sun Jian went forward to Dagu, ninety li from Luoyang. Dong Zhuo himself came out to fight Sun Jian amongst the tombs of the emperors of Later Han. Dong Zhuo was defeated and fled. He withdrew his camp to Mianchi and gathered troops at Shan. Sun Jian advanced to Luoyang and attacked L\u00fc Bu. Once again The Flying General was defeated and put to flight.  Luoyang now came in the possession of Sun Jian, who cleared out the imperial temples and held great sacrifice. He found the Imperial Seal in a well in the Pottery Office south of the city. Following his success in Luoyang, Sun Jian sent part of his force forward to Xin'an and Mianchi to threaten Dong Zhuo's defence positions.Dong Zhuo Talks About Sun Jian  Dong Zhuo said to his Chief Clerk Liu Ai: \"The armies east of the passes have often been defeated. All of them are afraid of me and can do nothing effective. Sun Jian, however, the little fool, is quite competent. You must warn my officers to be careful of him. Some years ago I was sent west with Zhou Shen to attack Bian Zhang and Han Sui in Jincheng. I suggested to Zhang Wen that I should use my troops as a rearguard for Zhou Shen, but Zhang Wen would not agree. Soon afterwards Zhang Wen sent me to attack the rebel Xianlian Qiang. I knew we would have no success, but I could not avoid the duty, and so we marched. I left the Major with a Separate Command Liu Jing, with four thousand horse and foot, to camp in Anding as a show of strength. The Qiang tried to cut our lines of ommunication, but I opened them with a small attack, and the reason [I could do this so easily] was that the enemy were afraid of the soldiers in Anding. They thought there must be tens of thousands; they had no idea it was only Liu Jing. At the same time, Sun Jian was with Zhou Shen. He offered to lead ten thousand men forward to Jincheng, leaving Zhou Shen to act as rearguard with twenty thousand. Bian Zhang and Han Sui would have been afraid of Zhou Shen's great force, and would have been cautious about committing themselves against Sun Jian, while Sun Jian's troops were strong enough to cut their line of supplies. Had the commanders used our suggestions, Liang province would have been settled. But just as Zhang Wen could not use my advice, so Zhou Shen could not use Sun Jian's, and in the end they were defeated and turned back. So when he was an Associate Major, Sun Jian saw things the way I did, and he has some useful talents. Now, however, for no good reason he has joined the Yuan gang, and in the end he will die too.\"To Chang'an And After  Dong Yue, the General of the Gentlemen of the Household of the East, was sent by Dong Zhuo to camp at Mianchi. Duan Wei, the General of the Gentlemen of the Household, was sent to camp at Huayin and Niu Fu, Dong Zhuo's son-in-law and the General of the Gentlemen of the Household was sent to camp at Anyi. Other officers were sent to block any attacks coming from the east. Meanwhile, Dong Zhuo led his own troops away to Chang'an. Sun Jian had just repaired the imperial tombs and went back to Luyang. In the fourth month, summer, Dong Zhuo arrived in Chang'an. Ministers and excellencies came out to welcome him. They all bowed before his carriage. Dong Zhuo clapped and said to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk Huangfu Song: \"Yizhen, are you afraid?\" \"If Your Excellency uses virtue to maintain the court,\" replied Huangfu Song, \"this will be a time of great blessing, and why then should I be afraid? If you govern badly and inflict arbitrary punishments, however, I shall not be the only person who is frightened.\" Some supporters of Dong Zhuo wished to honour him as the Grand Duke and give him the title of Honoured Uncle. Dong Zhuo asked Cai Yong what he thought of the proposal. Cai Yong said: \"Your excellency's majestic virtue, how truly imposing! In my humble opinion, however, it is not yet possible to make a comparison with the Grand Duke. It would be better to wait until the east of the passes is settled and at peace, and the Emperor is returned to his former capital [at Luoyang]. Then we can talk about it.\" Dong Zhuo gave up the idea. The Colonel Director of Retainers Liu Aowas asked by Dong Zhuo arrest those of the officials and people who had not been respectful sons, loyal subjects, honest officials or obedient younger brothers. All those who were arrested were executed shortly after and their wealth was confiscated. This resulted in many people make false accusations against one another and thousands were put to death without good cause. The people became anxious and fearful and when they passed one another on the read they did no more then exchange glances, not daring to speak.The Coalition Begins To Crumble  Zhang Yang had allied himself with Yuan Shao, when the latter was in Hefei. Zhang Yang camped with the Southern Shanyu Yufuluo by the Zhang River. Han Fu became jealous at Yuan Shao because so many leading men had turned to him. He quietly cut down on his military supplies, hoping his army would drift apart. However, shortly after this his officer Qu Yi rebelled. Han Fu fought him and was defeated, and Yuan Shao made an alliance with Qu Yi. Pang Ji, a follower of Yuan Shao, said to his general: \"You have undertaken a great work, but you still rely upon others for subsidy and supplies. Unless you take a province for yourself, you will never be able to act independently.\" Yuan Shao objected, saying: \"Ji province has a strong army and my troops are hungry and weary. If we fail we shall be left with nothing.\" Pang Ji argued: \"Han Fu is a very ordinary fellow. If we make a secret agreement with Gongsun Zan to have him take Ji province, Han Fu will certainly be startled and frightened. Then you send someone who can argue a case well, to explain things to him. Han Fu will be under pressure, he will get flustered and he will certainly be willing to yield.\" This made Yuan Shao change his mind and he wrote to Gongsun Zan at once. Gongsun Zan approved and he came up with troops. He pretended he was going to attack Dong Zhuo but then turned against Han Fu. Han Fu fought him but without success. About this time Dong Zhuo entered the passes to Chang'an and Yuan Shao brought his army back to the Yan Crossing. He sent his nephew Gao Gan of Chenliu with Han Fu's friends Xin Ping of Yingchuan, Xun Shen, Guo Tu and others to say to Han Fu: \"Gongsun Zan is coming with an army from Yan and Dai [the north] and will follow his success with a further advance. All the commanderies will join him, and you cannot match his strength. Yuan the Chariots and Cavalry General is bringing his army eastwards, and we cannot be sure of his intentions. You seem to be in trouble!\" This frightened Han Fu and he said: \"What can I do?\" \"Judge yourself,\" replied Xun Shen. \"In generosity and charity, as a leader of men admired by all; how do you compare with Yuan?\" \"I cannot compare with him,\" replied Han Fu. Xun Shen continued: \"Generations of his family have displayed grace and virtue, and all the empire has received their favour; once more, how do you compare with Yuan?\" \"I cannot compare with him,\" replied Han Fu. \"Yuan is the hero of the time,\" said Xun Shen, \"and in these three ways your abilities fail to match his fine qualities. You have long held place above him, but he will surely not be satisfied to remain your subordinate. Now Ji province is an important property of the empire. If he and Gongsun Zan join forces to seize it then danger and loss can be expected any moment. On the other hand, Yuan is an old friend and a sworn ally. Here is the right plan for this moment: cede Ji province to Yuan. He will certainly be grateful to you, and Gongsun Zan cannot contest him. So you gain reputation for yielding place to a worthier man, and you yourself will be secure as Mount Tai.\" Han Fu was timid and so he followed this plan. When Han Fu's Chief Clerk Geng Wu, his Aide-de-Camp Min Chun and his Attendant Official at Headquarters Li Li heard of this, they protested, saying: \"Ji province has a million men at arms and sufficient grain to last for ten years. Yuan Shao leads an army which is isolated, dependent and poor; he relies on us for everything. Like a child on the lap, if you end its suckling it will starve and die. Why do you want to give him the province?\" Han Fu's answer was: \"I am a former officer of the Yuan and my ability is not equal to that of Benchu.I have taken account of his virtue, and so I cede it to him. The men of ancient times saw honour in such conduct. Why do you alone find fault?\"Yuan Shao Takes Ji Province  Before this, Han Fu's Attendant Officials Zhao Fu and Cheng Huan had led ten thousand Strong Bowmen to camp at the Meng Crossing. They heard what was going on and brought their men quickly back. At this time Yuan Shao was by Qingshui in Chaoge. Zhao Fu and the others came up behind him with several hundred boats and a force of over ten thousand men. They set their weapons and drums in order and passed, which really annoyed Yuan Shao. When Zhao Fu returned he said to Han Fu: \"Yuan Benchu's army has not a single measure of grain. Even now his men are deserting. Zhang Yang and Yufuluo have only recently joined him, and they will not accept his orders. He cannot match us. As your junior officers, we ask approval to oppose them with the troops we have at hand: within ten days his power will be like fallen earth and flying tiles. You, wise general, may rest on a high pillow with your doors open [in security and confidence]. Why should you be concerned or frightened?\" Han Fu still refused the advice. He left his office and went to lodge in Regular Attendant Zhao Zhong's former mansion. He sent his son to take the seal and tassel of his appointment as Governor and hand them to Yuan Shao. As Yuan Shao approached, ten of Han Fu's staff hastened to abandon him and join Yuan Shao. Geng Wu and Min Chun faced them with swords, but could not hold them back and were forced to let them go. Yuan Shao killed the two loyalists. Yuan Shao made Ju Shou of Guangping General Who Displays Firmness, with responsibility as Supervisor and Protector over all his officers, and he treated him with great favour. Because of their upright conduct, Shen Pei of Wei commandery and Tian Feng of Julu had both failed to fulfil their ambitions under Han Fu. Yuan Shao appointed Tian Feng as his Aide-de-Camp and Shen Pei as Attendant Official at Headquarters. Xu You and Pang Ji of Nanyang, with Xun Shen of Yingchuan, all became councillors. Zhu Han of Henei was appointed by Yuan Shao as Attendant Official for the Officers at the Capital. Zhu Han had been treated rudely by Han Fu in the past. He now sought to anticipate Yuan Shao's intentions. Without authority he brought troops to surround Han Fu's house, took up a sword and climbed into the building. Han Fu fled to the upper storey, and Zhu Han seized his eldest son, beat him and broke both his legs. When Yuan Shao heard of this, he immediatly arrested Zhu Han and killed him. Han Fu, however, was still anxious and afraid. He asked Yuan Shao for permission to leave, and he went to stay with Zhang Miao. Some time later, Yuan Shao had sent a messenger to Zhang Miao, to discuss plans with him. The messenger whispered something to Zhang Miao, while Han Fu was near. This made Han Fu believe they were plotting against him. Soon afterwards he got up and went to the lavatory and killed himself with a writing-knife.Cao Cao's Ambition  Around that time, Bao Xin spoke to Cao Cao and said: \"Yuan Shao is leader of the covenant, but he uses that authority to his own advantage. He will himself rebel and become another Dong Zhuo. You are not yet strong enough to restrain him, and you will only make trouble for yourself if you try. What you can do, however, is establish a position south of the Yellow River and wait to see what happens.\" Cao Cao thought this was an excellent idea. Not long after this, the Black Mountain bandits Poison Yu, Bo Rao, Sui Gu and their men, over a hundred thousand strong, plundered in Dong commandery. Wang Gang could not keep them out. Cao Cao led troops into Dong, attacked Bo Rao at Puyang and defeated him. Then Yuan Shao recommended him as Grand Administrator of Dong and Cao Cao set his government at Dongwuyang.Further Internal Problems In Both Camps  Yufuluo compelled Zhang Yang to join him against Yuan Shao. They camped at Liyang. When Dong Zhuo heard of this, he appointed Zhang Yang as General Who Establishes Righteousness and Grand Administrator of Henei. The Grand Astrologer examined the omens, and foretold that a great minister would be executed. Dong Zhuo had false accusations made that that the Commandant of the Guards Zhang Wen had been in contact with Yuan Shu. On 5 November 191 A.D. Zhang Wen was flogged to death in the market-place to fulfil the prophecy. Palace Attendant Liu He, son of Liu Yu, was ordered by the Emperor to help him escape from Dong Zhuo. He wished to return east. Liu He was ordered to go in secret out the Wu Pass, and take a message to Liu Yu that he should lead troops to come and receive the Emperor. Liu He came to Nanyang, but Yuan Shu kept him there as a guest to force Liu Yu into alliance. He would not let him continue his journey, but promised that when reinforcements came they would advance to the west together, and he made Liu He write a letter to Liu Yu. When Liu Yu received the letter, he sent several thousand cavalry to aid Liu He. Gongsun Zan knew of Yuan Shu's rebellious ideas. He urged Liu Yu not to send the troops, but Liu Yu didn't listen. Gongsun Zan then started to fear Yuan Shu would hear of his advice and would be angry, so he sent his cousin Gongsun Yueto take another thousand horsemen to Yuan Shu. And he secretly encouraged Yuan Shu to keep hold of Liu He and take the soldiers for himself. So Liu Yu and Gongsun Zan had a grudge against each other. Liu He fled from Yuan Shu, and got away to the north, where he was detained by Yuan Shao.Coalition Disbanded  By this time, every ruler of a province or commandery east of the passes was trying to seize someone else's territory to make himself more powerful. The coalition existed in name only and thus the 'Campaign against Dong Zhuo' had ended. If you wish to read what happened with Dong Zhuo's empire after the coalition disbanded, go to The Assassination at Chang'an.Notes Fact vs. Fiction Sources Onefourninethree Wiki 1493 Wiki Welcome to the Wiki  Connected to http://multiverserp.wikia.com and the brainchild of one of the editors there, One-four-nine-three (1493) is the universe code given to the area where my characters are from.Disclaimer  All of the models shown and vocalists given are not me.

A charitable character is guided by her compassion to share what she has in order to improve the plight of those around her. Charitable individuals are guided by the principle of treating others as they would be treated themselves. By sharing gifts and taking on the role of the Samaritan, they hope to cultivate goodwill in others, and the gifts they give will eventually return to them in their hour of need.\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever she helps another at the risk of loss or harm to herself. It isn't enough to share what your character has in abundance. She must make a real sacrifice in terms of time, possessions or energy, or she must risk life and limb to help another. Example: Deloris could see her dad losing his mind if he knew his little girl was driving around a south-side\nneighborhood so late at night. But if she wanted to be a top investigative reporter, she had to take some risks, even if it meant tracking down clues on a serial killer in a slum. She'd been the one to dub him 'Tommy 10 Tongues' in her first cover story. Now he was up to 12 tongues, and she was determined to catch him before he harvested another. She knew the police had no idea how to decipher the bloody hieroglyphs at the crime scenes, or why the victims were all missing their tongues. But the police didn't have an ex-lover who was a linguistics professor.\nThen Deloris passed the other motorist. A white man with a cast on one arm struggling to change a flat. If Tommy 10 Tongues didn't get him, the locals surely would. And yet, Deloris wasn't born yesterday. The cast could have been a fake. The killer could have used such tricks to lure his victims in. She didn't want to be the next one, but she couldn't bear the thought of writing the morning headline, 'Stranded Motorist 13th Victim.' So, she pulled over to do the charitable thing. Deloris gains all spent Willpower for her act of charity. Her willingness to risk herself for someone else validates her defining Virtue.

The truth is, I may own Thorson Lumber, but I\ndon't control it or I'd shut it down. If my uncle has his way, I'll never have that chance. \n\"I know his lawyers and thugs are pressuring you to stop the protest, but you can't give up. You feel the power of that forest. There's something there, something bigger than any of us that needs to be protected. \n\"All I came here to say is don't lose hope. I'll feed you what information I can from the inside to keep you one step ahead of them. If you give up now, there'll be nothing left to save.\" \nBy supporting the activists at her own personal expense and risk, Eva regains any spent Willpower. Other Names: Dreamer, optimist, utopian\nPossessed by: Anti-globalization activists, entrepreneurs, martyrs, visionariesJustice  Wrongs cannot go unpunished. This is the central tenet of the just, who believe that protecting the innocent and confronting inequity is the responsibility of every decent person, even in the face of great personal danger. The just believe that evil cannot prosper so long as one good person strives to do what is right, regardless of the consequences.\n Your character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he does the right thing at risk of personal loss\nor setback. The 'right thing' can be defined by the letter or spirit of a particular code of conduct, whether it be the United States penal code or a biblical Commandment. Example: For five years Malcolm watched the bastard parade into court, smiling through appeal after appeal. His gold-plated lawyers ran circles around the district attorney. Then they settled the class-action suit at such a ridiculously low payment that Malcolm had to wonder how far the bribes went. And the bastard was going free.\n Hundreds had been driven insane by the drug he distributed. It made him rich even while it made Malcolm's sister a corpse. . . and then a ghost. It was only then that Malcolm realized why she always appeared outside his hall closet. That's where he kept his gun.\nIf Malcolm takes the law into his own hands and makes himself a criminal as a result, he acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower. Other Names: Condemnatory, righteous\nPossessed by: Critics, judges, parents, role modelsPrudence  The Virtue of Prudence places wisdom and restraint above rash action and thoughtless behavior. One maintains integrity and principles by moderating actions and avoiding unnecessary risks. While that means a prudent person might never take big gambles that bring huge rewards, neither is his life ruined by a bad roll of the dice. By choosing wisely and avoiding the easy road he prospers slowly but surely.\n Your character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he refuses a tempting course of action by which\nhe could gain significantly. The 'temptation' must involve some reward that, by refusing it, might cost him later on. Example: \"Miss Hernandez, you're an intelligent woman -- and a beautiful one, I might add. There are so\nmany benefits available to the people who contribute to our family business. The least of them is the considerable fee we're offering for your services in this matter.\"\n \"Your offer is generous,\" Louise replied, \"and I thank you for it. But the types of offshore transactions you propose are tantamount to money laundering and tax evasion. It wouldn't be prudent for me to jeopardize my legal career by being party to this.\"\n\"You think you know, Miss Hernandez, but I assure you, you have no idea what you're passing up.\"\nIf Louise passes on the possibility of riches to preserve her job and name, she acts in a way that validates her defining Virtue and regains any spent Willpower. Other Names: Patience, vigilance\nPossessed by: Businessmen, doctors, priests, scientistsTemperance  Moderation in all things is the secret to happiness, so says the doctrine of Temperance. It's all about balance. Everything has its place in a person's life, from anger to forgiveness, lust to chastity. The temperate do not believe in denying their urges, as none of it is unnatural or unholy. The trouble comes when things are taken to excess, whether it's a noble or base impulse. Too much righteousness can be just as bad as too much wickedness.\n Your character regains all spent Willpower when he resists a temptation to indulge in an excess of any behavior, whether good or bad, despite the obvious rewards it might offer. Example: Michael pressed Ravera to the pavement and cuffed him. For half his years on the force, Michael had been trying to bring Douglas Ravera to justice.\n How many kids had died from Ravera's peddled junk? How many times had Michael's family received death threats? How many times had Ravera been collared only to walk on a technicality?\nMichael's mind kept turning back to the unregistered .38 stashed in his patrol car. He could fire some rounds into the car door and put Ravera's prints on the weapon. Who would doubt that Michael had to kill him in self-defense?\n\"No,\" Michael muttered to himself. He couldn't lower himself to the same level as this criminal, no matter how tempting. He'd be no better. Instead, he hauled Ravera into the back of the car and slammed the door.\nBy refusing to give in to extreme and compelling impulses, remaining centered instead, Michael acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower. Other Names: Chastity, even-temperament, frugality\nPossessed by: Clergy, police officers, social workersVices Envy  An envious person is never satisfied with what she has. No matter her wealth, status or accomplishments, there is always someone else who seems to have more, and it's coveted. Envious characters are never secure or content with their place in life. They always measure themselves against their rivals and look for ways to get what they deserve. They might be considered paranoid or just consumed by a selfloathing that they project onto others.\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever she gains something important from a rival or has a\nhand in harming that rival's wellbeing. Example: Hughes watched the reporters, sponsors and women flock to Montgomery like moths to a flame. One-tenth of a second in the 40 meter and a couple slick moves on the field were all that made Hughes the low-paid fullback and Montgomery the star tailback. Now it was the big Monday-night game and the attention was all on Montgomery.\n\"Drink this and you'll be MVP tonight.\"\nAt first, the voice seemed to come out of nowhere, but then there he was, one of the ugliest guys Hughes had ever seen, sitting right there in the locker room, grinning like the Cheshire Cat.\n\"Who the hell are you? How'd you get in here?\"\n \"Kick-off is in five minutes, Hughes. You want to be the star tonight? Then drink up. You want Montgomery to get the headlines tomorrow, then call security.\"\nHughes considered a moment, then took the vial and downed it. Salty, thick, warm and powerful -- so very powerful. Screw the consequences, he was going to have the game of his life.\nBy taking the drink, Hughes indulges his defining Vice and regains one point of spent Willpower. Other Names: Covetousness, jealousy, paranoia\nPossessed by: Celebrities, executives, politiciansGluttony  Gluttony is about indulging appetites to the exclusion of everything else. It's about dedicating oneself to sensual pleasures or chasing the next high. A glutton makes any sacrifice to feed his insatiable appetite for pleasure, regardless of the cost to himself or those around him. He might be considered a junky or even a kleptomaniac (he steals things he doesn't need just for the thrill of it).\n Your character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he indulges in his addiction or appetites at some risk to himself or a loved one. Example: They'd come for his dad. They'd hauled his ass into the bedroom, brought in the power tools, and then the screaming started. James thought about protesting, but what good would it do? He decided to drown it all out, instead. He snorted some coke and tipped back the whiskey. Sure, he'd gotten involved with them, and maybe that was a mistake, but he told his dad to keep out of it. James took another drink. The whiskey trailed fire down his throat and dulled his senses. They didn't tolerate people interfering in their business. And so, James took another drink.\n By overwhelming his senses with drugs and booze rather than helping his father, James indulges in his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower. Other Names: Addictive personality, conspicuous consumer, epicurean\nPossessed by: Celebrities, junkies, thievesGreed  Like the envious, the greedy are never satisfied with what they have. They want more -- more money, a bigger house, more status or influence -- no matter that they may already have more than they can possibly handle. Everything is taken to excess. To the greedy, there is no such thing as having too much. If that means snatching someone else's hard-earned reward just to feather one's own nest, well, that's the way it goes.\n Your character regains one Willpower point whenever he acquires something at the expense of another.\nGaining it must come at some potential risk (of assault, arrest or simple loss of peer respect). Example: Gregor scanned down the list of names. It read like a small-town telephone book. He signed the cover sheet, ending the employment of several hundred people. \"Such is the way of capitalism,\" he mused. The press wouldn't believe there was synergy to the merger unless the two companies' duplicated human resources weren't eliminated. Progress had its price.\nHe once again skimmed the magazine list of the world's 500 wealthiest men, and eyed the meager difference between his fortune at number 20 and that of number 19. Then he imagined next year's poll. Progress had its rewards, too.\nBy engineering the hostile takeover that costs hundreds of jobs, all for petty personal gain, Gregor indulges his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower. Other Names: Avarice, parsimony\nPossessed by: CEOs, lawyers, stock brokersLust  The Vice of Lust is the sin of uncontrolled desire. A lusty individual is driven by a passion for something (usually sex, but it can be a craving for virtually any experience or activity) that he acts upon without consideration for the needs or feelings of others. A lusty individual uses any means at his disposal to indulge his desires, from deception to manipulation to acts of violence.\n Your character is consumed by a passion for something. He regains one Willpower point whenever he satisfies his lust or compulsion in a way that victimizes others. Example: For two weeks, Aaron had been holed up with the star witness, 'protecting' her. That she was also suspected as an accomplice in the crime hadn't stopped Aaron from banging her seven ways to Sunday, ever since she'd come on to him on the second day. It might have meant compromising the witness and his career, but this chick was worth it. Aaron didn't care that her last four husbands had died or that the precinct had labeled her 'Black Widow.' The sex just kept getting better. In fact, he was exhausted for hours afterward. If he'd stopped to think about it, the blackouts might have worried him, but he didn't want to think about it.\nBy using his position and influence to get sexual favors, Aaron indulges in his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower. Other Names: Lasciviousness, impatience, impetuousness\nPossessed by: Movie producers, politicians, rock starsPride  Pride is the Vice of self-confidence run amok. It is the belief that one's every action is inherently right, even when it should be obvious that it is anything but. A prideful person refuses to back down when his decision or reputation is called into question, even when the evidence is clear that he is in the wrong. His ego does not accept any outcome that suggests fallibility, and he is willing to see others suffer rather than admit that he's wrong.\n Your character regains one Willpower point whenever he exerts his own wants (not needs) over others at some potential risk to himself. This is most commonly the desire for adulation, but it could be the desire to make others do as he commands. Example: Fabrice stepped out of his car and faced the old mansion. Four centuries of French weather had taken its toll on the once regal place. The setting sun stretched shadows across the fa\u008dade, highlighting every flaw and crack, and throwing a distorted shadow over the front door like an evil omen.\n/Haunted indeed./\nWhen the unkempt, ill-mannered student had shown up to his lecture and publicly challenged the professor to spend one night in the mansion, how could the foremost debunker of mystic nonsense decline?\nFabrice was sure he had more to fear from the house collapsing than from evil spirits. Yes, he was quite sure.\n By refusing to back down to the challenge, and reveling in his own self-assurance, Fabrice indulges his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower. Other Names: Arrogance, ego complex, vanity\nPossessed by: Corporate executives, movie stars, street thugsSloth  The Vice of Sloth is about avoiding work until someone else has to step in to get the job done. Rather than put in the effort -- and possibly risk failure -- in a difficult situation, the slothful person simply refuses to do anything, knowing that someone else will step in and fix the problem sooner or later. The fact that people might needlessly suffer while the slothful person sits on his thumbs doesn't matter one bit.\n Your character regains one Willpower point whenever he successfully avoids a difficult task but achieves the same goal nonetheless. Example: Catherine pretended to listen as the fourth tenant that day called to tell her, the superintendent, that the security lights were out. Some asshole had gone and broken all the lights around the apartment building.\nSure, she'd heard stories about the Harcourt building, where the lights were shattered one night and there were\nbreak-ins the next. Depending on who was telling the story, some weird shit happened over there.\nBut the afternoon soaps were starting, and Catherine decided the Harcourt stuff was just rumors. Besides, she had a baseball bat in case any boogey men came calling. She unplugged the phone and let her ass warm the couch. The lights could wait another day.\nBy avoiding work despite the repercussions, Catherine indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower. Other Names: Apathy, cowardice, ignorance\nPossessed by: Couch potatoes, trust-fund heirs, welfare cheatsWrath  The Vice of Wrath is the sin of uncontrolled anger. The wrathful look for ways to vent their anger and frustration on people or objects at the slightest provocation. In most cases the reaction is far out of proportion to the perceived slight. A wrathful person cut off on the freeway might try to force another driver off the road, or a wrathful cop might delight in beating each and every person he arrests, regardless of the offense.\n Your character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he unleashes his anger in a situation where doing so is dangerous. If the fight has already begun, no Willpower points are regained. It must take place in a situation where anger is unwarranted or inappropriate. Example: As April staggered in, Rebecca surprised her at the door, demanding the month's rent. April had gotten hooked on the new drug that had hit the streets. She had spent most of her time day-tripping and having paranoia attacks about 'things eating through the walls of the world.' Rebecca didn't care anymore, and when the usual litany of excuses began, Rebecca hit her. Blood ran from April's nose and down her mouth.\n\"I want. . . the damn. . . rent,\" Rebecca yelled, punctuating each statement with another blow until April was on the ground, balled up and crying.\nBy beating the money out of April, Rebecca indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower. Other Names: Antisocial tendencies, hotheadedness, poor anger management, sadism\nPossessed by: Bullies, drill sergeants, street thugsOnefourninethree Wiki Wiki-navigation Onefourninethree Wiki Ches Profile\u00a0:: Basics\u00a0::  Name\u00a0:: Ches\nNe(e)\u00a0:: Lachesishiro\nName meaning/origin\u00a0:: Lachesis -- One of the Greek Fates.

Many demons end up changing theirs once, or even several times, and often carry a seperate name for different lives. Surnames are not unheard of, but they aren't common. Generally, those who have a strong family backing that is well known (Such as a lineage of Princes) are known to have them as an easy ways of linking them to their family and kin, but others have been known to carry them as well. These names can come from a variety of backgrounds, or be something created simply because it is phonetically pleasing.Title  Titles are interesting things, as they are the source of a demon's power. Commanding one with their their true name and title binds them to your very word. As thus, they tend to keep such secret. They also may carry additional titles based on rank. Thus, those that bind them should preferably be marked by being in italics.Personality Virtues and Vices  Demons naturally are more inclined to give into their darker, sinful sides. As thus, all demons have one virtue and two vices that generally govern how they go about life. As usual, they have one virtue to compliment this.Magic and Combat Ability Scores  Demons have ability scores ranging from the high end to the low, as they are a very diverse species. They also have had time to practice and hone their skills.Affinity and Ability  Each demon is born with an affinity for a certain type of magic, and usually possesses an ability that compliments and makes use of their affinity. For example, Tyrelain Valsharan has an affinity for sound magic, and has the ability of Harmonic Suggestion, while his younger brother, Kireikomi, has an affinity for poison magic and exudes a powerful drug from his lips as his ability. Some, such as the former, must be activated for use while examples such as the latter are in effect at all times.Relationships Family  In Abyssal culture, family comes above all else. Be it comes above all else in those you have to kill to get ahead, or comes above all else in those you must aid and protect, the ties that bind individuals is one of the strongest that exist. To betray one's own blood weighs heavily upon a demon soul, so much so that they are willing to keep silent on some of the most grave offenses done in order to protect them, and keep themselves from soiling the image. Thus, therapy is rarely, if ever, an option when one is troubled.Onefourninethree Wiki Affinities and Abilities  One-four-nine-three is home to many different types of people, each possessing different affinities, and often have an ability to compliment such.Anti-Affinity  The bane of most every demon is the be 'blessed' with an anti-affinity. This causes them difficulties of learning and using magic. Thankfully, such a disability is rare, but there are those who have been known to possess it. Notables with an anti-affinity\u00a0::Energy Sensitivity  Though not always found within those who are blessed with suck, as one may put it, it is increasingly common within them. This mixed blessing allows for one to see a person's store of energy, see residue upon certain enchanted objects, or be able to tell where large amounts of it were spent. Whether this is a birth defect or an ability is unknown, but those who possess it rarely show other abilities. A significant drawback is that, due to the sensitivity, blindness due to the intensity may occur and healing by use of energy may cause more damage. Notables possessing Energy Sensitivity\u00a0::Magical Allergy  Similar to energy sensitivity is an allergy to magic itself. While the cause is unknown, the body reacts negatively to any use of magic, be it healing or the afflicted person trying to cast some. Some believe humans carry the gene within them, as a reason to why they are unable to use magic, but no conclusive evidence of such has been found. Still, those who believe in such think it merely to be an extension to the inability for some cambions and mixed-breeds to be able to use magic. Notables who are allergic to magic\u00a0::Sound Affinity  Notables possessing an affinity to sound\u00a0::Onefourninethree Wiki Enio Onefourninethree Wiki Asmodeus Profile\u00a0:: Basics\u00a0::  Name\u00a0::\nNe(e)\u00a0::\nName meaning/origin\u00a0::\nTitle\u00a0::\nAge\u00a0::\nDate of birth\u00a0::\nPlace of birth\u00a0::\nCurrent Residence\u00a0::\nSex\u00a0::\nRace\u00a0::\nRelationship status\u00a0::\nOrientation\u00a0:: Play-by\u00a0::\nVoice actor\u00a0::\nAccent\u00a0::\nTheme song\u00a0::Appearances\u00a0::  Height\u00a0::\nWeight\u00a0::\nSkin tone\u00a0::\nEye colour\u00a0::\nHair colour\u00a0::\nBuild\u00a0::\nMisc.

It reached full production in September 2005. The car is built by Volkswagen AG subsidiary Bugatti Automobiles SAS and is sold under the legendary Bugatti marque. It is named after racing driver Pierre Veyron, who won the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1939 while racing for the original Bugatti firm. The design of Veyron ressembles the classic Bugatti models such as the Type 35. Bugatti once again claimed the land speed record for production cars on July 4, 2010 with the Veyron Super Sport prototype. At the hands of Bugatti test driver Pierre Henri Raphanel, the Super Sport managed runs of 265.9 and 269.8 mph for an average terminal velocity of 267.81 mph on Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien track. The much awaited 'super-Veyron' sees the car's power output jump from 987 bhp to 1183 bhp and torque from 1250 to 1500 N\u00b7m. According to Bugatti, though, production models will be electronically limited to 257.9 mph to protect the tires.Recent Changes History  Development of the vehicle began with the 1999 EB 18/4 \"Veyron\" concept car. Introduced at the Tokyo Motor Show, it was similar in design and appearance to the final Veyron production car. One major difference was the EB 18/4's use of a W18 engine with three banks of six cylinders. The Veyron was designed by Hartmut Warkuss of Volkswagen rather than Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign who had handled the three prior Bugatti concepts. VW chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch announced the production Veyron at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show. It was promised to be the fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car in history. Instead of the W18, the production model would use a VR6/WR8-style W16 engine. First seen in the 1999 Bentley Hunaudi\u00e8res concept car, the W16 would get four turbochargers, producing a quoted 1001 horsepower (see engine section for details on the power output). Top speed was promised at 403\u00a0km/h (250.4\u00a0mph), and pricing was announced at \u20ac1 million (US$1.3 million at the time). Development continued throughout 2001 and the EB 16/4 Veyron was promoted to \"advanced concept\" status. In late 2001, Bugatti announced that the car, officially called the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, would go into production in 2003. However, the car experienced significant problems during development. Achieving the required high-speed stability was difficult - one prototype was destroyed in a crash and another spun out during a public demonstration at the Monterey Historics event in Mazda Raceway at Laguna Seca. Production of the Veyron was delayed pending resolution of these and other issues. Pi\u00ebch retired that year as chairman of the Volkswagen Group and was replaced by Bernd Pischetsrieder. The new chairman promptly sent the Veyron back to the drawing board for major revisions. Neumann was replaced as Bugatti president by Thomas Bscher in December of 2003, and substantial modifications were made to the Veyron under the guidance of former VW engineer, Bugatti Engineering head Wolfgang Schreiber. After the release of the car, it has been reported that while each Veyron is being sold for \u00a3840,000, the production costs of the car are approximately \u00a35 million per vehicle. This is not the price to produce one vehicle, but rather the cost of the entire Veyron project divided by the number of vehicles produced at that time. As Bugatti, and therefore Volkswagen, are making such a loss, it has been likened by automotive journalist Jeremy Clarkson to Concorde; in that they are test-beds for advancements in technology and developed as exercises in engineering. In the case of the Veyron, it will be several years before Volkswagen will be able to see if their investment in developing ground-breaking technology has paid off. One key measure is how much (if any) of the technology developed for the Veyron finds use in mass-produced cars.Specifications  The Veyron features a W16 engine\u201416 cylinders in 4 banks of 4 cylinders, or the equivalent of two narrow-angle V8 engines mated in a vee configuration. Each cylinder has 4 valves, for a total of 64, but the narrow V8 configuration allows two camshafts to drive two banks of cylinders so only 4 camshafts are needed. The engine is fed by four turbochargers, and it displaces 8.0\u00a0L (7,993\u00a0cc/488\u00a0in\u00b3) with a square 86 by 86\u00a0mm bore and stroke. Putting this power to the ground is a dual-clutch DSG computer-controlled manual transmission with 7 gear ratios via shifter paddles behind the steering wheel boasting an 8 ms shift time. The Veyron can be driven by full automatic transmission. The Veyron also features full-time all-wheel drive developed by UK based Ricardo helping to transfer power to the road. It uses special Michelin run-flat tires designed specifically for the Veyron to accommodate the vehicle's top speed. The car's wheelbase is 2710\u00a0mm (106.3\u00a0in). Overall length is 4462\u00a0mm (175.8\u00a0in). It measures 1998\u00a0mm (78.7\u00a0in) wide and 1206\u00a0mm (47.5\u00a0in) tall. Kerb weight is estimated at 4,160 lb (1888\u00a0kg). This gives the car a power to weight ratio of 529 bhp/tonne. The Bugatti Veyron has a total of 10 radiators.Performance  According to Volkswagen, the final production Veyron engine produces between 1020 and 1040 metric\u00a0hp (1006 to 1026 SAE net\u00a0hp; 750 to 765\u00a0kilowatts), so the car will be advertised as producing \"1001 horsepower\" in both the US and European markets. This makes it the most powerful production road-car engine in history. Peak torque is 1250\u00a0N\u00b7m (922\u00a0ft\u00b7lbf). Top speed was initially promised to be 252\u00a0mph (406\u00a0km/h), but test versions were unstable at that speed, forcing a redesign of the aerodynamics. In May 2005, a prototype Veyron tested at a Volkswagen track near Wolfsburg, Germany, and recorded an electronically limited top speed of 400\u00a0km/h (249\u00a0mph). In October, 2005, Car and Driver magazine's editor Csaba Csere test drove the final production version of the Veyron for the November 2005 issue. This test, at Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien test track, reached a top speed of 253.2\u00a0mph (407.5\u00a0km/h). The Veyron is the quickest production car to reach 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) with an estimated time of 2.5 seconds. It also reaches 200 and 300\u00a0km/h (124 and 186\u00a0mph) in 7.3 and 16.7 seconds respectively. This makes the Veyron the quickest-accelerating production car in history. It also consumes more fuel than any other production car, using 40.4\u00a0L/100\u00a0km (4.82\u00a0mpg) in city driving and 24.1 L/100\u00a0km (10 mpg) in combined cycle. At full-throttle, it uses more than 125 L/100\u00a0km (2.1 mpg)\u2014at full throttle, the Veyron would empty its 100\u00a0L fuel tank in just 12.5 minutes. The car's everyday top speed is listed at 234\u00a0mph (377\u00a0km/h). When the car reaches 137\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h), hydraulics lower the car until it has a ground clearance of about 3 1/2 inches (8.9 cm). At the same time, the wing and spoiler deploy. This is the \"handling\" mode, in which the wing helps provide 770 pounds (3425 newtons) of downforce, holding the car to the road. The driver must, using the key, toggle the lock to the left of his seat in order to use the maximum speed of 253.2 miles per hour (407.5\u00a0km/h). Theoretically it can go faster but it is electronically limited to 253.2 miles per hour (407.5\u00a0km/h) to prevent tire damage. The key functions only when the vehicle is at a stop when a checklist then establishes whether the car\u2014and its driver\u2014are ready to enable 'top speed' mode. If all systems are go, the rear spoiler retracts, the front air diffusers close and the ground clearance, normally 4.9 inches (12.4 cm), drops to 2.6 inches (6.6 cm). The Veyrons' brakes utilize unique cross-drilled and turbine vented carbon rotors, which draw in cooling air to reduce fade. Each caliper has eight titanium pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3\u00a0g on road tires. Prototypes have been subjected to repeated 1.0\u00a0g braking from 194 to 50\u00a0mph (312 to 80\u00a0km/h) without fade. With the car's fearsome acceleration from 50 to 194\u00a0mph (80 to 312\u00a0km/h), that test can be performed every 22 seconds. At speeds above 124\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h), the rear wing also acts as an airbrake, snapping to a 70-degree angle in 0.4 seconds once brakes are applied, providing 0.5 g (6\u00a0m/s\u00b2) of deceleration. Bugatti claims the Veyron will brake from 252\u00a0mph (406\u00a0km/h) to a standstill in less than 10 seconds. The braking is also so evenly applied that the car will not deviate from a straight path if the driver lets go of the steering wheel, even with the brakes fully applied starting from close to top speed. [13]Previews  Gordon Murray, designer of the McLaren F1 said the following about the Bugatti Veyron in UK auto magazine EVO during its development period:Reviews  However, after the car had made production, Murray went on to write an article for another UK auto magazine, Top Gear conceding a lot of his past resentment of the car.  He also declared in the article that: \"The braking is phenomenal,\" \"The primary ride and body control are good too\" and \"It's a huge achievement.\" The trend of backtracking on negative comments about the Veyron continued when prominent UK car show host Jeremy Clarkson declared on Top Gear that it was \"The best car ever made\" after initially saying it was ridiculous and would never exist.[14] He would later extend this by saying he would spend the night with British reality TV star Jade Goody to get his hands on one. The Veyron was then proclaimed the Top Gear Magazine Car of the Year along with the Toyota Aygo and its Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn clones. The Veyron was also declared the Most Innovative Invention of 2006 by Popular Science magazine.Official unveiling  The production Veyron was shown for the first time on October 19, 2005 at the Tokyo Motor Show. The official United States launch for the production version occurred at the 2006 Los Angeles International Auto Show in January. Visual differences between the prototype and production Veyrons are slight, but noticeable marks include the addition of marker lights or reflectors on the front fenders and a more pronounced \"dorsal spine\" on the hood (reminiscent of the Bugatti Atlantic), especially near the windshield. Six Veyrons were sold at the 2005 Dubai Motor Show in December, reportedly including the demonstration models used on the stands there. These would be the first reported private sales of the car.[15] Reports also indicate that deposits have been taken on 45 Veyrons as of December. The first personally owned Veyron was debuted in front of Hotel De Russie in Monte Carlo during the 2005 Grand Prix [16]Sales and service  Bugatti originally planned to build 300 Veyrons over five years. In March 2006, Bugatti president Bscher claimed to have 70 firm orders, selling out 14 months of production. In response, the company is reportedly speeding up production, with all 70 cars expected to be built in 2006. Bscher also reported that 14 cars have been completed and most will be shipped to the United States. It is not clear how many are in the hands of customers. The cars will be sold directly from the factory to customers or at 20 Bentley dealers worldwide. These include dealerships in London, Miami, Troy, Beverly Hills, San Diego, Pasadena, and Greenwich. Maintenance will be possible at Bentley dealerships, but repair service will require a flown-in mechanic, whom the company promises will be available 24 hours a day.Owners  Confirmed owners include:Final numbers  [31] Vehicle type: mid-engine, all-wheel-drive, 2-passenger, 2-door coupe\nBase Price: \u20ac 1,127,210 (\u00a3757 359, $1,440,800)\nEngine type: quad-turbocharged and intercooled DOHC 64-valve W-16, aluminum block and heads, direct fuel injection\nDisplacement: 7993\u00a0cm\u00b3 (488.8 in\u00b3)\nPerformance ratings\u00a0: Top speed (Electronically Limited): 253\u00a0mph (407.5\u00a0km/h)\nTheoretical Top Speed: 257mph (414 km/h) [36] Fuel economy:Gallery  Veyron Veyron Pegaso Edition Veyron Pur Sang Veyron Sang Noir Veyron Fbg par Herm\u00e8s Veyron Grand Sport Veyron Bleu Centenaire Veyron Grand Sport Sang Bleu Veyron Super SportTrivia Awards References External Links  News & ReferencesAutopedia Tesla Model S  The Tesla Model S (\"Project White Star\") is a full-sized battery electric sedan made by Tesla Motors.

When its cars were exported to the United States during the 1950s and 1960s, the name was commonly mispronounced as \"ren-alt\" to and by the American public, and the Americanised pronunciation continues in common usage, though the original French has gained significant ground over recent years. In the United Kingdom it is pronounced \"ren-o\" though the French pronunciation is closer to \"ruh-no\".History Foundation and early years (1898-1918)  Producing cars since late 1898, the Renault corporation was founded in 1899 as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Renault Fr\u00e8res by Louis Renault, his brothers Marcel and Fernand, and his friend Thomas Evert. Louis was a bright, aspiring young engineer who had already designed and built several models before teaming up with his brothers, who had honed their business skills working for their father's textiles firm. While Louis handled design and production, Marcel and Fernand handled company management. The first Renault car, the Renault Voiturette 1CV was sold to a friend of Louis' father after giving him a test ride on December 24 1898. The client was so impressed with the way the tiny car ran and how it climbed the streets that he bought it. The brothers immediately recognized the publicity that could be obtained for their vehicles by participation in motor racing and Renault made itself known through achieving instant success in the first city-to-city races held in France, resulting in rapid expansion for the company. Both Louis and Marcel Renault raced company vehicles, but Marcel was killed in an accident during the 1903 Paris-Madrid race. Although Louis Renault never raced again, his company remained very involved, including their Renault AK 90CV winning the first ever Grand Prix motor racing event in 1906. Louis was to take full control of the company as the only remaining brother in 1906 when Fernand retired for health reasons. The Renault reputation for innovation was fostered from very early on. In 1899, Renault launched the first production sedan car as well as patenting the first turbocharger. At the time, cars were very much luxury items, and the price of the smallest Renaults available being 3000 francs reflected this; an amount it would take ten years for the average worker at the time to earn. As well as cars, Renault manufactured taxis, buses and commercial cargo vehicles in the pre-war years, and during World War I (1914 - 1918) branched out into ammunition, military airplanes and vehicles such as the revolutionary Renault FT-17 tank. Renault became the world's leading manufacturer of airplane engines, and the success of the company's military designs were such that Renault himself was honored by the Allies for his company's contributions to their victory. By the end of the war, Renault was the number one private manufacturer in France.Inter-war years (1919-1938)  Between both world wars, Louis Renault enlarged the scope of his company, producing agricultural and industrial machinery. However, Renault struggled to compete with the increasingly popular small, affordable \"people's cars\", while problems with the stock market and the workforce also adversely affected the company's growth. Renault also had to find a way to distribute its vehicles more efficiently. In 1920, he signed one of its first distribution contracts with Gustave Gueudet, an entrepreneur from northern France. The pre-First World War cars had a distinctive front shape caused by positioning the radiator behind the engine to give a so called \"coalscuttle\" bonnet. This continued through the 1920s and it was not until 1930 that all models had the radiator at the front. The bonnet badge changed from circular to the familiar and continuing diamond shape in 1925. Renault produced a range of cars from small to very large. For example in 1928 which was the year when Renault produced 45,809 cars the range of 7 models started with a 6cv, a 10cv, the Monasix, 15cv, the Vivasix, the 18/24cv and the 40cv. There was a range of factory bodies, of up to 8 styles, and the larger chassis were available to coachbuilders. The number of a model produced varied with size. The smaller were the most popular with the least produced being the 18/24cv. The most expensive factory body style in each range was the closed cars. Roadsters and tourers (torpedoes) were the cheapest. The London operation was very important to Renault in 1928. The UK market was quite large and from there \"colonial\" modified vehicles were dispatched. Lifted suspensions, enhanced cooling and special bodies were common on vehicles sold to the colonies. Exports to the USA by 1928 had almost reduced to zero from their high point prior to WW1 when to ship back a Grand Renault or similar high class European manufactured car was common. A NM 40cv Tourer had a USA list price of over $4,600 being about the same as a V12 Cadillac Tourer. Closed 7 seat limousines started at $6,000 which was more expensive than a Cadillac V16 Limousine. The whole range was fairly conservative engineered and built. The newly introduced 1928 Vivasix, model PG1, was sold as the \"executive sports\" model. Lighter weight factory steel bodies powered by a 3180cc six cylinder motor provided a formula that went through to the Second World War. The \"Le Grand Renaults\", that is any with over 12 foot wheelbase (3.68m), were produced in very small numbers in two major types - six and eight cylinder. The 1928 six cylinder Le Grand Renault models NM, PI and PZ introduced the new three spring rear suspension that considerably aided road holding that was needed as with some body styles over 90mph was possible. The 8 cylinder Reinastella was introduced in 1929. This model lead on to a range culminating in the 1939 Suprastella. All Grand Renaults from 1923 are classed as classics by CCCA. Coachbuilders included Kellner, Labourdette, J.Rothschild et Fils and Renault bodies. Closed car Renault bodies were often trimmed and interior wood work completed by Rothschild. The Le Grand Renaults were built using a considerable amount of aluminium. Engines, brakes, transmissions, floor and running boards and all external body panels were aluminium. Unfortunately of the few that were built many went to scrap to aid the War effort.Post war (1939-1971)  During World War II, Louis Renault's factories worked for Nazi Germany producing trucks with work on cars officially forbidden. He was, for this reason, arrested during the liberation of France in 1944 and died in prison before having prepared his defense. An autopsy later showed that his neck had been broken, suggesting that he was murdered. His industrial assets were seized by the provisional government of France. The Renault factories became a public industry (known as R\u00e9gie Nationale des Usines Renault) under the leadership of Pierre Lefaucheux. In the years immediately following its nationalization Renault experienced something of a resurgence, led by the rear engine 4CV model, which was launched in 1946 and proved itself a capable rival for cars such as the Morris Minor and Volkswagen Beetle, its success (more than half a million sold) making sure it remained in production until 1961. There was also a large mechanically conventional 2-litre 4-cylinder car, the Renault Fregate, from 1951 to 1960. As with earlier Renault models, the company made extensive use of motor racing to promote the 4CV, the car winning both the Le Mans 24 Hours and Mille Miglia races as well as the Monte Carlo rally. However, despite the success of its flagship model, the company continued to be blighted by labor unrest, and indeed continued to be well into the 1980s. The 4CV's replacement, the Dauphine, sold extremely well as the company expanded production and sales further abroad, including Africa and North America. The car did not sell well in North America and it was outdated by the start of the 1960s. In an attempt to revive its flagging fortunes, Renault launched two cars which were to become phenomenally successful \u2013 the Renault 4 and Renault 8 in 1961 and 1962 respectively. The 4 in particular was to continue in production until 1992. Both cars continued Renault's motor racing traditions with great success in rallying, a tradition which was further upheld by collaborations with the Alpine company (which most famously produced the Renault-powered Alpine A110). As well as the 4 and 8, the company achieved success with the more upmarket Renault 16 launched in 1966, which continued Renault's reputation for innovation by being the world's first hatchback larger than subcompact size.Modern era (1972-1980)  The company's compact and economical Renault 5 model, launched in 1972, was another success, particularly in the wake of the 1973 energy crisis. The 5 remained in production until 1984 when it was replaced by the Super5. The formula was much the same however, and the Super5 inherited its styling lines from its father. Endangered like all of the motor industry by the energy crisis, during the mid seventies the already expansive company diversified further into other industries and continued to expand globally, including into South East Asia. The energy crisis also provoked Renault's attempt to reconquer the North American market; despite the Dauphine's success in the United States in the late 1950s, and an unsuccessful car-assembly project in Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Qu\u00e9bec, (1964-1972), Renault had virtually disappeared from North America by the 1970s. However, in the early part of the decade, when the energy crisis-hit continent required smaller, more economical cars, Renault began to make plans to return through a collaborative partnership with the American manufacturer American Motors Corporation (AMC). From 1962 to 1967, Renault assembled Completely Knocked Down (CKD) kits of the Rambler Classic sedans in its factory in Belgium. Renault did not have large or luxury cars in its product line and the \"Rambler Renault\" was aimed as an alternative to the Mercedes-Benz \"Fintail\" cars. Similar to the fate of some of these Mercedes cars at the time, many of these \"American\" Renaults finished their life working as taxis. Later, Renault would continue to make and sell a hybrid of AMC's Rambler American and Rambler Classic called the Renault Torino in Argentina (sold through IKA-Renault). Renault partnered with AMC on other projects, such as development of a rotary concept engine in the late 60s, and would eventually own AMC in 1980. This was one of a series of collaborative ventures undertaken by Renault in the late 1960s and 1970s, as the company established subsidiaries in Eastern Europe, most notably Dacia in Romania, and South America (many of which remain active to the present day) and forged technological cooperation agreements with Volvo and Peugeot (for instance, for the development of the PRV V6 engine, which was used in Renault 30, Peugeot 604, and Volvo 260 in the late 1970s.). In the mid 1960s an Australian arm, Renault Australia, was setup in Heidelberg, Melbourne, which would close in 1981. Interestingly Renault Australia did not just concentrate on Renaults, they also built and marketed Peugeots as well. In North America, Renault formed a partnership with AMC, loaning AMC operating capital and buying a small percentage of the company in late 1979. Jeep was keeping AMC afloat until new products, particularly the XJ Cherokee, could be launched. When the bottom fell out of the 4x4 truck market in early 1980 AMC was in danger of going bankrupt. To protect its investment Renault bailed AMC out with a big cash influx -- at the price of a controlling interest in the company -- 47.5%. Renault quickly replaced some top positions in AMC with their own people. The Renault-AMC partnership also resulted in the marketing of Jeep vehicles in Europe. Some consider the Jeep XJ Cherokee as a joint AMC/Renault project since some early sketches of the XJ series was done as a collaboration of both Renault and AMC engineers (AMC insisted that the XJ Cherokee was designed by AMC personnel; however, a former Renault engineer designed the Quadra-Link front suspension for the XJ series). The Jeep also used wheels and unique rocking seats from Renault. Part of AMC's overall strategy when the partnership was first discussed was to save manufacturing cost by using Renault sourced parts when practical, and some engineering expertise. This led to the improvement of the venerable AMC in-line six -- a Renault/Bendix based port electronic fuel injection system (usually called Renix) that transformed it into a modern, competitive powerplant with a jump from 110 hp to 177 hp with less displacement (4.0L vs. 4.2L). The Renault-AMC marketing effort in passenger cars was not as successful compared to the popularity for Jeep vehicles. This was because by the time the Renault range was ready to become established in the American market, the second energy crisis was over, taking with it much of the trend for economical, compact cars. Renault sold some interesting models in the USA in the 1980s, especially the simple looking but fun Renault Alliance GTA (Renault 9) and GTA convertible \u2013 a real automatic-top convertible with a simple but clean euro-style design featuring a gently sloping hood, as well as a 2.0\u00a0L engine - big for a car of its class; and the ahead-of-its-time Renault Fuego coupe; Renault sold other models in the US during the 1980s. However, Renault sold AMC to Chrysler in 1987 after the assassination of Renault\u2019s chairman, Georges Besse. The Renault Medallion (25 in Europe) sedan and wagon was sold from 1987 to 1989 through Jeep-Eagle dealerships. Jeep-Eagle was the new division Chrysler created out of the former American Motors. However, Renault products were no longer imported into the United States after 1989. A completely new full-sided 4-door sedan, the Eagle Premier, was developed during the partnership between AMC and Renault. The Premier design, as well as its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Bramalea, Ontario, Canada, were the starting point for the sleek LH sedans such as the Eagle Vision and Chrysler 300M. In the late seventies and early eighties Renault increased its involvement in motorsport, with novel inventions such as turbochargers in their Formula One cars. The company's road car designs were revolutionary also \u2013 the Renault Espace was one of the first minivans and was to remain the most well-known minivan in Europe for at least the next two decades. The second-generation Renault 5, the European Car Of The Year-winning Renault 9, and the most luxurious Renault yet, the 25 were all released in the early 1980s, building Renault's reputation, but same time the company suffered of poor product quality which reflected badly to the image of the brand and the ill-fated Renault 14 is seen by many as the culmination of these problems in the early 1980s.Restructuring (1981-1995)  Although its cars were somewhat successful both on the road and on the track, Renault was losing a billion francs a month and reported a deficit of 12.5 billion in 1984. The government intervened and Georges Besse was installed as chairman; he set about cutting costs dramatically, selling off many of Renault's non-core assets, withdrawing almost entirely from motorsports, and laying off many employees. This succeeded in halving the deficit by 1986, but he was murdered by the left wing terrorist group Action Directe in November 1986. He was replaced by Raymond L\u00e9vy, who continued along the same lines as Besse, slimming down the company considerably with the result that by the end of 1987 the company was more or less financially stable. A revitalized Renault launched several successful new cars in the early 1990s, including the phenonemonally successful 5 replacement the Clio, the second generation Espace, the innovative Twingo, the Laguna, and the 19. In mid-1990s introduced successor to R19,Renault M\u00e9gane, was the first car ever to achieve a 4-star rating, the highest at the time, in EuroNCAP crash test in passenger safety. In 1998 Renault introduced M\u00e9gane Sc\u00e9nic, a completely new class of cars, a compact monospace with a footprint of a regular M\u00e9gane. The return to success on the road was matched by a return to success on the racetrack \u2013 Renault-powered cars won the Formula One World Championship in 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1997 with Williams, and in 1995 with Benetton.Privatisation (1996-1999)  It was eventually decided that the company's state-owned status was detrimental to its growth, and Renault was privatised in 1996. This new freedom allowed the company to venture once again into Eastern Europe and South America, including a new factory in Brazil and upgrades for the infrastructure in Argentina and Turkey. It also meant the end of the aforementioned successful Formula 1 campaign. In the twenty-first century, Renault was to foster a reputation for distinctive, outlandish design. The second generation of the Laguna and M\u00e9gane featured ambitious, angular designs which turned out to be highly successful. Less successful were the company's more upmarket models. The Avantime, a bizarre coup\u00e9/ multi-purpose mix vehicle, sold very poorly and was quickly discontinued while the luxury Vel Satis model did not sell as well as hoped. However, the design inspired the lines of the second generation M\u00e9gane, the most successful car of the maker. As well as its distinctive styling, Renault was to become known for its car safety; currently, it's the car manufacturer with the largest number of models achieving the maximum 5 star rating in EuroNCAP crash tests. The Laguna was the first Renault to achieve a 5 star rating; in 2004 the Modus was the first to achieve this rating in its category. The government of France owns 15.7 per cent of the company. Louis Schweitzer has been the Chairman of Renault since 1992 and CEO from 1992 to 2005. In 2005, Carlos Ghosn (also CEO of Nissan) became Renault's CEO, with Louis Schweitzer staying on as Chairman. Renault owns Samsung Motors (Renault Samsung Motors) and Dacia, as well as retaining a minority (but controlling) stake (20%) in the Volvo Group. As of 2004, Renault was the fifth most popular car maker in the United Kingdom behind the Ford Motor Company, Vauxhall Motors, Peugeot and Volkswagen. The most popular French car in the UK is currently the Renault Clio, which has been a strong seller throughout Europe since its launch 14 years ago. For 2004 Renault reported a 43% rise in net income to 3.5 billion \u20ac and 5.9% operating margin, of which Nissan contributed 1,767 million \u20ac. The Group (Renault, Dacia, Renault Samsung Motors) posted a 4.2% increase in worldwide sales to a record 2,489,401 vehicles, representing a global market share of 4.1%. Renault retained its position as the leading brand in Europe with 1.8 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles sold and market share of 10.8%. Renault is exhibiting a Hi-Flex Clio 1.6 16v at the 2006 Paris International Agricultural Show. This vehicle, which addresses the Brazilian market, features Renault-developed flexible-fuel engine technology, with a highly versatile engine that can run on fuel containing petrol and ethanol in any proportion (0% to 100% of either) Renault, together with associated brands Dacia and Renault Samsung, aims to sell 4 million vehicles worldwide in 2010. On June 30, 2006 the media reported that General Motors convened an emergency board meeting to discuss a proposal by shareholder Kirk Kerkorian to form an alliance between GM and Renault-Nissan. The hastily arranged meeting suggests that GM's board is treating Kerkorian's proposal with urgency. Coincidentally, unsubstantiated rumours have been circulating about Renault's possible return to the U.S. market. There is speculation that a GM-Renault-Nissan alliance could pave the way for Renault's return to the U.S. market, since GM could eliminate some of its less profitable brands, and offer the owners of dealerships that would otherwise close Renault dealerships. However, GM CEO Richard Wagner felt that an alliance would benefit Renault's shareholders more than those of GM, and that GM should receive some compensation for it. This did not sit well with Renault; subsequently, talks between GM and Renault have ended on October 4, 2006.The Renault Nissan Alliance (2000\u2014 )  Signed on March 27, 1999, the Renault-Nissan Alliance is the first of its kind involving a Japanese and a French company, each with its own distinct corporate culture and brand identity, linked through cross-shareholding. Renault has a stake of 44.4 per cent in Japanese automaker Nissan while Nissan in turn has a 15 per cent stake (non-voting) in Renault. Together they represent more than 9.8% of the worldwide market (5.74% for Nissan & 4.04% for the Renault group) with sales of 3,597,748 (Nissan) and 2,531,500 (Renault Group), placing the alliance 4th after GM, Toyota & Ford. The marketing success was also matched by success of their return to the Formula 1 circuit as a manufacturer again after buying the Benetton team. The team went on to win both World Drivers and Constructors championships in 2005 and 2006 ahead of the vastly more experienced Ferrari and McLaren teams.Corporate governance  Current members of the board of directors of Renault are:Timeline List of vehicles  Current model line up: Dacia vehicles sold in some markets under the Renault Marque: Renault light commercial vehicles:Earlier models  Renault's range is well known for safety. All of the models, except the Trafic, Clio II, Twingo, and Kangoo (the latter two are expected to be replaced soon while the Clio II to end its production in 2008) have obtained the maximum 5-star safety crash-test rating from EuroNCAP, and became the first maker to have seven cars with this rating. Renault Laguna was the first medium-size car to obtain five-star rating, as well as the Modus and Megane in its own category.Motorsport  Motorsport has long been recognised as an effective marketing tool for automobile manufacturers. In the late seventies and early eighties, Renault began to involve itself more heavily in motorsport, setting up a dedicated motorsport division called Renault Sport, and winning the Le Mans 24 Hours (with the Renault Alpine A442, built in collaboration with newly-acquired Alpine) while achieving success in both rallying (with the Renault 5 Turbo) and Formula One. Initially, Renault's entry into Formula One in 1977 was ridiculed when the team's first design included such curiosities as a turbocharger. However, the team were to win their first race on home soil in Dijon a mere two years later and by the early eighties, every front-running Formula One team used turbochargers. Renault also took over the Benetton F1 team in 2001, and quickly became very competitive, Fernando Alonso winning Renault's first race in its second incarnation at the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix. 2004 saw the Renault team finish a close third in the Constructors' Championsip and in 2005 the team won both Constructors' and Drivers' titles (with Fernando Alonso). Questions have been raised regarding Renault's commitment to its Formula One team, particularly with the appointment of Carlos Ghosn as CEO. However at the 2005 French Grand Prix Ghosn set out his policy regarding the company's involvement in motorsport: In short he will continue Renault's investment in F1 as long as the team is successful and can use the resulting publicity for wider commercial gain. Conversely if the team is unsuccessful in future it can be expected that Ghosn will withdraw resources from the sport. In 2006 Carlos Ghosn finally announced that the team will stay in F1 in the long term (at least until 2012) putting an end to the rumors.Accolades  Renault cars have performed well in the European Car of the Year awards. The is Clio the only car since the prize's conception in 1964 to win the award twice. The Renault 12 (1970), Renault 5 (1972), Renault 20 (1976), Renault 25 (1985) and Renault Laguna (2002) have all achieved runners-up in spot in the competition. Renaults most recent models are well known for their safety, all but 4 of the current models have achieved the maximum 5-star rating by the EuroNCAP crash-test assessment programme. Renault has regularly topped the French car sales charts, fighting off fierce competition from Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot.Overseas Accolades  In 1970 the Renault 12 won the prestigious Australian Wheels Car of the Year award.Typeface  Both the Renault logo and its documentation (technical as well as commercial) had used a specially designed typeface called Renault, developed by British firm Wolff Olins. This type family is said to have been designed not for prestige reasons, but mainly to save costs at a time where the use of typefaces was more costly than it is now. In 2004, French typeface designer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Porchez was commissioned to design a replacement. This was shown in October of that year and is called Renault Identit\u00e9.Miscellanea See also External links Clubs Models Autopedia Ariel Atom  The Ariel Atom is a high performance sports car made by the Ariel Motor Company based in Somerset, England. It is unusual in the respect that the chassis is the body, and therefore lacks a roof, windows and other features commonly found on road cars. It is available with a range of engines; the top of the range being a supercharged Honda Civic Type-R K20 engine and a Supercharged 2.0 Litre 300\u00a0hp 250\u00a0ft/lbs GM Ecotec engine both of which can reach speeds rivaling those of much more expensive automobiles. Although the top speed of approximately 140-150\u00a0mph is relatively tame compared to more exotic sports cars, the high power-to-weight ratio (approximately 500\u00a0bhp/ton) affords it incredible acceleration and control through corners because there is no large amount of weight to throw it out of the turn. The Ariel Atom has received great media interest, most recently when it was featured on the Discovery Channel and tested by Jeremy Clarkson on BBC motoring television programme Top Gear, where it lapped their test track faster than a Porsche Carrera GT, and also creatively re-arranged Clarkson's face because of the open canopy's lack of wind protection. A still image from the show circulated heavily around the time of the show's premiere. The car is featured in the video game Project Gotham Racing 2 for the Xbox console, Project Gotham Racing 3 and Project Gotham Racing 4 for the Xbox 360 console and TOCA Racedriver 3 for the PC, Xbox and PS2. Brammo Motorsports of Ashland, Oregon has signed a deal with Ariel Ltd to manufacture the Atom in the USA. In the USA it is available with the supercharged GM Ecotec engine introduced in 2004 on the Saturn ION Red Line and also used in the Cobalt SS. As of 2008, manufacturing in the United States has been passed to TMI Autotech, Inc. in Alton, Virginia. The Ariel Atom was also used by Wrightspeed to prototype the electric running gear for an entirely new production vehicle which Wrightspeed are raising funds to build. The Atom-based prototype, called the X1, also has incredible acceleration, reaching 60\u00a0mph in 3 seconds. Because the X1 is electric, it has the equivalent fuel consumption of 170 mpg.Recent Changes Specifications Suspension  The Atom\u2019s suspension is derived from single seat racecars and fully adjustable, requiring only a wrench. Both front and rear double unequal length wishbones and inboard, pushrod operated dampers, contribute to the Atom\u2019s dynamic racecar-like handling characteristics. Adjustable suspension rod ends feature inboard rubber/metal bushes to promote a more comfortable road-going ride. The front and rear Bilstein dampers are also adjustable. Stacked light and heavy coil springs impose a low spring rate for minor deflections with higher rate for large deflections.Acceleration  In an issue of Track and Race Car magazine, a comprehensive test was performed on a range of cars, from the Porsche 911 Carrera S, Ford GT, BMW M5 to the Caterham CSR 260 track day car. The Supercharged Ariel Atom 1 won the 2005 0-100-0\u00a0mph test by a clear margin, reaching 100\u00a0mph and then stopping in 10.88 seconds, ahead of the Caterham CSR 260 (11.41) and the Ford GT in 4th (13.17). The following year, they won Autocar's 0-100\u00a0mph challenge with the new Ariel Atom 2 300\u00a0bhp Supercharged edition achieving a time of 6.86 seconds, and then stopping from 100 in 3.8 seconds. The British newspaper The Sunday Times measured its average acceleration from 0 to 60 at 2.89 seconds, making it the world's 3rd fastest accelerating production car available today after the $1.3 million, 1001\u00a0bhp Bugatti Veyron which reaches 0 to 60 in 2.46 seconds, and the Ultima GTR, which reaches 0-60\u00a0mph time in 2.6 seconds.See also References External links  News & References Enthusiast Sites & Community ForumsAutopedia Lexus logo.png Autopedia Automobiles Autopedia Monster Jam  Monster Jam is a live motorsport\u00a0event tour and television show operated by Feld Entertainment and under United States Hot Rod Association (USHRA).External links Autopedia Images with unknown copyright status  Images with unknown copyright status.Autopedia Rayous Autopedia Vehicle manufacturers  This is a list of the known vehicle manufacturers from around the world.Autopedia Toyota Camry  The Toyota Camry is a Japanese Mid-size vehicle manufactured by Toyota since 1982. The Camry has been the best selling car in the United States for eight of the last nine years starting in 1997. The Camry name comes from the English phonetic of the Japanese word \"Kammuri,\" which means \"Crown.\" Over 400,000 American families buy Camrys each year because of its roominess and reliability, in addition to a good value to cost ratio. The Camry also sells very well in Australia and a number of Asian markets, in particular Cambodia where the vast majority of cars are Camrys, but it has not sold as well in Europe. Related luxury models which share major chassis components with the Toyota Camry are the Lexus ES, sold in the United States, and the Toyota Windom, sold in Japan until 2006. The Camry is primarily configured as a four-door sedan but at different times has also been available as a five-door hatchback, two-door coup\u00e9, and a station wagon. The Camry name was first launched in 1980 with the Toyota Celica Camry. The first model line independently named the Toyota Camry was launched in 1982 for the 1983 model year. An offshoot of the Camry, the Toyota Camry Solara, has been available as a coupe and a convertible. The Camry underwent major redesigns and upgrades in model years 1987, 1992 (1990 in Japan), 1997, 2002 and most recently in 2007. Other than the original Celica Camry, the Toyota Camry has always been an FF layout vehicle. This means the engine is transversely mounted to drive the front wheels. Some models have been offered with all-wheel drive. The second and third-generation Camrys were rebadged to be sold as the Holden Apollo in Australia. The Holden equivalents were not successful even though they came from the same factory as the Camry. Since 2000, Daihatsu has sold a Camry twin named the Altis. See Autopedia's comprehensive Toyota Camry Review.Recent Changes  The Toyota Camry underwent major redesigns and upgrades in model years 1987, 1992 (1990 in Japan), 1997, 2002, and most recently in 2007. The 2007 Toyota Camry tries to combine the best of both worlds: maintain the dependability and safety that has made the model so popular, while adding a little more aggressive styling to counter the main complaint that the Camry is boring. Toyota also offers a hybrid gas/electric Camry that uses technology similar to that of the Toyota Prius, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, and Lexus RX 400h for better gas-mileage around town. For more information see: Toyota Camry Hybrid.Styles and Major Options Pricing  MSRP for the 2008 Camry ranges from just over $18,000 for the base level CE to close to $29,000 for the XLE version with a high-powered V6 and navigation system. Today's actual prices by city can be found at CarsDirect.Gas Mileage  EPA estimates for the Toyota Camry are as follows:Reliability  According to Consumer Reports, reliability of the 4-cylinder and hybrid 2007 Camrys is well above average, while the V6 version is below average (rare for Toyota) due to an automatic transmission problem.Warranty Safety  There are seven airbags (Front Impact, Passenger Side Impact, Front-Seat Side and Full-Length Side, and a Driver Knee airbag) standard on all 2007 Camry trims, as well as four-wheel anti-lock brakes. The 2008 Camry recieved the best possible score for front-end collision safety and for side-impact safety for both front and rear seats. For more information see Toyota Camry Crash Test Results When the current generation Camry underwent crash testing by ANCAP, it scored 4 stars out of 5. See ANCAP result for 2006 Toyota Camry and ANCAP result for 2006 Toyota Camry Ateva (curtain airbags).Previous Generations' Crash Test Results  Both the NHTSA and the IIHS publish crash information for the third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation Camry. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) scores crash ratings as one to five stars for front and side crashes. Similarly, the IIHS scores crash performance with a four-level grade (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, and Poor) in multiple categories and overall. This model Camry scored 4 stars when tested by ANCAP in 2002. See ANCAP result for 2002 Toyota Camry.Fifth generation  The fifth generation Camry was tested for front, side, and rollover crashes (NHTSA) and rear, side (with and without side airbags), and frontal offset crashes (IIHS). The fifth-generation frontal performance was similar to that for the fourth-generation. [2] [3] It was also again listed as a BEST PICK in frontal crashes. Similarly, IIHS side impacts with airbags was rated as good overall with good in most categories. However, side crash performance without airbags was only two stars in 2002 NHTSA and poor, the lowest score on the IIHS scale. Three out of the nine categories were scored as poor, including Head protection, driver, Injury:Head/neck, and Injury:Torso, rear passenger. The IIHS website notes that although Toyota changed the design of 2004 Camrys to improve side performance, the changes would not significantly impact the crash performance of vehicles without side airbags. NHTSA rollover performance is listed as five stars for 2001 models and four stars thereafter. IIHS rear-crash performance was rated as marginal for Camrys with cloth seats and poor for Camrys with leather seats. [4]Fourth generation  The fourth-generation Camry was tested for frontal and side impacts NHTSA and frontal offset IIHS crashes, but scored significantly better than the third generation in all frontal tests. Additionally, the IIHS website lists the 1997-2001 Camry as being a BEST PICK in frontal crash tests. The NHTSA gave the Camry four stars in side impact tests when fitted with side airbags and three stars without. [5]Third generation  The third-generation Camry was tested only frontal (NHTSA) and frontal offset (IIHS) crashes. NHTSA gave the vehicle four stars for the driver and between three and four stars for the passenger, depending on the year. The IIHS scored it acceptable overall, with three out of six categories listed as good and the other three listed as acceptable. In comparison, the similar-vintage Honda Accord fared similarly (although somewhat worse) [6], the Ford Taurus did notably better [7], and the Nissan Maxima performed much worse[8].Photos Colors  Colors available vary by trim.Main Competitors Unique Attributes  While by definition the \"Best Selling Car In America\" will have to appeal to the common denominator, the 2007 Toyota Camry does offer a few features that go beyond the basic: Of the cars surveyed by the RACV, the 2002-2006 Toyota Camry are the cheapest medium (4 cylinder version) and large (6 cylinder version) cars to run on a weekly basis. In the Middle East, Camrys are popular with drifters despite being front wheel drive. The Toyota Camry is Australia's first locally-built car to utilise double overhead cam.Resale Values  All Toyota models have high resale values because of very high vehicle reliability and supply / demand characteristics for each model that enable Toyota to not discount the sales price on the current model year (steep discounts on current model year vehicles causes resale values to drop for earlier model years.) Within the mid-size car segment, the Camry typically battles with the Honda Accord for best resale values.Criticisms Generations Sixth Generation (2007- present)  The sixth generation Camry is a completely redesigned model and is assembled at the Toyota plant in Georgetown, Kentucky as well as at Toyota Manufacturing in Japan. Starting in 2007, the Camry will also be manufactured at Subaru's Lafayette, Indiana plant, about 100,000 units per year. In Subaru's plant, Toyota will set up its own machinery and assembly line to manufacture the Camry. A Camry manufactured in Japan is denoted with a VIN starting with \"J\" as well as a small hatch on the passenger's side of the front bumper, used to secure the vehicle during shipping over the ocean, US made models are denoted with a VIN starting with \"4\". It was released as a 2007 model making its first introduction at the 2006 North American International Auto Show [9] along with its identical hybrid twin, the Camry HV. In 2010, after Toyota began finding success in NASCAR, the Toyota Camery NASCAR Edition was released. The new Camry has a 2.4\u00a0L I4 making 158\u00a0hp (118\u00a0kW) with 4 trim levels: CE, LE, SE, and XLE. It will also have an optional 3.5\u00a0L V6 making 268\u00a0hp (200\u00a0kW) with three trims: LE, SE, and XLE. The V6 will be available with a 6-speed sequential transmission. A spilt-folding rear seat is not available on the SE trim. A navigation system with a cell phone link and heated leather seats are available for the SE and the V6-powered XLE. A keyless entry/remote starter is optional on the V6-powered XLE. The CE and LE have hubcap designs similar to the previous generation models. The rear of the car features the controversial \"Bangle-butt\" design first seen on the 2002 BMW 7 Series. The South East Asian Camry has a styling that look like Toyota Aurion. The sixth generation Camry will also be built in Australia. There, it goes on sale on July 22, 2006. For the first time in 18 years, the Australian-market Camry will lack a V6 engine. The only option will be a 2.4L I4 which is expected to produce 125 kW (168hp).Camry Hybrid  For 2006, Toyota has created a hybrid gas/electric Camry called the Camry Hybrid to be introduced alongside the redesigned 2007 Toyota Camry . It uses a Hybrid Synergy Drive setup similar to that of the Toyota Prius, Toyota Highlander Hybrid and Lexus RX 400h, which mates Toyota's 3MZ V6 with an electric motor. However, the Camry Hybrid will utilize a 4-cylinder gasoline engine as opposed to a V6, a setup that will produce 192\u00a0hp (143\u00a0kW). Standard features include remote entry and start, side torso airbags, knee airbags and side-curtain airbags. The Camry Hybrid will be built at the company's Georgetown, Kentucky plant, with about 45,000 projected per year. For more information see: Toyota Camry Hybrid.Main Competitors Fifth generation (2002\u20132006)  In September 2001, the latest Toyota Camry was released as a larger sedan (taking styling cues from the successful Vitz, Corolla and Solara coup\u00e9) only, but without a station wagon for the first time (a similarly styled wagon was sold on the Japanese home market however, as the Toyota Mark II Blit). Elsewhere, the Camry station wagon was replaced by the Highlander crossover SUV. This model was launched in most export markets, including the United States, as a 2002 model year car. The styling of the fifth-generation Camry is somewhat similar to the fourth-generation model in that both have gently curved surfaces accented by sharp creases. However, the front end of the car is relatively short, leaving a great deal of the length to the cabin, a technique adopted by compact cars. In contrast to the fairly squat fourth-generation Camry, the fifth generation is a decidedly tall vehicle. It is 2.5\u00a0in (64\u00a0mm) taller and has a 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) longer wheelbase than the previous model. In the United States for 2002, the basic CE model was dropped but the SE sport model was reintroduced. Both the LE and SE models are available with a manual transmission when equipped with the four-cylinder engine now up to 3.0 \u00a0L and 255 nbsp;hp (122\u00a0kW). Any model may be equipped with a V6 or an automatic transmission, although the manual transmission is not available on V6 models. The 2002 Camry Solara remained on the fourth generation chassis, and received only minor styling upgrades to the front and rear ends. However the Solara did receive the same 2.4\u00a0L I4 engine now available on the Camry. In late 2004, the 2005 Camry was introduced with new upgrades such as a chrome grille (though the SE had a sportier grille), a new taillight design, and new wheels. A new trim level was added (the standard model) priced lower than the Camry LE. Interior upgrades to the Camry included a rear center head restraint, a storage bin in the door, optitron gauges, and standard leather seating on XLE V6 models. The second generation Camry Solara was introduced in August 2004. Again, styling from the Camry was radically different, taking design cues from the Lexus SC 430. The 2.4\u00a0L engine was still offered, however, a new 3.3\u00a0L V6 was optional. The V6 was coupled with a 5-speed automatic transmission. In addition to SE and SLE trims, a new SE Sport was offered. Unlike the first generation Solara, the SLE trim could be had with the four-cylinder engine. Daihatsu continued with its twin Altis model for the Japanese market.Taiwan  The Camry in Taiwan of this generation looked very similar to other versions, but the front end had a \"thicker\" grille and larger, all-white, differently shaped headlights [10]. The reverse lights were moved onto the trunk and were somewhat similar to the lights on a second generation Avalon's trunk [11]. The older models (2002), had tail lights with a white streak across them [12], while some later models (2004 and later) did not [13].Australia  The new fifth generation Toyota Camry has been refreshed with the new model lineup. The Altise is the base model that replaced the CSI. The model lineup moves to the Ateva, the Grande and the top-of-the-range Azure. There is also a sports model, the Sportivo. All models come with either a 2.4 litre 4 cylinder and 3 litre V6 engines.Main Competitors Fourth generation (1997\u20132001)  The fourth-generation Camry was launched in Japan in December 1996. It continued as a sedan and station wagon (called the Camry Gracia in Japan), though the latter model was not sold in the United States. This generation was launched in the US for the 1997 model year. In 2000, the sedan models received a mid-model upgrade to the front and rear fascias, but remained otherwise similar to the 1999 models. The Japanese Scepter ceased to exist as the Japanese Camrys adopted the 1795\u00a0mm wide platform. The Vista began departing from the Camry, remaining 1700\u00a0mm wide and eventually forming the basis of the growing Corolla. In addition, the Vista's sheetmetal resembled a tall, formal sedan, while the Camry became sleeker. This \"split\" continues today. The Lexus ES 300 was again built from the Windom, which uses the Camry chassis.   The Camry Solara was added in both coup\u00e9 and convertible form in 1999. In contrast to the third-generation Camry two door, the Camry Solara was a significant styling departure from the four door. The Solara was available in SE and SLE trim, corresponding roughly to the sedan's LE and XLE trims. In the United States, the four door Camry SE was dropped and the base model was renamed the CE for the 1997 model year. Both the LE and the XLE trims were carried over from the previous generation. All models of Camry were initially available with either the 2.2\u00a0L I4 or the 3.0\u00a0L V6 engine, except the Solara SLE, which was only available with the V6. The LE-based Collector Edition was new for 2001 model year. Power was increased slightly to 133\u00a0hp SAE (99\u00a0kW) for the 5S-FE 2.2\u00a0L I4 and 194\u00a0hp SAE (145\u00a0kW) for the 1MZ-FE V6. Manual transmissions were only available on the CE and LE trim levels and any Solara model. For the General Export Market, the Camry was offered as 2.2 GLX and 3.0 V6 Grande. This was the first Camry to be sold as a Daihatsu; the Daihatsu Altis was identical to the export version of the Camry. The Camry V6 was again on Car and Driver magazine's 10 Best list for 1997.Australia  In Australia, unlike the previous generation, the nameplate Camry was also applied to the V6 variants, while the Vienta V6 range was revised as the \"upmarket\" models. The line-up of 4 cylinder Camry models consisted of the CSI, Conquest and CSX models (automatic transmission is most common, manual is very rare), all three variants were available in sedan or wagon. The Camry V6 models consisted of CSI and Conquest, with the wagon models only available in automatic transmission. The Camry V6 Touring Series sedan model was launched in March 1999. The Vienta line up consisted of VXI and Grande sedan models and the VXI wagon. The VXI model was basically a V6-powered version of the 4-cylinder Camry CSX model. In September 2000, the revised Camry range was launched. The Vienta V6 range was discontinued due to the launch of the Toyota Avalon sedan in July 2000 and two new models were added to the Camry range: the top-of-the-range Azura V6 sedan and the Touring Series V6 sportswagon model, both of which were available in automatic transmission only. Towards the end of the model run, the limited edition Intrigue and Advantage sedan models were launched.Main Competitors Third generation (1992\u20131996)  The third-generation Camry (first sold in 1990 in Japan; in the US as a 1992 model year car) is regarded as the first to break into the large-car market, or what Toyota billed at the time as \"world-sized\". This model marked the transition away from an inexpensive four door vehicle into a larger, more luxurious family sedan. However, in Japan, the 1992 Camry was a different vehicle, which shared its doors and fenders with the exported model, but was limited to the 1700\u00a0mm (66.9\u00a0in) width required to fit into a lower tax bracket (the 'number 5' bracket). The wider export model was called the Toyota Scepter in its home market. In the United States, an automatic transmission became the only option on all but the base and sport-model Camrys, whereas previously, a manual transmission was available on nearly all trim levels. In that market, both the four and six-cylinder engines received upgrades in displacement and power: the four was upped to 2.2\u00a0L and 130\u00a0hp SAE (97\u00a0kW), and the V6 to 3.0\u00a0L and 185\u00a0hp SAE (137\u00a0kW). In addition to the DX (also sometimes called Deluxe) and LE trims, 1992 saw the addition of an XLE luxury trim and the SE sport trim\u2014presumably introduced to compete with the Nissan Maxima SE. Some other countries followed the 2.2\u00a0L and 3.0\u00a0L engine choice. Toyota in New Zealand sold these models as the 220 and V6 respectively, the smaller-engined car filling the gap of the departed Corona. It shared the rounded-body-panel look of many imports of similar vintage: the Toyota Corolla, Honda Accord, and Nissan Altima, to name a few. This was a departure from the second-generation models which, although they had many more rounded panels than the first-generation Camrys, were nevertheless generally slab-sided in shape. The third-generation Camrys had rounded features and a very curved silhouette. The Vista continued in parallel, available in addition as a hardtop sedan. This is a similar car to the then new Windom, which formed the basis of the Lexus ES 300 in foreign markets, equipped with a 3.0\u00a0L V6 engine. In 1994, Toyota released a coupe version of the Camry with styling very similar to the four door version. This vehicle would be dropped for the next generation, although it would later be replaced by the Camry Solara. The same year, the Japanese home market saw a revised, 1700\u00a0mm wide Camry and Vista, with different sheetmetal, on the same platform. (The Japanese version of this page lists this as a 'fifth-generation' model.) The third-generation Camry was on Car and Driver magazine's \"10 Best\" list for 1992 and 1993.Australia  In Australia, the Camry 4-cylinder models consisted of the Executive, CSI and Ultima sedan models (automatic only). The V6 range was known as the Camry Vienta and also consisted of the Executive, CSI and Ultima sedan model. The Camry Vientas were available in automatic transmission only. In 1993, a new sedan model called the Touring Series was launched which was fitted with sports suspension. In 1994, the range was revised slightly, where the Executive models was renamed CSI and the CSI was renamed the CSX model. Remember, that all models had the choice of having optional extras fitted at the buyers expense. This means you will find some variations, but the CSX models were considered to be Top of the range in 4cyl and the Vienta was top of the range in V6. In July 1995, the facelifted model was launched in Australia and was now built at the new Altona plant. This also marked the beginning of the exporting of left-hand drive Camrys to the Middle East. The 4 cylinder range consisted of the CSI and CSX models. The V6 models were simply known as the Vienta. The Ultima sedan was renamed the Grande model, and manual transmission was now available in the CSI and Touring Series sedan models. Towards the end of the model run, limited edition Getaway and Intrigue sedan models were launched. See Autopedia's comprehensive Third-generation Toyota Camry Review.Main Competitors Second generation (1987\u20131991)  The second-generation model debuted in 1986 for the 1987 model year, and included a station wagon but dropped the hatchback. At this point, it was still regarded as a mid-size car. In 1988, all-wheel drive (called All-Trac) and a 160\u00a0hp JIS (118\u00a0kW) 2.5\u00a0L V6 engine were added as options for the first time. The V6 featured dual overhead camshafts, much like the upgraded 130\u00a0hp JIS (96\u00a0kW) 4 cylinder. In 1991, anti-lock brakes became optional on the V6, LE, and wagon models. The Kentucky plant also began producing Camrys in 1988, where three trim levels of the second-generation Camry were made: the unbadged base model, the DX, and the LE. The 2.5\u00a0L engine and Camry chassis was repackaged as the upscale Lexus ES 250. The ES 250 was essentially the Japanese-market Camry hardtop. The second-generation Camry was extremely popular in the United States and it is not at all uncommon to see examples on American roads. The 1987 Camry marked the first generation of Camry to be built in Australia. A 1.8L 4 cylinder EFI, with 64 kW (86hp) was standard on the base model, while a 2.0L 4 cylinder EFI, with 88 kW (116hp) was available on all others. In 1988, a 2.5L V6 was introduced. The V6 sat the very top of the range, and was the only model to be imported from Japan. Due to its positioning in the line-up, and the high import duty it attracted, it was very expensive, and only sold in small numbers. In 1989, the 1.8L Camry was dropped, and the base engine was replaced with a non-fuel injected 2.0L engine, producing 82 kW (110hp).Main Competitors First Generation/Origins  There is some dispute over the generational naming of the Toyota Camry. Most sources note the first generation Camry to have been produced as a 1983 model. A fewer number of sources state the first generation to have started in 1980 as the Toyota Celica Camry. This article follows the former convention.Toyota Celica Camry (1980\u20131982)  Originally launched as the Toyota Celica Camry in January 1980 for the Japanese home market, this model was essentially a second-generation Toyota Carina with updated body-styling and a front-end that resembled a 1978 Toyota Celica XX (known as the Celica Supra in export markets). The car used the rear-wheel drive Celica platform (which was shared by both the Corona and Carina) and was powered by either a 1.6\u00a0L 12T-U engine producing 88\u00a0hp JIS (65\u00a0kW) and 128\u00a0N\u00b7m (94\u00a0ft\u00b7lbf) or a 1.8\u00a0L 13T-U engine producing 95\u00a0hp JIS (70\u00a0kW) and 147\u00a0N\u00b7m (108\u00a0ft\u00b7lbf). Towards the end of its model lifecycle, Toyota introduced a sports version of the Celica Camry equipped with the 16-valve DOHC 2.0\u00a0L engine from the Celica. This is the most sought after version of the Celica Camry in the secondhand market today. Although it has an identical 2500\u00a0mm (98.4\u00a0in) wheelbase to the Celica, the Corona, and the Carina, it is longer than the Carina but shorter than both the Corona and Celica. During its model cycle, over 100,000 units were sold in Japan. The Celica Camry was also exported to a number of markets using the Carina's name, and it replaced the second-generation Carina in those markets.First generation (1983\u20131986)  In 1982 for the 1983 model year, the Camry became an independent model line, and was sold as a mid-size four-door sedan and five-door hatchback. There were limited exports, predominantly to right-hand-drive markets. At this point, Camry was positioned above the Carina and Corona, two other mid-sized models made by Toyota. A twin was announced at this point: the Toyota Vista. In North America, the Camry, which replaced the Corona, was available with a 92\u00a0hp SAE (68\u00a0kW) 2.0\u00a0L I4 engine or a 74\u00a0hp 2.0\u00a0L I4 turbodiesel engine, and could be purchased with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic. In contrast to the rear-wheel drive Celica Camry, the Toyota Camry was a front-wheel drive vehicle built on an all-new platform. The design of the first-generation Camry fit well within the box-shaped trends of the early 1980s. Additionally, the vehicle size and available options were characteristic of Japanese-designed cars of the time; the Camry was a small, inexpensive sedan with solid but spartan construction and competed indirectly against larger American counterparts.Main Competitors Camry In Popular Culture Worldwide  The Camry is consistently ranked as one of the most popular vehicles in the North American market. It is Toyota's \"bread-and-butter\" vehicle, so its marketing and sales strategy is cautious, aimed squarely at the center of buyer demographics, as most Camry buyers are not car enthusiasts. The Camry is positioned directly below the Toyota Avalon and the Lexus ES 350 in its two largest markets, Australia and North America. It is considered a sub-luxury mid-size sedan. The Camry is rarely optioned above the Avalon or ES 350, but a fully equipped Corolla slightly overlaps with the base-model Camry. The Camry was less popular in Europe, where the design was considered bland and incompatible with European driving habits. Toyota positioned the Camry as a BMW 5 Series rival, yet it lacked the cachet to compete. Following long-term poor sales, the Camry was withdrawn altogether from Europe in 2004, leaving the smaller, UK-built Avensis as the top-of-the-line sedan. Because there is no station wagon version for the fifth generation Camry, the Camry sedan and the Avensis station wagon are sold side by side in markets like New Zealand. After the introduction of the fourth-generation Camry, sales in Japan dipped. Prior to the fourth generation, Toyota adapted the Camry's design to suit Japanese tax laws and domestic market requirements. These versions of the Camry are bounded by a certain set of dimensions which would otherwise be unsuitable for export markets. These modified-for-Japan models were called the Vista, which became separate from the Camry in 2000. For the fourth-generation Camry, Toyota decided to split the Vista from the Camry. Both models still share a large number of components, but the fourth-generation split was more significant than the previous re-engineered splits. Though the Vista was sized according to domestic vehicle tax laws, the Camry (now called the Camry Gracia) was identical to those sold in foreign markets. This placed the Camry at a disadvantage as it was sized at the lower-end of a higher tax category, which included cars such as the Crown and Aristo, both aimed at a higher-end market than the Camry. The introduction of the A32-series Nissan Cefiro in 1994 may have prompted Toyota to change its strategy, despite the poor sales of the Scepter, basically a rest-of-the-world third-generation Camry, which was sold between 1992\u20131994 (only 4,885 units sold in total). The continued success of the Nissan Cefiro (and afterwards the Nissan Teana) meant that some customers were willing to pay extra taxes for a larger family car, and so this marketing strategy continued. As of 2005, the Camry is produced at Toyota plants in Japan, Australia; and Georgetown, Kentucky, USA, with CKD assembly operations in Vietnam, Philippines; and Thailand. It is also assembled from CKD-kits at Toyota's local partners in Malaysia and Taiwan. [1] The Camry was imported into China as the Toyota Jiamei until 2005. Thereafter, the car was assembled locally and known as the Toyota Kaimeirui, which sounds closer to \"Camry\".  Camrys built in Australia are exported to New Zealand, the Middle East, South Africa and South Pacific islands.Trivia  The latest generation Camry introduces a raised trunk lid, previously seen on the second generation Avalon.Awards  The Camry has won numerous awards, including most recently the 2007 Motor Trend Car of the Year.See also External Links Autopedia Ford GT90  The Ford GT90 was a concept car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. It was unveiled in January 1995, at the Detroit Auto Show as \"the world's mightiest supercar\". Claimed performance included a top speed close to 250 mph (402 km/h) from a 720 hp (537 kW) quad-turbocharged V12 engine. The mid-engined car was a spiritual successor to the Ford GT40, taking from it some styling cues, such as doors that cut into the roofline, but little else. All angles and glass, the Ford GT90 was the first Ford to display the company's \"New Edge\" design philosophy. The GT90 was built around a honeycomb-section aluminum monocoque and its body panels were moulded from carbon fiber. The GT90 was built by a small team in just over six months and, as a result, borrowed many components from another high profile stablemate\u2014the Jaguar XJ220. The all-round double wishbone suspension and the five-speed manual gearbox came from the Jaguar, while the engine was from another member of the Ford family. The GT90's 48-valve V12 was a six-litre engine which, if Ford had ever produced it in volume, might have produced up to 720 hp (537 kW), thanks to four Garrett Systems T2 turbochargers. The engine was based on the Ford Modular engine. Two V8 engines each had portions removed, and the cut down engines were welded together. In total, this yielded a 90-degree V-12, with 90.2 mm bore and 77.3 mm stroke. .Unique Attributes  Ceramic insulation tiles - these prevent the exhaust heat from melting the body panels.Criticisms  \"I actually drove the car.

The truck shares the stretched Nissan F-Alpha platform with the Nissan Armada and Infiniti QX56 SUVs, and is manufactured in Canton, Mississippi. See Autopedia's comprehensive Nissan Titan Review.Recent Changes  According to the Wall Street Journal, Nissan is planning a heavy-duty version of the Titan, to compete with the F-250/F-350, the Silverado 2500/3500, and the Ram 2500/3500. Not much is known about it except that it is expected to be released in late 2009.Styles and Major Options  The Titan is available in 4 different trims (XE (Base), SE, Pro 4X, and LE).

The Tundra hovered just over 100,000 units annual sales when the larger Titan was introduced, while the Ram sold 400,000 and the Silverado/Sierra and F-Series sold 900,000 annually. During the first full year of production (December 2003 to December 2004), 85,920 Titans were sold, while the Dodge Ram declined somewhat and the F-150 jumped to nearly 950,000. 86,945 Titans were sold in 2005. 126,529 Toyota Tundras were sold in 2005.Hybrid Models  At this time, Nissan has no plans to create a hybrid version of the Titan.

Audi announced in 2005 that the name of the successful Audi R8 race car would be used for a new road car in 2007, the Audi R8, based on the Audi Le Mans Quattro concept car, which appeared at the 2003 Geneva Auto Show and 2003 International Motor Show. The R8 was officially launched at the Paris Auto Show on 30 September 2006. There is some confusion with the name which the car shares with the Le Mans winning R8 LMP. Originally, many thought the car would be called the R9 (as there is a gap in numbering left when Audi announced the R8's successor, the diesel-powered R10).Recent Changes Styles and Major Options Pricing  Add more fields as necessary.Gas Mileage  Add more fields as necessary. As seen on the FuelEconomy.gov website, the City/Highway MPG averages are as follows:Engine  The Audi R8 will be available with a 4.2 L V8 making 420\u00a0hp, as seen in the Audi RS4. Pricing for the 420\u00a0bhp model starts from \u20ac104,400 or \u00a377,000 (Approx. $140,000 USD). The R8 has a dry weight of 1560\u00a0kg (3439\u00a0lb). A 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (0-60\u00a0mph) time of about 4.2 seconds is possible with a top speed of about 187\u00a0mph(301\u00a0km/h).Future upgrades  A second, more powerful engine variant that uses a 520-hp 5.2 L V10, a enlargened version of the Lamborghini Gallardo's engine and already seen in the Audi S8, is rumoured but not confirmed by Audi. Audi is currently in the process of developing a new turbocharged 5.2 L V10 engine for the future Audi RS6, and there is a possibility that this engine will make its way into the R8, dependent on marketing decisions. Test mules of this vehicle are developing well in excess of 600\u00a0bhp with the turbocharged 5.2 L V10. If this were to happen it is almost certain that this would create an RS8. According to some sources the 6.0 liter V12 TDI diesel engine from Audi Q7 has been confirmed to Audi R8 as well. This would make Audi R8 by far the fastest diesel powered car in the world with 0 \u2013 100\u00a0km/h acceleration in less than 4 seconds.Performance  The 2-seat coupe is already available in Europe, and will be made available to the USA in the summer of 2008. In addition, an open-top roadster, Porsche Carrera GT-like model is rumoured to follow in 2009. Many publications were hailing it as the first car to truly be able to beat Porsche - considered by many to be one of the best supercars ever made, and the leader in its class. Initial comparison tests have proven quite positive in this respect; Evo Magazine in its comparison test between the R8, 911 Carrera 4S, Aston Martin V8 Vantage, and BMW M6 have claimed that the Audi is a better supercar saying that \"Audi humbles Porsche. A new dawn starts today.\" Other publications have also made similar reviews of the Audi beating the Porsche in comparison tests.

Originally the term Land Rover referred to one specific vehicle, a pioneering civilian all-terrain utility vehicle launched on April 30, 1948, at the Amsterdam Motor Show, but was later used as a brand for several distinct models, all four-wheel drive. Starting out as part of The Rover Car Company or Rover, Land Rovers were designed and manufactured as a range of four-wheel drive vehicles under a succession of owners, including British Leyland, British Aerospace and BMW. Today, the marque is part of the Tata Group (along with Jaguar) after a 7 year stint in the now defunct Premier Automotive Group, a division of the Ford Motor Company. Land Rover is one of the longest lived SUV brands (the only brand which is older is Jeep).Manufacturing & Business  Land Rovers are manufactured primarily at the Solihull plant, near Birmingham, England. Production of the \"Freelander\" (2) was moved to the Jaguar car factory at Halewood near Liverpool, a former Ford car plant. Defender models are assembled under license in several locations worldwide, including Brazil and Turkey. The former BL/Rover Group technical centre at Gaydon in Warwickshire is home to the Land Rover corporate and R&D headquarters.2008 Sale  On 11 June 2007, Ford announced that its plan to sell Land Rover, along with Jaguar. Ford retained the services of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and HSBC to advise it on the details of the deal. The buyer, possibly to a private equity group, was initially expected to be announced by September 2007, but the sale was delayed and an announcement shall not be made until the end of 2007. A UK based private equity firm, Alchemy Partners, besides Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra (both from India) have expressed interest in purchasing Jaguar and Land Rover from the Ford Motor Company. Before the sale was announced, Anthony Bamford, chairman of British excavators manufacturer JCB had expressed interest in purchasing Jaguar Cars in August, the year previously; only to back out later when told the sale would also involve Land Rover, which he did not intend to buy. Tata Motors have received endorsements from the Transport And General Worker's Union (TGWU)-Amicus combine and Ford as a preferred bidder. On March 25, 2008, a deal was made to sell Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata for $2 billion.History  The first Land Rover was designed in 1947 in the United Kingdom (on the island of Anglesey in Wales) by Maurice Wilks, the chief designer at the British car company Rover, as a farm vehicle that could be used for everything from ploughing fields to driving in town. It is said that he was inspired by an American World War II Jeep that he used one summer at his holiday home in Wales . The first Land Rover prototype 'centre steer' was built on a Jeep chassis. A distinctive feature has been their bodies, constructed of a lightweight rustproof proprietary alloy of aluminium and magnesium called Birmabright. This material was used owing to post war steel shortages and a plentiful supply of post-war aircraft aluminium. This metal's resistance to corrosion was one of the factors that allowed the vehicle to build up a reputation for longevity in the toughest conditions. The early choice of colour was dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early vehicles only came in a shade of light green; all models until recently feature sturdy box section ladder-frame chassis. The early vehicles, such as the Series 1, were designed to be field-serviced; advertisements for Rovers have bragged about vehicles driven thousands of miles on banana oil. Now with more complex service requirements this is less of an option. The British Army maintains the use of the mechanically simple 2.5 litre 4 cylinder 300TDi engined versions rather than the electronically controlled 2.5 litre 5 cylinder TD5 to retain some servicing simplicity. This engine also continued in use in some export markets. Land Rovers, particularly the commercial and military models, became ubiquitous throughout rural areas and in the developing World. The Land Rover featured in the South African movie The Gods Must Be Crazy illustrates the love-hate relationship many owners feel with the earlier Series 1, 2 and 3 vehicles. Land Rovers have competed in the Paris Dakar Rally as well as being the vehicle used for the Camel Trophy as part of a sponsorship deal. The Land Rover Defender is also used by military forces throughout the world. In the UK armed forces, the very expensive Pinzgauer, now built in the UK, is increasingly common in roles previously the preserve of the Land Rover Defender such as ambulances, artillery tractor and weapons platform with 188 Pinzgauers in service and 15,000 Land Rovers. Since the 1970s, in most remote areas of Africa, South America, Asia and in the Australian Outback the Toyota Land Cruiser has overtaken the Land Rover as the utility 4x4 of choice, probably because of the better parts network offered by Japanese competitors. In Australia at least, pricing is actually comparable or in favour of the Land Rover. Another reason seems to be the 'leadfoot' factor - the workhorse Toyota models tend to have larger engines than the comparable Land Rover models. In Britain, the Land Rover fell from favour with the farming community with the arrival of less expensive Japanese alternatives, with Daihatsu Fourtracks and Isuzu Troopers becoming a common sight on farms around the country, until rust eventually ended their working lives. However, with subtle improvements to the Defender in the early 1990s, and with the introduction of better, more reliable engines in the form of the TDi (especially the 300TDi) and the new five-cylinder TD5, most farms once again have a Land Rover Defender in their yard. The Range Rover has helped to define the Land Rover brand as much as the traditional Series and later Defender vehicles. Its upmarket image is peerless in the SUV market and led to a proliferation of products with the introduction of the Discovery/LR3, Freelander and Range Rover Sport. By the late 1990's Land Rover were concerned that the brand was fragmented in the eyes of customers who saw a collection of products, which had little relation to each other. In order to exert more leverage from marketing-spend, a re-think led to a departure from the traditional 'mud and guts' advertising to more aspirational and luxury orientated marketing to better reflect the true customer-base. This product strategy has kept Land Rover in business. In 2005 it was the most profitable part of Ford's Premier Automotive Group (PAG) brand portfolio. This is in sharp contrast with Jaguar, another PAG brand, which has failed to innovate and appeal to new customers. Land Rovers profits should contiue to rise with the indroducton of the new Freelander at the end of 2006 and the new Defender in the summer of 2007.Company Timeline Models  There have also been models developed for the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) At the 2004 North American International Auto Show, Land Rover introduced its first concept, the Range Stormer (Gritzinger, 2004). The armoured police vehicle, the Shorland, was not a Land Rover produced model but was built from Land Rover parts by Shorts of Belfast. These were used by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Ulster Defence Regiment until the 1970s, when a more conventional armoured Land Rover Tangi was built.Concept Models Military use  Since the very beginning all Series and Defender models have been used in a military capacity, in fact they are the back bone of the British Armed Forces. Often this has entailed just slightly modifying civilian models (primarily adding military \"blackout\" lights), but some dedicated military models have also been developed such as the Forward Control and the Lightweight. The Discovery has also been used in small numbers, mostly as liaison vehicles. Two models that have been designed for military use from the ground up are the 101 Forward Control from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s. The latter was intended to be transported by helicopter. The famous Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (United Kingdom) teams were early users in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and their convoys of landrovers and larger military trucks are a sight often seen in the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes. More recently, vehicles have been painted white, and are issued with fittings similar to civilian UK Mountain Rescue teams. The teams have recently been threatened with replacement of their beloved Land Rovers by Toyota 4 x 4 SUV-style vehicles. Military modifications include heavy duty suspension, uprated brakes, 24 Volt electrics, convoy lights, electronic suppression of the ignition system, blackout curtains and mounts for special equipment and small arms.Although they also lack the 'creature comforts' that would be associated with a civilian vehicle, such as sound deadening, carpets, air con, and other 'comfort' additions. Military uses include light utility vehicle, communications platform, weapon platform for recoilless rifles, TOWs or machine guns, ambulances and workshops. One famous adaptation of Land Rovers to military purposes is the \"Pink Panther\" models. Approximately 100 Series IIAs were adapted to reconnaissance use by the British special operations forces the SAS. For desert use they were often painted pink, hence the name. The vehicles were fitted with among other gear a sun compass, machine guns, larger fuel tanks and smoke dischargers. Similar adaptations were later made to Series IIIs and 90/110/Defenders. The 75th Ranger Regiment of the United States Army also adapted twelve versions of the Land Rover that were officially designated the RSOV (Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.) Series and Defenders have also been uparmoured. The most widespread of these is the Shorts Shorland, built by Shorts Brothers of Belfast. The first of these were delivered in 1965 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force. They were originally 109\" models with an armoured body and a turret from the Ferret armoured car. In 1990 there had been more than 1,000 produced.  In the 1970s a more conventional armoured Land Rover was built for the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Wales called the Hotspur. The Land Rover Tangi was built by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's own vehicle engineering team during the 1990s. The British Army has used various armoured Land Rovers, first in Northern Ireland but also in more recent campaigns. They first added protective panels to Series General Service vehicles (the Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK)). Later they procured the Glover Webb APV and finally the Courtaulds (later NP Aerospace) Composite Armoured Vehicle, commonly known as Snatch. These were originally based on heavy duty V8 110 chassis but some have recently been re-mounted on new chassis from Otokar of Turkey and fitted with diesel engines and air-conditioning for Iraq. Although these now have more in common with the 'Wolf' (Defender XD) Land Rovers that many mistakenly confuse them with, the Snatch and the Wolf are different vehicles. The most radical conversion of a Land Rover for military purposes was the Centaur Halftrack. It was based on a Series III with a V8 engine and a shortened belt drive from the Alvis Scorpion light tank. A small number was manufactured, and they were used by Ghana, among others. The Land Rover is used by military forces throughout the world. However, it is increasingly being supplemented, and even replaced, by larger vehicles. For instance the Pinzgauer, now built in the UK, is increasingly common in roles previously the preserve of the Land Rover Defender, such as ambulances, artillery tractors and weapons platforms. This is mainly due to the demands of modern warfare- combat vehicles today are generally required to carry much more equipment in the form of weaponry, communications equipment and armour. A 'soft' light 4x4 like the traditional Land Rover simply doesn't have the load capacity or strength of a larger medium-duty vehicle like the Pinzgauer. Even the current generation of Land Rover used by the British Army, the Wolf, have upgraded and strengthened chassis and suspension compared to civilian-spec vehicles.Abilities  The use of Land Rovers by the British and Commonwealth military, as well as on long term civilian projects and expeditions, is mainly due to the superior off-road performance of the marque. For example, the short wheelbase version of the Land Rover Defender is capable of tackling a gradient of 45 degrees, an approach angle of up to 50 degrees, a departure angle of 53 degrees and a ramp break-over of up to 155 degrees - greatly superior not just to urban 4x4s but to military vehicles such as the HMMWV and Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle. A distinctive feature of all Land Rover products has been their exceptional axle articulation (the degree to which the wheels have vertical travel, with high amounts allowing them to maintain contact (and traction) with the ground over uneven surfaces), which is currently 7 inches (178mm) at the front axle and 8.25 inches (210mm) at the rear on basic Defender models. Right from the start in 1948, PTOs (Power take-offs) were integral to the Land Rover concept, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks was very clear about this, and his original instruction was \"...to have power take-offs everywhere!\" The 1949 report by the British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station described it thus: \"The power take-off is driven through a Hardy-Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an 8 in x 8 in belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing.\" PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up to the demise of the Series Land Rover in 1985. It is still possible to order an agricultural PTO on a Defender as a special order. One of the other capabilities of the utility Land Rover (the Series/Defender models is that they are available in a huge variety of body styles, ranging from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a 12-seat fully trimmed Station Wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered a huge range of conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, 'cherry picker' hydraulic platforms, ambulances, snowploughs, and 6-wheel drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.Land Rover Experience  Land Rover Experience is the company's busy driver training wing. Established in 1998, Land Rover Experience consists of a network of centres throughout the world, setup to help customers get the most out of their vehicle's on and off-road capability. The flagship centre is based in Eastnor, Herefordshire in the UK, which has long been used as an engineering test and development facility. Courses offered include off-road driving, winching, and trailer handling, along with a variety of corporate and individual 'Adventure Days'. Land Rover ExperienceSafety  Road accident statistics on a model-by-model basis from the UK Department of Transport show that the Land Rover Defender and Land Rover Discovery are the safest cars on British roads (measured in terms of chance of death in two car injury accidents) - between three times safer than the safest Volvo models, twice as safe (half the death-rate per two vehicles injury accident) compared with the Jeep Cherokee and Toyota Land Cruiser and only matched by the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Jaguar XJ.Quality Concerns and Improvements  Recently, however, Land Rover has markedly improved its quality and reliability. However in the past it has shown reliability and build quality problems, and this is reflected in its showing in various industry and consumer quality and dependability related surveys, as detailed below: Beginning with the Discovery Series III (LR3 in the US) model, one of the replacement power plants for the new model was the 4.4L V8 engine developed by Jaguar and a 4.0L V6 developed by Ford (Jaguar was also part of the Ford Group). Some of the service problems in US specification Land Rover Defender and Discovery models are related to the Rover V8 petrol engine, as Land Rover increased the displacement and otherwise modernized the engine, which was originally designed in the late 1950s by General Motors for Buick. The same engine has powered a variety of other British cars, including the Rover 3500 and Triumph TR8. Most European, South African and Australian specification Defenders and Discovery models are now equipped with the TD5 diesel engine and reliability has still proven a problem as detailed in the surveys above. Part of the problem is also caused by the manufacturing methods used. The Defender is still largely hand-built, with aluminium body panels mounted on a steel chassis. This makes it very hard for the vehicle to have the same rigidity and inter-panel sealing as is found on modern vehicle. The 1980s saw numerous cut-backs to the utility Land Rover line (at that time, the Ninety/One Ten range), which included the replacement of the galvanised metal body cappings (as used since 1948) with simple painted items. This led to rapid corrosion of these parts. Similar economy measures were put in place. Recently increased investment under Ford has seen the return of the galvanised cappings, and design changes to reduce corrosion (such as the introduction of a one-piece rear door on Station Wagon and Hard Top models, which previously had doors made from panels over a steel frame). Land Rover still makes heavy use of the British Leyland \"parts bin\" on its older models (the Defender and Freelander in particular), and this as well as its parts-sharing scheme is often cited as the cause of many malfunctions. It now appears that Ford is attempting to address the Land Rover quality issues. It was reported in the Birmingham Post on 27 May 2004 that Ford's senior management have given the Land Rover plant 8 weeks to come up with a \"road map\" to address the quality issues at Land Rover and bring its competitiveness up to global standards in 5 years. Ford has threatened Solihull with closure unless significant improvements are realised, and with no replacement for the Jaguar X-Type on the cards, it seems likely that there will be sufficient extra capacity at Halewood in the coming years to accommodate the entire Land Rover range. Despite the recent drops in quality, it is rumoured that 75% of all Land Rovers produced since 1955 are still on the road. This figure may be misleading, due to the wider range of vehicles and much higher production of recent years. The simplicity of build and cross compatibility of parts with many earlier models, together with the enthusiasm of many owners, has ensured many vehicles have stayed on the road. The longevity of individual vehicles may also tend to hide any improvements in production quality as assembly faults, once fixed, may stay fixed, and so may only matter to the first buyer. Enthusiasts of the marque and commercial users often point out that the mechanical components of the vehicles are very tough and reliable- it is the 'non-essential' areas such as interior fit/finish, weather sealing and ancillary electrics that fail. Another point often made is that other manufacturers not only produce models with assembly faults which are recalled, but do not tend to remain as reliable as Land Rover products in the long run. It is also true that a much larger proportion of early Land Rover Discovery, the first vehicle to be produced in very high numbers, remain in everyday use than can be said of rival manufacturers. All Land Rovers are crash tested.In popular culture and public media  Land Rovers, particularly the commercial and military models, became ubiquitous throughout rural areas and in the developing World. \"The Antichrist,\" the Land Rover featured in the South African film The Gods Must Be Crazy, illustrates the love-hate relationship many owners feel with the earlier Series 1, 2 and 3 vehicles. The 1960s TV series Daktari featured a Land Rover which was the subject of Corgi models that still frequent eBay listings. Many other films feature prominent roles for Land Rovers, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Ace Ventura, Hotel Rwanda and the Bond film The Living Daylights. Mission: Impossible III features a Land Rover Discovery 3 (LR3). One of the not-so-subtle drug lords in the British crime movie Layer Cake is noted for driving a yellow Range Rover. An anachronism occurs in Ice-Cold in Alex, which features a Land Rover though the film is set during World War II. Fox's television show The O.C. featured an affluent family driving a Range Rover. The 2006 film The Queen depicts Queen Elizabeth II manoeuvring a forest green Land Rover through the Scottish countryside and when the vehicle breaks down crossing a river the scene is used as a vehicle to demonstrate the Queen's practical ability \"I was a mechanic during the war\". A Land Rover is amongst the vehicles used in the film The Italian Job in which it drives through winding backstreets and courtyards of Turin. It's interesting to note that it is the most modern looking vehicle in the film due to its unchanging looks. The Land Rover brand is mentioned on an almost daily basis in the UK on BBC Radio 2 in the on air banter between morning travel reporter Lynn Bowles and co-hosts Sarah Kennedy, Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce. Lynn learnt to drive in a Land Rover and is fast becoming a mascot for the marque after competing in the 2004 run of the Macmillan 4x4 UK Challenge and co-presenting the Heritage Motor Centre  Land Rover show every year since 2005. When a new paint colour called 'Stornoway Grey', a replacement of Bonatti Grey, was introduced to Land Rover vehicles, Western Isles councillor Angus Nicolson demanded the name to be changed to Silvery Stornoway because he claimed the colour will damage the town's image among tourists and leave people with the impression that Stornoway was drab and dull. Land Rover representative responded that the use of Stornoway Grey will help keep it on the map, as grey is an extremely popular colour for the vehicle. Land Rovers have competed in the Paris Dakar Rally and won the Macmillan 4x4 UK Challenge almost every year, as well as having been the vehicle used for the Camel Trophy as part of a sponsorship deal. Now, Land Rover has its own G4 challenge.Land Rover Clubs  The Land Rover brand has been elevated to a cult status amongst enthusiasts. Nowhere is this more evident than the Land Rover club environment. Hundreds of clubs have formed throughout the UK and internationally. Land Rover clubs break down into a number of groups of varying interests. Single Marque Clubs - As the title suggests these clubs bring together owners of a specific model or series of vehicle such as the Series One Club, or the Discovery Owners Club. Clubs based around ownership of earlier series vehicles tend to attract the purists amongst Land Rover owners whose interests often relate to restoration of their vehicles to their original condition. Special Vehicle Clubs - At various times Land Rover have produced vehicles for specific events or on a specific theme, most notable are the Camel Trophy and G4 Challenge vehicles which have been sold on to the general public, and a range of Defenders that were loosely based on the custom vehicles produced for the Tomb Raider motion picture. Regional Clubs - These break down into two groups, competitive and non-competitive clubs. Non-competitive clubs activities generally relate to social events, off road driving or Green Laning on un-surfaced public highways or 'pay and play' days at off road centres. Competitive clubs are a phenomenon almost exclusively found within the UK, who as well as the non-competitive activities detailed above run competitive events such as Tyro, Road Taxed Vehicle (RTV) and Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trials, winch and recovery challenges or speed events such as Competitive Safari's. All UK competitive events are run within the framework of rules created by the Motor Sports Association (MSA) with further vehicle specific rules applied by the host club or association. A number of clubs are affiliated to the Association of Land Rover Clubs (ALRC) formerly known as the Association of Rover Clubs (ARC) the association applies its own vehicle regulations to all of its member clubs who have the opportunity to compete together at regional events and an annual national event with vehicles approved to the same standard. Club Licensing - In 2005 under Ford ownership the Land Rover company became more interested in the club environment. An internal club was formed, The Land Rover Club a club exclusive to employees of the Ford Premier Automotive Group. Also, an agreement was generated to allow other clubs to use the Land Rover green oval logo under licence. In 2006 the Beds, Herts and Cambs club were the pilot licensees for the new agreement, who now benefit from a reciprocal arrangement where their own logo is trade marked and owned by Land Rover and they can refer to themselves as a 'Land Rover Approved Club'.References External links Autopedia Coolow Check it out  Check out this new template.

He has a younger sister named Tsubami, who is just as rude and self-centered as her older brother. Even though both mascots are quite the package, they are dearly loved by their fans. As of June 2014, another Swallows sibling named Torukuya has joined the mascot family. He strongly resembles a luchador. He always carries a parasol, and sports a bottle of the beverage \"Yakult\" that he wears strapped to his back like a backpack. Much more nice and quiet when compared to his siblings, he will loiter around foul territory, waving and posing to fans.Team Information - History  The\u00a0Tokyo Yakult Swallows\u00a0are a professional\u00a0baseball\u00a0team in\u00a0Japan's\u00a0Central League. The Swallows are named after their corporate owners, the\u00a0Yakult\u00a0Corporation. From 1950 to 1965, the team was owned by the former\u00a0Japanese National Railways\u00a0(Kokutetsu\u00a0(\u56fd\u9244) and called the\u00a0Kokutetsu Swallows; the team was then owned by the newspaper\u00a0Sankei Shimbun\u00a0from 1965 to 1968 and called the\u00a0Sankei Atoms.\u00a0Yakult purchased the team in 1970 and restored its original Swallows name in 1974.

Het is primair gericht op beleidsmedewerkers, bestuurders en technici bij overheden en in de verkeersindustrie. Het is een wiki, dat wil zeggen dat iedereen kan meeschrijven - u dus ook! Er is ook een  redactie, die de algemene ontwikkeling van het Handboek bewaakt en bijstuurt, maar de bijdragen worden van lezers uit het gehele vakgebied verwacht. Om een vliegende start te kunnen maken heeft de Dienst Verkeer en Scheepvaart van Rijkswaterstaat (voorheen Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer) opdracht gegeven aan adviesbureau Witteveen+Bos om een groot aantal artikelen te schrijven, die samen de eerste versie van het Handboek vormen. Deze versie is onlangs gereedgekomen. Het Handboek Regionale Verkeersmonitoring is ontwikkeld in het kader van het ATMO project van TRANSUMO.Inhoudsopgave van het Handboek Verkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring met inductielussen Werkingsprincipe  Een inductielus bestaat uit een lus van koperdraad die in of onder het wegdek is aangebracht. Bij asfalt- en betonwegen wordt een sleuf in het wegdek gefreesd, waarin de inductielus en de communicatie hardware wordt aangebracht. Bij elementverharding wordt de inductielus onder de verharding aangebracht. De inductielus is verbonden met een elektronische schakeling en bevat een spoel waarin een magnetisch veld wordt opgewekt met een frequentie van 40 tot 100 kHz. De passage van een hoeveelheid metaal, zoals in een (vracht)auto, verandert de zelfinductiespanning in de inductielus, de co\u00ebffici\u00ebnt van de zelfinductie en de frequentie. Door deze verstoring van het magnetisch veld kan een voertuigpassage worden waargenomen. De gevoeligheid van de inductielus kan per lus worden afgesteld door de vorm van de lus aan te passen of het aantal windingen in de spoel te veranderen. Het afstellen van de gevoeligheid van de inductielussen luistert nauw. De inductielus dient zo te worden afgesteld dat voorkomen wordt dat voertuigen op de naastgelegen rijstrook worden gedetecteerd en dat (lichte) motorfietsen niet worden gedetecteerd. Het inductielus detectiesysteem bestaat uit \u00e9\u00e9n of meer detectielussen, een lokale verwerkingsunit en eventueel een communicatiemodule om gegevens naar een centrale te sturen. Per rijstrook wordt een enkele lus of een luspaar aangebracht. De detectielussen registreren de voertuigbewegingen en geven deze door aan de lokale verwerkingsunit, ook wel het detectorstation genoemd. Deze unit kan de gegevens interpreteren en omvormen tot de gewenste variabelen zoals voertuigpassages en snelheden. Een enkele lus kan een passage van een voertuig meten, waardoor het aantal voertuig passages, de passage tijden en de bezettingsgraad kunnen worden geregistreerd. Van die gegevens kunnen vervolgens de intensiteit, de dichtheid en de harmonisch snelheid worden afgeleid. Door twee lussen op korte afstand van elkaar te leggen (een luspaar) kunnen nog een aantal extra zaken worden gemeten, waaronder individuele snelheden, rekenkundige gemiddelde snelheden, harmonische gemiddelde snelheden, individuele voertuiglengte en gemiddelde voertuiglengte. Behalve intensiteiten kunnen dus ook (gemiddelde) snelheden en voertuigcategorie\u00ebn worden waargenomen. In onderstaande figuur is een schematische weergave van een dubbele inductielus opgenomen.Toepassing  Bij de meeste systemen worden de meetgegevens door de lokale verwerkingsunit geaggregeerd tot 1, 5, 15 of 60 minuten. De gegevens zijn dan verwerkt tot intensiteiten per voertuigklasse (op basis van de lengte van het voertuig) en gemiddelde snelheden per tijdsinterval. Doordat gewerkt wordt met een rekenkundig gemiddelde worden de snelheden bemeten met de inductielussen overschat. Dit is verder uitgewerkt in het verkeerskundige artikel over rekenkundige gemiddelde snelheden. Indien het systeem een communicatiemodule bevat, kunnen de geaggregeerde gegevens per tijdseenheid direct naar de centrale worden gestuurd en daar verwerkt worden. Een ander mogelijkheid is om de gegevens lokaal uit te lezen, bijvoorbeeld eens per week of maand met behulp van een laptop. Het Nederlandse (hoofd)wegennet is uitgerust met een uitgebreid monitoringssysteem, dat is gebaseerd op detectielussen. Dit systeem, MoniCa genoemd (Monitoring Casco), zorgt voor de verzameling, verwerking en verstrekking van dynamische en statische verkeersgegevens. Het zijn gegevens over intensiteiten, gemiddelde snelheden, voertuigcategorie\u00ebn, files, spitsdrukte en spookrijdermeldingen. Via verschillende informatieketens ligt MoniCa aan de basis van de meeste DVM-maatregelen, zoals waarschuwen voor langzaam rijdende of stilstaande voertuigen (automatische incidentdetectie), snelheidsmaatregelen (snelheidsdeken), weergave filelengtes op DRIP's etc. Rijkswaterstaat heeft tevens een systeem met inductielussen ontwikkeld voor het bewaken van verkeersstromen. Dit verkeerssignaleringssysteem wordt aangeduid met MTM (Motorway Traffic Management) en is op verschillende autosnelwegen in Nederland ge\u00efnstalleerd. MTM is een volledig geautomatiseerd netwerkmanagementsysteem voor het hoofdwegennet. Dit wordt gebruikt voor de automatische incidentdetectie (AID), bij werk in uitvoering, bij beveiliging van defecte infrastructuur situaties, voor snelheidsmaatregelen en voor de aansturing van onder meer toeritdosering en DRIP's (via MoniCa). Op wegvlakken met MTM liggen om de 300 tot 500 meter detectielussen, op delen zonder MTM kent het MoniCa-systeem een lagere dichtheid van de meetlocaties. Met behulp van de gegevens uit weggebonden meetsystemen (waaronder de inductielussen) kunnen de reistijden over een traject worden geschat. Voordat de reistijd gegevens echter beschikbaar zijn moeten de ingewonnen gegevens worden bewerkt met behulp van een algoritme. De werking van het reistijd algoritme is toegelicht in het artikel over de bewerking van de gegevens. Daarnaast worden de inductielussen toegepast bij VRI's. De werkwijze van de inductielussen bij VRI's wordt verder toegelicht bij het monitoringssysteem verkeersregelinstallaties (VRI's). In de stedelijke omgeving wordt het systeem ook gebruikt bij de toegang tot parkeergarages en bij dynamische afsluitingen. Onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat er meer mogelijk is met het inductielus detectiesysteem dan de toepassingen die momenteel worden gebruikt. De verstoring van het magnetisch veld blijkt per voertuig verschillend te zijn waardoor een soort handtekening wordt achtergelaten. Er is door verschillende instanties onderzoek uitgevoerd naar de mogelijkheid om met behulp van deze \u2018handtekening\u2019 voertuigen te herkennen ten behoeve van reistijdmetingen. Onderzoeken zijn onder andere uitgevoerd door Coifman en Cassidy van de University of California, door Kwon van de universiteit van Minnesota en door Sio-Song van een Franse overheidsinstelling. Doordat een match wordt gevonden tussen de gepasseerde voertuigen bij een eerste meting en de voertuigen bij een meetpunt verder stoomafwaarts kan de werkelijke reistijd en de trajectsnelheid bepaald worden.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  Het inductielus detectiesysteem is een nauwkeurig systeem voor het meten van voertuigsnelheden en intensiteiten. Voor wat betreft het meten van voertuiglengtes is het syteem niet nauwkeurig omdat niet de werkelijke voertuiglengte wordt gemeten, maar de lengte van het door de detector gemeten magnetisch profiel. Dit wordt vaak het elektrisch voertuigprofiel genoemd. Dit gemeten elektrische voertuigprofiel wordt door veel detectoren met een formule aangepast om te komen tot een geschatte werkelijke voertuiglengte. De formule is meestal zodanig gekozen dat bij een verzameling van een groot aantal gemeten voertuigen, de statistiche verdeling van de voertuiglengtes overeenkomt met die van de statistische verzameling van werkelijke voertuiglengtes van de gepasseerde voertuigen. Gezien de problematiek met het meten van de voertuiglengtes wordt door Rijkswaterstaat niet een absolute nauwkeurigheid van de lengtemeting vereist, maar een eis die betrekking heeft op de reproduceerbaarheid van de lengtemeting Een voordel van lusdetectiesystemen is dat deze ongevoelig zijn voor extreme weersomstandigheden zoals overvloedige regenval en mist. Zware vorst kan de inductielussen echter beschadigen en de metingen be\u00efnvloeden.. Bij hoge voertuigsnelheden wordt de nauwkeurigheid van het systeem minder. Hoewel de huidge generatie lusdetectoren geen problemen hebben met het detecteren van motorfietsen, kunnen deze toch worden gemist doordat de lus smaller is dan de rijstrook. Daardoor kunnen motorfietsen langs de inductielussen rijden niet worden gemeten. Een ander probleem is dat voertuigen die ter hoogte van de inductielussen van rijstrook wisselen vaak worden gerapporteed als zijnde voertuigen met een korte voertuiglengte. Deze worden dan ten onrechte geklassificeerd als een motorfiets. De werking van de inductielussen kan worden verstoord door niet goed afgeschermde elektrische installaties of zendmasten in de nabijheid. Daarnaast kan het lastig zijn om inductielussen toe te passen op plaatsen waar veel metaal aanwezig is, zoals bijvoorbeeld bij viaducten, nabij rails of bij betonnen constructies die zijn voorzien van wapening. Het aanwezige metaal heeft invloed op de grootte het signaal van de meting. In dat geval dient de detector op een gevoeliger stand te worden ingesteld (Soms \"de betonstand\" genoemd). In de onderstaande tabel is een inschatting gegeven van de nauwkeurigheid van de diverse meetgegevens, deze eisen aan de nauwkeurigheid van de gegevens zijn afkomstig uit het rapport van Polman.Beschikbaarheid  De beschikbaarheid van het inductielussysteem is sterk afhankelijk van de kwaliteit van de wegverharding. Als er werking zit in de wegverharding kan door schuring en oprekking schade ontstaan aan de kabels. De kabels kunnen breken of kunnen bloot komen te liggen, waardoor water de werking kan verstoren. Vooral bij hoge percentages vrachtverkeer of op locaties met veel rembewegingen zijn inductielussen kwetsbaar. Daarnaast worden in veel situaties de problemen veroorzaakt door de verwerkingsunit of de communicatiemodule. In het rapport van Polman wordt gesteld dat het systeem tussen de 97 en 100% van de tijd beschikbaar is. Het rapport van van Lint wordt aangegeven dat bij MoniCa bijvoorbeeld 12% van alle ruwe minuutgegevens (tijdgemiddelde snelheden en intensiteiten) ofwel onbetrouwbaar zijn of volledig missen. Daarnaast wordt door van Lint aangegeven dat er regelmatig uitschieters van 25% of meer zijn, deze uitschieters worden vaak veroorzaakt door achterstallige onderhoudswerkzaamheden.Actualiteit  Vanaf een fractie van een seconde na een voertuigpassage zijn de gegevens beschikbaar in het systeem. De verwerking van de gegevens tot bruikbare informatie neemt vervolgens enkele minuten in beslag afhankelijk van de informatiebehoefte en de toepassing.Flexibiliteit  De inductielussen zijn niet flexibel, omdat ze in het wegdek worden gefreesd. De infrastructuur wordt echter steeds dynamischer gebruikt, zoals bij [[Begrippenlijst#spitsstroken|spitsstroken] en dynamische rijbaanmarkering. Maar bijvoorbeeld ook bij wegverleggingen tijdens werk in uitvoering kunnen detectielussen het verkeer niet goed monitoren.Gegevenstype  Per rijstrook kunnen de volgende gegevens worden gemeten met de detectielussen (lusparen): (MoniCa) inductielussen berekenen de rekenkundig gemiddelde snelheid op een locatie, deze rekenkundige gemiddelde snelheden geven echter een overschatting van de werkelijke snelheden over een traject. In de begrippenlijst is meer informatie te vinden over de rekenkundig gemiddelde snelheid.Realisatie  Bij de implementatie van het systeem moet rekening worden gehouden met een doorlooptijd van enkele maanden, in verband met de levertijd, het frezen van de inductielussen in het asfalt en het in werking stellen van het systeem.Onderhoud  Inductielussen liggen enkele decimeters diep in het wegdek. Er wordt daardoor slechts indirect invloed uitgeoefend op de inductielus. De inductielus is daardoor zeer betrouwbaar gebleken en storingen blijken achteraf vaak onterecht te worden toegekend aan de lus zelf. Vaak zijn deze storingen een gevolg van andere problemen zoals falende aansluitingen in luskoppelkasten. Dit is dan vaak weer een gevolg van achterstallig onderhoud dan wel het beschadigd raken van de luskoppelkasten bij maaiwerkzaamheden. Toch kan bij een zware wegbelasting (vrachtverkeer) en zware vorst het voorkomen dat de lussen fysiek belast worden en na verloop van tijd het begeven. Doordat een wegafzetting benodigd is bij onderhoud aan de inductielussen is een inductielus een duur meetsysteem om te onderhouden. Dit is echter ook het geval indien onderhoud nodig is aan (radar)detectoren die boven rijstroken zijn opgehangen De jaarlijkse kosten voor afschrijving en onderhoud voor de inductielussen liggen in de orde grootte van 10.000 euro per lus en 20.000 euro voor de centrale verwerkingsapparatuur en de communicatie infrastructuur. Naast de directe kosten voor een wegafzetting heeft het afsluiten van een rijstrook ook negatieve effecten op de doorstroming van het verkeer, wat voor economische schade zorgt. Deze schade wordt echter veelal voorkomen door dit ondehoud in de avonduren dan wel 's nachts uit te voeren. Uit oogpunt van de kosten en de verkeersoverlast wordt bij een defecte inductielus vaak gewacht met de herstelwerkzaamheden totdat er meerdere lussen hersteld moeten worden.Kosten  De kosten van een inductielus detectiesysteem zijn afhankelijk van het aantal detectielussen, het aantal rijstroken en de gebruikte communicatie-infrastructuur. In het algemeen geldt dat inductielussen relatief goedkoop zijn in onderhoud, aanschaf en installatie. De kosten voor de detectielussen en de lokale verwerkingsunit liggen in de ordegrootte van 8.000 tot 12.000 euro per locatie met \u00e9\u00e9n tot vier rijstroken (Bron:Gemeente Rotterdam). Een nadeel van inductielussen is dat tijdens de installatie de rijstroken moeten worden afgesloten, aangezien de inductielussen in het wegdek gefreesd moeten worden. De kosten voor het systeem zitten voornamelijk in de aanleg, inclusief wegafzetting. Daarnaast zitten de kosten voornamelijk in de verwerkingsunit, de kosten voor de verwerkingsunit zijn maar beperkt afhankelijk van het aantal rijstroken. Een detectielus heeft in principe een lange levensduur, circa dertig jaar. De levensduur is echter gekoppeld aan de levensduur van de wegverharding waarin of waaronder de inductielus is aangebracht. Bij vervanging of onderhoud van het wegvak gaat de inductielus namelijk ook verloren. Een levensduur van 30 jaar wordt hierdoor nooit behaald.Referentieprojecten Bronnen  Bukkems en Folles, Alternatieven voor lusdetectie, ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2002 Coifman en Cassidy, Vehicle Reidentification and Travel Time Measurement onCongested Freeways, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 2002 Bukkems en Folles, Alternatieven voor lusdetectie, ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Gemeente Rotterdam, Monitoring Rotterdam DP3: Vergelijking potenti\u00eble meetsystemen, Gemeente Rotterdam dS+V afdeling Verkeer en Vervoer, maart 2006 Hillen, Monitoring ten behoeve van reistijdinformatie, AGV in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2006 Kwon, Blind Deconvolution of Vehicle Inductance Signatures for Travel-Time Estimation, University Minnesota Department of Transportation, februari 2006 van Lint, Evaluatie en analyse van reisinformatie, Technische Universiteit Delft in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, maart-juni 2006 van Lint, Datafusie en toestand schatten: het maximale halen uit onbetrouwbare en heterogene verkeersgegevens, PAO Cursus Regionale Verkeersmonitoring, november 2006 Polman, Voertuigdetectie: wensen en mogelijkheden, Goudappel Coffeng in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, november 2001 Sio-Song, Inductive-Loop-Based Vehicle Signature Features Analysis and Anonymous Vehicle Reidentification for Travel Time Estimation, Transportation research 86th board annual meeting, 2007 Wilson, Handboek verkeerslichtenregelingen, CROW, januari 2006Openstaande vragen / opmerkingen  -> Terug naar weggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Hoofdpagina  De wiki Verkeersmanagement heeft tot doel om kennisuitwisseling over verkeersmanagement tussen wegbeheerders, onderzoekers en adviseurs te bevorderen.

De wiki-redactie stelt het op prijs als u zich als gebruiker registreert.Verkeersmanagement Weggebonden meetsystemen Inleiding  Weggebonden meetsystemen werken op basis van puntmetingen op \u00e9\u00e9n of meerdere locaties, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van detectoren op, in, boven of langs de weg. Met behulp van deze meetsystemen worden voertuigen gedetecteerd, gesignaleerd en/of geregistreerd. Afhankelijk van de gewenste informatie c.q. het doel waarvoor het verkeer wordt gemonitord, heeft een bepaald meetsysteem de voorkeur. In dit artikel worden de volgende verschillende weggebonden meetsystemen behandeld, die momenteel op de markt zijn: Deze negen meetsystemen worden in dit handboek afzonderlijk toegelicht. Klik hiervoor op de betreffende link. In die artikelen worden de werking, de toepassing en de kenmerken van hetmeetsysteem besproken. In dit artikel worden de systemen op de volgende onderdelen systematisch met elkaar vergeleken: nauwkeurigheid, beschikbaarheid, actualiteit, gegevenstype, flexibiliteit, realisatie, onderhoud en kosten.Vergelijking systemen  Met de meetsystemen waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van inductielussen, radar, infrarood of camera's, kunnen over het algemeen dezelfde gegevens worden ingewonnen. Bijvoorbeeld intensiteit van het verkeer, snelheid en voertuigcategorisering, en als afgeleide ook de filesituatie. Deze systemen kunnen elkaar ook vervangen en zij kunnen onderling met elkaar worden vergeleken. Het systeem voor kentekenherkenning is een aparte toepassing met het gebruik van camera's. Doordat gebruik wordt gemaakt van camera's op twee of meer locaties, kunnen de reistijd op het traject en de trajectsnelheid worden bepaald. Verkeersregelinstallatie worden primair gebruikt om het verkeer veilig en optimaal te regelen. De detectiegegevens van VRI's kunnen met enige aanpassingen tevens worden gebruikt voor het monitoren van verkeer. De verkeersregelinstallaties zijn voor het detecteren van de voertuigen uitgevoerd met inductielussen, radar, infrarood of camera's. De pneumatische telslang, visuele verkeerstellingen en remote sensing zijn methoden die tijdelijk (van enkele uren tot enkele dagen) het verkeer monitoren, met bijvoorbeeld als doel het in kaart brengen van verkeersintensiteiten voor beleid. Onderstaand zijn per kenmerk de betreffende eigenschappen van de negen meetsystemen kort weergegeven. Dit maakt een vergelijking van een aantal meetsystemen per kenmerk mogelijk. De indicaties over bijvoorbeeld nauwkeurigheid en beschikbaarheid moeten als relatief worden ge\u00efnterpreteerd, ten opzichte van andere meetsystemen die dezelfde gegevenstypen leveren. Meer informatie is per meetsysteem opgenomen in de individuele artikelen.Nauwkeurigheid  Met het criterium nauwkeurigheid wordt het verschil aangeduid tussen de werkelijke waarde en de waarde volgens het systeem (de meetgegevens).Beschikbaarheid  Met het hoofdcriterium beschikbaarheid is beoordeeld in welke mate een systeem (tijdelijk) geen metingen kan verrichten door een (ver)storing. In het algemeen geldt dat de beschikbaarheid van het systeem sterk afhangt van de bewaking van het systeem (hoe snel is duidelijk dat het systeem defect is), de reparatie van de sensor (hoe snel wordt het defecte systeem weer gerepareerd) en het onderhoud van het systeem.Actualiteit  Het criterium actualiteit geeft weer hoeveel tijd er verstrijkt tussen het meten en het centraal beschikbaar komen van de gegevens voor toepassing.Flexibiliteit  Onder flexibiliteit wordt verstaan of een systeem eenvoudig kan worden aangepast of gewijzigd.Gegevenstype  Met het criterium gegevenstype wordt aangegeven welke ruwe gegevens met het meetsysteem kunnen worden ingewonnen.Realisatie  Onder realisatie valt met name de hinder die de installatie van de systemen levert voor het wegverkeer.Onderhoud  Met het criterium onderhoud wordt aangegeven welk onderhoud benodigd is om de verschillende systemen beschikbaar en nauwkeurig te houden. Daarnaast is globaal aangegeven welke kosten met het onderhoud van het systeem gepaard gaan.Kosten  De investeringskosten bestaan grofweg uit de kosten van de lokale detectiesystemen, de communicatiemiddelen en de centrale verwerking (apparatuur en software). Er is een globale vergelijking gemaakt tussen de investeringskosten van de verschillende meetsystemen. De exacte kosten verschillen (soms sterk) per leverancier, per afnamehoeveelheid, aanbestedingsvorm, eigendomsrechten, et cetera.Bronnen  Citilog, Mediatunnel, video detection system: for a better en safer tunnel management, Citilog, 2004 van den Berg, Actuele verkeersgegevens Amsterdam, Gemeente Amsterdam, Dienst Infrastructuur, Verkeer en Vervoer, oktober 2005 Bukkems en Folles, Alternatieven voor lusdetectie, ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2002 Folles, van der Burgt, Bokma, van Kaam, Ogen op de weg, resultaten en conclusies pilot video incident detectie A67, Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2001 Gemeente Rotterdam, Monitoring Rotterdam DP3: Vergelijking potenti\u00eble meetsystemen, Gemeente Rotterdam dS+V afdeling Verkeer en Vervoer, maart 2006 Hillen, Monitoring ten behoeve van reistijdinformatie, AGV in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2006 van Lint, Evaluatie en analyse van reisinformatie, Technische Universiteit Delft in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, maart-juni 2006 Polman, Voertuigdetectie: wensen en mogelijkheden, Goudappel Coffeng in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, november 2001 Wilson, Handboek verkeerslichtenregelingen, CROW, januari 2006 Terug naar -> MeetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring d.m.v. kentekenherkenning Werkingsprincipe  Systemen voor kentekenherkenning registreren op verschillende locaties objecten door middel van het registreren van de kentekenplaten. Hiervoor wordt gebruik gemaakt van camera's gepositioneerd op meerdere plaatsen in het netwerk. Met de ingewonnen tijdstippen waarop voertuigen passeren, is het systeem in staat om op specifieke, vooraf gedefinieerde trajecten de actuele reistijden, trajectsnelheden en herkomst- bestemmingspatronen te bepalen. Om de reistijden of trajectsnelheden te kunnen bepalen, worden op het begin- en eindpunt van het te bemeten traject boven elke rijstrook camera's gemonteerd. Die maken van elk passerend voertuig een foto, soms met behulp van infrarood om de passage van het voertuig waar te nemen. In de lokale verwerkingsunit wordt het camerabeeld verwerkt met behulp van een videoalgoritme, om het kenteken van het voertuig te herkennen. Het kenteken en de bijbehorende passagetijd worden naar de centrale verwerkingsunit gestuurd. Deze vergelijkt de gegevens van het beginpunt met de gegevens van het eindpunt. Als het voertuig op beide locaties wordt geregistreerd, kunnen de reistijd, de bijbehorende trajectsnelheid van het voertuig en een herkomst-bestemmingspatroon (bij gebruik van meerdere cameralocaties in het netwerk worden berekend. De reistijden en snelheden worden berekend op basis van de afstand tussen de meetlocaties en de geregistreerde tijdsduur. Voor een reistijdmeting worden de reistijden van diverse voertuigen gecombineerd, zodat per tijdsperiode een gemiddelde reistijd kan worden bepaald tussen begin- en eindpunt. De kwaliteit van het systeem is sterk afhankelijk van het aantal voertuigen dat ge\u00efdentificeerd wordt door zowel de camera aan het begin van het traject als de camera aan het eind van het traject, in dat geval is er sprake van een voertuig-match. Hoe hoger het percentage voertuig-matches is, hoe betrouwbaarder de berekende gegevens. Het systeem bepaalt namelijk bijvoorbeeld aan de hand van het gemiddelde van de reistijden van de voertuigen waarvan een voertuig-match beschikbaar is de gemiddelde reistijd over het traject voor tijdsperiode x. Het is mogelijk om de camera's niet boven alle aanwezige rijstroken te plaatsen, maar slechts boven \u00e9\u00e9n rijstrook. Het nadeel hiervan is dat er substantieel minder voertuig-matches zijn. Waardoor er minder gegevens beschikbaar zijn om de resultaten (reistijden, voertuigsamenstelling, snelheden, herkomst-bestemming) te bepalen. Daarnaast is de nauwkeurigheid van de gemiddelde reistijd minder, aangezien de snelheidsverschillen tussen de rijstroken niet worden meegenomen bij het bepalen van de gemiddelde reistijd. Het voordeel van het plaatsen van \u00e9\u00e9n camera is dat de kosten een stuk lager liggen en toch een beeld kan worden gevormd van de verkeerssituatie.Toepassing  Het gebruik van camera's in combinatie met kentekenherkenning kent meerdere functionaliteiten: Met het gebruik van kentekenherkenning voor alle vijf de toepassingen is zowel in Nederland als in het buitenland veel ervaring opgedaan. Enkele voorbeelden zijn: Bij systemen voor kentekenherkenning speelt privacygevoeligheid een belangrijke rol. Met name het opslaan van gegevens van kentekens ligt gevoelig. Bij reistijdmetingen worden de gegevens daarom binnen de systeemgrenzen gebruikt en worden ze niet aan andere systemen verstrekt voor gebruik door andere doeleinden. Bij trajectcontrole worden de gegevens van de kentekens alleen gebruikt indien de maximumsnelheid wordt overschreden; in de andere gevallen blijven de gegevens binnen het systeem. De beelden van de camera\u2019s die gebruikt worden voor kentekenherkenning zijn veelal niet geschikt om centraal te bekijken. De beelden zijn namelijk gericht op de kentekens of omtrek van de voertuigen en niet op het overall verkeersbeeld. Ze brengen over het algemeen maar een klein wegvlak in beeld, waarbinnen alleen individuele voertuigen herkend hoeven te worden.Kenmerken Beschikbaarheid  Het is niet altijd mogelijk om de (kentekens van) passerende voertuigen te registreren, omdat het kenteken niet altijd correct kan worden gelezen. Dit kan verschillende oorzaken hebben. Het kenteken kan vuil of onduidelijk zijn. Het kenteken kan niet leesbaar zijn omdat het camerabeeld niet duidelijk genoeg was. Maar ook kunnen kentekens niet bepaald worden doordat voertuigen dicht achter een ander voertuig rijden, waardoor het beeld wordt afgeschermd en het kenteken niet zichtbaar is.Actualiteit  Binnen het systeem zijn de gegevens binnen een minuut tot enkele minuten bekend. De precieze tijd is afhankelijk van het type communicatiesysteem dat wordt gebruikt. Zodra de gegevens van beide meetlocaties (begin- en eindpunt) in het centrale systeem zijn verwerkt, is de reistijd direct bekend in de database en daarmee inzichtelijk. De tijdsduur voordat de reistijd wordt weergegeven in de database is afhankelijk van de trajectlengte. Hoe langer het traject en/of hoe lager de snelheden hoe later de verwerkte gegevens beschikbaar zijn voor toepassing. Indien het traject te lang is en de metingen gebruikt worden voor het tonen van actuele reistijden is het mogelijk dat de berekende reistijden bij lange na niet meer actueel zijn.Flexibiliteit  De systemen voor kentekenherkenning worden in het algemeen als 'vaste' installaties geleverd. Er zijn echter ook tijdelijke, mobiele installaties leverbaar. De mobiele installaties worden in het algemeen toegepast voor het verkrijgen van herkomst- en bestemmingspatronen.Gegevenstype  Met het kentekenherkenningssysteem kunnen de volgende gegevens worden gemeten of bepaald:Realisatie  Bij de realisatie van deze systemen moet rekening worden gehouden met een doorlooptijd van een maand tot enkele maanden. Dit is afhankelijk van zaken zoals de levertijd, de installatie/montage en het in werking stellen van het systeem. De camera's worden bij voorkeur op locaties geplaatst waar voertuigen weinig van rijstrook wisselen, aangezien anders een substantieel deel van de voertuigen niet wordt geregistreerd. Op kruispunten zijn er over het algemeen meer rijstroken, doordat er opstelvakken in verschillende richtingen zijn. Als systemen dichtbij een kruising worden geplaatst, zijn er meer camera's nodig en worden de systeem duurder. Om extra kosten te besparen moet vantevoren duidelijk worden bepaald over welke trajecten de gemiddelde reistijden nuttig en nodig zijn. De camera's kunnen aan masten of portalen worden bevestigd. Als er bestaande masten, portalen of eventueel kunstwerken in de buurt staan, kunnen deze ook worden gebruikt. Zolang de camera's maar goed zicht hebben op een rijstrook.Onderhoud  De camera\u2019s moeten regelmatig worden gecontroleerd op de juiste werking van het systeem, om de nauwkeurigheid van de waarnemingen te waarborgen. Voorts wordt aanbevolen om de lens ca. 1 x per jaar schoon te maken. Als een camera boven een weg hangt is bij defect in de regel een wegafzetting noodzakelijk. Vooral op drukke locaties wil de wegbeheerder een wegafzetting doorgaans beperken, waardoor de werkzaamheden worden gecombineerd met andere projecten. Hierdoor kan de beschikbaarheid van de systemen afnemen.Kosten  De kosten voor een kentekenherkenningssysteem liggen in de ordegrootte van 25.000 - 30.000 euro (bron: Gemeente Rotterdam), afhankelijk van het aantal camera's en het aantal rijstroken dat gemeten wordt per camera. Bij een kentekenherkenningssysteem voor trajectmetingen zijn minimaal 2 meetpunten nodig. Bij veel leverancies is het ook mogelijk om een dienst af te nemen (bijvoorbeeld de levering van reistijdinformatie), in plaats van de aanschaf van het materiaal. Hieraan zijn wel andere kosten verbonden, die afhankelijk zijn van de tijdsperiode en de nauwkeurigheid van te leveren gegevens.Bronnen  Gemeente Rotterdam, Monitoring Rotterdam DP3: Vergelijking potenti\u00eble meetsystemen, Gemeente Rotterdam dS+V afdeling Verkeer en Vervoer, maart 2006 Hillen, Monitoring ten behoeve van reistijdinformatie, AGV in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2006 Salomons, Outlier removal in camera based travel-time data of the Delft camera network, TU Delft faculteit Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen afdeling Transport & Planning, 2007Openstaande vragen  -> Terug naar weggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Succesfactoren en leerpunten  Dit artikel beschrijft factoren die bijdragen aan het succes van monitoringsprojecten.

Het systeem registreert de intensiteiten, snelheden en verkeerssamenstelling. Het belangrijkste voordeel van het radardetectorsysteem is dat het flexibel is. Tevens is het te gebruiken als mobiel monitoringssysteem. Daarnaast wordt het verkeer slechts beperkt gehinderd bij installatie en onderhoud van het systeem.Werkingsprincipe  Alle radardetectors zenden een elektromagnetisch signaal uit met een hoge frequentie (circa 10 of 24 GHz). Het uitgezonden signaal wordt gereflecteerd door stilstaande of bewegende objecten, waarna het gereflecteerde signaal door de radardetector weer wordt ontvangen. Er wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen twee typen radars: Puls radar\n Dit eenvoudige type radar zendt korte pulsen uit en meet het tijdverschil tussen het zenden en het ontvangen van de radargolven. Aangezien de snelheid van de radargolven een vast gegeven is kan uit het tijdverschil de afstand tot het voertuig bepaald worden. Snelheid en richting van de voertuigen kan worden bepaald door het doen van meerdere metingen na elkaar. Dit type radar heeft als beperkingen: Door deze nadelen wordt dit type radar bijna nergens meer toegepast. Continu radar\n Dit type radars zendt een continu radarbundel uit in plaats van korte pulsen. Er worden twee typen onderscheiden: Doppler radar\n Deze veelgebruikte radars sturen een radarbundel uit en meten de frequentieverandering van het ontvangen signaal. Afhankelijk van de bewegingsrichting van het object zal de ontvangen frequentie hoger of lager zijn dan het uitgezonden signaal. Vanwege dit Doppler-effect kan de radardetector direct de snelheid van het voertuig meten doordat de frequentie van het signaal in dezelfde verhouding veranderd als de snelheid van het gedetecteerde object. Zowel de objecten die naar de detector toe bewegen als die van de detector af bewegen kunnen worden gedetecteerd maar de radar is 'blind' voor stilstaande objecten. Voor een optimaal resultaat moet de radardetector zodanig worden ge\u00efnstalleerd dat de stralingsbundel parallel aan de rijrichting loopt. Indien dit niet mogelijk is kan, na opmeten van de hoek met de rijbaan, door een eenvoudige geometrische berekening een correctie worden toegepast. De radardetector kan zowel voertuigen als voetgangers en fietsers detecteren. \nNadelen: Frequency-Modulated radar\n Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar is de meest ingewikkelde soort radar en kan worden gezien als een soort combinatie van puls- en dopplerradar. De FMCW radar zendt een signaal uit met continu vari\u00ebrende frequentie en vergelijkt dit met de frequentie van het ontvangen signaal, hieruit kunnen direct de afstand, snelheid en richting (weggaand of komend) tot het gedetecteerde object worden bepaald. Doordat zowel richting als afstand in dezelfde meting worden bepaald is het goed mogelijk om meerdere objecten van elkaar te onderscheiden. Detectie van Stilstaande objecten, voetgangers en fietsers is mogelijk als deze voldoende signaal reflecteren. \nNadelen: Voor de benaming van een radardetector worden ook wel de namen microgolf detector, microwave detector of radio wave detector gebruikt. De radardetector kan aan een mast langs de weg of aan een uithanger, portaal of viaduct boven de weg worden bevestigd.Toepassing  De kwaliteit van de detectie is sterk afhankelijk van de positie van de radardetector. De kijkhoek voor juiste registratie van intensiteiten en snelheden kan per radardetector verschillen. Een radardetector heeft een groot meetgebied, waardoor een goed beeld kan worden verkregen van de doorstroming van het verkeer. Vanaf circa 40 meter vanaf de radardetector kan het verkeer worden gedetecteerd en vanaf circa 150 meter kan het verkeer op meerdere rijstroken worden gedetecteerd. Technisch gezien kan een radardetector als hij goed is afgesteld en er geen andere belemmeringen zijn, het verkeer op tien rijstroken over een afstand van duizend meter te detecteren. Echter door de afscherming van de voertuigen door andere voertuigen en objecten ligt het bereik van de radardetector lager, in Japan bij het VICS project wordt een bereik van 70 meter gehanteerd. Monitoringssystemen die gebruik maken van radardetectoren zijn volop in gebruik in Nederland. Op het hoofdwegennet wordt de monitoring van de verkeersstromen voornamelijk uitgevoerd met behulp van inductielussen; op enkele locaties, zoals bij kunstwerken, worden radardetectoren toegepast (door metalen constructiedelen zouden inductielussen gestoord worden). Op lokaal niveau worden de radardetectoren vaker toegepast als alternatief voor inductielussen. De provincie Zuid-Holland gebruikt radardetectoren voor het monitoren van het verkeer op de N206 en de N207.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  De kwaliteit van de metingen is sterk afhankelijk van de positie van de detector. Bij het meten van intensiteiten zijn hogere nauwkeurigheden bereikbaar dan met lengtebepaling en snelheidsmetingen. De grootste nauwkeurigheid van de metingen is haalbaar als de radardetector recht boven de rijstrook wordt geplaatst, in de lengte richting van de rijbaan. Een nadeel van radardetectoren met betrekking tot snelheidsmetingen is dat de snelheidsmeting afhankelijk is van de kijkhoek ten opzichte van het wegdek. Voor een nauwkeurige snelheidsmeting dient deze hoek nauwkeurig te worden ingesteld en de juiste correcitefactor voor de betreffende hoek te worden ingesteld in de detector. Voor een nog optimalere bepaling van de correctiefactor zijn referentiemetingen met kussen of andere nauwkeurige detectorn nodig. Indien dit wordt nagelaten zullen de snelheidsmetingen van radardetectoren veel onnauwkeuriger zijn dan die van lussen. Onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat een radarsysteem dan bij dezelfde verkeerssituatie een ander gedrag van een verkeerssignaleringsinstallatie kan geven dan lussen op hetzelfde traject. De metingen van de radardetectoren worden nauwelijks be\u00efnvloed door de weersomstandigheden. Indien de radardetector op een windgevoelige constructie wordt bevestigd kunnen trillingen de metingen be\u00efnvloeden. Een lichtmast beweegt bijvoorbeeld door de wind en door passerende vrachtwagens, een portaal is veel stabieler. Daarnaast worden radardetectoren niet be\u00efnvloed door veranderende lichtintensiteiten, zoals het verschil tussen dag en nacht, wat wel een nadeel is van infrarood- en camera-detectoren. In de onderstaande tabel is een inschatting gegeven van de nauwkeurigheid van de diverse meetgegevens, deze eisen aan de nauwkeurigheid van de gegevens zijn afkomstig uit het rapport van Polman. Deze nauwkeurigheid is alleen haalbaar als gewerkt wordt met \u00e9\u00e9n radardetector per rijstrook en recht boven de rijstrook en correct ingestelde correctiefactor voor de snelheid.Beschikbaarheid  Het systeem is ongeveer 97 procent van de tijd beschikbaar (Bron: Polman).Actualiteit  Het radardetectorsysteem registreert de gegevens binnen fracties van een seconde. Na ongeveer een minuut zijn de gegevens vervolgens verwerkt en beschikbaar voor gebruik.Flexibiliteit  De radardetectorsystemen zijn flexibel af te stellen of in te richten, afhankelijk van de situatie. De ligging en de vorm van het detectieveld zijn zonder verplaatsing van de radardetector moeilijk te veranderen. Het systeem kan daarnaast als mobiele installatie worden gebruikt, bijvoorbeeld tijdens wegwerkzaamheden. De apparatuur hoeft niet, zoals bij inductielussen, in het wegdek worden opgenomen en kan daardoor - indien noodzakelijk - ook na installatie nog worden verplaatst. Aan deze verplaatsing zijn natuurlijk wel kosten verbonden, in verband met verwijdering en installatie en het opnieuw afstellen van de detectoren en de apparatuur.Gegevenstype  Per rijstrook kunnen de volgende gegevens worden gemeten met de radardetectoren:Realisatie  Bij de implementatie van het radardetectorsysteem moet rekening worden gehouden met een doorlooptijd van een maand tot enkele maanden. Dit is afhankelijk van zaken zoals de levertijd, de bevestiging van de radardetectoren op de standplaats en het in werking stellen van het systeem. Bij het installeren van de radardetector moet de rijstrook alleen worden afgezet indien de radardetector recht boven de rijbaan of dicht langs de rijbaan wordt bevestigd.Onderhoud  Radardetectoren zijn onderhoudsarm. Het onderhoud van de radardetectoren is gemakkelijker en goedkoper, dan bij lusdetectoren, aangezien er geen ingrepen in de weg noodzakelijk zijn. Indien de detectoren recht boven de rijbaan worden geplaatst of op masten dicht langs de rijbaan, is afsluiting van \u00e9\u00e9n of meerdere rijstroken noodzakelijk, de duur van de afsluiting duurt wel korter dan bij het onderhoud aan inductielussen.Kosten  De kosten van een radardetectorsysteem zijn afhankelijk van het aantal locaties, het aantal detectoren en de communicatie-infrastructuur. Voor een meetlocatie met zes rijstroken liggen de kosten voor de installatie en aanschaf van het systeem in de orde grootte van 30.000 euro.

Met behulp van een videoalgoritme kunnen de beelden worden verwerkt en de voertuigen gedetecteerd. Behalve voor de inwinning van gegevens over de verkeerssituatie, worden ook camera's gebruikt voor incidentdetectie, doelgroepherkenning en kentekenherkenning. Het grote voordeel van camerasystemen is dan ook dat ze voor verschillende doeleinden geschikt zijn. Een nadeel is dat de beelden en het systeem gevoelig zijn voor zware weersomstandigheden en de nauwkeurigheid van de monitoring sterk wordt be\u00efnvloed door kwaliteit van de beelden.Werkingsprincipe  Onder de detectiecamera's behandeld in dit artikel worden de camera's bedoeld die het verkeersbeeld monitoren door middel van het detecteren en registreren van de passerende voertuigen. Naast deze vorm van camera's worden camera's binnen monitoring onder andere ook gebruikt voor: De detectiecamera's kunnen aan een mast naast de weg of aan portalen boven de weg worden bevestigd. Vanaf die plek brengt \u00e9\u00e9n camera een gedeelte van de weg in beeld. E\u00e9n of meer camera's worden aangesloten op een lokale verwerkingsunit, of de beelden worden via bijvoorbeeld een glasvezelverbinding naar een centrale verzonden en op een centrale verwerkingsunit aangesloten. De beelden uit de camera's worden met behulp van een videoalgoritme verwerkt om zodoende de voertuigen te detecteren. Voor het verwerken van de camerabeelden worden twee soorten algoritmes toegepast: Bij virtuele lussen worden in het camerabeeld lussen of vlakken getekend. Het videoalgoritme bepaalt of een voertuig zich in/op de virtuele lus bevindt. De actuele videobeelden binnen de virtuele lussen worden vergeleken met de statische achtergrond van het camerabeeld en met het camerabeeld dat korte tijd eerder is genomen. Als het actuele beeld binnen de virtuele lus verschilt met de statische achtergrond en het voorgaande beeld, dan is sprake van een detectie. Bij voertuigtracking wordt een voertuig door het gehele camerabeeld gevolgd en wordt met behulp van een videoalgoritme een voertuigtrajectorie gemaakt. In onderstaande figuur is de verwerking van de camerabeelden tot verkeersgegevens weergegeven.Toepassing  Op zowel het Nederlandse hoofdwegennet als het onderliggende wegennet worden camera's gebruikt voor het detecteren van voertuigen en het monitoren van verkeersstromen. Bij het inwinnen van verkeersgegevens met behulp van camera\u2019s kunnen de indicatoren intensiteit, snelheid, verkeerssamenstelling en filesituatie worden ingewonnen. De camera\u2019s worden ook gebruikt voor:  1. Incidentdetectie 2. Beoordeling van de algehele verkeerssituatie   3. Verkeerslichtenregelingen (VRI's) Bij het bepalen van de ligging en de afmeting van detectievelden, moet er rekening mee worden gehouden dat voertuigen op een naastgelegen rijstrook het detectieveld visueel kunnen afschermen. Dit kan de werking van de detector be\u00efnvloeden. Een hoog voertuig kan bijvoorbeeld het detectieveld op een aangrenzende rijstrook aan het zicht van de camera onttrekken. Dit probleem kan worden voorkomen door de camera anders te positioneren of door meerdere camera's te plaatsen. In algemene zin geldt dat met \u00e9\u00e9n camera op maximaal drie rijstroken kan worden gemeten. Bij het gebruik voor \u00e9\u00e9n rijstrook kan de camera het beste midden boven de rijstrook worden geplaatst, bij twee rijstroken boven de scheiding tussen de rijstroken en bij drie rijstroken boven de middelse rijstrook. De cameradetectiesystemen worden over het algemeen als vaste systemen geleverd, maar er zijn ook tijdelijke, mobiele systemen leverbaar.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  De kwaliteit van de gegevens wordt in hoge mate bepaald door de interpretatie en kwaliteit van de opgenomen beelden. Camera's zijn gevoelig voor een juiste belichting. Bij het analyseren van het camerabeeld treedt het probleem op dat de statische achtergrond aan veranderingen onderhevig is, bijvoorbeeld bij de overgang van dag naar nacht. Daarnaast is het beeld van een voertuig afhankelijk van de licht- en weersomstandigheden. Bij zonnig weer bijvoorbeeld omvat het beeld van een voertuig zowel het voertuig als zijn schaduw; bij donker weer wordt het beeld sterk bepaald door de verlichting in het voertuig. Ook andere weersomstandigheden zoals mist en zware regen kunnen het bereik en de kwaliteit van de camerabeelden be\u00efnvloeden. Een goed cameradetectiesysteem bevat algoritmes die deze ongewenste effecten voor een belangrijk deel filteren. Voertuigtracking leidt tot een hogere nauwkeurigheid van de snelheidsmeting. Bij de installatie van de camera's is het van belang dat deze niet op een windgevoelige constructie wordt geplaatst. Als dit niet het geval is, staan de beelden bij zeer harde wind niet helemaal stil. Daardoor 'bewegen' de virtuele lussen in het camerabeeld of blijken de camerabeelden bewogen. De tracking van de voertuigen is dan niet meer secuur genoeg. In onderstaande tabel is een inschatting gegeven van de re\u00ebel te eisen nauwkeurigheid van de diverse meetgegevens, afkomstig uit het rapport van Polman.Beschikbaarheid  In het rapport van Polman wordt gesteld dat het systeem ongeveer 99 procent van de tijd beschikbaar is.Actualiteit  De videobeelden en de detectie van de voertuigen zijn in een fractie van een seconde beschikbaar in de locale verwerkingsunit. Afhankelijk van het type communicatiesysteem zijn de gegevens binnen een minuut tot enkele minuten beschikbaar voor gebruik in een centrale.Flexibiliteit  Cameradetectie is snel aanpasbaar aan een nieuwe situatie. De camera's kunnen van afstand worden bediend. Ze kunnen voor verschillende doeleinden worden gebruikt, zoals detectie bij VRI's, incidentdetectie, doelgroepdetectie en waarneming van de actuele verkeerssituatie (langzaam rijdend verkeer/filevorming). Echter, voor het nauwkeurig meten van snelheid en intensiteit is een andere positie nodig dan voor het nauwkeurig detecteren van incidenten, stilstaande voertuigen, afgevallen lading et cetera.Gegevenstype  Per rijstrook kunnen de volgende gegevens worden gemeten met de camera's en het videoalgoritme: Daarnaast kunnen de camera's worden gebruikt voor het detecteren van informatie zoals filelengte, doelgroepvoertuigen, stilstand, afgevallen lading. Met name voor incidentmanagement wordt de camera detectiemethode veel toegepast.Realisatie  De doorlooptijd van de realisatie van een camerasysteem bedraagt ongeveer een maand tot enkele maanden. Dit is afhankelijk van zaken zoals de levertijd, de installatie/montage op de standplaats en het in werking stellen van het systeem. Het systeem kan ook als mobiel systeem worden uitgevoerd. In dat geval moet rekening worden gehouden met de voeding van het systeem, dat extra moet worden aangelegd. Bij het installeren van de cameradetector moet de rijstrook alleen worden afgezet indien de cameradetector recht boven de rijbaan wordt bevestigd. Het verkeer wordt dus alleen in dit geval gehinderd.Onderhoud  Het systeem moet regelmatig worden gecontroleerd op de juiste werking. Daarnaast moet de lens van de camera regelmatig schooon worden gemaakt voor een optimale beeld kwaliteit. Het onderhoud, voornamelijk het reinigen van de lenzen, is arbeidsintensief en daardoor duur.Kosten  De kosten van een videodetectiesysteem met liggen in de ordegrootte van 15.000 - 20.000 (Bron: Gemeente Rotterdam), afhankelijk van het aantal camera's die zijn aangesloten op het verwerkingssysteem.Bronnen  Citilog, Mediatunnel, video detection system: for a better en safer tunnel management, Citilog, 2004 Folles, van der Burgt, Bokma, van Kaam, Ogen op de weg, resultaten en conclusies pilot video incident detectie A67, Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2001 Gemeente Rotterdam, Monitoring Rotterdam DP3: Vergelijking potenti\u00eble meetsystemen, Gemeente Rotterdam dS+V afdeling Verkeer en Vervoer, maart 2006 Hillen, Monitoring ten behoeve van reistijdinformatie, AGV in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2006 Polman, Voertuigdetectie: wensen en mogelijkheden, Goudappel Coffeng in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, november 2001 Wilson, Handboek verkeerslichtenregelingen, CROW, januari 2006Openstaande vragen  Is heel moeilijk om daar een exact cijfer op te plakken. Hangt echt af van project tot project. Bijvoorbeeld, moeten extra palen worden geplaatst om de camera op te monteren of kan gebruik worden gemaakt van de bestaande infrastructuur en cameras. Naast de aankoop van de camera heb je ook nog de kost van de detectiemodule. Wat de onderhoudskost van het systeem betreft zit je met video detectie wel goed in tegenstelling bijvoorbeeld tot inductieve lussen. Je hooft geen grondboringen te doen en ook wegen moeten niet (zo vaak) worden afgezet om onderhoud te doen.

Deze functie noemt men de fundamentele relatie (ook wel basisrelatie) van de verkeerskunde.Intensiteit, dichtheid en snelheid  De intensiteit is het aantal voertuigen dat per tijdseenheid een zekere wegdoorsnede passeert. De intensiteit wordt meestal per voertuigcategorie uitgedrukt in het aantal voertuigen per uur en wordt weergegeven in intensiteit-tijddiagrammen. De capaciteit is het maximum aantal voertuigen dat per tijdseenheid een zekere dwarsdoorsnede kan passeren. De dichtheid van de verkeersstroom is het aantal voertuigen dat zich op een bepaald tijdstip op een wegvak met een bepaalde lengte en breedte bevindt. Net als bij de intensiteit kan de dichtheid worden bepaald op de hele weg of op een deel van de weg. De dichtheid wordt meestal uitgedrukt in voertuigen per kilometer en wordt weergegeven in dichtheid-tijddiagrammen. Dichtheid is een betere indicator voor de verkeersafwikkeling dan intensiteit, omdat een lage dichtheid altijd een goede afwikkeling betekent en dat hoeft bij een lage intensiteit niet altijd het geval te zijn. De snelheid geeft aan hoe hard een voertuig rijdt. De snelheid wordt weergegeven in snelheid-tijddiagrammen, tijd-wegdiagrammen van snelheid (ook wel 'vlekkenkaart' genoemd). Voor de beschrijving van de verkeersafwikkeling op macroscopisch niveau is de individuele snelheid niet van belang en wordt er alleen gekeken naar de gemiddelde snelheid. Meer informatie over snelheid is te vinden in het artikel over snelheid.Het fundamenteel diagram  De fundamentele relatie q = k * u beschrijft de verhouding tussen de drie grootheden. Het fundamenteel diagram beschrijft vervolgens de relaties tussen intensiteit en dichtheid, tussen snelheid en dichtheid en tussen snelheid en intensiteit. Zie onderstaande figuur. In het diagram zijn vijf parameters aangegeven die bepalend zijn voor het gedrag van het verkeer: Met deze parameters wordt een aantal punten in het diagram vastgelegd. De verdere vorm van het diagram wordt bepaald door de modelkeuze. Hiervoor zijn vele verschillende modellen ontwikkeld. In onderstaande figuur zijn een aantal voorbeelden van verschillende relaties tussen de snelheid en de dichtheid gegeven. De vorm van de diagrammen en met name de parameters zijn afhankelijk van (wisselende) omgevingsfactoren. De gemiddelde vrije snelheid is bijvoorbeeld afhankelijk van de voertuigpopulatie: een groot aandeel vrachtverkeer zal een lagere snelheid veroorzaken. Ook de capaciteit is geen vast gegeven. Zowel de samenstelling van de populatie als bijvoorbeeld weersomstandigheden hebben daar invloed op. Ten slotte heeft de omgeving nog een sterke invloed. Denk hierbij aan de inrichting van de weg, kwaliteit van het wegdek, indeling van de rijbaan, enzovoorts. De veronderstelling in alledrie de relaties is dat voertuigen onder gelijke omstandigheden allemaal ongeveer hetzelfde reageren. Bijvoorbeeld: bij lagere gemiddelde snelheden houden voertuigen kortere volgafstanden aan. Of andersom: als de volgafstand te klein wordt (dichtheid te groot) gaat de gemiddelde snelheid omlaag. Dientengevolge geeft het fundamentele diagram (in welke vorm dan ook) geen causale relatie weer. Er is immers niet te zeggen of snelheid nu verandert door dichtheid of andersom. Voor beide zijn argumenten te vinden. Het fundamenteel diagram is een gemiddelde statistische relatie en niet meer dan dat.De fundamentele relatie in de praktijk  In onderstaande figuur zijn verschillende meetwaarden opgenomen. Hierin valt duidelijk het theoretische fundamenteel diagram terug te vinden. Er zijn echter een aantal opmerkelijke zaken. De locatie van een meetpunt (bovenstrooms van, benedenstrooms van of in het knelpunt) is van van invloed is op de meetwaarden. Dit is te zien in onderstaande figuur.Bronnen Verkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring voor Dynamisch Verkeersmanagement  Regionale verkeersmonitoring wordt onder meer ingezet voor dynamisch verkeersmanagement (DVM). Binnen DVM wordt onderscheid gemaakt in drie typen toepassing: informeren/adviseren, waarschuwen en sturen en regelen. Deze toepassingen stellen elk verschillende eisen aan de informatie. Een effectieve toepassing van dynamisch verkeersmanagement vraagt in het algemeen om actuele en nauwkeurige gegevensinwinning.Inleiding  Gegevens die met behulp van verkeersmonitoring worden verkregen, kunnen voor verschillende doeleinden worden gebruikt. E\u00e9n van de toepassingen van verkeersmonitoring is het aansturen van de dynamische verkeersmanagement maatregelen. Dynamisch verkeersmanagement (DVM) is een veelzijdig instrument dat door wegbeheerders wordt ingezet om de wegcapaciteit optimaal te benutten. Het betreft een reeks maatregelen waarmee wordt geprobeerd om - op basis van real-time informatie - de afwikkeling van het verkeer te reguleren. En tevens om weggebruikers te informeren en zonodig te waarschuwen voor de situatie op het wegennet. DVM- maatregelen worden gestuurd door actuele verkeersgegevens, die via monitoringssystemen worden verkregen. Bij deze maatregelen spelen aspecten zoals samenwerking tussen wegbeheerders en organisatie ook een belangrijke rol, omdat de werking van de maatregelen vaak de grenzen van een beheersgebied overschrijdt. Het aansturen van de DVM-maatregelen leidt tot een bepaalde informatiebehoefte, die geheel of gedeeltelijk kan worden ingevuld door monitoring van de verkeersstromen op het wegennet. Monitoring levert veel verschillende gegevens op. Dit artikel gaat specifiek over de aan DVM gerelateerde, operationele aspecten van verkeersmonitoring. Hoofdzakelijk wordt de informatiebehoefte behandeld voor het aansturen van systemen die aan de wegkant zijn gebonden, zoals DRIPs, TDI\u2019s, GRIPs, kantelborden en matrixborden. Verkeersmonitoring voor het verstrekken van actuele verkeersinformatie voorafgaand aan de reis of voor in-car systemen, wordt apart behandeld in het artikel over actuele verkeersinformatie. In dit artikel is aangegeven welke eisen en wensen er in het algemeen aan de monitoringsgegevens worden gesteld vanuit de toepassing voor dynamisch verkeersmanagement. Denk aan actualiteit, nauwkeurigheid, aggregatieniveau, beschikbaarheid en de frequentie van de inwinperiode. Ook wordt in het artikel aangegeven welke gevolgen deze eisen hebben voor de inwinning en bewerking van de gegevens. Er worden veel verschillende indelingen gehanteerd voor de maatregelen die in het kader van dynamisch verkeersmanagement worden aangestuurd. Dit artikel volgt de indeling van het werkboek Gebiedsgericht Benutten. Veel wegbeheerders gebruiken dit werkboek als leidraad bij het opstellen van verkeersmanagementmaatregelen. Onderstaand figuur geeft het verband tussen de toepassing, de informatiebehoefte, de gegevensinwinning en gegevensbewerking weer.....Dynamisch verkeersmanagement  Het pakket van DVM-maatregelen is zeer divers. Hierdoor verschillen de  eisen aan gegevens en monitoringssystemen ook per toepassing. In het hiervoor genoemde werkboek Gebiedsgericht Benutten wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen: De maatregelen binnen deze drie onderwerpen hebben elk een eigen effect op de verkeerssituatie op het wegennet. Zo kunnen de maatregelen bijvoorbeeld lokaal de doorstroming be\u00efnvloeden, de verkeersstromen herverdelen over het netwerk, de verkeersvraag be\u00efnvloeden of de capaciteit be\u00efnvloeden.Informatiebehoefte  De informatiebehoefte die ontstaat vanuit de toepassing voor operationeel dynamisch verkeersmanagement is zeer divers. Hieronder wordt ingegaan op de informatiebehoefte voor de verschillende onderwerpen (informeren/adviseren, waarschuwen, sturen en regelen). De opsommingen dienen ter illustratie en zijn niet volledig.Informeren/adviseren  Onder deze categorie worden DVM-maatregelen verstaan die weggebruikers informeren over de actuele situatie op de weg en die hen adviseren over mogelijke alternatieve routes. De getoond informatie kan bijvoorbeeld als doel hebben om het attentieniveau van de weggebruikers te verhogen, het verkeer beter over het netwerk te verdelen, de reistijd van de weggebruikers te optimaliseren of de verkeersvraag (op bepaalde routes) te verminderen. Voorbeelden zijn: Om dynamische maatregelen voor het informeren en adviseren van de weggebruiker aan te sturen, is informatie over de verkeerssituatie nodig. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan:Waarschuwen  Ten behoeve van de veiligheid van de weggebruikers worden DVM-maatregelen toegepast die de weggebruiker waarschuwen voor onverwachte, ongebruikelijke of gevaarlijke situaties. De getoond informatie heeft voornamelijk als doel om het attentieniveau van de weggebruikers te verhogen en om weggebruikers te wijzen op de betreffende (afwijkende) situatie. Voorbeelden zijn: Om dynamische maatregelen voor het waarschuwen van de weggebruiker aan te sturen is actuele informatie over de verkeerssituatie nodig. Denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan:Sturen en regelen  Onder de categorie sturen en regelen worden DVM-maatregelen verstaan die helpen om de verkeersstromen te sturen en te regelen. Deze maatregelen hebben bijvoorbeeld als doel om de doorstroming te bevorderen, door de capaciteit te vergroten of door het verkeer beter te verdelen over het netwerk. Voorbeelden zijn: Specifieke voorbeelden van maatregelen zijn: Om de dynamische maatregelen, ten behoeve van het regelen en sturen van de verkeersstromen, aan te sturen is informatie over de verkeerssituatie nodig. Denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan:Eisen aan informatie  Voor dynamisch verkeersmanagement is het in het algemeen van belang dat de gegevens up-to-date en nauwkeurig zijn. Hoe nauwkeuriger en actueler de informatie, hoe beter de functionaliteit en effectiviteit van de maatregel. De specifieke eisen aan de informatie verschilt per toepassing en per maatregel. dit geldt ook voor het detailniveau van de informatie. Voor het aansturen van de  toeritdoseerinstallatie is bijvoorbeeld een hoog detailniveau vereist. Voor het omleiden van het verkeer kan met een minder hoog detailniveau worden volstaan. De concrete invulling van de gegevens om DVM-maatregelen aan te sturen, stelt eisen aan de kwaliteit van de informatie. Denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan: Actualiteit: voor de toepassing van de informatie voor DVM is in het algemeen een hoge actualiteit vereist. Bij informatie die nodig is om weggebruikers te waarschuwen, is zelfs een zeer hoge actualiteit gewenst. Weggebruikers moeten immers zo snel mogelijk worden ge\u00efnformeerd over naderend gevaar (bijvoorbeeld stilstaande voertuigen). Het sturen en regelen van de verkeersstromen vereist een minder hoge actualiteit. Voor informeren is het met name belangrijk dat de getoonde informatie overeenkomt met de belevingen van de weggebruiker. Indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van bijvoorbeeld een voorspellingsalgoritme, dan hoeven de ingewonnen gegevens op zichzelf niet heel actueel te zijn. Als de informatie na bewerking maar \u2018actueel\u2019 is. Voorspellingsalgoritmes of -modellen hebben in het algemeen nog wel moeite om onder alle omstandigheden een goede voorspelling van de verkeerssituatie te doen. In feite is een hoge actualiteit een hulpmiddel om een hoge nauwkeurigheid te bereiken: om de ingewonnen gegevens beter aan te laten sluiten bij de (actuele) werkelijkheid. Indien reistijden worden gemeten met behulp van kentekenherkenning is bijvoorbeeld van belang, dat het traject waarover de reistijden worden gemeten niet te lang is. Indien de weggebruikers aan het begin van het traject worden ge\u00efnformeerd op basis over de laatste gemeten reistijden, dan is de getoonde informatie verouderd en dus minder nauwkeurig. Dit kan (gedeeltelijk) worden ondergevangen door voorspellingsalgoritmes toe te passen op de verkregen reistijdinformatie. Aggregatieniveau: het aggregatieniveau hangt onder meer samen met de actualiteit van de informatie. Een hoger aggregatieniveau leidt tot een lagere actualiteit. Daarnaast geldt dat bij een te lage aggregatie de informatie te gedetailleerd is en daardoor minder goed bruikbaar. De aggregatie van de informatie moet daarnaast niet te hoog zijn. Anders kan je niet waarnemen wat je daadwerkelijk wil waarnemen. Zo is voor het waarschuwen van het verkeer een laag aggregatieniveau benodigd. Je wilt bijvoorbeeld weten of er stroomafwaarts voertuigen rijden met een lage snelheid, om de voertuigen stroomopwaarts te waarschuwen voor deze langzamer rijdende voertuigen. Bij informatie over de filelengte kan worden volstaan met een hoger aggregatieniveau. Files worden namelijk pas aangegeven als de lengte langer is dan 1 kilometer. De filelengte wordt namelijk afgerond op hele kilometers. Nauwkeurigheid: de nauwkeurigheid van de informatie is van groot belang voor de toepassing van dynamisch verkeersmanagement. De getoonde informatie wordt namelijk direct naast het werkelijke wegbeeld getoond. Als de maatregelen die de verkeersmanager worden toegepast tijdens situaties dat er geen reden is voor het inzetten van de maatregel verliest de weggebruiker het vertrouwen in het systeem. Neem bijvoorbeeld het afkruizen van een rijstrook terwijl er geen noodzaak toe is maar hierdoor wel file ontstaat. Ook verliest de verkeersmanager het vertrouwen in het systeem als de monitoringssituaties niet overeenkomen met de werkelijke situatie op de weg. Enige afwijking van de werkelijke situatie is toegestaan. De toegestane afwijking verschilt sterk per toepassing. Reistijden op DRIPs mogen bijvoorbeeld enkele procenten (bijvoorbeeld 10 procent) afwijken van de werkelijke situatie. En filelengtes worden zoals gezegd afgerond op hele kilometers. Systematische fouten in de gegevens zijn minder problematisch, omdat deze kunnen worden gecorrigeerd. Fouten die random optreden, zijn daarentegen niet eenvoudig te corrigeren en leveren daardoor wel problemen op. Beschikbaarheid: hoge beschikbaarheid is bij de toepassing voor DVM-maatregelen vereist. Want als het [meetsystemen|monitoringssyteem] uitvalt, werkt ook de verkeersmanagementmaatregel niet meer die met de monitoringsgegevens wordt aangestuurd. Indien het systeem vaak uit staat, daalt het vertrouwen van de weggebruiker in de informatie. Bij de toepassing 'waarschuwen' komt de veiligheid van de weggebruiker daarnaast in het geding als het systeem te vaak niet beschikbaar is. De effectiviteit van een DVM-maatregel hangt sterk samen met de beschikbaarheid van het systeem. Er moet bij de eisen aan de beschikbaarheid van een systeem ook rekening worden gehouden met de verhouding tussen de effectiviteit van de maatregel en de kosten voor een hoge beschikbaarheid van het systeem. Een spitsstrook heeft bijvoorbeeld een hoge effectiviteit, waardoor ook hoge eisen aan de beschikbaarheid (kunnen) worden gesteld. Een toeritdosering heeft daarentegen een lagere effectiviteit, waardoor er lagere eisen aan de beschikbaarheid kunnen worden gesteld. Frequentie inwinperiode: voor de meeste toepassingen van de verkeersmonitoring voor dynamisch verkeersmanagement is het van belang dat de verkeersgegevens continu, 24 uur per dag 7 dagen per week, worden ingewonnen.Inwinnen en bewerken van gegevens  De gegevens die met verkeersmonitoring worden ingewonnen, worden rechtstreeks of direct na bewerking gebruikt door de verkeersmanagementsystemen. Of ze worden naar de operators op de verkeerscentrale gestuurd, die de gegevens interpreteren en gebruiken. Gegevens die nodig zijn voor de aansturing van de DVM-maatregelen zijn bijvoorbeeld: Deze gegevens kunnen worden ingewonnen met verschillende soorten meetsystemen, welke worden toegelicht in het artikel meetsystemen. In ingewonnen gegevens zullen vervolgens bewerkt moeten worden zodat de verkeersmanager in de verkeerscentrale de informatie kan gebruiken om de maatregelen in te schakelen. Sommige maatregelen zullen na bewerking van de gegevens direct worden ingeschakeld, zonder tussenkomst van de operator. De verschillende bewerkingsmethodes en de modellen die worden gebruikt zijn toegelicht in het artikel gegevensbewerking.Referentieprojecten Bronnen  van den Berg, Actuele verkeersgegevens Amsterdam, Gemeente Amsterdam, Dienst Infrastructuur Verkeer en Vervoer, oktober 2006 Dijker en Visser, Handboek Regionale Verkeersmonitoring, Bijdrage aan de PAO Cursus Regionale Verkeersmonitoring, Ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat, november 2006 Immers, Meeuwissen, Stada en Yperman, DVM en beter benutten vereisen een robuust netwerk, TNO en KU Leuven, 2003 Boeve, Goede, Tchernoff, Hennekeij en Prins, Werkboek gebiedsgericht benutten, Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, oktober 2002 Rijkswaterstaat, MaatregelenCatalogus Benutten: overzicht van verkeerskundige maatregelen voor Gebiedsgericht Benutten, ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat, Kennisplatform Verkeer en Vervoer, CROW, SWOV, 2005Openstaande vragen  Momenteel geen openstaande vragen. Terug naar -> Toepassingen van verkeersmonitoringVerkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring met Floating Car Data via GSM  Floating Car Data (FCD) via GSM is een monitoringssyteem, waarbij mobiele telefoons op het wegennet worden gevolgd om een beeld van de verkeerssituatie te krijgen. Het systeem levert gedetailleerde actuele en historische informatie over de reistijd en snelheden. Het meest bekende systeem is Mobile Traffic Services (MTS). Dit artikel gaat hoofdzakelijk over de werking van het MTS-systeem. Het voordeel van FCD via GSM is dat geen grote vloot van voertuigen hoeft te worden ingezet met speciale plaatsbepalingsystemen, zoals GPS of transponsers.Werking van het systeem  Floating Car Data (FCD) via de mobiele telefoon (GSM) gebruikt anonieme gegevens van mobiele telefoons in voertuigen om het actuele verkeersbeeld op het hoofdwegen- en secundaire wegennet te bepalen. Onder het secundaire netwerk worden provinciale wegen en bijvoorbeeld ook hoofdroutes in de stad gerekend. Het FCD-systeem dat mobiele telefoons als sensoren gebruikt, is een vorm van een voertuiggebonden meetsysteem. Het systeem maakt gebruik van bestaande signalen van de GSM's. Er hoeft dus geen speciale terminal in het voertuig te worden geplaatst om gegevens naar een centrale te verzenden. Een mobiele telefoon legt om de paar seconden contact met de zendmasten in zijn omgeving. Met dit signaal kan voortdurend de locatie van een GSM worden bepaald. Momenteel kan bij alle systemen alleen nog gebruik worden gemaakt van de mobiele telefoons van \u00e9\u00e9n mobiele provider, waardoor de dekkinggraad nog niet optimaal is. Uit de ontvangen en opgeslagen signalen van de mobiele telefoon kunnen vervolgens verkeersgegevens worden afgeleid. Door een GSM over de weg op deze manier te volgen, kunnen trajectsnelheid en reistijd worden bepaald. Daarnaast kunnen herkomst-bestemmingspatronen worden opgebouwd. Er wordt ook al gewerkt aan methoden om verkeersintensiteiten te schatten.Positiebepaling  Bij het FCD-systeem via GSM wordt gebruik gemaakt van de positiebepaling van een mobiele telefoon. De GSM heeft een mobiele operator nodig om zijn communicatie tussen zend- en ontvangstmast in stand te houden. De belangrijkste bronnen voor het bepalen van de rijtijden zijn telefoongesprekken, SMS-berichten en het opzetten van een gesprek. Daarnaast wordt ook gebruik gemaakt van positie-informatie die in de standby stand vrijkomt. Maar die is minder frequent en minder exact. Global System of Mobile Communication (GSM) is gebaseerd op een concept van cellen. In elke cel staat een zender/ontvanger met een beperkt vermogen. Om te voorkomen dat interferentie optreedt tussen aangrenzende cellen, wordt gebruik gemaakt van verschillende frequenties. De betrouwbaarheid is sterk afhankelijk van de kwaliteit van de radioverbinding. Bij het monitoren van het verkeer worden de signalen die een mobiele telefoon uitzendt, gebruikt voor de positiebepaling van de voertuigen. De locatie van de bellende mobiele telefoon wordt twee keer per seconde door de mobiele operator vastgesteld.Dit gebeurt binnen een bandbreedte van vijfhonderd meter. Deze band ligt in de cirkel om de zend- en ontvangstmast. Daarbij wordt nog gebruikgemaakt van sectoren. Zo is van de mobiele beller bekend waar deze zich bevindt, binnen een sector van vijfhonderd meter. Bij de overgang van de ene naar de andere band en met het snijpunt van een weg, is exact bekend waar de telefoon zich bevindt. Op die manier is bekend op welke locatie de mobiele telefoon zich bevindt en op welk tijdstip hij zich hier bevindt. In het Cellular Positioning System vindt de positiebepaling van een mobiele telefoon plaats aan de hand van verschillende gegevens, bijvoorbeeld:Stappen tot verkrijgen verkeersinformatie  Bij de toepassing van GSM-signalen voor het verkrijgen van verkeersinformatie moet de benodigde soft- en hardware in het netwerk van de mobiele operator worden geplaatst, om de verplaatsingen van mobiele telefoons te kunnen ontsluiten. De verkeersinformatie krijgt in vijf stappen \u2018bottum up\u2019 gestalte (zie onderstaande figuur):Privacy  De gegevens van de mobiele telefoons die voor de verkeersinformatie worden gebruikt, zijn niet herleidbaar tot personen of mobiele telefoonnummers. Er worden door de telecomprovider uitsluitend tijdelijke coderingen verstrekt aan de wegbeheerder of de leverancier van de FCD. Er wordt gebruik gemaakt van een techniek die de privacy van weggebruikers met een mobiele telefoon waarborgt (een zogenoemde Privacy Enhancing Technology). Dit is overeenkomstig de aanbevelingen van het College van Bescherming Persoonsgegevens over nieuwe technieken, die het volgen van de mobiliteit van weggebruikers mogelijk maken.Toepassing  Het voordeel van Floating Car Data via GSM is dat geen grote vloot voertuigen hoeft te worden uitgerust met speciale plaatsbepalingsystemen, (zoals GPS). Hiervan levert een aanzienlijk deel doorgaans geen informatie,omdat het betreffende voertuig geparkeerd staat. FCD via GSM heeft dit nadeel niet, omdat het gebruik maakt van al bestaande communicatietechnologie. Een ander voordeel van FCD is dat dit systeem goed in staat is om een beeld te krijgen van het herkomst-bestemmingspatroon van de voertuigen op het netwerk. Doordat het systeem een groot bereik heeft - groter dan alle andere methoden die worden toegepast voor het bepalen van de herkomsten en bestemmingen - kunnen de gegevens uit het FCD-systeem goed worden gebruikt om de gaten in H/B-matrices op te vullen, die gebruikt worden voor online-verkeersmodellen. Het belangrijkste nadeel van het FCD-systeem via GSM is dat het aantal metingen nog erg klein is. Met name doordat in het huidige systeem:Pilot projecten  Er zijn verschillende technische systemen op de markt die met behulp van het netwerk van mobiele telefoons de locaties van voertuigen bepalen, en dit gebruiken voor het verkrijgen van een beeld van de verkeerssituatie. Twee voorbeelden zijn: Mobile Traffic Service Het meest bekende systeem in Nederland is Mobile Traffic Services (MTS). Dit systeem voert de plaatsbepaling uit op basis van netwerksignalering van actieve mobiele telefoons. MTS is een dienstenpakket dat verkeersinformatie levert over het gehele wegennet, dus van rijkswegen, provinciale wegen en gemeentelijke wegen. De verkeersinformatie komt tot stand door de verplaatsingen van mobiele telefoons in te winnen en deze te verwerken. De belangrijkste bronnen voor het bepalen van de posities zijn telefoongesprekken, SMS-berichten en het opzetten van een telefoongesprek. In deze situatie wordt elke twee seconden contact gemaakt met de mobiele operator. Daarnaast wordt ook gebruik gemaakt van positie-informatie die in de standby stand vrijkomt, ook al is deze minder frequent. Estimotion Estimotion (ook wel ITIS) genoemd is een systeem dat de plaatsbepaling uitvoert op basis van schakelmomenten tussen de verschillende GSM-cellen. Doordat bekend is waar en op welk moment de voertuigen/mobiele telefoons van GSM-cel wisselen, kunnen met behulp van een kaart van het wegennet de route, reistijd en trajectsnelheid van de voertuigen worden bepaald. In Belgi\u00eb is een pilot uitgevoerd waarbij gebruik is gemaakt van de estimotion technologie. De Vlaamse overheid, de mobiele telefoonprovider Proximus en ITIS Holding plc (een Brits bedrijf gespecialiseerd in verkeersinformatie) hebben een samenwerkingsovereenkomst om met de estimotion-technologie verkeersinformatie in te winnen. Bij vlot verkeer worden accurate reistijden berekend voor de meeste snelwegen en kleinere wegen. Meestal geeft deze technologie ook het juiste verloop van het verkeer weer. De voorspelde reistijden zijn echter vaak te optimistisch, vooral bij vertraagd verkeer.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  De nauwkeurigheid van Floating Car Data-systemen, zoals MTS, wordt bepaald door: Positiebepalings- en uitzendfrequentie De actualiteit van de gegevens bepaalt mede de nauwkeurigheid van de informatie. Hoe vaker de GSM informatie naar de centrale stuurt en hoe vaker de centrale de signalen verwerkt tot posities en reistijden, hoe nauwkeurig de informatie over de verkeerssituatie. Aantal getraceerde mobiele telefoons De nauwkeurigheid is mede afhankelijk van het aantal mobiele telefoons dat op het netwerk wordt getraceerd. Hoe meer mobiele telefoons beschikbaar zijn, hoe meer metingen er zijn aan de hand waarvan de gemiddelde snelheid en reistijd kan worden bepaald. En dus: hoe nauwkeuriger de verkeersgegevens. Bij hogere verkeersdrukte is het aantal telefoongesprekken over het algemeen hoger, waardoor ook meer waarnemingen beschikbaar zijn. Dichtheid van het netwerk De nauwkeurigheid van het systeem in stedelijk gebied is minder groot dan daarbuiten. Dit komt onder meer doordat de positiebepaling op het onderliggend wegennet en stedelijk wegennet moeilijker is. Dit hangt samen met het feit dat de wegen in de stad dichter op elkaar liggen, waardoor in sommige gevallen niet (goed) te onderscheiden is welke route een voertuig neemt. Hierbij moet echter wel worden opgemerkt dat in stedelijk gebied de celgrootte van GSM kleiner is dan in landelijk gebied.Ervaringen uit pilot projecten  In Nederland zijn verschillende pilotprojecten uitgevoerd met MTS om het verkeer te monitoren. In de pilotprojecten zijn verschillende ervaringen opgedaan met het FCD-systeem. Drie van deze pilots komen in dit handboek aan bod. De uitgebreide ervaringen met MTS worden besproken in de drie afzonderlijke artikelen:Actualiteit  De actuele gegevens worden binnen een minuut na afloop van de periode geleverd. De periode bedraagt tussen de 5 en 15 minuten. Dit is afhankelijk van de beschikbaarheid aan telefoongesprekken die worden gevoerd.Beschikbaarheid  De beschikbaarheid van gegevens hangt af van het aantal telefoongesprekken dat wordt gevoerd. Bij grotere drukte is het aantal gesprekken over het algemeen hoger, waardoor ook de beschikbaarheid toeneemt. Verwacht wordt, dat op momenten dat de behoefte aan actuele gegevens het grootst is, de beschikbaarheid ook het grootst zal zijn.Flexibiliteit  Omdat de verkeersgegevens per wegsegment worden aangeleverd en weggebonden zijn (dus niet statisch), is er een grote mate van flexibiliteit bij het bepalen van de routes die moeten worden bemeten.Gegevenstypen  Met Floating Car Data worden de reistijden over trajecten ingewonnen. Aan de hand van de reistijden kan informatie worden verkregen over de snelheden en vertragingen op het netwerk. Daarnaast kan een herkomst-bestemmingspatroon worden opgesteld aan de hand van de verkregen posities van de voertuigen. Gewerkt wordt aan een methode om de intensiteiten op de trajecten te schatten.Kosten  In tegenstelling tot bij de weggebonden systemen, zijn voor FCD geen investeringen in de aanschaf en het onderhoud van fysieke infrastructuur nodig. De investeringskosten voor een FCD-systeem via GSM zijn daardoor relatief laag. De grootste kostenpost is het aantal telefooncentrales dat moet worden ingericht.Bronnen  Hillen, Monitoring ten behoeve van reistijdinformatie, AGV in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2006 de Jong, Klunder, Oldenburger, Versteegt en Baan, Evaluatie Floating Car Data en Road Side Radar Zuid-Holland, TNO Mobiliteit en Logistiek, maart 2006 LogicaCMG, Resultaten validatiestudie MTS Polman, Voertuigdetectie: wensen en mogelijkheden, Goudappel Coffeng in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, november 2001 Rutten, Schuurbiers en de Wolff, Floating Car Data per mobiele telefoon, Verkeerskunde nummer 10, december 2003 Van der Vlist, de Wolff en Rutten, Verkeersgegevens op basis van mobiel telefoonverkeer, Collequium Vervoersplanologisch Speurwerk, september 2004 de Wolff en Swaans, Sturen op informatie: naar bereikbaarheidskwaliteit, Provincie Noord-Brabant, Symposium Dynamisch Verkeersmanagement, 2005 Site van LogicaCMG over MTS Terug naar -> Voertuiggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring met verkeersregelinstallaties  Verkeersregelinstallaties (VRI's) worden naast het regelen van het verkeer op kruispunten ook gebruikt voor het monitoren van het verkeer. De meeste verkeerslichtenregelingen werken op basis van de aan-/afwezigheid van voertuigen. Voor de detectie wordt meestal gebruik gemaakt van inductielussen en drukknoppen, soms ook van detectiecamera's, radar- en infraroodsignalen. De detectoren van deze installaties kunnen relatief eenvoudig worden gebruikt voor monitoring. VRI\u2019s kunnen doorgaans ook eenvoudig worden gebruikt als tussenstation voor het verzenden van monitoringsgegevens, omdat ze veelal een verbinding met een centrale computer hebben en omdat op de drukkere wegen bijna altijd wel een VRI nabij is.Werkingsprincipe  Binnen dit artikel wordt gericht op het tellen van het verkeer met behulp van verkeersregelinstallaties (VRI's), het gebruik van de ingewonnen gegevens in een model wordt toegelicht in het artikel over verkeersmodellen. Bij het monitoren van het verkeer met behulp van VRI\u2019s worden hoofdzakelijk gebruik gemaakt van inductielussen en drukknoppen als detectiesysteem. De laatste jaren worden er al regelmatig andere detectievormen toegepast. Detectiecamera's zijn de meest toegepast andere vorm van detectie, ook radardetectoren worden tegenwoordig vaker toegepast, infrarooddetectoren worden nog sporadisch toegepast bij VRI\u2019s. Belangrijk is dat de detectieconfiguratie voor een VRI is ontworpen voor de detectie van de aanwezigheid van voertuigen of langzaam verkeer, en niet direct voor het tellen ervan. Daarnaast is filemeting of wachtrijmeting een aspect waarop wordt gedetecteerd en waarop de detectoren zijn geconfigureerd. De standaard VRI\u2019s zijn dan ook vaak niet in staat om direct te worden gebruikt als monitoringssysteem. Met enkele aanpassingen in de detectieconfiguratie software en de beheerscentrale kan een detectieveld zonodig geschikt worden gemaakt voor monitoring zonder de functie voor de VRI te verstoren. De lokaal ingewonnen gegevens worden naar een VRI-centrale toegestuurd. In de centrale worden de gegevens geaggregeerd tot het geweeste niveau, vervolgens worden de gegevens naar de monitoringscentrale gestuurd al waar de dataverwerking en datafusie plaatst vindt. De uiteindelijke bewerking van de gegevens afkomstig uit de monitoring met de VRI is besproken in het artikel over gegevensbewerking. Of een VRI kan worden omgebouwd tot monitoringssysteem is afhankelijk van de centrale die gekoppeld is aan de VRI en de leeftijd van de VRI zelf. Ook zijn er verschillen tussen de mogelijkheden tot ombouwen per fabrikant.Toepassing  De VRI\u2019s worden bij de toepassing van monitoring voornamelijk gebruikt voor het doorsturen van intensiteitsgegevens. De beschikbare rekenkracht kan lokaal worden ingezet om de ruwe data alvast in een eerste stap te verwerken. In een model kunnen de ruwe gegevens vervolgens nog worden bewerkt om meer informatie, zoals reistijden, te verkrijgen. Daarnaast kunnen de VRI\u2019s ook een functie hebben bij preprocesssing en controle van meetgegevens. Door de aanwezigheid van een groot detectieveld kunnen andere detectoren worden gebruikt om de detectoren, die voor monitoring worden toegepast, te controleren of eventueel bij storing te vervangen. Dit kan in de VRI worden geprogrammeerd. Ook kan in een VRI bij storing van communicatielijnen een bepaalde hoeveelheid data worden opgeslagen. aandachtspunt bij het monitoren van het verkeer met VRI\u2019s is dat de VRI moet beschikken over voldoende geheugen en meetmogelijkheden. Binnen de verkeersregelinstallaties wordt steeds meer gebruik gemaakt van systemen die de kwaliteit van de verkeerslichtenregeling kunnen beoordelen. Hierbij worden lokaal in de automaat alle events (detectieovergangen, signaalgroepovergangen, e.d.) opgeslagen (in een gecomprimeerd formaat). Deze informatie wordt vervolgens eens in de zoveel tijd (instelbaar) overgezonden naar een centraal systeem. Vervolgens worden deze gegevens automatisch of handmatig bewerkt. Daartoe wordt op een centraal systeem (dit kan zijn het systeem waar de gegevens binnenkomen) de gecomprimeerde bestanden ingelezen en met behulp van voorafgedefinieerde algoritmen bewerkt. Zodoende kan informatie worden verkregen over bv intensiteiten, groentijden, cyclustijden, wachttijden, wachtrijen, onnodig wachten, overstaan (2x voor rood staan), enz. Op basis van eveneens vooraf gedefinieerde/ingestelde beleidsuitgangspunten kan vervolgens een kwaliteitsniveau hieraan gehangen worden (en online gedisplayed worden). Het systeem kan eveneens goed gebruikt worden voor foutopsporing, evaluaties en onderzoeken. Naast het monitoren van de verkeersstromen kunnen VRI\u2019s ook gebruikt worden voor selectieve detectie, met name voor het openbaar vervoer. Er zijn een aantal systemen op de markt, waaronder: VETAG, VECAM, KAR, SICS, Opticom, Sabimos.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  De primaire taak van een VRI is het regelen van het verkeer. De nauwkeurigheid van de detectoren voor monitoring kan afhankelijk zijn van de detectieconfiguratie ten behoeve van deze primaire taak. Ten behoeve van monitoring zijn aanpassingen veelal mogelijk zonder de functionaliteit voor de VRI te verminderen.Beschikbaarheid  Voor VRI\u2019s is meestal geregeld dat storingen binnen korte tijd worden verholpen. Door de kwaliteitseisen die aan de regeltoestellen worden gesteld, is het aantal storingen bovendien zeer beperkt. De beschikbaarheid ten behoeve van monitoring wordt daardoor voornamelijk bepaald door de beschikbaarheid van de individuele detectoren.Actualiteit  Indien er geen gebruik wordt gemaakt van een model, vergt de verwerking van de ruwe gegevens enkele uren. Wordt wel gebruik gemaakt van een model dan is de verwerkingstijd afhankelijk van het type model. Maar over het algemeen geldt dat de gegevens binnen enkele minuten beschikbaar zijn voor gebruik.Flexibiliteit  De flexibiliteit is afhankelijk van de gebruikte detectiesystemen en de configuratie ervan. De metingen zullen altijd in de buurt van kruispunten (of andere locaties waar VRI\u2019s staan) worden uitgevoerd.Gegevenstype  Met detectoren van VRI's kunnen alle mogelijke gegevens worden ingewonnen, afhankelijk van de gebruikte detectiesystemen en de configuratie ervan. In het algemeen wordt het systeem gebruikt voor de inwinning van de intensiteiten. Daarnaast kunnen sommige systemen, afhankelijk van de specifieke inrichting, ook andere gegevens inwinnen zoals: Met modellen kunnen aan de hand van de ingewonnen gegevens de reistijden worden berekend.Realisatie  Het Aansluiten van een extra detector op een VRI of het aanpassen van de detectorconfiguratie kan in principe snel worden gerealiseerd. Uit kostenoverwegingen wordt veelal gewacht totdat werkzaamheden kunnen worden gecombineerd. Dit geldt met name voor het slijpen van inductielussen.Onderhoud  Een groot deel van de onderhoudsactiviteiten en kosten vallen onder het reguliere VRI onderhoud, de monitoringstoepassing lift hierin mee. De VRI\u2019s kenmerken zich door zeer weinig storingen en kwalitatief goed onderhoud. De monitoringscentrale en (indien gebruikt) het model hebben wel apart onderhoud nodig. VRI\u2019s worden steeds meer zodanig geprogrammeerd dat de werking zo goed mogelijk in stand blijft als \u00e9\u00e9n of meer detectoren kapot gaan of een storing vertonen. Hiermee wordt de mogelijkheid gecre\u00eberd om met een relatief gering kwaliteitsverlies reparatie van de detectie te kunnen uitstellen. Kostenoverwegingen spelen hierbij een rol. Voor de kwaliteit van de monitoring kan het gewenst of noodzakelijk zijn om het onderhouds- en herstelregime anders in te stellen, althans voor de onderdelen van het systeem die voor de monitoring van belang zijn.Kosten  Door gebruik te maken van beschikbare systemen en netwerken van de VRI\u2019s kunnen de kosten voor monitoringssystemen worden beperkt, in vergelijking tot een zelfstandig functionerend monitoringssyteem. Met name de kosten voor lokale verwerkingsunits en communicatie zijn hierdoor lager of soms nihil. Bij het ombouwen van de VRI tot monitoringssysteem zitten de kosten voornamelijk in de aanpassingen in de detectieconfiguratie en het aanbrengen van een extra applicatie in de VRI beheerscentrale. Daarnaast brengt de verwerking van de ruwe gegevens tot bruikbare data kosten met zich mee. Indien gebruik wordt gemaakt van een model zitten de kosten in de rechten op en het gebruik van het model.Bronnen  van den Berg, Actuele verkeersgegevens Amsterdam, Gemeente Amsterdam, Dienst Infrastructuur, Verkeer en Vervoer, oktober 2005 Hillen, Monitoring ten behoeve van reistijdinformatie, AGV in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2006 Wilson, Handboek verkeerslichtenregelingen, CROW, januari 2006Openstaande vragen  -> Terug naar weggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring d.m.v. visuele verkeerstellingen  Visuele verkeerstellingen zijn een tijdelijke monitoringsmethode waarbij mensen het verkeer tellen. Met deze handmatige tellingen worden op een bepaalde locatie de passerende verkeersdeelnemers geregistreerd. Hierbij wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen de verschillende verkeerscategorie\u00ebn. De methode kan zonder veel voorbereidingen en op korte termijn worden uitgevoerd. Ze vergt geen speciale/kostbare apparatuur en levert direct bruikbare gegevens op.Werkingsprincipe  Bij visuele handmatige verkeerstellingen worden alle passerende verkeersdeelnemers, onderverdeeld in verkeerscategorie\u00ebn, geregistreerd. Met behulp van deze methode kunnen gedetailleerde gegevens over de verkeersintensiteit en de verkeerssamenstelling worden verkregen. Het aantal te onderscheiden categorie\u00ebn verkeersdeelnemers is afhankelijk van het doel van het onderzoek.  Bij de methode bevindt zich een waarnemer aan de kant van de weg. Hij turft voor elke passerende verkeersdeelnemer een streepje op het registratieformulier, in een voor de desbetreffende verkeerscategorie bestemd vakje. Desgewenst kan hierbij onderscheid worden gemaakt naar rijrichting. Voor het tellen van een of meer drukkere verkeerscategorie\u00ebn kan een handteller worden gebruikt. Vooraf bepaalt de onderzoeksleider welke verkeerscategorie\u00ebn tijdens de metingen dienen te worden onderscheiden. Hierbij moet een afweging worden gemaakt tussen de complexiteit van de tellingen (heel veel categorie\u00ebn) en gegevensverlies bij aggregatie (heel weinig categorie\u00ebn). Tevens moet de onderzoeksleider vooraf een schatting maken van de intensiteit, om het aantal waarnemers en het eventuele gebruik van handtellers te bepalen. Afhankelijk van de verwachte intensiteit en het aantal te onderscheiden verkeerscategorie\u00ebn dienen \u00e9\u00e9n of meer waarnemers te worden ingezet. In een woonstraat is \u00e9\u00e9n waarnemer in staat al het verkeer waar te nemen, terwijl op een druk kruispunt meer waarnemers nodig zijn om al het verkeer in alle richtingen te kunnen waarnemen. Als vuistregel geldt dat \u00e9\u00e9n waarnemer, met een registratieformulier voor tien voertuigcategorie\u00ebn 800 tot 1000 vtg/u in \u00e9\u00e9n richting kan registreren. Of 400 tot 600 vtg/u in twee rijrichtingen. Indien de waarnemer in het bezit is van een handteller voor vier categorie\u00ebn kan hij 2000 vtg/u in \u00e9\u00e9n rijrichting registreren. De verwerking van de gegevens bestaat uit het berekenen van de uurgemiddelden van de verschillende categorie\u00ebn per rijrichting. Het aantal voertuigen per voertuigcategorie kan vervolgens worden omgerekend naar de personen-auto-equivalent (PAE).Toepassing  De visuele handmatige verkeerstellingen kunnen onder meer worden gebruikt voor: De keuze van de locatie waarop wordt geteld is afhankelijk van het doel van de telling, het wegtype en de kenmerken van het verkeer. Bij de locatiekeuze dient men zich af te vragen welk verkeer w\u00e9l en welk verkeer n\u00edet relevant is voor het onderzoek. Als onderscheid moet worden gemaakt tussen de rijrichtingen, moet het zicht op al het verkeer goed zijn. Er moet bijvoorbeeld rekening worden gehouden met het 'afdekken' van het zichtveld door vrachtauto's. De periode waarin wordt geteld is afhankelijk van het doel van de telling. Een telling gedurende de spitsperioden is toereikend als men de intensiteiten tijdens de drukste uren wil weten. Om de exacte ligging van de spistperiode vast te kunnen stellen, kunnen mechanische tellingen (met bijvoorbeeld de pneumatische telslang), de telresultaten van nabijgelegen locaties of historisch telmateriaal worden gebruikt. Ook kan voor een ruime meetperiode worden gekozen, waarbinnen altijd de drukste perioden vallen. Bij het uitvoeren van de verkeerstellingen moeten de verkeersveiligheidsregels in acht worden genomen. Waarnemers moeten voldoende afstand van de wegkant houden en een veiligheidsvest dragen dat aan de veiligheidsnormen voldoet.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  Registratie per kwartier is normaliter voldoende nauwkeurig. Bij hoge intensiteiten kan ervoor worden gekozen om de gegevens per 5 of 10 minuten te registreren. Een kort tijdsinterval kan bijvoorbeeld nuttig zijn om de piekdrukte in de spits vast te stellen of om de gevolgen van waarneem- en registratiefouten te beperken. Een nadeel van korte tijdsintervallen is dat het aantal te verwerken gegevens toeneemt. De verkeersintensiteit wordt be\u00efnvloed door factoren als dag van de week, weersomstandigheden, jaargetijde en bijzondere omstandigheden zoals wegwerkzaamheden en evenementen. De overdraagbaarheid van de resultaten van de meting zijn daardoor sterk afhankelijk van de situatie tijdens de onderzoeksdag. Een korte eenmalige telling kan derhalve nooit meer dan een indicatief beeld opleveren. In het algemeen zal een visuele handmatige telling van enkele uren voldoende zijn om een goede indicatie te geven van de intensiteiten en samenstelling van het verkeer in de betreffende periode. De meetresultaten kunnen echter niet dienen als basis voor uitspraken over de verkeersafwikkeling van een hele week, een maand of een jaar.Gegevenstype  Visuele handmatige verkeerstellingen kunnen worden toegepast voor het verzamelen van de volgende gegevens:Kosten  Bij langdurige tellingen is deze methode erg kostbaar, omdat er dan veel mens-/arbeidsuren in het onderzoek moeten worden gestoken.Bronnen  CROW, Tellen en meten in het verkeer: leidraad voor het uitvoeren van eenvoudig verkeersonderzoek, juni 1994 -> Terug naar weggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring met pneumatische telslangen  De pneumatische telslang is een tijdelijke meetmethode, waarbij het verkeer op een provinciale of (vooral) stedelijke weg gedurende gemiddeld een week kan worden waargenomen. Met de pneumatische telslang worden de voertuigen (assen) die over de rubberen slang rijden gedetecteerd. De telslang kan zowel worden gebruikt voor motorvoertuigen als voor fietsers. Met behulp van deze methode kunnen de intensiteiten (per voertuigcategorie) worden bepaald.Werkingsprincipe  Een pneumatische telslang is een holle rubberen slang. Op de plaats waar het verkeer moet worden geteld wordt de telslang over de weg gelegd, loodrecht op de rijrichting van het verkeer. De slang wordt met grondhaken in de berm en/of met klemmen op het wegdek bevestigd. De telslang wordt aangesloten op een telapparaat dat naast de rijbaan wordt opgesteld. Met de pnuematische telslang kunnen de intensiteiten, snelheden en voertuigcategorie\u00ebn worden gemeten. Het telapparaat totaliseert de gegevens per ingestelde meetperiode en bewaart deze in het geheugen totdat ze worden uitgelezen. Op het moment dat het wiel van een voertuig de rubberen slang overrijdt, wordt de lucht in de slang verplaatst, hetgeen door het telapparaat wordt gedetecteerd. De gevoeligheid van het telapparaat is instelbaar, zodat het mogelijk is om (brom)fietsers buiten de meting te houden. Voor het tellen van motorvoertuigen moet de telslang loodrecht op de bewegingsrichting van de voertuigen liggen. Dit is om dubbeltellingen te voorkomen. Een telslang moet niet in of net na een bocht worden geplaatst, of net na een uitrit/zijweg, omdat de voertuigen dan niet loodrecht over de telslang rijden. Bij het tellen van (brom)fietsers dient de telslang onder een hoek van 30 graden te worden aangelegd. Zo kunnen naast elkaar rijdende fietsers apart worden gedetecteerd. De gevoeligheid van de telapparatuur moet op de (brom)fietsers worden afgesteld.aaaToepassing  De methode van de pneumatische telslang wordt veel al gebruikt voor beleidstoepassingen, zo kunnen de ingewonnen gegevens en bewerkte informatie onder meer worden gebruikt om: De telapparatuur is in staat om een groot aantal voertuigcategorie\u00ebn te herkennen, op basis van het aantal assen en de afstand tussen de assen. In dit geval zijn er twee telslangen per rijrichting benodigd. Daarnaast kan de telapparatuur - in een combinatie met twee telslangen - de snelheid meten en kan de rijrichting van voertuigen worden bepaald. De meer eenvoudige telapparatuur is voor deze doeleinden overigens niet geschikt. De keuze van de meetlocatie is afhankelijk van het doel van de telling, het wegtype en de kenmerken van het verkeer. In stedelijk gebied kan de belasting van een weg/straat aanzienlijk fluctueren, als gevolg van de ontsluiting van parkeerterreinen, kantoren et cetera. Bij het kiezen van de locatie dient men zich af te vragen welk verkeer wel en welk verkeer niet relevant is voor het onderzoek. Het aantal benodigde telslangen en de positionering van de telslangen is afhankelijk van de situatie en de vraag of het verkeer per afzonderlijke rijrichting moet worden geregistreerd. Onderstaande figuur laat zes mogelijke combinaties zien: Vanwege veiligheidseisen is het bijna niet meer mogelijk om de slangen in het midden van de rijbaan of in de middenberm te bevestigen. Daarom wordt in het midden van de telslang een knoop gelegd om zodoende alleen de voertuigen te traceren die over \u00e9\u00e9n helft van de slang rijden. De benodigde lengte van de meetperiode is afhankelijk van de toepassing waarvoor wordt gemonitoord. De pneumatische telslang is een periodiek meetsysteem, en wordt meestal voor enkele weken ingezet. Er kunnen technische beperkingen ten aanzien van de lengte van de meting gelden, zoals een beperkte geheugenruimte. Afhankelijk van het gekozen tijdsinterval kan de telapparatuur kortere of langere tijd functioneren. De apparatuur is niet geschikt voor hogere snelheden (>100 km/u), omdat de verankering van de slang dan mogelijk onvoldoende weerstand biedt om de slang op zijn plaats te houden. De meetmethode wordt bijna niet toegepast bij snelheden boven de 60 km/u, in verband met de geldende veiligheidseisen en de hoge slijtage.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  Hoe langer de meetperiode, des te nauwkeuriger is het berekende gemiddelde. Bij de keuze van de meetperiode dient rekening te worden gehouden met geplande wegwerkzaamheden en vakantiedagen. Op deze dagen is de verkeersstroom namelijk niet representatief. Wielen die gelijktijdig de slang oprijden kunnen niet apart worden waargenomen. Vandaar dat meestal over het geregistreerd aantal voertuigassen wordt gesproken. Indien een voertuig niet loodrecht ten opzichte van de ligging van de telslang rijdt, passeren de wielen van het voertuig de slang niet gelijktijdig, waardoor abusievelijk twee aspassages worden geregistreerd. Daarom is het noodzakelijk dat de slang loodrecht op de rijrichting van de voertuigen wordt geplaatst. Bij eenvoudige telapparatuur, die geen onderscheid maakt naar de voertuigcategorie\u00ebn, onstaat er tevens een vertekening als gevolg van passerende vrachtauto\u2019s, die meer dan twee assen hebben. Met behulp van een (vast ingestelde) assenco\u00ebffici\u00ebnt wordt het aantal getelde assen omgerekend naar het aantal voertuigen. Een verkeerd ingestelde asco\u00ebffici\u00ebnt kan een aanzienlijke vertekening geven. Een geschatte waarde van 0,50 bij een werkelijke waarde van 0,48 geeft al een overschatting van het aantal voertuigen met ruim vier procent.Beschikbaarheid  Indien de telapparatuur defect, als gevolg van extreme weersomstandigheden, criminaliteit of het kapot rijden van de telslang, is het systeem niet meer beschikbaar. Het is verstandig om de appartuur een aantal keren per meetperiode te controleren.Actualiteit  De gegevens zijn direct beschikbaar in de locale verwerkingsunit. Met behulp van een computer kunnen de gegevens worden uitgelezen en vervolgens worden verwerkt tot bruikbare informatie. De verwerking gebeurt meestal na afloop van de meetperiode, en kan enkele dagen duren.Flexibiliteit  Het telapparaat heeft een eigen stroomvoorziening en kan derhalve overal worden geplaatst. Er moet wel een paal, boom of mast aanwezig zijn om het apparaat aan vast te ketenen om diefstal tegen te gaan.Gegevenstype  De toepassing van de pneumatische telslang is geschikt voor het verzamelen van de volgende gegevens; welk ingezameld kunnen worden voor de gehele rijbaan, per rijrichting of per rijstrook:Onderhoud  De onbewaakte opstelling maakt de apparatuur gevoelig voor vandalisme. De apparatuur wordt soms kapot teruggevonden of zelfs gestolen. In de zomer bij erg warm weer bestaat de kans dat de telslangen in het asfalt worden gereden. Daarnaast kunnen de klemmen na enige tijd van gebruik uit het asfalt worden gereden.Realisatie en kosten  De methode is in vergelijking tot het  visueel handmatig tellen veel minder arbeidsintensief en is indien een tijdelijk systeem gewenst is zeer betaalbaar. De methode is geschikt om gedurende langere tijd aaneengesloten tellingen te verrichten. De apparatuur kan redelijk snel worden ge\u00efnstalleerd (of verplaatst).Bronnen  CROW, Tellen en meten in het verkeer: leidraad voor het uitvoeren van eenvoudig verkeersonderzoek, juni 1994Openstaande vragen  De gewone pneumatische telslang telt fietsers met een onnauwkeurigheid van rond de vijf procent. (Bron: Fietsberaad.nl) De kosten zijn gemiddeld 350 euro per week inclusief huur en plaatsen van de telapparatuur. -> Terug naar weggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring voor actuele verkeersinformatie  Regionale verkeersmonitoring wordt onder meer ingezet om aan reizigers actuele verkeersinformatie te verstrekken. De reiziger kan op basis van de verkregen informatie besluiten eerder of later te vertrekken, een andere route te volgen of een ander vervoermiddel te nemen. Daarnaast heeft actuele informatie een comfortverhogende functie door het wegnemen van onzekerheid. Ook weggebruikers die hun reis niet kunnen (of willen) aanpassen waarderen actuele verkeersinformatie over het algemeen als positief. De informatie aan de reiziger moet 7 dagen per week 24 uur per dag beschikbaar zijn. Daarom moeten de gegevens benodigd voor het verstrekken van verkeersinformatie continu worden ingewonnen. Omdat reizigers niet gebaat zijn bij onjuiste of verouderde informatie, worden redelijk hoge eisen gesteld aan de actualiteit en nauwkeurigheid.Inleiding  Gegevens die met behulp van verkeersmonitoring worden verkregen, kunnen voor verschillende doeleinden worden gebruikt. E\u00e9n van de  toepassingen van verkeermonitoring is het verstrekken van actuele verkeersinformatie aan de reizigers. Om de actuele verkeersinformatie aan de reizigers te kunnen tonen is informatie benodigd over de verkeerssituatie op het wegennet. Informatie die benodigd is voor actuele verkeersinformatie is onder andere filemeldingen, actuele reistijden, maar ook wegwerkzaamheden, evenementen, incidenten etc. Dit artikel richt zich voornamelijk op de methoden om monitoringsgegevens in te winnen en te bewerken tot bruikbare informatie voor actuele verkeersmonitoring. Daarnaast heeft dit artikel betrekking op pre-trip en in-car informatie. Verkeersinformatie die on-trip via wegkant systemen aan de reiziger wordt getoond wordt beschreven in het artikel over dynamisch verkeersmanagement. Specifiek zal dit artikel inzicht geven in het hoe en waarom van het verstrekken van actuele verkeersmonitoring, de benodigde informatie en de eisen en wensen aan deze informatie. Hieronder vallen onder meer de eisen en wensen met betrekking tot actualiteit, nauwkeurigheid, aggregatieniveau, beschikbaarheid en de frequentie van de inwinperiode. Ook wordt aangegeven welke gevolgen deze eisen en wensen hebben voor de in te winnen gegevens \u00e9n voor de bewerking van deze gegevens. Onderstaand figuur geeft het verband tussen de toepassingen, de informatiebehoefte, de gegevensinwinning en de gegevensbewerking weer.Actuele verkeersinformatie  De algemene omschrijving van verkeersinformatie luidt: informatie die inzicht geeft in de stand van zaken op de weg of op het spoor. Het gaat hierbij om zaken zoals files, vertragingen, weersomstandigheden (gladheid, mist), omleidingen, incidenten en flitslocaties. Dit Handboek Regionale Verkeersmonitoring is gericht op de monitoring van het verkeer op het wegennet. Dit artikel richt zich dan ook op actuele verkeersinformatie over het Nederlandse wegennet en gaat niet in op verkeersinformatie over het openbaar vervoer. Een reiziger kan momenteel voor aanvang van de reis op verschillende manieren informatie over de verkeerssituatie verkrijgen, voorbeelden zijn teletekst, internet of radio. Tijdens de reis kan de informatie worden verkregen via verschillende 'in-car systemen', zoals radio, de mobiele telefoon diensten en diensten via het navigatiesysteem. Ook wordt actuele verkeersinformatie verstrekt via weggebonden systemen, zoals Dynamische Route Informatie Paneel (DRIP)|DRIP's, dit item wordt behandeld in het artikel Verkeersmonitoring voor Dynamisch Verkeersmanagement. De belangrijkste gedachte achter het verstrekken van actuele verkeersinformatie is om reizigers te ondersteunen bij het optimaliseren van hun reis. Uitgangspunt is dat de reiziger reeds het voornemen heeft om een bepaalde reis te maken en dat hij op basis van actuele informatie deze reis kan aanpassen. De aanpassingen die de reiziger kan maken hebben betrekking op: Daarnaast heeft actuele informatie een comfortverhogende functie door het wegnemen van onzekerheid. Ook weggebruikers die hun reis niet kunnen (of willen) aanpassen waarderen actuele verkeersinformatie over het algemeen als positief. Verschillende typen informatie vallen onder actuele verkeersinformatie: In het artikel wordt ingegaan op de informatie die verkregen kan worden via verkeersmonitoringstechnieken, dus files en reistijden. De verkeersinformatie kan zowel tekstueel (gesproken en gedrukt) als grafisch (via elektronische kaarten) worden gepresenteerd. Er zijn verschillende organisaties die verkeersinformatie verstrekken. Enkele van die organisaties zijn: Onderstaande figuren geven een beeld van de wijze waarop verkeersinformatie kan worden weergegeven.Informatiebehoefte  De informatiebehoefte die ontstaat voor het verstrekken van actuele verkeersinformatie heeft een aantal algemene eigenschappen. Deze eigenschappen worden hieronder toegelicht. Om actuele verkeersinformatie te kunnen verstrekken, is eenvoudigweg behoefte aan informatie over de actuele verkeerssituatie. De meest relevante verkeersinformatie die vooraf en tijdens een reis gewenst is, is de (te verwachten) reistijd/reisduur. Er kan ook andere informatie worden gegeven waarmee de reiziger zelf een inschatting kan maken van zijn of haar reistijd. Denk hierbij aan filelengte, eventueel in combinatie met de oorzaak van de file, of de weersomstandigheden. De reiziger kan met behulp van de verkregen informatie zelf een inschatting maken van de vertraging en de waarschijnlijke reistijd. Het merendeel van de actuele verkeersinformatie is momenteel nog gericht op een brede doelgroep, denk aan de informatie verstrekt via de radio of via internet. Voor deze informatie verstrekking is informatie benodigd van de verkeerssituatie over het gehele verkeersnetwerk. Dit vraagt om een uitgebreid meetsysteem en/of om uitgebreide databewerking. Een voorbeeld van een uitgebreid meetsysteem zijn de detectielussen op het hoofdwegennet, bijvoorbeeld gebruikt voor een groot deel van het netwerk op de site van de ANWB. Via uitgebreide gegevensbewerking kan verkeersdata ook verrijkt worden, zodat met (relatief) beperkte gegevensinwinning toch een volledig beeld wordt verkregen van de situatie op het gehele verkeersnetwerk. Een voorbeeld hiervan is de Vialis Traffic Factory, dat gebruikt maakt van een verkeersmodel om met behulp van verkeersgegevens van een aantal locaties een beeld te vormen van de situatie op het gehele netwerk. Naast verkeersinformatie over het gehele netwerk is individueel op de reiziger gerichte informatie een op komende markt. Via in-car systemen, zoals mobiele telefoons en navigatiesystemen, kan de weggebruiker verkeersinformatie verkrijgen over de situatie op het voor hem interessante deel van het wegennet. Via het navigatiesysteem kan informatie worden verstrekt over de verkeerssituatie op de ingeprogrammeerde route, afhankelijke van de verkeerssituatie op het traject kan de route worden gewijzigd. De huidige verkeersinformatie verkregen via het TomTom-navigatiesysteem komt op twee manieren aan zijn verkeersinformatie. De eerste mogelijkheid is via de radio met een RDS/TMC-ontvanger. De tweede mogelijkheid is via de Plus-dienst Traffic, waarbij informatie via een dataverbinding over het mobiele netwerk (GPRS) wordt aangeleverd. In de toekomst zal tevens informatie via mobiele telefoons worden ingewonnen om informatie over de afwikkeling van het verkeer te kunnen verstrekken aan de weggebruikers. Voor meer informatie zie [1] Ook kan de reiziger via een sms/mms dienst op de hoogte gehouden worden van de verkeerssituatie op een bepaald traject binnen een bepaald tijdsvenster. Of kan gerichte verkeersinformatie worden opgevraagd via sms/mms. Verschillende providers en verkeersinformatie diensten bieden deze dienst aan de reiziger.Eisen aan de informatie  Voor actuele verkeersinformatie is het in het algemeen van belang dat de gegevens up-tot-date zijn. Informeren over een file van een uur geleden brengt frustraties bij de weggebruiker met zich mee, waardoor de geloofwaardigheid van het systeem sterk daalt. De concrete invulling van de gegevens om actuele verkeersinformatie te kunnen verstrekken, stelt eisen aan de kwaliteit van de informatie. Denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan: Actualiteit: De gewenste actualiteit van de informatie moet aansluiten bij het gevoel dat een weggebruiker heeft bij de term \u2018actueel\u2019. Dit hangt af van de snelheid waarmee de actuele verkeerstoestand voor de weggebruiker kan veranderen. Over een paar minuten zal er niet veel veranderd zijn. Over vijf minuten kan het wat erger of beter zijn geworden en over een uur kan het compleet veranderd zijn. Een reiziger wil een keuze kunnen maken ten aanzien van de situatie zoals die zich nu voordoet. Aan informatie van een paar uur eerder heeft hij niet veel. Een actualiteit tot 5 \u00e1 10 minuten \u2018oud\u2019 is over het algemeen acceptabel. Nauwkeurigheid: de nauwkeurigheid van de informatie is van redelijk belang voor de toepassing van actuele verkeersinformatie. Hierbij geldt dat de reiziger pas een optimale keuze kan maken als de informatie goed overeenkomt met de werkelijke (te verwachten) situatie. Omdat de reiziger bewust is van het feit dat de verkeerssituatie kan veranderen tussen het moment van informatie verstrekken en het rijden op de route, wordt een beperkte afwijking meestal geaccepteerd. Daarnaast wordt de lengte van de file in praktijk niet op detailniveau gemeld, maar per \u00e9\u00e9n kilometer, waardoor de informatie ook niet per decimaal nauwkeurig hoeft te zijn. Informatie over reistijden wordt iets gedetailleerder weergegeven, namelijk per minuut. De informatie moet dus redelijk nauwkeurig zijn, maar niet zo nauwkeurig als voor bijvoorbeeld dynamisch verkeersmanagement. Bij in-car-systemen ziet de weggebruiker direct of de file die genoemd wordt ook daadwerkelijk aanwezig is. Als de file dan niet aanwezig is en er ook niet uit het verkeersbeeld is af te lezen (veel verkeer) dat er zojuist een file heeft gestaan, verliest de weggebruiker het vertrouwen in de verstrekte informatie. Aggregatieniveau: het aggregatieniveau hangt onder meer samen met de actualiteit van de informatie. Hoe hoger het aggregatieniveau, hoe lager de actualiteit. Voor verkeersinformatie kan worden volstaan met een aggregatieniveau van 5 \u00e1 10 minuten. Dit komt overeen met de gewenste actualiteit van de informatie. De diensten die de informatie verspreiden up-daten hun informatie ook niet elke minuut. De radio geeft bijvoorbeeld elk half uur een filebeeld. Beschikbaarheid: verkeersinformatie heeft als doel het comfort voor de reiziger te verhogen en het verkeer beter te verdelen over de tijd en het netwerk. Verkeersinformatie is niet noodzakelijk voor het maken van de reis en het heeft ook geen verkeersveiligheidsfunctie. Indien de informatieverstrekking niet werkt leidt dit dan ook niet tot een onveilige of onoverkoombare situatie. Reizigers zijn echter zo gewend aan het feit dat ze verkeersinformatie kunnen ontvangen, dat storing van deze dienst tot een hoop irritatie kan leiden. De aanbieders van verkeersinformatie streven er dan ook naar om 24 uur per dag en 7 dagen per week verkeersinformatie te kunnen leveren. Indien van enkele locaties, bijvoorbeeld een detectielus in een traject, de informatie niet beschikbaar is, kan nog steeds verkeersinformatie worden verstrekt. De exacte locatie of lengte is dan misschien wat minder precies maar het overall verkeersbeeld blijft beschikbaar. Frequentie inwinperiode: monitoring voor actuele verkeersinformatie vereist dat de informatie in principe continu, 24 uur per dag 7 dagen per week, moet worden ingewonnen en beschikbaar moet zijn voor de reiziger. De gegevens worden in de regel geaggregeerd per periode van \u00e9\u00e9n tot vijf minuten.Benodigde gegevens en gegegevensbewerking  Er bestaan diverse monitoringsystemen om verkeersinformatie te genereren. De benodigde gegevens kunnen zowel met weggebonden systemen als met voertuiggebonden systemen worden ingewonnen. Met behulp van monitoringssystemen worden gegevens als reistijd, snelheid en intensiteit op het wegennet verkregen. Deze gegevens worden vervolgens in de verkeerscentrale bewerkt tot informatie over filelengtes en reistijden. Waarna de informatie ter beschikking wordt gesteld aan providers die de verkeersinformatie vervolgens via grafische plaatjes, teksten of radio uitzendingen aan de weggebruikers over brengen. De ingewonnen gegevens kunnen ook aan verkeersmodellen gekoppeld. Door het gebruik van rekenalgoritmen, kan de verkeerssituatie op andere dan de gemeten trajecten worden bepaald. Hierdoor wordt inzicht gekregen in het functioneren van het gehele netwerk. Monitoringsgegevens die gebruikt kunnen worden voor de informatiebehoefte aan automobilisten voorafgaand aan hun reis, en voor in-car systemen, zijn zeer divers. De gegevens zijn afhankelijk van de bewerking die ze ondergaan, alvorens ze aan de weggebruiker worden verstrekt. Enerzijds zijn er gegevens benodigd die kunnen worden ingewonnen met de monitoringssytemen zoals beschreven in dit handboek: Naast deze gegevens zijn voor het complete plaatje van de verkeersinformatie gegevens benodigd over:Voorspellende verkeersinformatie  Dit artikel gaat specifiek in op de actuele verkeerssituatie. Het voorspellen van de toekomstige verkeerssituatie is echter een zinvolle toepassing als het gaat om verkeersinformatie. Met name als vooraf verkeersinformatie wordt vergaard is het interessant om te weten hoe de situatie eruit ziet als jij op de snelweg zit. Daarnaast is het voor het plannen van je reis bijvoorbeeld interessant om te weten hoe laat je weg moet gaan om op tijd aan te komen. Op http://www.verkeersverwachting.nl kan bijvoorbeeld de reis gepland worden die je morgen wil gaan afleggen.Referentieprojecten Bronnen Openstaande vragen  - meer informatie over voorspellende verkeersinformatie. Terug naar -> Toepassingen van verkeersmonitoringVerkeersmanagement MTS - Actuele verkeersinformatie Noord-Brabant  De provincie Noord-Brabant wint in het project 'Brabantse Wegen Beter Zichtbaar' actuele verkeersinformatie in over het complete wegennet. De inwining van deze informatie gebeurt door middel van het volgen van mobiele telefoons op het wegennetwerk. Alle verkeersbewegingen op zowel het hoofd- als het onderliggend wegennet worden geregistreerd door het MTS-systeem van LogicaCMG, waarmee de bewegingen van mobiele telefoons worden gevolgd. Via de provinciale internetsite en in de toekomst misschien ook via DRIP\u2019s op provinciale wegen, wil de provincie meer inzicht geven in de verkeersbewegingen op het totale wegennet.Inleiding  Burgers en bedrijven willen er op kunnen vertrouwen dat zij binnen een voorspelbaar en aanvaardbaar tijdsbestek \u00e9n tegen acceptabele kosten hun bestemmingen kunnen bereiken. De reiziger accepteert langere reizen, mits hij zich daarop kan instellen. Een belangrijk uitgangspunt is dat de reiziger centraal staat. In Noord-Brabant wordt de bereikbaarheid daarom benaderd \u2018van deur tot deur\u2019. Dit betekent dat het hoofdwegennet en het onderliggend wegennet als \u00e9\u00e9n geheel worden gezien en dat de verschillende wegbeheerders gezamenlijk moeten optrekken. Op de meeste rijkswegen wordt met een grote dichtheid aan detectielussen in het wegdek informatie verzameld over de intensiteit, snelheid en doorstroming van het verkeer op wegvakken. De implementatie van deze inwintechniek levert voor provinciale en gemeentelijke wegen grote problemen op, waardoor ze daar eigenlijk niet wordt toegepast. Op de gemeentelijke en provinciale wegen zijn hoofdzakelijk gegevens bekend van incidentele meetlussen. Daarmee wordt geen informatie gegeven over de snelheden en reistijden van hele wegtrajecten. In 2003 en 2004 is door de provincie Noord-Brabant de eerste fase van de pilot \u2018Brabantse Wegen Beter Zichtbaar\u2019 uitgevoerd met de Mobile Traffic Services (MTS)-diensten van ICT-dienstverlener LogicaCMG. Deze onderneming werkt in de pilot samen met telecomoperator Vodafone. MTS is een Floating Car Data (FCD) toepassing die gebruik maakt van de positionering van mobiele telefoons. Bellende automobilisten leveren gegevens over de kwaliteit van de doorstroming van het verkeer op zowel het hoofdwegennet als het onderliggend wegennet. De eerste fase van het pilotproject richtte zich op het gebied begrensd door de A58, A16, A59 en N261. Na de positieve evaluatie van de eerste fase van de pilot is de afname van MTS-gegevens voor twee jaar verlengd en is het project uitgebreid naar de hele provincie.Doel  Het project 'Brabantse Wegen Beter Zichtbaar' beoogt met Floating Car Data het inzicht in het verkeer op de Brabantse wegen aanzienlijk te vergroten. Weggebruikers kunnen via internet verkeersinformatie bekijken zoals reistijden en snelheden, op basis waarvan elk moment van de dag reisafwegingen kunnen worden gemaakt. Wegbeheerders kunnen op basis van historische informatie extra inzicht krijgen in de verkeerssituatie voor bijvoobeeld beleidsdoelstellingen. De pilot is er in eerste instantie op gericht te kijken of het genereren van verkeersinformatie op basis van zich verplaatsende GSM-toestellen werkt en of daarmee inzicht is te krijgen in de verkeersafwikkeling in het pilotgebied. De verkeersafwikkeling moet daarvoor kunnen worden beoordeeld naar momenten van de dag, alsmede vari\u00ebrend gedurende het jaar (bijvoorbeeld Paasdrukte). De gegevens vormen een mogelijke basis voor dynamisch verkeersmanagement (DVM). Tevens was een doel om via dit project in de verkeerskundige wereld een doorbraak te realiseren in de toepassing van FCD-technieken. Of er sprake is van een doorbraak valt nog te bezien. Zeker is wel dat het Brabantse project heeft geleid tot beweging op het gebied van data-inwinning ten behoeve van verkeerskundige toepassingen.Inwinnen en verwerken  Het mobieltje is er allang niet meer voor het bellen alleen. De mobiele telefoon verraadt namelijk vrij nauwkeurig haar positie. Een mobiele telefoon in de auto kan daarom een belangrijke bron zijn voor het verzamelen van verkeersinformatie. De MTS-toepassing meet reistijden van auto\u2019s door het volgen van mobiele telefoons in auto\u2019s op zowel het hoofd- als het onderliggend wegennet. De snelheden van auto\u2019s worden hiervan direct afgeleid. Bewegende voertuigen leveren met deze methodiek zelf de gegevens. Er zijn dus geen meetsystemen op of langs de weg nodig. De huidige kwaliteit van reistijden van deur tot deur (over verschillende routes) kan inzichtelijk worden gemaakt, evenals de fluctuaties daarvan (betrouwbaarheid). De verkeersinformatie krijgt in vijf stappen \u2018bottum up\u2019 gestalte: Een mobiele telefoon legt om de paar seconden contact met de zendmasten in zijn omgeving. De positie van iemand die zijn telefoon aan heeft staan, maar niet belt, wordt ook bepaald. Overigens is de positiebepaling bij gesprekken veel nauwkeuriger, dan wanneer een mobieltje wordt gevolgd van iemand die niet belt. Vodafone heeft een marktaandeel van zo\u2019n dertig procent. Er worden dus heel wat telefoons gevolgd. Aardige bijkomstigheid is dat het aantal gesprekken toeneemt naarmate het drukker is op de weg, vooral bij files. De provincie verwacht overigens, dat voor een goede invulling van de informatievraag voor DVM verschillende systemen naast elkaar de benodigde gegevens zullen moeten leveren. Met lussen in het wegdek kan de wegbeheerder informatie over het verkeer verzamelen die met behulp van GSM\u2019s niet kan worden geleverd, namelijk inzicht in het aantal en soort voertuigen dat gebruik maakt van de weg. Het MTS-systeem levert ook weer informatie die de inductielussen niet geven, de gemiddelde snelheid en reistijd op een wegtraject. De systemen vullen elkaar dus goed aan.Kwaliteit van de gegevens  Deze paragraaf beschrijft het validatieonderzoek, zoals dat door Goudappel Ceffeng is uitgevoerd voor MTS in Noord-Brabant en waarvan de resultaten omschreven zijn in Tijdens de pilot is door Goudappel Coffeng een validatieonderzoek uitgevoerd. Hieruit bleek dat voor een groot deel van de wegen MTS kwalitatief goede informatie geeft over de feitelijke snelheden van het verkeer. Daarmee is MTS ook een geschikte bron voor reistijden. MTS schoot alleen tekort op de echte binnenstedelijke wegen. Daarnaast levert het inwinsysteem te vaak geen informatie op wegen van lagere orde met lage verkeersintensiteiten. Waar de grens ligt, is niet eenvoudig aan te geven, maar zo beneden de achtduizend motorvoertuigen per etmaal wordt het voldoende registreren problematisch. Met name in de daluren ontbreken dan gegevens van de betreffende wegen. Dit is doorgaans geen groot probleem voor met name actuele informatie, omdat bij lage intensiteiten zich zelden problemen voordoen in de doorstroming. In het validatieonderzoek is de kwaliteit vastgesteld van de reistijden die met MTS worden ingewonnen. Op een gedeelte van het Brabantse wegennet zijn de berekende reistijden die zijn verkregen via MTS, vergeleken met drie referentiesystemen: De validatie is uitgevoerd op de volgende type wegen, waarbij sterk gevarieerd is in trajectlengte (tussen 600 meter en 18 kilometer): Op de autosnelwegen is de MTS-data vergeleken met de rijtijden die met de inductielusdata (MTM) zijn gemeten. Zowel voor zeer korte als lange trajecten, voor trajecten met en zonder congestie en voor situaties met en zonder verkeersongevallen, zijn de met MTS berekende reistijden zonder meer uitstekend. Gedurende een ongeval op de A27 blijkt de reistijd gemeten met MTS hoger. De vraag is of in deze situatie de lusdata te optimistish of de MTS-data te pessimistisch zijn. Bekend is in elk geval dat inductielussen bij erg lage snelheden onbetrouwbare informatie leveren. Het is dus aannemelijk dat hier de tijden met MTS beter zijn dan die met lussen. De reistijden op provinciale en doorgaande wegen met MTS zijn gemeten, zijn vergeleken met de reistijden die volgen uit kentekenwaarnemingen. De reistijden met MTS worden over het algemeen goed berekend. Er is wel sprake van enkele uitzonderingen. Deze hebben te maken met het individuele rijgedrag van automobilisten (de weg zoeken en tanken). Daarnaast zijn de verkeersintensiteiten voor het validatieonderzoek op dit type wegen, deels aan de lage kant. Verwacht mag worden dat de met MTS berekende reistijden op drukke wegen minder last hebben van uitschieters. Beide punten worden aangepakt en daarmee zal de kwaliteit van de reistijden, die met MTS worden berekend, nog verder verbeteren. Op de stedelijke ontsluitingswegen richting het hoofdwegennet worden reistijden gemeten die goed overeenkomen met de tijden van de in de verkeersstroom meerijdende auto\u2019s. Voor dit type wegen is sprake van een grote variatie in reistijden. Deze grote variatie wordt zowel berekend met MTS, als gemeten met het referentiesysteem. De door MTS berekende gemiddelde reistijd komt goed overeen met de gemiddelde reistijd uit het referentiesysteem. Op binnenstedelijke wegen kunnen via MTS reistijden worden berekend. De rijtijden op het echte stedelijke wegennet worden in vergelijking met het referentiesysteem (meerijdende auto\u2019s) onvoldoende goed door MTS gereproduceerd. Zeer waarschijnlijk heeft dit te maken met de specifieke verkeerskundige situatie van het wegennet en de verkeersregelingen aldaar. Bovendien zijn nog trajecten uitgekozen die niet als gebruikelijke route kunnen worden aangemerkt. Nader onderzoek naar deze (en mogelijk andere) redenen is gewenst. Welllicht kan voor de stedelijke omgeving worden bekeken wat wel haalbaar is om met voldoende kwaliteit te meten met MTS. Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer plaatst kritische kanttekeningen bij het bovengenoemde validatieonderzoek. Zo is er voor referentiereistijden onder meer gebruik gemaakt van reistijden uit lusgegevens, die zijn berekend met de offline PLSB-methode. Die methode levert zowel structurele als willekeurige fouten. Bovendien is de toegepaste methodologie niet toereikend en de gekozen steekproef is te klein om generieke uitspraken te kunnen doen. Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer heeft in 2006 een Evaluatiestudie laten uitvoeren door de Technische Universiteit Delft faculteit Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen Afdeling Transport & Planning, op het traject A13 van Delft-Noord tot Rotterdam Overschie. In deze studie zijn naast MTS meerdere reistijdsystemen ge\u00ebvalueerd, waaronder MoniBAS, CDMS en PLSB (Piecewise-Linear Speed-Based, oftewel stuksgewijs lineair op snelheid gebaseerd). Conclusies uit deze studie zijn dat met een monitoringsysteem, waarbij voor reisinformatie uitsluitend gebruik wordt gemaakt van MTS, men waarschijnlijk zeventien procent goedkoper uit is ten opzichte van de huidige systemen. Dit gaat echter gepaard met een reductie in kwaliteit van veertig procent in termen van offline reistijden en een reductie in kwaliteit van ongeveer 45 procent in online reistijden. Beide betrekking hebbend op periodes met congestie (files). Op basis van deze evaluatiestudie ligt het niet voor de hand om MTS-gegevens in te kopen op snelwegtrajecten waar het MoniCa-meetnet voldoende aanwezig is. Op die trajecten waar dat nog niet het geval is, is MTS een alternatief, zij het dat daarmee voornamelijk verkeersinformatiedoeleinden kunnen worden bediend. Voor veel DVM-doelen moet alsnog een complementair inwinsysteem worden gebruikt. Het is daarom zinvol voor dergelijke trajecten te kijken naar combinaties van inwintechnieken en de gegevens te combineren (datafusie). Een aanvullend validatieonderzoek uitgevoerd door Ecorys, concludeert dat MTS zowel kosteneffici\u00ebnt is als voldoende maatschappelijke baten kan opleveren. Ook bij relatief eenvoudige toepassingen als het informeren van de reiziger. De baten hierbij zijn: een kortere reistijd, minder congestie, een betere benutting van het wegennet. Ook de verkeersveiligheid is gebaat bij minder filevorming en daardoor minder stress bij automobilisten. Voordeel is er nadrukkelijk ook voor transporteurs. De milieuwinst wordt overigens als marginaal ingeschat.Toepassingen  De gegevens worden de komende jaren ingezet voor operationele toepassingen. De meest opvallende toepassing is dat de gegevens vanaf juli 2005 worden getoond op een website, zodat iedereen kan zien hoe de actuele verkeerssituatie op de Brabantse wegen er uit ziet. Daarnaast heeft de provincie de gegevens gebruikt voor andere, meer beleidsmatige analyses. Verder staan nog op stapel: Op basis van actuele verkeersgegevens op de website kunnen weggebruikers maatregelen nemen. Voor het project is het dan wel van belang dat de website goed wordt bezocht. Dit bezoek blijkt beperkt, de provincie heeft er echter ook geen grote publiciteitscampagne aan gewijd. De provincie heeft wel onderzocht, middels de zogenaamde \u201cInteractieve Interviewer\u201d (een on-line enqu\u00eate gekoppeld aan de website), wat de gebruikers vinden van de website. Daaruit blijkt onder meer dat men de compleetheid van de informatie waardeert (alle belangrijke wegen in Brabant worden getoond) en dat men deze informatie graag ook voor andere delen van Nederland ziet. De website wordt het meest geraadpleegd voor de avondspits, waarschijnlijk vanaf de werkplek, zodat reizigers zien wat ze ongeveer kunnen verwachten. Van de gebruikers blijkt 68 procent een andere route te kiezen en nog eens 24 procent zegt een ander tijdstip van vertrek te kiezen. Ruim 90 procent blijkt dus zijn gedrag aan te passen op basis van de informatie (indien er sprake is van filevorming natuurlijk). Overigens is de Interactieve Interviewer een handige manier om de \u2013 onbekende - websitegebruiker te consulteren. De respons op de eerste enqu\u00eate was goed met ruim zevenhonderd respondenten. Met de enqu\u00eate werden ook emailadressen verzameld van mensen die bereid waren aan een vervolgenqu\u00eate deel te nemen. Dat leverde ongeveer driehonderd adressen op. Deze mensen hebben een tweede enqu\u00eate toegestuurd gekregen, waarin is getoetst welke zaken ze het liefst aan de website verbeterd zouden zien. De vijftien voorgelegde mogelijkheden waren gebaseerd op de in de eerste enqu\u00eate verzamelde opmerkingen/reacties. Uit de enqu\u00eate blijkt dat de volgende verbeteringen het meest gewenst zijn: Op zich zijn dit verwachte uitkomsten. Maar dergelijke wensen zijn niet eenvoudig te realiseren. Zoals hiervoor aangegeven wordt op het geven van een voorspelling nog gestudeerd. Het bepalen van de groei of afname van een file is lastig, omdat files enerzijds een speciale dynamiek kennen. En anderzijds omdat het meetsysteem niet expliciet filelengte meet, maar snelheden van het verkeer. Dit is niet zo maar te vertalen in filelengte. Waar wel aan voldaan zou kunnen worden, is het tonen van wegwerkzaamheden. De website is hier zelfs voor voorbereid. Het vereist wel een goede organisatie tussen de vele wegbeheerders in Brabant. Daar wordt momenteel aan gewerkt. De informatie over wegwerkzaamheden die op de website komt moet immers wel kloppen! Voor een optimaal gebruik dient tevens te worden geraliseerd, dat een website een publieksdienst is. Die moet dus zo goed mogelijk aansluiten bij de gebruikerswensen.Organisatie  De provincie Noord-Brabant is de regionale regisseur voor het nadrukkelijk vormgeven van de netwerkgedachte en het speelveld van dynamisch verkeersmanagement. Vernieuwend aan het project is dat informatie wordt ingekocht, die door een private partij wordt ingewonnen. De eerste fase van de pilot \u2018Brabantse Wegen Beter Zichtbaar\u2019 is uitgevoerd met de Mobile Traffic Services (MTS)-diensten van ICT-dienstverlener LogicaCMG. Die werkt in deze pilot samen met telecomoperator Vodafone. Na de positieve evaluatie van de eerste fase van de pilot is de afname van MTS-gegevens voor twee jaar verlengd en is het project uitgebreid naar de hele provincie. Tevens is de overstap gemaakt van historische gegevens naar actuele gegevens. De overgang van pilotfase naar de operationele fase heeft meer tijd gekost dan verwacht, omdat in de opdracht niet helder was beschreven wanneer het project door zou gaan en onder welke condities. Bij de afname van MTS-gegevens is het marktmodel bijzonder. De provincie krijgt een licentie voor datagebruik, maar de gegevens blijven van LogicaCMG. Die kan deze onderneming ook aan andere partijen leveren. Het is een gezamenlijke taak van overheden/wegbeheerders en marktpartijen om hier een goede modus voor te vinden. Daarnaast is een goede samenwerking tussen de regionale wegbeheerders van belang. Voor MTS worden de mobieltjes gebruikt van het Vodafone-netwerk in het pilotgebied. LogicaCMG ontvangt mobiele verkeersgegevens van Vodafone. Deze gegevens zijn niet herleidbaar tot personen of mobiele telefoonnummers van klanten van Vodafone. Vodafone verstrekt uitsluitend tijdelijke coderingen die zijn gekoppeld aan mobiele communicatie. Deze coderingen zijn niet terug te leiden tot het telefoonnummer of de persoon die de telefoon gebruikt. In overeenstemming met aanbevelingen van het College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens over nieuwe technieken die het volgen van de mobiliteit van weggebruikers mogelijk maken, wordt gebruik gemaakt van een techniek die de privacy van weggebruikers met een mobiele telefoon waarborgt (een zogenaamde Privacy Enhancing Technology). Over het project, met name de gegevensinwinning door het volgen van GSM's, is veel ge\u00efnformeerd bij collega-overheden zowel in als buiten Nederland. Hiervoor zijn onder meer diverse presentaties gevolgd op congressen en symposia. Er is veel overleg geweest met collega's van gemeenten, andere provincies, kaderwetgebieden en het Rijk. Het contact met andere overheden heeft zich ontwikkeld van informeren naar samenwerken. Inmiddels speelt nadrukkelijk de vraag hoe deze vorm van gegevensinwinning een vervolg gaat krijgen. Op dit moment is een aantal publieke en private partijen bezig om te komen tot een landelijk dekkend Nationaal Datawarehouse van verkeersgegevens.Succesfactoren en leerpunten  Met uitzondering van de binnenstedelijke wegen kan informatie over het zogenaamde onderliggende wegennet met MTS vrij eenvoudig beschikbaar komen, zodat dit als succes wordt ervaren. Uit enqu\u00eates is ook gebleken dat de weggebruikers tevreden zijn. Een goede samenwerking tussen de verschillende wegbeheerders is voor een gezamenlijke informatievoorziening essentieel. Als alle samenwerkende wegbeheerders in een netwerk het op \u00e9\u00e9n na goed doen, kan het hele netwerk toch niet goed worden gemanaged. De keten is nu eenmaal zo sterk als de zwakste schakel. De huidige marktconcepten zijn dikwijls gebaseerd op \u00e9\u00e9n inwintechniek (of inductielussen, \u00f3f VRI-lussen, \u00f3f FCD, \u00f3f kentekenherkennig enzovoort). Verkeerskundig en vanuit netwerkmanagement gezien is juist een verstandige combinatie van verschillende inwinprincipes ideaal. De wegbeheerders moeten daarom een goed beeld hebben van de informatiebehoefte. Veel systemen kunnen wel invoer van gegevens uit verschillende bronnen aan, maar het combineren of integreren (datafusie) van die gegevens is vaak nog een probleem. De provincie Noord-Brabant heeft met het MTS-systeem inzicht gekregen in met name reistijden op het onderliggend wegennet waar nog geen verkeersinformatie bekend was. Dit is een stap vooruit, maar er zijn duidelijk nog verbeteringen mogelijk: koppeling met andere systemen, het ontwikkelen van een intensiteitschatter, koppeling met een verkeersmodel en het verbeteren van het filter voor bijvoorbeeld fietser, voetgangers en stationaire punten. Helaas zijn de verbeterslagen niet uitgevoerd, omdat LogiaCMG door het gebrek aan meer klanten wordt beperkt in zijn investering. Mede omdat er nog geen echte concurrenten op de markt komen en er (bijna) geen andere wegbeheerders zijn die met FCD aan de slag zijn.Bronnen  B. Rutten, R.

Aanvullingen zijn welkom.Verkeersmanagement Regionale verkeersmonitoring in Europa (excl. Nederland)  Er is weinig centraal Europees beleid op het gebied van verkeersmonitoring, maar desondanks draait in diverse landen en regio's een groot aantal projecten. De projecten zijn meestal een initiatief van lokale overheden en staan dan ook volledig los van elkaar, zelfs van vergelijkbare projecten. Referentieprojecten van buitenlandse cases zijn hier te vinden. De Europese Commissie stimuleert deze bottom-up aanpak met verschillende fondsen. Europa-breed wordt overigens wel gewerkt aan enkele standaarden voor de uitwisseling van data en aan een overzicht van referentieprojecten. Daarnaast zijn in het kader van het TEMPO-programma voor verschillende regio's projecten opgestart, die met name internationaal verkeersmanagement financieel en organisatorisch ondersteunen. Dit artikel behandelt met name de internationale samenwerkingsprojecten onder de vlag van de Europese Unie.Inleiding  In dit artikel wordt een overzicht gegeven van verkeersmonitoring in Europa. Eerst volgt een korte beschrijving van het bestaande Europese ITS-beleid (Intelligente Transport Systemen en verkeersmonitoring). Daarna volgt een korte beschrijving van verschillende Euro-regionale programma's. Tot slot worden enkele trends aangestipt bij de monitoring in verschillende Europese landen.Europees beleid  Er is weinig beleid van de Europese Commissie op het gebied van verkeersmonitoring. Dit volgt uit het idee dat alleen EU-regelgeving wordt ontwikkeld voor problemen op Europese schaal. In de laatste review van het White Paper on Transport uit 2001 staat overigens w\u00e9l dat ontwikkelingen van ITS van groot belang zijn. Onderzoek wordt gestimuleerd via de zogenoemde framework onderzoeksgelden. Bovendien wordt een green paper geschreven over Europese best practices en mogelijkheden van Europese ondersteuning op het lokale niveau. Belangrijk is dat het initiatief voor ITS in het algemeen bij de regio's blijft liggen. Deze initiatieven worden dan eventueel ondersteund door de Europese Commissie, bijvoorbeeld door het toekennen van beurzen (hier aanvragen) of via het TEMPO-programma.TEMPO, programma voor Euro-regionale projecten  TEMPO is een programma van het Europese Directoraat-Generaal Transport en Energie (DG-TREN) (Directoraat Generaal Transport en Energie) voor de Europese samenwerking op het gebied van ITS, inclusief verkeersmonitoring. Het programma loopt van 2001 tot 2006. Voor de periode 2007 tot 2013 wordt het programma waarschijnlijk doorgezet in de vorm van het Easyway programma. In het TEMPO-programma zijn onder meer Europese standaards ontwikkeld voor de uitwisseling van verkeersgegevens. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn DATEX II voor verkeersinformatie en OTAP voor meetgegevens. Daarnaast zijn er voor de verschillende regio's (zie kaart) projecten gestart die ITS regionaal moeten bevorderen. Dit heeft enerzijds als doel dat de betrokken landen en partijen hun kennis en gegevens over verkeer onderling uitwisselen. Anderzijds worden via deze programma's verbeteringen gefinancierd aan verkeersmanagementsystemen. Zo worden door heel Europa monitoringsystemen aangelegd en verkeerscentrales ingericht, die via de ontwikkelde standaards goed met elkaar kunnen communiceren. De programma's bestaan uit regionale samenwerkingsverbanden van verschillende overheden en private partners. De uitvoering van de projecten wordt financieel ondersteund door het TEMPO-programma. Van alle onderdelen van TEMPO zijn uitgebreide internetsites opgezet met informatie over de projecten en de regio's. Hieronder volgt een kort overzicht beschrijving van alle euregionale projecten met een link naar de bijbehorende website waar verdere gedetailleerdere informatie over de projecten kan worden gevonden. Aangezien de programma's allemaal het volledige spectrum van dynamisch verkeers management beslaan, worden hier alleen de opvallende eigenschappen van verschillende monitoring systemen genoemd. Hiervan wordt ook door middel van een link aangegeven waar eventueel verder informatie te vinden is.CENTRICO  CENTRICO concentreert zich rond de drukste autosnelwegen van Europa; de Benelux met delen van Frankrijk Duitsland en Groot-Brittani\u00eb. In dit gebied zijn de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van verkeersmonitoring al ver gevorderd. CENTRICO ondersteund lokale initiatieven en stemt de monitoring van de verschillende landen op elkaar af. Een goed voorbeeld hiervan is route-informatie over internationale routes, zoals succesvol ge\u00efmplementeerd is tussen Keulen en Eindhoven en tussen Antwerpen en Rotterdam.STREETWISE  De Euro-regionale samenwerking tussen Groot-Brittani\u00eb en Ierland krijgt vorm in STREETWISE. Dit programma gaat hoofdzakelijk om kennisuitwisseling en financiering van ITS-projecten in de regio. Op het gebied van verkeersmonitoring zijn verschillende pilots gefinancierd, waaronder automatische voertuigtellers en reistijdvoorspellers. De automatische voertuigtellers maken gebruik van geavanceerde inductielussen en telecommunicatiesystemen, om individuele voertuigdata centraal te verzamelen en te verwerken. Voor het voorspellen van reistijden zijn verschillende methodes gebruikt. In Ierland en Schotland zijn experimenten met floating car data uitgevoerd. In Ierland is hiervoor een prototype ontwikkeld, op basis waarvan een industri\u00eble standaard wordt ontwikkeld. Ierland en ook Schotland zijn verder bezig met experimenten om reistijden te voorspellen door middel van kentekenherkenning.VIKING  Het VIKING programma wil meetgegevens uit de gehele Scandinavische regio op elkaar laten aansluiten. De deelnemende landen zijn Noorwegen, Zweden, Finland, Denemarken en Noord-Duitsland. Bijzonder aan deze regio is dat de verkeerssituatie op grote delen van het wegennet (80 procent) alleen afhankelijk is van het weer en niet van het verkeer. Daarom is in het kader van het VIKING-programma onderzoek gedaan naar weersvoorspellingen speciaal voor verkeersomstandigheden. Daarnaast wortd op internetsites weersinformatie met verkeersinformatie gecombineerd, zoals hier in Zweden. Om te kunnen inspelen op deze verschillende eigenschappen van het netwerk, wordt per locatie bepaald welke functie de verkeersmonitoring daar moet hebben. Voor het hele netwerk is vervolgens nagegaan in hoeverre de huidige monitoringsystemen voldoen aan de bovenstaande functionele eisen. Over het algemeen wordt hier goed aan voldaan; echter, vooral in Noorwegen is de monitoring buiten de steden nog onder de maat. Naast het opstellen van richtlijnen en het inventariseren van de verkeersmonitoring, wordt door VIKING ook gewerkt aan standaardisatie. Doel is om de uitwisseling van gegevens tussen de verschillende landen mogelijk te maken, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van bestaande Europese standaarden.ARTS  Binnen het ARTS-programma is vooral ge\u00efnvesteerd in het op peil brengen van verkeersmonitoring in Portugal, Spanje en Frankrijk. Het netwerk voor verkeersdetectie is flink uitgebreid en er zijn verkeerscentrales ingericht in Lissabon, Valladolid, La Coru\u00f1a en Bilbao. Bestaande centrales zijn vernieuwd en aangepast aan de Europese standaarden. Het meest in het oog springende ARTS-project is de 'Paso del Estrecho'. Elke zomer ontstaat een grote vervoersstroom van Frankrijk richting Marokko dwars door Spanje, die de nodige problemen voor de verkeersveiligheid en doorstroming met zich meebrengt. Spanje en Frankrijk werken samen om dit verkeer in goede banen te leiden. Dit gebeurt door middel van onderlinge uitwisseling van verkeersinformatie en Frans- en Arabischtalige voorlichting aan het publiek over veilige routes en dergelijke.SERTI  Het samenwerkingsverband van Frankrijk, Itali\u00eb en Spanje (SERTI) richt zich vooral op het gebied rond de Pyrenee\u00ebn en de Alpen. In deze gebieden is de internationale samenwerking vooral waardevol op het gebied van incidentmanagement. Er zijn goede verbindingen tussen de verschillende verkeerscentrales, zodat de verschillende landen samen kunnen inspelen op onverwachte gebeurtenissen. Een van de projecten focust bijvoorbeeld op hevige sneeuwval, dit kan namelijk voor ernstige verkeershinder zorgen. Door de 'afhandeling' van zowel sneeuw als verkeer te co\u00f6rdineren, blijft de schade zo veel mogelijk beperkt.CORVETTE  De regio's rond de oostelijke Alpen zijn verenigd in het CORVETTE-programma. Dit bergachtige gebied vormt een centraal punt in het Europese wegennetwerk, met zeer specifieke eigenschappen. De grote internationale verbindingen zijn beperkt tot enkele tunnels en passen. Door een gebrek aan alternatieve routes is het netwerk rond de Alpen weinig robuust. Gecombineerd met extreme weersomstandigheden, vakantiepieken en grote incidenten zorgt dit voor een belangrijke taak van verkeersmanagement. In het kader van CORVETTE is onder meer gewerkt aan het afstemmen van verkeersregelscenario's (Traffic Management Plans). Deze scenario's voorzien in gebeurtenissen met grensoverschrijdende effecten. Door samenwerking tussen verkeerscentrales uit verschillende landen kunnen de gevolgen hiervan beperkt blijven. De scenario's zijn gezamenlijk ontwikkeld en daarna succesvol getest in de praktijk.CONNECT  Na de aansluiting van de nieuwe lidstaten is een bijbehorend Euro-regionaal ITS-project in het leven geroepen, CONNECT. Belangrijk doel van dit programma is het aansluiten van Oosteuropese landen op bestaande expertise in de EU. Daarnaast ondersteunt dit programma een aantal concrete projecten. Zo wordt bijvoorbeeld in Polen een uitgebreid systeem ontwikkeld voor het meten van de weerssituatie. En in verschillende landen worden verkeersmanagementcentrales ingericht die aansluiten op de Europese standaarden.Mare Nostrum  In een samenwerking tussen ARTS, SERTI en CORVETTE is het project Mare Nostrum opgezet. Het idee is om over de volledige corridor (zie kaart) eenduidige signaalgeving te installeren. Dit betekent dat DRIP's over de hele lengte op dezelfde wijze zijn vormgegeven. Hierbij is vooral van belang dat heldere, consistente pictogrammen worden gebruikt, zodat taalbarri\u00e8res niet meer van invloed zijn. Daarnaast is de verdere indeling van de teksten ook hetzelfde over de hele route; drie regels met tien tot twaalf karakters.Partners for Roads  Een geheel ander programma is het door Rijkswaterstaat ge\u00efnitieerde Partners for Roads programma. Doelstellling is om Nederlandse verkeerskundige kennis te verspreiden bij buitenlandse partners, met name in de nieuwe EU-lidstaten waar het wegennet op dit moment flink wordt vernieuwd. In dit kader worden diverse projecten uitgevoerd door Nederlandse ingenieursbureaus, in een samenwerkingsverband van Rijskwaterstaat en de lokale tegenhanger daarvan. Bovendien verzorgt Rijkswaterstaat een uitgebreid pakket van trainingen aan medewerkers van andere wegenautoriteiten. Er wordt bijvoorbeeld geleerd hoe Europese subsidies moeten worden aangevraagd.Trends Europese verkeersmonitoring Inwinnen van gegevens  Voor het inwinnen van gegevens zijn zeer veel verschillende meetmethodes beschikbaar. Bij de meeste Europese monitoringsystemen wordt gebruik gemaakt van inductielussen en/of infrarood detectie (bv. Traffic eyes), waarmee gemiddelde snelheid, intensiteit en bezettingsgraad op een lokatie worden gemeten. Deze metingen worden aangevuld met meetinstrumenten die specifiek zijn voor de locatie of het doel van het project. Zo is in Zweden het weer van grote invloed op het verkeer. Daar worden weersmetingen en -voorspellingen dan ook meegenomen bij het monitoren van verkeer. Hierbij worden weersgegevens zowel bij verkeerscentrales verzamelt, als weergegeven bij verkeersinformatie op het internet. Hierdoor kunnen verkeersmanagers en gebruikers op basis van het verwachte weer inschatten of wegen begaanbaar zijn. In grote delen van Zweden en Noorwegen staan ook cameras waarmee makkelijk de actuele begaanbaarheid van wegen te zien is. In veel andere Europese steden wordt gebruik gemaakt van camera's, ten behoeve van visualisatie van situaties op de weg. Bovendien zijn de camerabeelden van grote waarde voor de verkeersmanagers; zij kunnen bij incidenten goed zien wat er precies aan de hand is. Een aantal Europese projecten is specifiek interessant uit het oogpunt van de inwinning van gegevens. Naast het structureren van gegevens van conventionele monitoring, zoals in het eerder beschreven VIKING-project, worden ook veel experimenten gedaan met nieuwe vormen van monitoring. Zo is er het  LUMOS-project, waarbij vanuit de lucht de verkeerssituatie wordt gefilmd. Ook zijn er experimenten met verkeersmonitoring met behulp van mobiele telefoons. Bij deze techniek wordt gebruik gemaakt van het contact tussen mobiele telefoons en de centrale, wat een grove bepaling van de positie mogelijk maakt. Met deze gegevens kunnen reistijden en H/B-matrices worden geschat. De eerste experimenten hiermee zijn uitgevoerd in Finland, Frankrijk en Noord-Brabant.Verwerken van gegevens  Het verwerken van meetgegevens tot verkeersinformatie is volop in ontwikkeling. In heel Europa lopen allerlei verschillende initiatieven en projecten, waarin de verwerking met verschillende methodes en doelen wordt aangepakt. Veel verkeersmanagementcentrales verwerken hun gegevens tot Level of Service-indicaties om deze op internet te kunnen laten zien. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn onder andere te vinden in  Barcelona, Berlijn en Nordrhein-Westfalen (voor een overzicht klik hier). De verschillende steden en regio's vullen deze informatie aan, afhankelijk van de specifieke doelen die ze hebben. Wanneer het doel is om de routekeuze te be\u00efnvloeden, is het zinvol om ook reistijden te laten zien, zoals onder meer in  Barcelona is gedaan. Om het tijdstip van vertrek te kunnen be\u00efnvloeden, wordt - bijvoorbeeld in Nordrhein-Westfalen - een voorspelling gedaan van de verkeerssituatie op de korte termijn. Hierbij is de betrouwbaarheid van de voorspelling erg belangrijk voor het effect dat deze heeft op de gebruikers van een netwerk. Een laatste doel is het be\u00efnvloeden van de modaliteitskeuze. Om dit te bewerkstelligen, wordt onder meer door VMZ Berlijn en MOBINET M\u00fcnchen een intermodale routeplanner aangeboden. Door reistijden van verschillende (combinaties van) modaliteiten te vergelijken, wordt verwacht dat automobilisten sneller geneigd zijn om voor het openbaar vervoer te kiezen.Organisatie  De manier waarop de verkeersmonitoring is georganiseerd varieert sterk. In  Spanje en Glasgow wordt de verkeersmonitoring volledig door de staat uitgevoerd. Berlijn, M\u00fcnchen en het Verenigd Koninkrijk maken gebruik van een PPS-constructie. En als laatste voorbeeld: Zweden heeft als staat een raamwerk voor verkeersmonitoring opgezet, waarbinnen opdrachten aan private partijen worden verleend. De keuze om private partijen te betrekken bij het proces van verkeersmonitoring, komt voort uit kostenbesparing. Concurrentie bij uitbesteding drukt de prijs. Daarnaast kunnen private partijen de verkeersinformatie gebruiken voor winstgevende dienstverlening aan individuele bedrijven en consumenten.Links en Bronnen  European Transport Research Knowledge Centre Verkeersinformatie voor heel Europa TEMPO secretariaat (Trans-European intelligent transport systeMs PrOjects) CENTRICO STREETWISE (Seamless Travel Information Services for the Western Isles of Europe) ARTS (Advanced Road Traffic in South-west) SERTI CORVETTE (Co-ORrdination and Validation of the dEployment of advanced Transport Telematic systems in the Alpine area) VIKING programma CONNECT (Co-ordination and stimulation of innovative ITS activities in Central and Eastern European countries)Verkeersmanagement Online Verkeersmodellen  In toenemende mate worden online verkeersmodellen gebruikt om monitoringgegevens aan te vullen met informatie die niet zo gemakkelijk via metingen is te verkrijgen. Metingen zijn in tijd en plaats beperkt. Door de resultaten van metingen te koppelen aan modellen, kan ook iets worden gezegd over de verkeersontwikkeling op andere tijden en plaatsen. Voor online modellen is vooral van belang dat de rekentijd kort is. Het gebruik van macromodellen ligt daarom voor de hand. Maar omdat computers steeds sneller en geavanceerder worden, kunnen tegenwoordig ook micromodellen worden toegepast. Deze leveren een nog gedetailleerder beeld van het verkeer tussen de meetpunten en in de toekomst.Inleiding  Realtime of online verkeersmodellen krijgen een steeds grotere betekenis in de huidige verkeerskundige praktijk. Belangrijkste eigenschap van deze modellen is dat ze op basis van binnenkomende gegevens direct resultaten leveren. Daarom moeten ze minstens realtime kunnen voorspellen. Dat wil zeggen: \u00e9\u00e9n seconde aan gegevens wordt binnen \u00e9\u00e9n seconde verwerkt. Het resultaat is informatie die niet direct kan worden gemeten, zoals extrapolaties naar de toekomst of interpolaties naar locaties waar niet wordt gemeten. Door de technische vooruitgang is het steeds beter mogelijk om aan de eis van minimaal realtime berekeningen te voldoen. Bovendien kunnen binnen de beperkte tijd ook steeds complexere modellen worden doorgerekend. Gezien de continue verbetering van computers, blijven de mogelijkheden voor online simulatie de komende jaren groeien. In dit artikel wordt aangegeven waarvoor verkeersmodellen in hoofdlijnen worden gebruikt. Vervolgens wordt besproken welke invoer nodig is voor ieder online verkeersmodel. Belangrijk aandachtspunt hierbij is met name de schatting van de zogenoemde H/B-matrix. Verder komen in dit artikel de verschillende methoden van online verkeersmodellering aan de orde. Ten slotte volgt een overzicht van mogelijke toepassingen, nu en in de toekomst.Doelstelling van online verkeersmodellen  Verkeersmodellen worden gebruikt als aanvulling op de gemeten data. Deze aanvulling bestaat uit een interpolatie tussen bekende datapunten of uit een extrapolatie daarbuiten. In het concrete geval van online verkeersmonitoring wordt interpolatie voornamelijk gebruikt om de toestand op een locatie te schatten. Wanneer op locaties A en C wordt gemeten, kan een online verkeersmodel een inschatting geven van de situatie op de tussenliggende locatie B. Extrapolatie wordt daarentegen voornamelijk toegepast voor de tijdsdimensie. Bij een bepaalde toestand op tijdstip t voorspelt een verkeersmodel de toestand op tijdstip t+1. Een aantal concrete toepassingen van online verkeersmodellen en hun doelen binnen de verkeersmonitoring zijn:Invoer voor het model  Het model gebruikt twee belangrijke databronnen om te komen tot de gewenste informatie. Aangezien het model online werkt, zijn ook realtime meetgegevens nodig. De data moet zo snel mogelijk na de meting voor het model beschikbaar zijn. Naast deze continue stroom gegevens uit het netwerk, is ook a-priori kennis nodig over het verkeer op het netwerk. Het gaat hierbij om de verhouding tussen verkeersstromen met verschillende herkomsten en bestemmingen. Aangezien deze gegevens niet kunnen worden gemeten, gaat het altijd om een schatting. De schatting kan eventueel worden aangepast met behulp van realtime verkeersgegevens. Realtime Meetgegevens Afhankelijk van het gebruikte model kunnen in principe alle type gegevens worden gebruikt voor online simulaties. Het meest gebruikelijk zijn evenwel de snelheden, intensiteiten en sinds kort ook reistijden. Bij deze toepassingen is van belang dat met name de randen van het te beschouwen netwerk goed worden bemeten. Voor elk model is het cruciaal om te weten hoeveel verkeer er in en uit het netwerk gaat. Hoe deze gegevens geschat kunnen worden, staatin het artikel over de H/B-matrix.Methodes voor online verkeersmodellering  Online simulaties verschillen maar op \u00e9\u00e9n manier van offline simulaties en dat betreft de vereiste korte rekentijd. Over het algemeen worden bestaande offline modellen aangepast om online te gebruiken. In deze paragraaf worden de verschillende typen modellen besproken die voor online verkeerssimulaties kunnen worden gebruikt. Verkeersmodellen worden ingedeeld naar detailniveau; macro, micro en meso. Macromodellen beschrijven de eigenschappen van de verkeersstroom per wegvak. Micromodellen beschrijven daarentegen het gedrag van alle individuele voertuigen. Mesomodellen zijn een tussenvorm, met groepen voertuigen als basis. Deze vorm wordt weinig gebruikt en daarom hier niet verder uitgewerkt. Naast de strikt verkeerskundige modellen is ook informatie opgenomen over mathematische methoden die voor online verkeerssimulaties worden gebruikt.Verkeersmodellen online toegepast  In het artikel over micromodellen wordt de algemene werking van een micromodel beschreven, zoals dat zowel voor offline als online simulaties geldt. Specifiek voor online simulaties geldt vooral dat berekeningen realtime moeten kunnen worden uitgevoerd. Dit legt beperkingen op aan de complexiteit en uitgebreidheid van het model. Een interessante mogelijkheid van de realtime modellen is het uitvoeren van online calibratie. Dit betekent dat met regelmatige intervallen de parameters gehercalibreerd worden, op basis van de laatste meetgegevens. Hierdoor is het model in staat zichzelf aan te passen aan wisselende omstandigheden. Tot slot moet het model een mogelijkheid hebben om realtime data als input te gebruiken. Bij een aantal bekende micromodellen is hiervoor inmiddels een module ontwikkeld. Voor macromodellen geldt dat ze door hun korte rekentijd zonder veel aanpassingen goed online kunnen worden gebruikt. Ook omdat veel meetgegevens (bijvoorbeeld uit inductielussen) worden aangeleverd als macro variabelen (gemiddelde snelheid en intensiteit). Realtime microsimulaties zijn pas de laatste tijd technisch mogelijk. Er zijn nog slechts bepaalde type modellen geschikt om microsimulaties realtime uit te voeren. De verwachting is dat dit aantal zich snel zal uitbreiden. Vooralsnog wordt vooral gebruik gemaakt van de cellular automata modellering. Deze methode heeft vooral als voordeel dat de rekentijd beperkt is, een belangrijke overweging bij online simulaties.Statistische modelleringen  Zonder gebruik te maken van expliciete verkeerskundige kennis, kunnen voorspellingen ook op historische data worden gebaseerd. Er bestaan veel wiskundige methodieken om op basis van historische data trends te herkennen en te gebruiken om voorspellingen te doen. Dit betekent dat uit een grote hoeveelheid data een functie wordt gedestilleerd, die vervolgens wordt gebruikt om onbekende waarden te berekenen. Binnen de verkeerskunde wordt een aantal technieken veelvuldig toegepast. Het gaat dan met name om artifici\u00eble neurale netwerken en bayesiaanse netwerken. Deze worden hier kort toegelicht.Neuraal netwerk  Algemeen Een kunstmatig neuraal netwerk (of gewoon neuraal netwerk) is een wiskundige techniek waarmee relaties worden gelegd tussen oorzaak (invoergegevens) en gevolg (uitvoergegevens), zonder het systeem zelf in beschouwing te nemen. De kracht van een kunstmatig neuraal netwerk is dat het in staat is deze relaties zelf te vinden. Hoewel zo\u00b4n netwerk is opgebouwd uit eenvoudige (wiskundige) elementen, kunnen deze relaties zeer complex zijn. Kunstmatige neurale netwerken zijn hierdoor bij uitstek geschikt voor situaties, waarin een traditionele modelmatige beschrijving niet toereikend, praktisch of mogelijk is. Het concept van kunstmatige neurale netwerken is in eerste instantie ontwikkeld om de menselijke hersenstructuur te modelleren. Deze is opgebouwd uit een hecht netwerk van met elkaar verbonden neuronen. Kunstmatige neurale netwerken bestaan uit een wiskundige voorstelling van deze neuronen en verbindingen. In een kunstmatig neuraal netwerk wordt de invoer via de neuronen door het netwerk doorgegeven. De vorm van het netwerk wordt bepaald door de manier waarop de neuronen zijn gegroepeerd. Meestal zijn er in een netwerk een aantal lagen met neuronen, waarbij de verschillende lagen met elkaar verbonden zijn. Er wordt dan onderscheid gemaakt tussen de invoerlaag, de verborgen lagen en de uitvoerlaag. Elk neuron heeft vaak meerdere invoerparameters. Deze invoer wordt gewogen gesommeerd en geschaald door middel van een transferfunctie. Deze functies zijn vaak eenvoudige mathematische functies zoals sinus, sigmo\u00efde, tangens hyperbolicus of lineaire functies. De uitvoer van de transferfunctie is in feite de uitvoer van het neuron, welke vaak weer als invoer dient voor neuronen in de volgende laag. De uitvoer van de neuronen in de uitvoerlaag is de uitvoer van het model. Het kalibreren van neuraal netwerk gebeurt door middel van het doorrekenen van een groot aantal voorbeelden. Na elk voorbeeld wordt de uitkomst van het neurale netwerk vergeleken met de juiste uitkomst; op basis hiervan worden de parameters automatisch bijgesteld. Zo ontstaat een leerproces waarbij een neuraal netwerk bij een bepaalde invoer de bijbehorende uitvoer kan reproduceren. Toepassing binnen de verkeerskunde Neurale netwerken zijn goed in staat een proces te simuleren, dat moeilijk door modellen is te beschrijven. Zo is bekend dat er een relatie is tussen de verkeersdrukte op een weg en de reistijd over die weg. Deze relatie is echter moeilijk in formule- of modelvorm vast te leggen. Neurale netwerken hebben in de praktijk bewezen deze relatie wel te kunnen beschrijven, op basis van grote hoeveelheden historische data. Voorlopig is reistijdvoorspelling de succesvolste toepassing van neurale netwerken binnen de verkeerskunde.Bayesiaans netwerk  Algemeen Een bayesiaans netwerk is een structuur, waarin wordt aangegeven welke kans bepaalde gebeurtenissen hebben afhankelijk van andere gebeurtenissen. Dit betekent dat op basis van a-priori kennis (X is waar, X is niet waar) een uitspraak kan worden gedaan over de kans op een gebeurtenis X. In formule vorm: $ Pr(X_1, \\ldots, X_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n Pr(X_i \\mid \\operatorname{parents}(X_i)) $  De figuur hiernaast geeft de kans weer op nat gras, wat afhangt van de regen en de sprinkler. Wanneer iets bekend is over een onderdeel van het systeem (het regent of het gras is nat), dan heeft dat invloed op de kansen van de andere gebeurtenissen: als het regent is de kans klein dat de sprinkler aan staat. Het meest kritische onderdeel van het bayesiaans netwerk is het juist invoeren van de relaties en de bijbehorende kansen. Dit is in feite de a-priori kennis van het systeem. De invoer kan op twee manieren gebeuren, namelijk op basis van een model of op basis van historische gegevens. Een stochastisch model kan worden omgeschreven tot een bayesiaans netwerk door de verschillende relaties als kansen weer te geven. Dit betekent wel dat er bepaalde beperkingen zijn aan het type model dat kan worden gebruikt, vooral doordat alles in gebeurtenissen wordt gedefinieerd. Een bayesiaans netwerk kan niet uitrekenen hoe hoog de intensiteit of hoe lang de reistijd is, maar alleen wat de kans is dat de reistijd of intensiteit boven een bepaalde waarde komt. De andere mogelijkheid is het gebruik van historische data. Er zijn algoritmes ontwikkeld die op basis van grote hoeveelheden data alle verschillende relaties en de bijbehorende kansen kunnen uitrekenen. Dit zijn zeer zware berekeningen; die kunnen dan ook maar voor beperkte netwerken worden uitgevoerd. Er is nog een ander groot nadeel van het gebruik van historische data. Gebeurtenissen die in de beschikbare data niet voorkomen, hebben ook een kans van nul. Het is dus belangrijk om een complete historische database te hebben. Toepassing binnen de verkeerskunde Bayesiaanse netwerken worden op allerlei gebieden toegepast binnen de verkeerskunde. Voor het MiOS-project bijvoorbeeld, is een bayesiaans netwerk toegepast om tot een eenvoudig model van het rijgedrag te komen. Op basis van gedetailleerde Remote Sensing data is een bayesiaans netwerk gebouwd dat het rijgedrag met beperkte nauwkeurigheid kan voorspellen.Toepassing Huidige toepassingen  In de volgende concrete voorbeelden wordt gebruik gemaakt van online verkeersmodellen.Toekomstige toepassingen  De verwachting is dat online modellen steeds gedetailleerder worden. Een combinatie van slimmere algoritmes en betere hardware (snellere computers) biedt de mogelijkheid een groter gebied met grotere gedetailleerdheid te modelleren. Daarnaast ontstaan meer mogelijkheden om realtime voorspellingen te doen. Dit biedt interessante mogelijkheden. Zo kunnen verkeersmanagers direct de gevolgen van eventuele maatregelen zien. Ook maakt dit betrouwbare reistijdvoorspellingen over hele netwerken mogelijk. Hoe goed modellen uiteindelijk in staat blijken te zijn het verkeer te voorspellen, blijft natuurlijk altijd de vraag. Mensen blijven immers onvoorspelbare wezens.Links en Bronnen  Estimation of the Transport Demand for Real-Time Aplications The Estimation of Freeway Origin-Destination Demand Using Real-Time Traffic Data of Freeway Traffic Management System (Ftms) Online Traffic Simulation with Cellular AutomataOpenstaande vragen  Hoe werkt de koppeling tussen METANET en BOSSonline? Heeft de pilot een vervolg gekregen? Worden ook andere statistische voorspellingsmethoden gebruikt? Wat zijn andere toepassingen met neurale netwerken en bayesiaanse netwerken?Verkeersmanagement Handboek Regionale Verkeersmonitoring Verkeersmanagement MoRo - Verkeersmonitoring Rotterdam  Met het project Monitoring Rotterdam (MoRo) richt de gemeente Rotterdam zich op het structureel inwinnen van verkeersgegevens. Het project is in april 2004 van start gegaan en fase 1 van het project is begin 2007 afgerond. In deze eerste fase is het inwinsysteem ontworpen. Hiertoe werd bepaald welke informatie gewenst is, welke indicatoren hiervoor nodig zijn en welke systemen in staat zijn om deze gegevens te verzamelen. Tevens werden de verschillende systemen beoordeeld en vergeleken. De belangrijkste keuze die in fase 1 moest worden gemaakt, was de keuze tussen een systeem voor kentekenherkenning en/of een netwerksysteem waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van de gegevens afkomstig uit een verkeersregelinstallaties. Omdat de kwaliteit van een kentekenherkenningsysteem dat reistijden kan meten groter is dan een netwerksysteem dat reistijden berekend, is er gekozen voor de realisatie van een kentekenherkenningsysteem. De planning is dat alle benodigde systemen in het derde kwartaal van 2008 volledig operationeel zijn.Inleiding  Het is de wens van elke grote stad: adequaat en effici\u00ebnt dynamisch verkeersmanagement om het verkeer in en om de stad vlot te laten doorstromen. Behalve verkeerskundige maatregelen zijn daarvoor up to date verkeersgegevens nodig. Met het project Monitoring Rotterdam (MoRo) richt de stad Rotterdam zich op het structureel inwinnen van deze gegevens. Het project startte in april 2004 en inmiddels is de eerste fase - het ontwerp van het inwinsysteem - (bijna) afgerond. In januari 2007 heeft de aanbesteding van het verlangde inwinsysteem plaats gevonden en in de verdere loop van 2007 en 2008 komt het systeem in de lucht. Ten tijde van het schrijven van dit artikel was de opdracht nog niet gegund. Deze gunning stond gepland voor eind februari. Dit artikel besteedt vooral aandacht aan het ontwerp van het inwinproces. Hierbij komen onder andere het vaststellen van relevante indicatoren, het inventariseren en vergelijken van systemen en het inwinplan aan bod.Doel van het project  Om het verkeer in en om de stad beter te laten doorstromen, wil de gemeente Rotterdam aan de hand van de actuele situatie op de weg kunnen bepalen welke (verkeers)maatregelen zij moet inzetten. Hiervoor zijn op structurele basis, actuele en gedetailleerde gegevens over het totale verkeersbeeld nodig. De gemeente Rotterdam doet wel al het een en ander aan inwinning van gegevens, maar deze gegevensverzameling heeft vaak betrekking op \u00e9\u00e9n specifieke toepassing of een bepaalde locatie. Deze specifieke en lokale gegevensinwinning is qua uitrol en aantal detectiepunten te mager om te kunnen voorzien in de inwinning van verkeersgegevens op netwerkniveau. MoRo moet resulteren in een structurele inwinning van verkeersgegevens waarmee het wel mogelijk is om het verkeer op netwerkniveau te monitoren.Verschillende fasen  Het MoRo-project bestaat uit drie fasen. De eerste fase gaat over het ontwerpen van een inwinsysteem en een nieuwe structuur voor het Verkeersmanagementsysteem Rotterdam (VMR). Het eindresultaat van de eerste fase is een functioneel programma van eisen. In de tweede en derde fase worden respectievelijk de inwinning en het nieuwe VMR gerealiseerd. De eerste fase (2004-2007) is opgedeeld in vijf deelprojecten:Inwinning van gegevens  Fase 1 van het MoRo-project richtte zich op het ontwerp van het inwinsysteem. In eerste instantie werd een lijst opgesteld van verkeersgegevens - de indicatoren - die gemeten moeten worden. Vervolgens werd onderzocht welke systemen en diensten op de markt beschikbaar zijn die deze indicatoren kunnen inwinnen. Daarna zijn deze systemen en diensten beoordeeld. Mede op basis van deze informatie is de afweging gemaakt voor het pakket aan systemen en/of diensten waarmee de gewenste informatie kan worden ingewonnen.Vaststelling van relevante indicatoren  Een inventarisatie naar de informatiebehoefte onder medewerkers van de Dienst Stedenbouw en Volkshuisvesting (dS+V) resulteerde in een lijst met indicatoren waarvan het wenselijk werd geacht dat die gemeten zouden worden. Hierbij werd niet alleen gekeken naar indicatoren die relevant zijn voor dynamisch verkeersmanagement maar ook naar indicatoren die relevant zijn voor andere toepassingen voor verkeersmonitoring. Door middel van een multi-criteria analyse zijn de indicatoren geprioriteerd waarna er een selectie is gemaakt van de meest relevante indicatoren. De relevante indicatoren zijn te verdelen in twee groepen te weten: Indicatoren die met behulp van nieuwe meetsystemen kunnen worden verkregen, zijn: Deze volgorde is in aflopende relevantie, met uitzondering van de indicator brugopeningen. Deze indicator is zeer relevant, maar is als laatste indicator in de lijst opgenomen omdat ze iets zegt over de infrastructuur en niet over de verkeersstromen. De indicator 'ongevallen/incidenten' (ongeplande capaciteitsbeperkingen) is uiteindelijk afgevallen, omdat er voor deze indicator geen (eenvoudig) meetsysteem op de markt is. De gemeente Rotterdam is niet voornemens om specifiek voor deze indicator (op grote schaal) meetsystemen te realiseren. In de beoordeling van de meetsystemen is wel meegenomen of en in welke mate de overgebleven meetsystemen in staat zijn om \u00f3\u00f3k ongevallen/incidenten te detecteren. Indicatoren die uit de eigen organisatie of via derden kunnen worden verkregen, zijn:Inventarisatie van systemen en diensten  Nadat de relevante indicatoren waren benoemd, is onderzocht welke systemen en diensten op de markt beschikbaar zijn. Er is een korte inventarisatie gemaakt van leveranciers van meetsystemen en vervolgens zijn deze leveranciers aangeschreven met het verzoek om informatie over de meetsystemen en diensten die zij kunnen leveren. Ook is informatie opgevraagd bij diverse wegbeheerders die dergelijke systemen in gebruik hebben. De verkregen informatie gaf inzicht in de verschillende beschikbare systemen voor de volgende typen meetmethoden: Op basis van kenmerken en eigenschappen zijn de meetsystemen in te delen in een aantal groepen: Hieronder vallen in principe alle systemen die lokaal gegevens verzamelen, in dit geval inductielussen, radar, infrarood en camera. Een voertuig kan op zowel het begin- als het eindpunt worden herkend. Het tijdsverschil tussen de herkenning op beide punten is de reistijd van het voertuig. Herkenning van een voertuig gebeurt meestal aan de hand van een kenteken. Een netwerksysteem kan op basis van ruwe gegevens uit verkeerslichten en lokale detectiesystemen andere gegevens inschatten. Hierbij wordt gebruik gemaakt van een simulatiemodel. De universele wegkantsystemen zijn slechts doorgeefluiken. Een dergelijk systeem kan de signalen van brugopeningen ontvangen en direct doorgeven aan een centrale. In onderstaand overzicht is aangegeven welke systemen voor de verschillende indicatoren kunnen worden gebruikt. In de tabel is onderscheid gemaakt naar de wijze waarop het meetsysteem de indicator kan leveren.Vergelijking van potenti\u00eble meetsystemen  In het derde deelproject is een multicriteria-analyse uitgevoerd en zijn de verschillende systemen voor structurele inwinning van de benodigde verkeersgegevens met elkaar vergeleken. Tevens is er een concept inwinplan opgesteld.Beoordelingscriteria  In de multicriteria-analyse is elk meetsysteem beoordeeld op een groot aantal criteria. Hierbij is onderscheid gemaakt tussen hoofdcriteria en subcriteria. De volgende criteria zijn hierbij gebruikt: Met het hoofdcriterium nauwkeurigheid wordt het verschil aangeduid tussen de werkelijke waarde en de waarde volgens het systeem (de meetgegevens). De totaalscore van het hoofdcriterium nauwkeurigheid is een gewogen gemiddelde van de twee subcriteria 'Nauwkeurigheid in normale omstandigheden' (75%) en 'Effect van extreme weersomstandigheden' (25%). Met het hoofdcriterium beschikbaarheid is beoordeeld in welke mate een systeem (tijdelijk) geen metingen kan verrichten door een (ver)storing. De totaalscore van het hoofdcriterium beschikbaarheid is een gewogen gemiddelde van de volgende drie subcriteria: Het hoofdcriterium actualiteit geeft weer hoeveel tijd er verstrijkt tussen het meten en het centraal beschikbaar komen van de data. Het hoofdcriterium datacommunicatie bestaat uit de subcriteria 'Communicatiemogelijkheden' (75%) en 'Hoeveelheid datacommunicatie (per dag)' (25%). Voor het subcriterium communicatiemogelijkheden is gekeken naar de aansluitmogelijkheden van de systemen. Meer specifiek naar het aantal en het type van mogelijke communicatiemiddelen die door de systemen kunnen worden gebruikt, zoals vaste lijn, GSM, GPRS. De hoeveelheid datacommunicatie is berekend aan de hand van de frequentie en de hoeveelheid data die per keer wordt verzonden (zoals opgegeven door de leveranciers). Onder flexibiliteit wordt verstaan of een systeem eenvoudig kan worden aangepast of gewijzigd. Het subcriteria 'verplaatsen of wijziging indeling meetlocatie' (75%) bekijkt of er kostenbesparingen mogelijk zijn bij het verplaatsen van een meetlocatie of bij het wijzigen van de indeling van meetlocatie, bijvoorbeeld door hergebruik van de apparatuur. Er is voor elk systeem een inschatting gemaakt van de mogelijke kostenbesparing: laag, gemiddeld of hoog. Bij het subcriteria 'extra toepassingen' (25%) wordt een inschatting gemaakt van de mogelijkheden van het systeem om het systeem - naast de huidige indicatoren voor Monitoring Rotterdam - ook nog voor andere toepassingen te kunnen gebruiken. De (extra) mogelijkheid om ongevallen/incidenten te detecteren is extra zwaar meegewogen. Deze indicator was in deelproject 1 al als gewenst aangemerkt. De totale kosten van een inwinsysteem worden bepaald door de investeringskosten en de kosten voor het gebruik (jaarlijkse kosten). De investeringskosten bestaan grofweg uit de kosten van de lokale detectiesystemen, de communicatiemiddelen en de centrale verwerking (apparatuur en software). Bij het bepalen van een schatting van de investeringskosten zijn de volgende aspecten gebruikt: Een ander belangrijk deel van de investeringskosten zijn de kosten van de installatiewerkzaamheden. Deze kosten zijn echter niet zomaar in te schatten en zijn daarom niet meegenomen. De jaarlijkse kosten bestaan grofweg uit onderhoudskosten, communicatiekosten en interne beheerskosten dS+V. Met name voor de communicatiekosten is ook het aantal locaties van belang. Vandaar dat de jaarlijkse gebruikskosten worden ingeschat op basis van de volgende vier aspecten: Naast de vermelde hoofd- en subcriteria zijn nog twee subcriteria meegenomen: referenties en evaluaties (50%) en realisatie (50%). Samen vormen deze twee het hoofdcriterium 'Overig'. Het aantal opgegeven referenties en evaluaties zegt iets over de betrouwbaarheid van het systeem. Onder realisatie vallen aspecten die van belang zijn in relatie tot het \"aanbrengen\" van het systeem en de impact op de omgeving (uitstraling, overlast tijdens realisatie en onderhoud). Naast de criteria waarop elk systeem een score kan halen, zijn er ook minimale eisen opgesteld. De inwinsystemen moeten aan deze eisen voldoen, willen ze als relevant worden beschouwd voor de inwinning van de indicator(en). De eisen hebben betrekking op de meest relevante aspecten bij het inwinnen van de indicatoren, namelijk de nauwkeurigheid, de beschikbaarheid en de actualiteit van de gegevens. De eisen zijn als volgt geformuleerd:Beoordeling van de meetsystemen  Elk type systeem kan bepaalde verkeersgegevens meten, maar niet alle systemen kunnen dat even nauwkeurig. Onderstaande tabel maakt duidelijk hoe goed een systeem in staat is om de desbetreffende gegevens te meten. Hoe lager het getal, hoe beter het systeem hiertoe in staat is. Een lege cel betekent dat het systeem die informatie niet kan inwinnen binnen de gestelde eisen. Uit de tabel komt naar voren dat geen enkel meetsysteem geschikt is om alle gegevens in te winnen. Enkele specifiekere conclusies uit de beoordeling van de meetsystemen zijn:Combinatie van systemen  Geen van de systemen is geschikt om alle gegevens in te winnen. Dat betekent dat er meer soorten meetsystemen moeten worden aangeschaft om alle informatiebehoeftes te kunnen vervullen. De verschillende systemen kunnen worden gecombineerd tot \"pakketten\". Het uitgangspunt is dat met een pakket alle indicatoren kunnen worden geleverd. Reistijd is de meest relevante indicator en er zijn slechts twee systemen voldoende geschikt gebleken om reistijden te meten: kentekenherkenning en netwerksystemen. Voor de indicatoren snelheid en verkeerssamenstelling zijn de lokale detectiesystemen (lussen, radar en infrarood) het meest geschikt. Deze kunnen ook de overige indicatoren leveren (file en intensiteit). Er zijn daarmee drie combinaties (pakketten) van systemen denkbaar om alle indicatoren te leveren: A kentekenherkenning aangevuld met lokale detectiesystemen Een kentekenherkenningssysteem is alleen geschikt voor het meten van reistijden. Hoewel het systeem ook een indicatie van de intensiteiten en verkeerssamenstelling kan geven, voldoet het niet aan de eisen. Voor de andere indicatoren dienen aanvullende (lokale) detectiesystemen te worden gebruikt. B netwerksysteem aangevuld met lokale detectiesystemen Een netwerksysteem gebruikt met name gegevens uit verkeerslichten om uit te rekenen wat de reistijden zijn. Ook voor een netwerksysteem geldt dat er aanvullende lokale detectiesystemen nodig zijn, aangezien een netwerksysteem niet in staat is puntsnelheden en verkeerssamenstelling te meten. C kentekenherkenning \u00e9n netwerksysteem aangevuld met lokale detectiesystemen Een combinatie van een kentekenherkenningssysteem en netwerksysteem is met name geschikt voor reistijden en dan ook weer aangevuld met lokale detectiesystemen voor de overige indicatoren. Samen vormen deze een sterke en robuuste combinatie voor het inwinnen van verkeersgegevens. Aanvankelijk had pakket C de voorkeur. Er is echter toch gekozen voor pakket A (Kentekenherkenning in combinatie met lokale detectie). Het achterliggend idee bij pakket C was dat de combinatie van reistijdmeting en het berekenen van reistijden op basis van VRI-gegevens voor een robuuster systeem zou zorgen. Er zouden op minder locaties reistijdmeetsystemen hoeven te worden ingericht. Echter, de inschatting was dat te weinig leveranciers de combinatie van een reistijdmeetsysteem met een netwerkmodel tot een aanbieding konden ombouwen. Door de vraagdefinitie in het bestek zou het aantal geschikte leveranciers al meteen sterk worden beperkt, wat ongewenst is. De kwaliteit van een kentekenherkenningsysteem (of een andere vorm van voertuigherkenning) staat ver boven die van een netwerksysteem dat reistijden berekent, terwijl de kosten niet al te ver van elkaar vandaan liggen. Vandaar dat toch is gekozen voor een reistijdmeetsysteem.Het inwinplan  Parallel aan deelproject 3 is het inwinplan opgesteld. Hierin wordt een voorstel gedaan voor de locaties waar de verschillende indicatoren moeten worden ingewonnen. Dit inwinplan is opgesteld vanuit de inventarisatie van de vraagbehoefte naar (verkeers)informatie (deelproject 1). Deze informatiebehoefte was redelijk algemeen uitgevoerd en de vertaling naar een netwerk was dan ook een worsteling. Dit heeft dan ook geresulteerd in een concept inwinplan. Dit concept inwinplan is bij de vertaling naar een bestek nog in detail is beschouwd. Omdat de eisen en wensen niet altijd in verhouding stonden tot het doel van de informatie, zijn de eisen en wensen die bij de informatiebehoefte zijn geinventariseerd aan een review onderworpen.Aantal meetlocaties  Er is een schatting gemaakt van het aantal benodigde meetlocaties op de bundels en de hoofdwegen in Rotterdam. Deze schatting is gebaseerd op de informatiebehoefte zoals ge\u00efnventariseerd in deelproject 1 van Monitoring Rotterdam. Een locatie betreft \u00e9\u00e9n richting met \u00e9\u00e9n of meerdere rijstroken. Het geschatte aantal meetlocaties per indicator is hieronder weergegeven.Combineren van indicatoren op \u00e9\u00e9n locatie  Voor het realiseren van het inwinplan kunnen verschillende indicatoren, die op dezelfde locatie zijn geprojecteerd, worden gecombineerd. Het totaal aantal meetlocaties zal dan ook (veel) kleiner zijn dan het totaal van de afzonderlijke indicatoren. In onderstaande tabellen is aangegeven welke indicatoren vaak zijn te combineren omdat ze op dezelfde locatie zijn geprojecteerd. Ook hier is onderscheid gemaakt naar het basis inwinplan en het uitgebreide inwinplan.Aanbesteding en vervolgtraject  Er is voldoende inzicht in de voor- en nadelen van de verschillende meetsystemen, om tot aanschaf over te gaan. Hiertoe is een bestek opgesteld op basis waarvan marktpartijen een aanbieding konden uitbrengen.Aanbesteding  Het centrale uitgangspunt bij het ontwerp van het bestek was het idee dat marktpartijen voldoende ruimte moesten krijgen. De hoofdlijn van het bestek komt in het kort neer op het volgende:Vervolgtraject  De aanbesteding vond plaats op 10 januari 2007. In de maanden januari en februari worden de aanbiedingen beoordeeld. Vervolgens gaat het voornemen tot gunning uit (medio februari). Indien er geen bezwaren worden gemaakt kan de gunning eind februari plaatsvinden. Ten tijde van het schrijven van dit artikel was de opdracht nog niet gegund. De leveringstermijn bedraagt 12 maanden voor de eerste 85 procent en 18 maanden voor de volle 100 procent. Dit betekent dat het gehele systeem in het derde kwartaal van 2008 volledig dient te werken.Verwerking en gebruik  Pas als de gegevens in een centraal systeem worden verzameld, kunnen ze worden gebruikt voor (nog te realiseren) maatregelen in het kader van dynamisch verkeersmanagement. Het belangrijkste probleem bij het verzamelen van verkeersgegevens in een centraal systeem, is dat de gegevens niet zomaar naast elkaar kunnen worden gelegd. Sommige gegevens betreffen een bepaalde locatie (zoals de snelheid), andere betreffen een gehele route (zoals de reistijd). En sommige gegevens worden elke minuut opnieuw gemeten, terwijl andere gegevens slechts eenmaal per uur worden verzameld. De oplossing hiervoor bestaat uit twee 'onderdelen'. Enerzijds is er behoefte aan een set afspraken over de wijze waarop gegevens worden geregistreerd en opgeslagen en anderzijds is er behoefte aan een centraal systeem dat (volgens de afspraken) alle gegevens kan verzamelen en weer beschikbaar kan stellen aan de personen en systemen die de gegevens nodig hebben. Het Nationaal Datawarehouse is een dergelijk centraal systeem dat op basis van een set afspreken over data uitwisseling en locatiebepaling, gegevens verstrekt. In het bestek is dan ook duidelijk opgenomen dat het wenselijk is dat de gegevens ter beschikking worden gesteld aan dit Nationaal Datawarehouse. Daarnaast heeft de gemeente Rotterdam de intentie om alsnog over te gaan tot de aanschaf van een zogenoemde \"DVM Gegevenslaag\" waardoor processen beter zijn te stroomlijnen en verkeerskundige applicaties ook alleen verkeerskundige functies hoeven te vervullen. Ook een koppeling tussen diverse bronnen en parallelle centrales wordt beter mogelijk. Dit systeem wordt aangeschaft als er meer ervaringen zijn met het inwinnen van gegevens en als er nadere afspraken zijn gemaakt over interfacing en protocollen.Bronnen  dS+V (2005); Deelproject 2b: inventarisatie van de aanbodzijde (systemen en diensten in de markt) dS+V (2006); Deelproject 3: Vergelijking potenti\u00eble meetsystemen dS+V (2006); (concept) inwinplan dS+V (2006); Project samenvatting Het volledige bestek is hier te vinden.Openstaande vragen  Voorlopig geen specifieke openstaande vragen.Verkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring met actieve infrarooddetectoren  Er bestaan twee infrarooddetectorsystemen: passief infrarood en actief infrarood, in dit artikel worden de actieve infrarooddetectoren besproken. Actief infrarood kan worden gebruikt om de verkeerssituatie te monitoren, door gegevens over de intensiteit en snelheid in te winnen. Het voordeel van het infrarooddetectoryssteem is dat het systeem minimaal wordt be\u00efnvloed door weersomstandigheden en dat het verkeer tijdens de aanleg en het onderhoud weinig overlast ondervindt.Werkingsprincipe  Actief infrarood detecteert de aanwezigheid van voertuigen door middel van het uitzenden van een reflecterend signaal. Dit gebeurt door een low-energy laserstraal (conform de afstandsbediening van de audioapparatuur) op het wegoppervlak. De aanwezigheid van een voertuig wordt gedetecteerd als de lichtstraal van de infrarooddetector wordt onderbroken. Dit wordt waargenomen door een eerdere terugkaatsing van de lichtstraal. De infrarooddetectoren kunnen aan een mast langs de weg of aan een uithanger, portaal of viaduct boven de weg worden bevestigd.Toepassing  Passief infrarood wordt vooral toegepast als aanwezigheidsdetector. Actief infrarooddetectoren hebben, in tegenstelling tot passieve infrarooddetectoren ook de mogelijkheid om verkeer op verschillende rijstroken te detecteren en de gegevens intensiteit, snelheid en dichtheid te meten. Actieve infrarooddetectoren kunnen echter geen stilstaande voertuigen detecteren, passieve detectoren w\u00e9l. Actief infrarood lijkt in veel opzichten op de werking van  radardetectoren. Echter worden actieve infrarooddetectoren in tegenstelling tot radardetectoren wel beperkt door het optische bereik (zichtafstand), waardoor mist of hevige neerslag de werking en de nauwkeurigheid wel kan be\u00efnvloeden. Daarnaast kan de actieve infrarood detector de actieve dichtheid meten, dit is niet mogelijk met de radardetector. Wel kan de radardetector de dichtheden berekenen aan de hand van de relatie tussen de intensiteit en de snelheid. Er is momenteel nog weinig ervaring met het toepassen van infrarooddetectoren voor het monitoren van het verkeer. Op enkele locaties in Nederland worden infrarooddetecoren toegepast Traffic Eyes om het verkeer te monitoren. Een Traffic Eye is een detectiesysteem met twee infrarooddetectoren. De Traffic Eyes sturen sms-berichten met de gemeten verkeersgegevens naar een centrale computer. Die verwerkt de gegevens tot concrete verkeersinformatie. Deze verkeersinformatie kan vervolgens weer worden gebruikt om verkeersmanagementsystemen aan te sturen.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  Infrarooddetectorsystemen zijn nauwelijks gevoelig voor weersomstandigheden. Actieve infrarooddetectie wordt beperkt tot het optische bereik, een ononderbroken zichtlijn. Bij mist, sneeuw of hevige neerslag wordt de zichtafstand van het meetsysteem beperkt. Bij passieve infraroodsystemen wordt de detectieafstand niet beperkt door de zichtafstand. De kwaliteit van actieve infrarooddetectie hangt daarnaast af van het lichtniveau en de kleur van het te detecteren doel, een voertuig die ongeveer dezelfde kleur heeft als het asfalt is slechter te detecteren dan een voertuig met een compleet andere kleur. In de onderstaande tabel is een inschatting gegeven van de nauwkeurigheid van de diverse meetgegevens, deze eisen aan de nauwkeurigheid van de gegevens zijn afkomstig uit het rapport van Polman.Beschikbaarheid  Het bereik van een infrarooddetector is beperkter dan van een radar of een camera. Het ligt tussen de 0 en 150 meter. In het rapport van Polman wordt gesteld dat het systeem ongeveer 98 procent van de tijd beschikbaar is voor gebruik.Actualiteit  Het infrarooddetectorsysteem registreert de gegevens binnen een fractie van een seconde. Na ongeveer \u00e9\u00e9n tot enkele minuten zijn de gegevens verwerkt en beschikbaar voor gebruik.Flexibiliteit  Infrarooddetectorsystemen zijn flexibel in te richten en af te stellen, afhankelijk van de situatie. De ligging en de vorm van het detectieveld zijn zonder verplaatsing van de infrarooddetector moeilijk te veranderen. Het systeem is ook als mobiele installatie beschikbaar, bijvoorbeeld bij wegwerkzaamheden.Gegevenstype  Actieve infrarooddetectoren hebben de mogelijkheid voor detectie op verschillende rijstroken. Daarbij worden meestal gegevens geleverd als:Realisatie  Bij de implementatie van het infrarooddetectorsysteem moet rekening worden gehouden met een doorlooptijd van een maand tot enkele maanden. Dit in verband met de levertijd, de bevestiging van de infrarooddetectoren op de standplaats en het in werking stellen van het systeem. De infrarooddetectoren worden aan een viaduct, portaal, uithanger of paal naast de weg gemonteerd. Tijdens de aanleg is er dus weinig overlast voor het verkeer.Onderhoud  Het infrarooddetectorsysteem moet regelmatig gecontroleerd worden op de juiste werking. Voor het overige zijn de infrarooddetectoren onderhoudarm. Het onderhoud van de infrarooddetectoren is gemakkelijk en goedkoop, aangezien er geen ingrepen in de weg noodzakelijk zijn en het verkeer minimaal wordt verstoord.Kosten  De kosten voor een infrarooddetectorsysteem zijn afhankelijk van de omvang van de meetlocatie en het aantal detectoren. De kosten van het systeem zijn hoger dan de kosten van een radardetectorsysteem, specifieke prijsinformatie is echter niet beschikbaar.Bronnen  Gemeente Rotterdam, Monitoring Rotterdam DP3: Vergelijking potenti\u00eble meetsystemen, Gemeente Rotterdam dS+V afdeling Verkeer en Vervoer, maart 2006 Hillen, Monitoring ten behoeve van reistijdinformatie, AGV in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, september 2006 Schoemakers, Stemerding en van der Vlist, Voertuigdetectie: wensen en mogelijkheden, Goudappel Coffeng in opdracht van het ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat/Rijkswaterstaat Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer, november 2001 Wilson, Handboek verkeerslichtenregelingen, CROW, januari 2006Openstaande vragen  -> Terug naar weggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Verkeersmonitoring met remote sensing  Remote sensing is een techniek waarmee het wegverkeer vanaf grote hoogte kan worden waargenomen. De Technische Universiteit Delft voert momenteel een pilot uit, waarbij het verkeer op de snelweg vanuit een helikopter met camera's wordt gemonitord. Met deze beelden wordt informatie verkregen over het rijgedrag van de individuele autombilisten. Remote sensing levert niet alleen informatie op over het verkeer in een bepaalde situatie, er kan ook een beeld mee worden verkregen van het verloop van het wegverkeer over een langer traject.Inleiding  De betekenis van remote sensing in de brede zin van het woord, is het verzamelen van gegevens over het aardoppervlak via waarneming vanaf grote hoogte. Bijvoorbeeld door satellietbeelden of door waarneming waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van luchtballonnen, vliegtuigen, helikopters en hoge gebouwen. In de context van verkeersmonitoring is remote sensing het tracen van voertuigen met behulp van camera\u2019s vanaf grote hoogten, zoals vanuit helikopters, vliegtuigen en vanaf gebouwen. Het gebruik van de huidige methoden voor verkeersmonitoring is beperkt tot het verkrijgen van informatie over de verkeersstromen en de voertuigen op een doorsnede. Met behulp van remote sensing kan een algeheel beeld worden gevormd van het individuele rijgedrag van de automobilisten op een traject. Op basis hiervan kunnen betere voorspellingen worden gedaan van de verkeerssituatie.Pilots  Er worden momenteel verschillende pilots met de remote sensingtechniek uitgevoerd voor de monitoring van verkeer.Case: Monitoring hoofdwegennet met een helikopter  De Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek heeft een project lopen, getiteld Tracing Congestion Dynamics, with Innovatieve Microscopic Data to a Better Theory. De TU Delft werkt in dit onderzoeksproject samen met de Adviesdienst Verkeer en Vervoer van Rijkswaterstaat aan een methode om het rijgedrag van de automobilisten op het hoofdwegennet over grotere lengte vast te leggen. Dit project is een van de pilots op het gebied van remote sensing en wordt hieronder in detail toegelicht.Werkingsprincipe  In het project van de TU Delft en AVV worden vanuit een helikopter foto-opnamen gemaakt van het verkeer op een wegvak van de snelweg. De heli hangt op \u00e9\u00e9n positie op een hoogte van ongeveer 500 meter. De digitale camera fotografeert met een frequentie van tien foto's per seconde het verkeer op het wegvak onder de helikopter. De foto's worden al tijdens de vlucht opgeslagen op een computer. Na de vlucht wordt het beeldmateriaal verwerkt tot bruikbare verkeersgegevens, de zogenoemde trajectorie\u00ebn van de voertuigen. Tijdens de verwerking worden verschillende stappen doorlopen: Bewerken van de camerabeelden Detectie en identificatie van de voertuigen Opstellen trajectorie\u00ebnToepassing  Met de gegevens die uit de camerabeelden worden gehaald, kan onder meer onderzoek worden uitgevoerd naar het volggedrag van de automobilisten. Daarbij wordt dan extra aandacht besteed aan het verbeteren van de verkeersmodellen. Daarnaast wordt de methode gebruikt om meer inzicht te krijgen in het effect van verschillende weginrichtingsmaatregelen, zoals de spitsstroken en de 80 km/u-maatregel. Hierbij zijn voornamelijk de laterale posities van belang. Dit zijn de posities in de breedterichting van de weg, zoals rijstrookwisselingen. Verder zijn de volgafstanden van belang, in relatie tot de snelheid, intensiteit en verkeerssamenstelling. De methode kan tevens worden gebruikt om andere facetten van het rijden te onderzoeken, bijvoorbeeld het inhaalgedrag van automobilisten en het gedrag rond in- en uitvoegen van de autosnelweg.Kenmerken Nauwkeurigheid  In het remote sensingproject zijn nog allerlei ontwikkelingen in volle gang. Momenteel is het nog moeilijk om de beelden te bewerken als de lichtintensiteit tijdens de opnames sterk verandert. Daarnaast blijkt het systeem zeer gevoelig voor slecht weer. Bij slecht zicht kunnen geen opnames van grote hoogte worden gemaakt. Bij stormachtig weer kan de helikopter niet stil genoeg blijven hangen, waardoor het beeld te veel beweegt voor een goede verwerking. Daarnaast is het met de huidige programmatuur niet mogelijk om de voertuigen op wegen met een kromming te detecteren. Ontwikkelingen voor programmatuur die dit zal verbeteren zijn in een vergevorderd stadium.Actualiteit  Het verwerken van het beeldmateriaal is arbeids- en tijdsintensief. De totale verwerking van de beelden tot bruikbare verkeersgegevens duurt ongeveer een maand.Gegevens  Met de bewerkte camerabeelden kan informatie verkregen worden over:Flexibiliteit  Doordat gebruik gemaakt wordt van een helikopter kan de meetlocatie tijdens de meting worden aangepast, desgewenst aan de ontwikkelingen op het wegennet.Realisatie  De meting brengt geen hinder voor het verkeer met zich mee, omdat geen apparatuur hoeft te worden ge\u00efnstalleerd.Kosten  De kosten voor deze manier van monitoren liggen relatief hoog. Slechts voor een korte periode (maximaal 3 uur) kan het verkeer worden gemonitord. Voor deze periode moeten zowel het systeem als de helikopter worden gehuurd.Bronnen  Ahola, Vehicle monitoring using digital video sequences, ENVIMON, 2005 Gorte, Karimi, Hoogendoorn, [Outline extraction of a motorway from helicopter image sequence, ISPRS workshop and the German Association for Pattern Recognition 2005 Hoogendoorn, van Zuylen, Schreuder, Gorte, Vosselman, Microscopic Traffic Data Collection by Remote Sensing, Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2003 Hoogendoorn, Schreuder, Tracing Congestion Dynamics with Remote Sensing, Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2005 Molinier, H\u00e4me, Ahola, 3D-Connected Components Analysis for Traffic Monitoring in Image Sequences Acquired from a Helicopter, 14th Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis SCIA2005, 2005 Next Generation Simulation, Interstate 80 Freeway Dataset, NGSIM FactSheet, 2006 Ossen, Hoogendoorn, van Loon, Schreuder, Helikopter blikt op verkeer: Datacollectie vanuit de lucht levert schat aan nieuwe informatie, Verkeerskunde januari 2006 Tracing Congestion Dynamics, http://www.tracingcongestion.tudelft.nl ENVIMON Research Project, http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/proj2/envimon/traffic.htm LUMOS Luftunterst\u00fctztes Monitoring System, http://www.projekt-lumos.de NGSIM, http://www.ngsim.fhwa.dot.gov/ Terug naar -> weggebonden meetsystemenVerkeersmanagement Kwaliteitsmonitoring, het da Vinci project  Meetgegevens van het hoofdwegennet worden steeds breder ingezet voor allerlei online en offline toepassingen. Hierdoor worden steeds hogere eisen gesteld aan de kwaliteit van de huidge informatieketen voor verkeersinformatie. Om aan de hoogste kwaliteitseisen te kunnen voldoen, wordt in het zogenoemde Da Vinci-project de kwaliteit van de informatieketen doorgelicht en mogelijke fouten met hun oorzaak opgespoord.Inleiding  Het Da Vinci-project is het belangrijkste project van dit moment in het kader van kwaliteitsmonitoring van verkeersgegegevens en wordt uitgevoerd door de Data en ICT Dienst van Rijkswaterstaat (voorheen AVV). In het project wordt een inschatting gemaakt van de kwaliteit van de diverse onderdelen van de informatieketen. Deze keten is oorspronkelijk opgezet voor het online verwerken van informatie, waaraan in het algemeen geen hoge kwaliteitseisen werden gesteld. Systemen ontberen dan ook de mogelijkheid om de kwaliteit te meten en te verbeteren. Nu data \u00f3\u00f3k wordt gebruikt voor bijvoorbeeld historische analyses en ondersteuning van dynamisch verkeersmanagement, is kwaliteit w\u00e9l een item.Informatieketen  De huidige informatieketen voor verkeersinformatie op het hoofdwegennet ziet er als volgt uit: In elk onderdeel van deze keten kunnen fouten optreden. Dit begint al bij de Monica-meetgegevens: hier vallen af en toe lussen op een bepaalde locatie uit en soms werkt het hele systeem niet. Wanneer deze 'gaten' beperkt blijven in tijd en ruimte, kan dit online door Monibas worden opgevangen. Monibas berekent een lopend gemiddelde over de bekende data (bij een lopend gemiddelde wordt ieder data punt in een tijdserie vervangen door het gemiddelde van de omliggende datapunten; hiermeer worden oneffenheden uit de serie gefilterd). Monibas kan ook delen van foutieve data van Monica opvangen. Onder online omstandigheden kan Monibas echter geen complexe fouten detecteren en opvangen. Deze fouten blijven dan in de hele informatieketen zitten. Denk bij dergelijke fouten aan lussen die continu 225 km/u als gemiddelde snelheid doorgeven. Een andere mogelijke fout is een verkeerd ingestelde ID-code van een lus, waardoor die niet goed door het systeem wordt herkend. Ook zijn er onderstations die steeds melden dat de aangesloten lussen correct functioneren, terwijl de lussen continu geen passages en snelheid=0 km/u meten. Het aantal mogelijke fouten in het hele informatieketen kan dus zeer groot zijn. Op dit moment is er geen structurele kwaliteitsmonitoring van het systeem. Het is in de meeste gevallen niet mogelijk om direct te controleren of de reistijden van TREFI overeenkomen met de reistijden die in de praktijk worden gerealiseerd. De enige kennis die op dit moment bestaat, is dat van de lusdata enkele procenten fout is. Over de gevolgen hiervan en de fouten in de rest van de keten is niets bekend. Dit was een belangrijke reden om het Da Vinci-project op te zetten. Daarnaast worden ook projecten gestart om de TREFI-reistijden te vergelijken met reistijdinformatie van andere bronnen, bijvoorbeeld cameraherkenningsystemen en floating car data.Fouten opsporen  Het Da Vinci-project onderzoekt fouten in de hele keten. De focus ligt op fouten in software en configuratie. Niet alleen ontstaan hier regelmatig fouten, bovendien is dit type fout het makkelijkst op te lossen. De fouten komen automatisch aan het licht door algoritmes die abnormale waarden detecteren. Dit betekent dat op een locatie wordt gekeken of de meting over verloop van tijd hetzelfde gedrag vertoont. Ook wordt op ieder moment gecontroleerd of de informatie ruimtelijk consistent is. Voor dit laatste vergelijkt het algoritme de metingen van \u00e9\u00e9n locatie met die van naastgelegen locaties. Op basis van het behoud van voertuigen kan hiermee worden bepaald of een meetlocatie de juiste gegevens levert. De validatie van algoritmes wordt verder verbeterd door deze te koppelen met externe informatie, om afwijkingen als gevolg van incidenten, wegwerkzaamheden, evenementen en extreme weeromstandigheden te onderscheiden van daadwerkelijk fouten in de informatieketen. In eerste instantie worden in het Da Vinci-project alleen de grove fouten ge\u00efnventariseerd en behandeld. In een later stadium kunnen ook kleinere fouten worden aangepakt.Ethical Investment Wiki Main Page Welcome  Welcome to the EI Wiki. This wiki is currently very much in the development stages.

Asset Classes - types of assets categorized into classes. These primarily include bonds, stocks, shares and private equities, real estate, commodities, cash equivalents, hedge funds, etc. Active/Passive Investment - Active Investment requires direct and regular intervention and 'tweaking' in the investment process by Fund Managers and invertors, for example by continual engagement and iteration. Passive investment means following and grouping in certain pre-determined or externally determined funds or investemnt portfolios Beneficiaries - technically, 'the person for whose benefit the property is held in trust' but more broadly, they are anyone who benefits from university services and who potentially benefit. Endowment funds- Bespoke Funds - these are funds that are regulated and predetermined or heavily managed so as to specifically cater for types of investor needs, and may strongly screen in or out certain types of companies or sectors. Includes tracker and thematic funds. Bonds - A certificate of debt issued by a government or corporation guaranteeing payment of the original investment plus interest by a specified future date. Thus universities tend to buy bonds issued from the government which guarantee a fixed return year on year in the form of interest. Bundled/Unbundled Financial Management - Financial management can include two types of tasks: 'Financial' and 'Extra Fiancial' (e.g.accountability, responsibility, sustainability). Bundled Management implies that these tasks are done in unison by one Fund manager or company or a single group of Fund Managers. Unbundled management immplies that the decisions of whether to purchase and sell and retain for financial short-term reasons are done seperately from the process of engagement with the companies themselves about their behaviour. Blue Chip Funds - these are funds that have a proven track record and are 'guaranteed' to produce steady, predictable returns for investment Charitable Status - Universities in the UK have 'charitable status', and thus they are obligated to fulfill certain types of financial responsibilities. They are determined by Charity Regulators via the Charities Commission. Charities have to fulfill their Fiduciary responsibility and trustees are legally responsible for the fufillment of them. Community investing - addresses the financial needs of low income communities by providing capital for affordable housing, small business development, and non-profit development. Community investments can be made through community development banks, loan funds, and credit unions and include loans, CDs, checking, savings, and money market accounts. See the Community Investment Centre Co-option - the process of hijacking a minority group's agenda because it fits in with an overall or dominant groups agenda or concern. The dominant group may champion this new agenda as if it were its own, but will usually merely allow the minority group minimal space and support so as to then claim credit if the agenda is successful and beneficial to the dominant group, while allowing it the option to condemn and distance itself from the agenda if it turns out to be unsuccessful. Corporate Social Responisbility (CSR) - the idea that Corporations have an intrinsic duty to take responisbility for the health and wellfare and development of their emploees and stakeholders. Deradicalization - the process of manipulation of radical agenda's, usually by a dominant group with vested interests, in order to subvert and accommodate new ideologies while essentially maintaining the 'status quo' or 'business as usual'. Classic results of deradicalization will be co-option, greenwash, or rhetorical demagoguery. Derivatives - money that is 'derived' from companies in various ways and usually returned to shareholders, which includes profits, dividends and interest Eco efficiency - the ability of organizations to make savings and increase profit margins by becoming more 'sustainable' or ecological: e.g. costs savings from increased energy efficiency. Eco effectiveness - the ability for organisations to become more profitable and effective by investing in and improving human and natural capital: e.g. regenerating economically productive ecosystems or investing in health and safety training Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Issues - The Enhanced Analytics Initiative defines ESG issues as having one or more of the following features: - the focus of public concern - not easily quantifiable, thus qualitiative in nature (e.g. intellectual capital and governance) - reflect externalities - affected by increasing regulation (e.g carbon emissions) - arise through a companY's supply chain (e.g. labour issues in factories) \u2018ethical and socially responsible investment principles\u2019 (ESRIP) Externalities - costs and benefits not generally accounted for by markets and quantifiable financial mechanisms Engagement - the process of interacting with organizations and businesses to increase democracy and encourage behavioural change. Ethical Criteria - a set of attributable and assessable benchmarks that are put in place to indicate that an organization is investing ethically. Equities - the monetary value of a property or business beyond any amounts owed on it in mortgages, claims, liens, etc. Thus universities' total business value and property and capital are equities. Equities tend to increase in value (e.g. property) if well amnaged, but they cost money to manage adn maintain. can invest in equities Feel Good Factor- the warm (extra-financial) feeling of investing ethically and being seen to be 'good'. Financial Duties/ Extra-Financial Duties - Financial Duties tend to be dominant for investors and Financial Managers. Public Companies, for example, are legally required to maximize the value of shares. Fiduciary - (person) a person to whom property or power is entrusted for the benefit of another. Thus Trustees 'owe' fiduciary duties to 'beneficiaries' under the trust. Fiduciary Responsibility/Duty - duties that common law jurisdictions impose upon a person who undertakes to exrecise some discretionary power in th einterests of another person in trust' (Freshfields) Fiduciary Duty should not be confused with 'legal duty' It is arguable that, since there is flexibility in the definition of these duties, that these duties need to account for the needs fo the main group of beneficiaries- the students. Fiduciary duty has been, apparantly, redefined to include the duty to account fo gevernance, social and environmental issues. See Social Funds.com moreover in the Freshfield's Report it states that \"[T]here is no duty to 'maximize' the return of individual investments, but instead a duty to implement an overall investment strategy that is rational and appropriate to the fund. Fiduciary duties include those to a) act for proper purpose, including 1.carry out the terms of the trust 2.act in the interests of the beneficiaries as a whole b) duty to act prudently 1.consider the suitability of investments 2. Apply special knowledge and skills 3. Act reasonably Fiduciary duties evolve over time according to changes in social norms and the values of society and, to a degree, technological and market changes. Governance/Governance Issues - the internal processes that allow an organisation or institution to function by allocating tasks and organising roles. Governance issues include remuneration, leave, equal opportunities, Greenwash - the process of 'cosmetic surgery' to make an organization look and sound good, or conform to new rules and regulations, while in reality continuing with unethical or unsustainable practices. Human Capital - the (market?) value of people with regard to their attributes and skills Ingression and Introjection of Values - introjection is a psychoanalytic term that indicates the internalization of external features and phenomenon. Introjection and ingression of values implies the building-in, incorporation and accommodation of ethical values into a system. Investment Decisions - a collective term for the activities associated with the selection, retention and realization of investments and extends to the provision and receipt of investment advice. investment management-is the process of deciding where and how to invest funds, while considering the overall aims and strategy of the investors. asset allocation, portfolio construction and stock-picking or bond-picking \u2018integrated analysis\u2019 approach, whereby screening and shareholder engagement are combined for maximum impact on the ESG performance of selected companies. Investment universe - an expression of the size of total investment possibilities open to an organization. The more stringent the ethical demands, the more limited the universe will tend to become. Investment Portfolios - the break-down or 'inventory' of an investor that states what kind of investments are made in what ways. Asset classes, their weighting and relative financial bias are all aspects of an investment portfolio. Locality Weighting - the dominance of investment in a certain geographic area, for example national or global investments, continental or regional. Liabilities - the opposite of an asset because it costs money to maintain ownership of it (e.g. through high maintenance or use costs) Market Alien Values- ethics, morality, sustainability, cultural integrity, community modern portfolio theory in investment -\u201cmanagement, in which portfolios of investments are selected based on their overall risk-reward characteristics rather than individual securities being selected on the basis of their individual risks and returns. Selecting an appropriately diversified portfolio is a crucial part of effective portfolio management. This is manifested in the balance that is sought to be struck between different types ofassets, such as equities, bonds and cash, and different geographic spreads, industries or sectors.\u201d Thus any intervention, like EI, that might limit the scope of diversity for investment portfolios are condemned by modern portfolio theory as implying an increased risk and thus imbalanced, inappropriate and less effective in achieving high and stable returns. This theory, however, is based on the assumption that it is 'appropriate' to invest in any and every sector only because it will increase 'diversity', regardless of the risk involved in investing in those particular sectors. Mutual funds-When an individual or a company invests capital in a mutual fund, this capital is pooled with all other monies received from individuals or companies. This pool of money is then invested by fund managers, who will choose various financial products they believe will help achieve the fund\u2019s financial objectives.25 In return for this investment, the investor receives shares in the mutual fund and becomes a shareholder. Mutual funds are generally open-end investment companies that buy back or redeem their shares at current net asset value. Most mutual funds continuously offer new shares to accommodate new investors. Natural capital - the value of ecological and environmental resources and services Nested Funds - funds that are inherently protected or exclusive or exist within certain layers or rules and regulations because they are held by particular types of trustees. They may guarantee minimum levels of risk or minimum levels of return. OSCR -The Office of Scottish Charities Regulation which oversees the fulfillment of Charities Law, especially financial law: http://www.oscr.org.uk/ Pooled investment- include mutual funds. A range of other pooled investment vehicles is available in the UK, including open-ended investment companies and \u2018investment trusts\u2019. These are not operated via a trust structure in the legal sense but as companies. Public Companies/Limited Companies - Public Companies issues stock to the general public and thus ownership of the company is non-exclusive and its value tends to be determined by the interaction of supply and demand for its shares. Limited Companies, on the other hand, are owned by an individual or specific individuals. Owners and managers of the company have the power to influence the share price directly by making ownership of the company's shares available to specific individuals for specific reasons. Pooled Fund/Pooling - the combination of individual investments into a singular pool (e.g. bespoke and thematic funds) indicating that they may have the same conditions and aims Rhetorical Demagoguery- rhetorical practice can apply to the deliberate dissemination of misinformation. Demagoguery is the practice of lying to citizens and stakeholders to gain their support long enough to allow the demagogue the space to consolidate power or destroy competition. Thus rhetorical demagoguery is associated to greenwash, where students are manipulated into believing falsehoods or the wrong kinds of objectives as important or desirable. Risk - the likelihood of failure to achieve predicted and required returns from investment. Higher rates of risk are sometimes associated with higher rates of returns. Risk Management - Ethical Investment is potentially more risky when it comes to returns from investemnt. Under Accounting and Reporting by Charities - Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) trustees are required to make a statement confirming that:\"..the major risks to which the charity is exposed, as identified by the trustees, have been reviewed and systems have been established to manage those risks.\" There are four basic strategies that can be applied to an identified risk: 1) transferring the financial consequences to third parties or sharing it (eg insurance, outsourcing); 2) avoiding the activity giving rise to the risk completely (eg a potential grant or contract not taken up); 3) management or mitigation of risk; or 4) it can be accepted (eg assessed as an inherent risk that cannot be avoided if the activity is to continue). Investment risk falls into different categories: 1) Governance risks \u2013 eg inappropriate organisational structure, difficulties recruiting trustees with relevant skills, conflict of interest; 2) Operational risks- eg service quality and development, contract pricing, employment issues; health and safety issues; fraud and misappropriation; 3) Financial risks- eg accuracy and timeliness of financial information, adequacy of reserves and cash flow, diversity of income sources, investment management; 4) External risks- eg public perception and adverse publicity, demographic changes, government policy; 5) Compliance with law and regulation- eg breach of trust law, employment law, and regulatory requirements of particular activities such as fund-raising or the running of care facilities. Screening - the process of including (positive screening) or excluding (negative screening) certain types of companies or sectors from an investment universe. Sin stocks - investments that are universally recognized as problematic or inherently unethical, e.g. tobacco, arms. Investment by universities in sin stocks thus provides massive leverage for a campaign to encourage change. Short Termism - the problem of myopia, or the inability to take the needs of the future adequately into account. Financial markets traditionally operate on a 3-5 year term , implying the need to maximise returns within that time frame. Shareholders - One that owns or holds a share or shares of stock; a stockholder. Also called shareowner. Short termism - is explained by a) Competition: competitive pressures for immediate returns to investment force profit maximisation in the short term b) Discounting: future value, returns, costs and benefits are 'worth' less to organisations than current ones because the future is uncertain, intangible and need to account for inflation, and they are thus discounted at a rate that tries to account for this by equating the future value to the current value. 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT(sri) Stakeholders - One who has an interest in the performance and operation of an organization. University stakeholders include trustees, alumni, students, staff and indirect employees. statement of investment policy principles (SIP)- Tilting- bias that an investment fund can have for certain types of investment. E.g. investments can be tilted towards investment in renewables, community investments, etc. This is a more thorough and comprehesive type of positive and negative screening. Time Horizons - Investment decision-making is also concerned with varying time horizons depending upon the investment involved. Pension fund investments in particular are intended to yield returns at some considerable distance into the future. It is therefore necessary when assessing investment decision making against legal standards to have regard to the expected long-term performance of investments where the fund involved demands a return on investment over an extended horizon Thematic Fund - a fund that is managed and developed to align with certain types of particular values. Common 'Themes' are Climate Change Funds, Utility Funds, banking funds. Tracker Fund - these types of funds track certain trends defined by the investor to give them more control over the investment. It is rel Transvaluation of values - the substitution of certain types of values within a system for others. Systems evolve, adapt and develop by continually developing their guiding principles and ideologies a trust - fund is insulated from the sponsoring employer, preventing the assets of the fund being made available to creditors if the sponsoring institutional defaults on its debts. In the pension context, a trust is thus fundamentally a means of protecting beneficiaries, with the trustee in the role of independent custodian .As with occupational pensions, a trust structure insulates the assets of the fund from the entity that manages them. There are also certain tax benefits associated with the trust structure. unit trusts- Mutual funds are known as \u2018unit trusts\u2019 in the UK. VALUE-DRIVEN AND VALUES-DRIVEN INVESTMENT-ESG considerations are capable of affecting investment decision-making in two distinct ways: they may affect the financial value to be ascribed to an investment as part of the decision-making process and they may be relevant to the objectives that investment decision-makers pursue. Value- following the correct process Value Neutral - a decision or investment which by its nature tends to be amoral (i.e. outside of morality). Bonds and equities are arguably value neutral because they are very traditional and have limited direct impacts. Vested Interests - indicates reasons that would prevent certain types of change because, for example, 'turkeys don't vote for Christmas'. Volatility - a measure of changeability and thus 'uncertainty' of a fund or share price, sometimes given as a percentage change in value over time. Weighting - the amount of weight or relative importance placed on a certain type of investment for ethical or financial reasons, which takes into account quantifiable and unquantifiable importance.Ethical Investment Wiki Renewable Capital, L.P.

If you don't know much about EI, this page should help you get a good grasp of the basic issues, as well as the arguments and supporting evidence for EI. If you want to add a question and/or answer, please do! Edit this page and type the question as a heading with the answer underneath. Please remember to try and include references for facts that you cite. (We are aware that this is lacking in the answers already there! This will be corrected over time, and if you can add some yourself then please do so.) If you'd like to ask any questions about this page, please visit the talk page, which can be reached by clicking the \"discussion\" tab above.What is EI?  Ethical Investment is simply the screening of an individual's or institution's investments for ethical criteria. This might involve measures like refusing to invest in arms companies, refusing to invest in companies with a history of human rights abuses, or choosing to invest in companies doing positive work in the Majority World.Why EI?  Ethical investment is untertaken in order to make financial transactions and investments accountable to everyone involved. By accountability, effects can be measured and assesed and then bad effects can be identified and reduced, while good effects and be encouraged. 'Justice', therefore, is the goal fo EI. Moreover, there is more to EI than merely reforming a financial system to attempt to account for other types of longer term or social and environmental costs. For example,in his Rules for Radicals, Alinsky outlines his strategy in organizing, writing, Thus whether EI 'works' or not in bringing about 'social and environmental justice' is not the only issue. If it increases awarness of the problesm and deepens democratic processes, then it is good for everyone: both the investors and the recipients of investment.What are the criticisms of EI?  *Marxist: Capitalism has inherent contradictions between labour and capital, and any attempt to resolve these within capitalism are merely reproducing capitalism due to its inherently bourgeoise nature. For example, companies cannot begin to become ethical becasue they necessarily demand short term profit maximisation. *Anarchist: EI is working with the system rather than creating alternatives outside the system. The result will be co-option of any radical agenda and the subversion of the aim of 'social and environmental justice'. Exploitation and class division will become more entrenched as the perception of 'authentic change' is created, while in reality , being disavowed. *Neoliberal: EI distorts the market and thus produces 'inefficiency' becasue there will be friction between resource allocation and demandWhere Did the Idea Come From?  Dating back to the nineteenth century, ethical investment\u2019s roots can be found among religious movements including the Quakers and Methodists, whose concerns included issues such as temperance and fair employment conditions. At the beginning of the 1900s, the Methodist Church began investing in the stock market, consciously avoiding companies involved in alcohol and gambling. During the twentieth century, more churches, charities and individuals began to take account of ethical criteria when making investment choices. Alinsky is often credited with laying the foundation for the grassroots political organizing that dominated the 1960s.[3] Later in his life he While his grassroots style took hold in American activism, his call to stock holders to share their power with disenfranchised working poor only began to take hold in U.S. progressive circles in the 1990s, when shareholder actions were organized against American corporations. Initially America was more advanced in developing the ethical investment ideology- for example in the 60's the activist Saul Alinsky encouraged stockholders in public corporations to lend their votes to \"proxies\", who would vote at annual stockholders meetings in favor of social justice. Then in 1971 the Pax World Fund was set up which avoided investments associated with the Vietnam War. The apartheid regime in South Africa accelerated the promotion of ethical investment in the 1980s. In 1983 [www.eiris.org/ EIRIS] was established as the UK\u2019s first independent research service in ethical investment. [www.friendsprovident.co.uk/ Friends Provident] launched the UK\u2019s first ethically screened unit trust a year later.How do endowment investments link universities with the global economy?  Endowment investment decisions are an expression of universities\u2019 financial values and priorities. Unniversities that own stocks in corporations have shareholder rights and responsibilities, including the right to engage in constructive dialogue with corporate executives as well as to vote and introduce shareholder resolutions, which are included in corporations\u2019 annual proxy statements.What are shareowner resolutions?  Shareowner resolutions provide a formal process for shareowners to request information and/or policy changes in corporations in which they invest. There are hundreds of shareowner resolutions submitted every year dealing with environmental, social and governance issues.Are there any precedents of EI by other institutional investors?  Engaged shaerowners represent a broad spectrum of institutional investors. Mutual Funds: In response to an SEC ruling in 2003, all mutual funds and investment managers are now required to have proxy voting policies and to disclose how they vote on each proxy question. Private and Public Pension Funds: These funds have an impressive record as engaged shareholders\u2014not only in voting their proxies, but also, in some cases, by initiating dialogues with corporate managers and by sponsoring shareholder resolutions. Public pension funds that have taken leading roles in introducing shareholder resolutions include those from California, Connecticut, Maine, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Oregon and Vermont. Private pension funds are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). An ERISA interpretive bulletin affirms the rights of fiduciaries to utilize proxy voting and other forms of shareholder engagement to protect the value of their investments: \u201cThe fiduciary act of managing plan assets that are shares of corporate stock includes the voting or proxies appurtenant to those shares of stock.\u201d Foundations: Some leading foundations including the Boston Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Nathan Cummings Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund have adopted active proxy voting policies. Religious Institutions: The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is the leading coordinator of shareowner engagement for it 275 faith-based institutional investors. Its members include national denominations, religious communities, pension funds, endowments, hospital corporations, economic development funds and publishing companies. For the 2006 proxy season, ICCR members filed 256 shareholder resolutions.How are Ethical Criteria Chosen?  Ideally in a consultative, participatory process involving, for example, a survey of the entire student body about options for investing. For details about what actual criteria are possible, see The Choice of Criteria in Ethical InvestmentIs shareowner engagement legal for institutional investors?  A recent report by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, the world's third largest law firm, emphasizes the importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues to the investment decision-making process. The 2005 report was prepared for the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative. Paul Watchman, Partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and senior author of the study, commented: \"The report confirms that a number of the perceived limitations on the integration of ESG issues into investment decision-making are illusory. Far from preventing the integration of ESG considerations, the law clearly permits and, in certain circumstances, requires that this be done. This legal interpretation has far-reaching implications for the institutional investment community worldwide.\"Who is Doing This?  Just as a few examples: New York City has $60 billion pension funds invested ethically. Local councils in Britain with EI policies include ones in Devon, Hampshire, London, Croydon, and Edinburgh. Universities with EI policies either already in place or in the process of being implemented include individual Oxbridge colleges, Edinburgh, York, East Anglia, Stanford and Harvard. the School of Oriental and African Studies in London recently withdrew investments from the arms trade in response to staff pressure. Companies such as BP now invest in renewable sources of energy because of pressure from their shareholders, and the major pension fund for University academics, the USS, holds \u00a319 billion and employs the most progressive ethical investment policy in Britain.Is EI Profitable?  This, of course, is a really important question, so let's give it a bit of time here. For a great, but technoical overview, see THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ETHICAL INVESTMENT FUNDS. Some people worry that a restricted universe (that is, restricting the number of possible companies you can invest in) necessarily means a higher risk investment. However, this is currently an area of much academic interest, with a good deal of theory arguing that EI can be just as proftable, if not more profitable, than ordinary investment. There is both theoretical and empirical evidence for this. As a starting example, the FTSE4Good index is the top 100 UK companies that conform to certain ethical criteria. Since the FTSE4Good index was founded, it has outperformed the FTSE index. Another fine example is the Jupiter Ecology Fund which has grown in value by 135% since its inception. Some of the reasons why this might be so include the following:Are there any relevant case studies of successful EI?  Increasingly, both through government legislation and through consumer pressure, companies are being forced to consider their own ethics. Ethical investment especially on a grand and public scale, is a really effective way of letting companies know that their corporate behaviour is not only a moral but also a financial matter for them to consider. So as well as empowering individuals to distance themselves from shady corporate practice, ethical investment has great power as a consumer movement. Check out the page 'Sharholder Actions' that show what engagement can acheive. 1) The Subprime Meltdown and SRI: Engage, Avoid, Predict Shareowner activists engaged banks on predatory lending long before the subprime crisis climaxed, and SRI research predicted the meltdown in time to avoid some impacts. http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi?sfArticleId=2366 Retrieved from \"http://ei.wikia.com/wiki/EI_Guide_Notes_Page\"Ethical Investment Wiki Investment policy for endowment funds Policy  1. Introduction The University Court of the University of St Andrews holds a modest amount of Endowment Assets. These funds have largely been provided for specific purposes. This paper sets out the investment policy for these assets. This policy is subject to regular review by the Investment and Collections Committee on behalf of the University Court. The University has previously adopted a traditional arms length approach to investment managers placing discretion and responsibility in all matters associated with individual stock selection to its appointed investment managers while placing reliance on those managers Socially Responsible Investment Policies. Following engagement with the Student body the University accepts that in making investment decisions the University should have regard to the promotion of socially responsible behaviours and sustainability. This policy has been developed in partnership with the active student body with the intention of moving the investment policy to one in which sustainable and ethical issues are taken into account alongside financial issues by investment managers in individual stock selection issues. Responsibility for governance of these arrangements rests with the University Court which it discharges by way of the Investments and Collections Committee. 2. Needs of the Funds As at 31 July 2006, the University held around \u00a336million of endowment funds, of which around 94% had been given for specific purposes. In devising an investment policy therefore, the primary purpose that the University Court needs to support is the generation of sufficient income to meet the specific purposes for which the funding was given to the University. The specific funds largely provide for three main core areas of spending \u2013 support for specific academic chairs, provisions of scholarships and bursaries and a group of other specific funds which include, book and prize funds, travel bursaries and other causes. In general terms the University believes that to support the primary purpose of the funds that it needs to achieve an above inflation (based on UK RPI) of 4% per annum. This general need is measured against a periodic (every 3 to 5 years) cash flow modelling exercise which is used to support a review of the Asset Allocation Strategy. 3. Ongoing donations Ongoing donations are used in accordance with donor\u2019s wishes. Those gifts that are given to produce income to support general or specific income will be invested in support of the asset allocation strategy prevalent at the time. Those gifts that are given to be spent on a specific purpose will be done so in the year of giving. Those gifts that are given for the general benefit of the University will be used in the year of gift on purposes which will be determined by the University. Currently such income is used to support the provision of scholarships and bursaries for students. 4. Authority to Invest The University Court derives its authority to invest funds from Ordnance No. 119 \u2018Additional Regulations as to the administration and finances of the University\u2019 which provides for wide ranging powers to enter into financial transactions and arrangements. The University Court is also content to place reliance on a report commissioned by the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) commissioned a report in the area of investment decisions taking into account environmental, social and governance issues from legal firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. The University is satisfied that this report indicates that it is entitled to take into account wider issues which are aligned with the interests of the funds stakeholders, as long as the approach to investment continues to involve a high degree of professional expertise and there is diversification in the asset base taking into account due regard for items of risk and return. 5. Asset Allocation Strategy To be completed on conclusion of process and agreement on action \u2013 will outline allocation of assets between asset classes and territorial boundaries if appropriate. Will also highlight heritable properties held in StA. 6. Investment Criteria The University believes that in investing its funds, regard must be made to social, environmental and governance issues. In line with its general strategic direction, the University believes that its investments should mirror its own desire to be sustainable and promote sustainability. Appointed asset managers are therefore expected to encourage good behaviour or discourage poor behaviour through screening of investments, either positively or negatively or through direct engagement with firms. In making investment decisions the University expects its appointed managers to consider, the following areas (this list should not be considered as exhaustive; While operating within these criteria, appointed investment managers are left at their discretion to select individual stocks and to operate within their own Socially Responsible Investment Policy. The appointed manager will be accountable to the University in terms of financial performance and adherence to commitments made on issues of social responsibility and sustainability. The appointed manager will also be expected to discuss issues around social responsibility and sustainability with the investments advisory committee. 7. Investment Manager(s) To be completed on appointment providing details of the manager, agreed performance targets, portfolio / product structure, possibly details of spread levels, expense and charge rates and dates of formal agreements. This section would also detail the actual method of achieving the investment criteria i.e. inclusion / exclusion or engagement which would be defined in the investment mandate. 8. Fund Performance Investment manager(s) will be expected to report to the Investment & Collections Committee in writing and in person periodically in line with the needs of the Committee. Investment manager(s) shall meet with the Sustainable Investment Advisory Committee (being a sub committee to the Investment and Collections Committee with remit outlined in Annex A) in relation to the investment criteria and stock selections. The University would expect any appointed investment manager to support the development of this policy in conjunction with the investments advisory committee, particularly with regard to transparency and definition of sustainability issues.Investments Advisory Committee  1. Purpose The University has established an investment policy which has its heart consideration of issues relating to positive behaviours in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) alongside requirements to generate funding for primary purposes. In support of this the University recognises that it will need to supplement its ongoing Committee structure to provide additional monitoring of the ESG aspects of its investment policy. For this reason it has created an Investments Advisory Committee as a sub group of the Investments & Collections Committee. This Committee will be established initially on an informal basis until the working arrangements and their effectiveness can be trialed and tested. 2. Membership It is important that this Committee has the opportunity to mirror, as far as possible, the elements of the University Community. It is therefore proposed that up to 3 members be permitted from each of the following constituencies: Court, University Management, Students, Staff and Alumni. The Committee would meet, either in public, or with public and private sessions on at least a twice yearly basis, following receipt of investment managers\u2019 reports with the investment managers invited to attend on an annual or bi-annual basis. The Committee will be chaired either by the Convener of the Investments and Collections Committee or by a members of University Management. 3. Remit The proposed remit for this Committee would be:Ethical Investment Wiki University of St Andrews Current Status  The University, is currently implementing an Ethical Investment Strategy in consultation with Specialist Financial Managers and the EI Campaigners.Timeline The Campaign So Far  The campaign launched with an attack on student consciousness \u2013 raising the level of awareness about the issue of Ethical Investment, and what it meant to the University. Campaigners from the One World Society, and the Students\u2019 Association, worked together to organise a student Referendum in the Union. On the day of the Referendum, the turnout was huge \u2013 greater than there had been for a referendum in St Andrews before. Nearly 1200 students cast their vote, and the motion was carried with an astounding 91% majority! Students do care about ethics, after all. Following this, the Union adopted an ethical investment stance, committing themselves to investing ethically and actively supporting the campaign to convince the University to do the same. Returning after the summer, the campaign gained a new coordinator, a new team, and a new direction for October of 2003. The focus \u2013 to get the University to be transparent in its investments \u2013 to tell us where the money was going. Dialogue with the University body, and specifically with the Quaestor and Factor, eventually led to the University agreeing to publish a list of companies in which its \u2018endowments fund\u2019 invests. That\u2019s the money set aside for student grants and scholarships, made up largely of alumni donations, and also comprising surplus accommodation and tuition fees, the fund is invested on behalf of and for the benefit of the students at the University. Meanwhile, the Students\u2019 Union, along with the Ethical Investment campaigners, had been meeting with various banks, exploring the possibility of transferring its own savings into an ethical account. The Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u2018ethical\u2019 account was fixed upon, and the Union\u2019s \u00a31million was transferred. Following much logistical organising, and continual dialogue with the University (and a new EI campaign coordinator), the University finally published a list of its investments online \u2013 transparency was achieved! You can look at the investments here. Along with transparency, came a written commitment to the development of an ethical investment policy for the University. Progress, it seemed, was being made. A year of talks with the University ensued. After what the campaign saw as much stalling, it was decided to hold a demonstration in order to show student support for the camapaign and push for a speeding up of the process. The demonstration was seen by the campaign as a massive success, and the University thereafter began to demonstrate a new attitude towards EI, showing real commitment to co-operation. In a working group with the Director of Finance, the campaign worked to produce a policy document which could be presented to the Investment and Collections Committee. This document made recommendations regarding EI, and laid out the route towards shifting University investments into an ethical portfolio. The document was accepted by the Committee, and then later by University Court, and the campaign, along with University officials, is working on following its recommendations. Following this endorsement by the Investments Committee and University Court, the working group pursued with more research into financial and legal positions and corporate benchmarking. A period of extensive consultation also began. The Director of Finance wrote articles for staff and alumni magazines explaining the position, promoting the research being done into forumulating a policy, and asking for feedback. A period of re-engagement with the student body also began and on March 16th alongside student association elections, an opinion poll was conducted asking students their views on ethical investment. 87% of students voted in favour of ethical investment, with a majority also opting to, if necessary, accept a small financial risk in return for such a policy. With a final policy supported by students, staff and alumni, and then endorsed by the Investments Committee and University Court in June, only the final step remains: chosing a sutible new fund manager and then moving the money. Fund manager interviews will now take place in September 2007; potential managers will be interviewed by a panel including the University Director of Finance, a member from the Investments Committee, the Students Association President, *and*, a representative from our campaign, a fantastic success! Check out the St Andrews Sustainable Investment PolicyEthical Investment Wiki Campaign case studies  Everyone's experience of EI campaigning is different. Some institutions are really receptive and keen to clean up their investment act, while others have been known to try every trick in the book in order to avoid the issue. This section of the EI Wiki allows you to read other people's stories of EI campaigning, which is a great resource if you're just getting started, but also fantastic to compare with if you're a seasoned campaigner.EI Stories Ethical Investment Wiki St Andrews Sustainable Investment Policy  This policy was the result of a year of negotiations with the University, and represents an agreement that all were happy with. It adopts the tactic of making a list of principles to which St Andrews's fund managers must subscribe. These include general aims, like \"\", and very specific principles, like \"\". This tactic, while guaranteeing some ethicality, avoids a simple set of fund restrictions, with the aim on allowing fund managers the flexibility to use the funds to engage with corporations for change. This means that a lot of responsibility lies in choosing the right fund manager -- to this end, we ensured that a campaign member would be on the selection team. The second strand of the policy was to form an Investments Advisroy Committee with a wide membership, which would monitor the progress of the funds. This ensures that the funds continue to work ethically, and the fund manager is doing eir job, and that the lines of communication with the student body remain open -- overall, it ensures that the policy keeps on going and is a living document, rather than a piece of paper sitting in a file somewhere. Read the policy hereEthical Investment Wiki London School of Economics  An EI campaign has been running this academic year at LSE with student support, but School are still to respond as of yet. In October 2006 the Union General Meeting passed a motion on divestment from the arms trade, specifically from 14 arms companies in which it had been found LSE was invested. The exact wording of the motion can be found below. The motion was taken to the School's Investment Sub-Committee on 20th November by Joel Kenrick, the SU Treasurer and was scheduled for further discussion at the next meeting of the committee. However, unfortunately this meeting has been postponed due to a staff resignation, so the campaign has somewhat had its hands tied over the last few months on this particular front. However, another divestment campaign has been growing in the meantime at LSE, specifically relating to the current situation in Sudan. At the beginning of 2007, another motion was (almost unanimously) passed by the UGM, calling on the School and the SU to divest in those companies which meet the 'Sudan Divestment UK' guidelines. Again, the full details of the motion can be found below. Therefore it looks like these campaigns could be entering a crucial, and difficult, stage now - namely persuading the school that these policies really are viable and for them to incorporate them into their investment strategies asap. However, it looks like things are slowly moving, with the school having agreed to a meeting of the Investments Sub-Committee towards the beginning of next term at which the issue of ethical investments, including Sudan divestment, will be discussed. It seems that the challenge now is to raise awareness and mobilise student and staff support through demos, petitions, student media, events, stalls - anything really! This could prove to be challenging during exam term, when everyone at LSE has a tendecy of chaining themselves to the library... we'll keep you posted! Arms Trade Motion Union notes: 1. LSE has received funding to the sum of \u00a3125,295.00 from two of the following companies: BAE Systems, EADS, GKN, Lockheed Martin, Thales Groups, Boeing, Cobham, Finmeccanica/Augusta Westland, Qinetiq, Smith Group, Rolls Royce, VT Group and DSTL. Union believes: 1. That the arms trade causes devastation and pain across the world 2. That the LSE has a moral obligation to divest in and not accept donations from those dealing in this trade Union resolves: 1. To ensure that the SU does not invest in or accept donations from the following companies: BAE Systems, EADS, GKN, Lockheed Martin, Thales Groups, Boeing, Cobham, Finmeccanica/Augusta Westland, Qinetiq, Smiths Group, Rolls Royce, VT Group and DSTL. 2. To lobby the school so that it will no longer invest in or accept donations from the following companies: BAE Systems, EADS, GKN, Lockheed Martin, Thales Groups, Boeing, Cobham, Finmeccanica/Augusta Westland, Qinetiq, Smiths Group, Rolls Royce, VT Group and DSTL. 3. To announce this policy on the global email 4. To press release this policy to local and regional press 5. To mandate the Environment and Ethics Officer to report back to the UGM on the policy\u2019s progress after two weeks Sudan Divestment Motion Union Notes: 1. That the LSESU has submitted a paper to the School requesting the adoption of a Socially Responsible Investment policy. Union Believes: 1. That the ethical consequences of colleges' investments are an issue of mounting concern to LSE students. 2. That targeted divestment is a powerful method of influencing the Sudanese government. 3. That it is incumbent upon the rest of the world and LSE in particular, to do everything possible in order to facilitate the end of the genocidal killing of civilians and the restoration of peace and security to the Darfur region. 4. That there is a humanitarian crisis occurring in the Darfur region in the Sudan, a humanitarian crisis that has killed over 400,000 civilians since February 2003 and 2.5 million people have been displaced. 5. That foreign investment has been of great importance in enabling the heavily indebted Sudanese government to finance its military policy of genocide. 6. That the last reliable source of information indicated that University bodies held a large amount of stocks in companies which meet guidelines for divestment by 'Sudan Divestment UK[1]. 7. In the United States many Ivy League universities, including Columbia, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania implement Socially Responsible Investment policies, often through an Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investment. Union Resolves: 1. To call for the School to divest from those companies identified as meeting the 'Sudan Divestment UK' guidelines on Sudanese divestment following a review of the holdings of the School. 2. For the LSESU to divest from those companies identified as meeting the 'Sudan Divestment UK' guidelines on Sudanese divestment. 3. To call for the School and its affiliates to make a statement of its intention not only to divest but to refrain from investing in any companies which meet the 'Sudan Divestment UK' guidelines until the situation in the Darfur has been resolved. 4. For the Executive Committee of LSESU to actively pursue the issue through meetings with the relevant administrative bodies. ________________________________ [1] Sudan Divestment UK judges a company to be suitable for divestment if they: a. Contribute to government revenue, b. Impart minimal benefit to disadvantaged citizens that are typically located in the geographic periphery of Sudan, and c. Have demonstrated no substantial corporate governance policy regarding the situation in Darfur.Ethical Investment Wiki EI Logo  [[Image:]]This is all important--for use on letters, papers, publicity, and everything possible!

Disarm UCL campaign victory On 1 January 2009 UCL adopted an ethical investment policy Click here for the policy This is a great victory for student campaigners at UCL. However we believe that the policy should have gone further. Click here on why we think UCL did not go far enough Brief history of the Disarm UCL campaign In 2006, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the Campaign Against the Arms Trade [1], UCL disclosed that it had a total of \u00a31,591,627 invested in two multi-national arms companies, Cobham and the Smiths Group, making it the largest known university investor in the UK. Both of these companies profit significantly from the sales of military products such as components for Eurofighter, Joint Strike Fighter, Hawk jets, Apache helicopters and F-16s. Both also predominantly export arms which due to the deregulation of the arms trade are sold to regimes without regard to human rights records including Turkey, Indonesia and Israel, as well as regions of conflict world-wide. disarmUCL was set up to campaign for UCL to divest from arms companies and adopt an ethical investment policy. Our campaign was based on widespread student and staff opposition to the investments, their detrimental affect on UCL\u2019s reputation, and the evidence that ethical investment is a financially viable alternative that is in many ways more secure due to the heavily-subsidized and unstable nature of the arms industry. In May 2007 the Smiths Group sold its Aerospace Division which contained the bulk of its military-related production. Consequently, disarmUCL focused solely on the Cobham shares worth over \u00a3900,000, but which have since decreased in market value showing the volatility of the global arms industry. The campaign successfully secured the support of UCL Union and ultimately met with the provost Malcolm Grant in June 2007, following which UCL Council announced that it would pursue ethical investment, setting up a working group to develop a policy. disarmUCL welcomes this commitment and this year will continue to campaign for immediate divestment from Cobham and an ethically responsible UCL. UP IN ARMS AT UCL disarmUCL was set up in November 2006 following the disclosure of UCL\u2019s direct investments in the arms trade. The campaign consisted from the outset of a broad and diverse group of students, staff and alumni, including many from existing UCLU student societies including Amnesty, People & Planet, Stop the War, MedSin and Friends of Palestine. We also had the support of student media including London Student and The Cheesegrater. The campaign so far has used a diversity of tactics, one of the most key being the petition (on paper, web and via text) which got over 1,200 signatures. The alumni network instigated a letter writing campaign. Alongside this conventional lobbying we also put on a gig with the Live Music society and arranged stunts on campus which attracted coverage from the International Herald Tribune [2], Camden New Journal, Peace News, The Times Higher Education Supplement, The Independent (Higher Education Supplement)[3] ,the Guardian Comment is Free website [4] and the New Statesman website [5]. Our overall strategy was to build a broad grass-roots campaign that mobilised campus-wide antipathy to UCL\u2019s arms invesments and highlighted the hypocrisy of UCL\u2019s claims to be a \u2018global\u2019 university with a history of liberalism and social justice while investing in the global arms trade. The success of disarmUCL in obtaining a commitment to the adoption of an ethical investment policy from UCL has been due to the hard work and creativity of ordinary students, staff and alumni.Ethical Investment Wiki Community Portal The General Plan Immediate Jobs  Any volunteers?In the Future Ethical Investment Wiki Mistral Windfarms  Website: http://www.mistralinvest.com/mistralenergy/concept.htmlInvestors Ethical Investment Wiki Links page Welcome  This is your portal to other EI resources.

An article was printed in the student paper Nouse by a member of People & Planet, and the ethical investment campaign was launched. In December a motion was passed in the Students Union. Enacted by the motion, Union President Mickey Armstrong raised the issue with the Vice-Chancellor Brian Cantor but no progress was made. In March 2006 People & Planet sought the help of other societies to get the campaign moving.Coalition Action  At the start summer term plans were made for a petition and a large scale campaign on campus. Seperate meetings were held weekly with involvement from People & Planet, FreeSoc, Amnesty International Society, Student Action for Palestine, Speak and a number of independent students. Articles were printed in York Vision (\"You're Cantor Productive\", 9th May) and Nouse (Student Outrage at Arms Shares, May 23rd) resulting in the letters being sent to the Vice-Chancellor. The next step was a mass day of action. http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~socs203/resources/die_in_photos/154358581_fba70da525.jpg http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~socs203/resources/die_in_photos/154381071_710aead9f9.jpg More photos here.Follow Up  Following day of action the Registrar/Secretary set up a working group to contruct an Ethical Investment Policy. The registrar has raised the issue with the Chancellor Greg Dyke, who was said to be supportive. The protest and campaign was reported in the local paper. Since then the working group has been meeting to discuss construction of the policy. Currently the group is devising a proposal based around the work of St Andrews One World Society. Initially the group was confident it could submit a proposal for Fincance Committee to approve before Christmas but progress has been hampered by involved students graduating and a general loss of momentum.Sudan Raises the Issue  In March 2007, Amnesty International Society raised the issue once again by submitting and passing Union policy on Sudan Divestment.

I am delighted that UCL has committed to the adoption of an ethical investment policy. I am pleased that the university seems eager to further its commitment both to social responsibility and to listening to and engaging with the wishes of students. I urge you to continue this commendable approach by ensuring that the rest of the ethical investment policy process is transparent and accessible to students and to alumni and in particular that the views of and feedback to the latter are disseminated through UCL Alumni Network channels. I call for equal student representation on the ethical review committee, ensuring that two members of the committee are members of the student body. Further, the review committee should be obliged to report publicly on its work on a regular basis, and these reports should be widely published to students via UCL Union and to alumni via the alumni newsletter. This information should include the procedure on how to raise ethical concerns with the review committee and who the members are. I would also like to urge you to consider including the possibility of positive investments in the future ethical investment policy in industries and companies which support and further UCL\u2019s mission to \u201cengage fully with the world around us\u201d, to break new ground through challenging convention\u201d and to \u201cprogress through partnership\u201d. My own decision to originally apply to study at UCL was due to its historical association as the first to admit students regardless of race, class, religion and gender. I remain proud of this and believe that if it could also establish a reputation for being a true leader in the field of ethical investment, it would encourage a sharp rise in the next generation of applicants. The benefits of UCL being seen around the world not just as \u2018the global university\u2019 but also \u2018the ethical university\u2019 seem boundless, To do this UCL will need a commitment to positive investment as mission-related investment is becoming increasingly popular among UK charitable institutions. I would like to highlight the fact that the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, writing in the International Herald Tribune on 10 November has said that the answer to the financial crises and climate change is the green economy, which will expand at an exponential rate I would consider some investments in this field as being an excellent way of ensuring that UCL continues to 'shape the future' through its investments as well as through academic excellence. Finally, I would like to see the ethical investment policy exclude any type of investment in arms-producing companies; therefore not not only investments in arms-producing companies held directly but also those investments via managed or pooled funds. Despite UCL\u2019s great progress I am still dismayed at the ongoing investment in Cobham plc. I am afraid as long as these investments continue and UCL fails to make it clear that it will not invest in arms-producing companies in the future, I will be unable to support UCL financially or otherwise.I assure you that many of my fellow ex-UCL students with whom I have spoken about this also share this view. I look forward to your response to these concerns, and to the implementation of an ethical investment policy that will allow me to restore my pride in my old university and for which I otherwise feel such a close affinity.

Ethical Investment Wiki Resolution To Congregation  The following Resolution was submitted to Oxford University's Congregation (the University's highest decision-making body) in May 2006. It was accepted without amendment by University Council, and so a meeting of Congregation was not required. See Oxford University for the full story. Congregation believes: (i) That the University should consider the social, moral and environmental impact of its investment decisions alongside concerns for the maximization of financial returns. (ii) That Oxford University should agree a credible Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) policy. (iii) That a credible SRI policy will take into account the impact of the actions of companies on all stakeholders, and will be backed up by a strategy for engagement or screening (divestment). Congregation notes: (i) That the University Investment Committee manages over \u00a3400m of University and college funds and endowments (through the Trusts Pool). (ii) That the sole social consideration currently included in University Investment policy states that the Investment Committee should 'instruct fund managers to pursue the adoption of the core principles contained within [the Good Corporation Charter], when speaking to companies in which they are investing'. (iii) That the Good Corporation Charter (GCC) is a voluntary Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) tool for self-assessment that gives no consideration to stakeholders other than a company's shareholders and employees. It therefore fails to constitute a credible approach to Socially Responsible Investment (SRI). (iv) That adopting a Socially Responsible Investment policy does not involve sacrificing financial returns. Recent studies have shown no difference between the overall performance of funds with SRI criteria as against non-SRI funds, and many SRI funds outperform the non-SRI average. Congregation further notes: (i) There are a wide range of effective mechanisms for implementing a credible Socially Responsible Investment policy, and incorporating and balancing social, moral and environmental criteria alongside financial considerations. These include the selection of specific ethically managed funds, the screening of investments based on accepted industry standards such as the FTSE4Good Index or the use of customized ethical portfolio management software from organizations such as the Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRiS). (ii) In the UK, SOAS, UEA and Edinburgh Universities, and the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) have implemented SRI policies without financial detriment. SRI policies have also been adopted in the United States by many Ivy League Universities including Columbia, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania. Congregation resolves to mandate the University Council to: (i) Seek advice from independent consultants on the range of SRI options available and their financial implications. (ii) On the basis of this advice, develop a clear and credible Socially Responsive Investment policy setting out standards that specifically take into account the impact of company behaviour on all stakeholders and the environment. (iii) Bring forward a resolution to establish a Joint Committee on Socially Responsible Investment, with junior and senior representatives of the University community. This committee should periodically review and assess the university's investments against its defined SRI policy and make recommendations to University Council and Investments Committee for future investment policy and decision-making. (iv) Publish suitable details of University Investments on an annual basis and report on the action that has been taken to ensure compliance with the SRI policy developed.

Website: http://www.konarka.comEthical Investment Wiki Oxford University  Apologies for the rather dry style - this is a direct extract from a dissertation on SRI! Background Oxford University is the oldest higher education institution in the UK. It is also one of the wealthiest, with an endowment valued at \u00a3558 million as of July 31st 2005 (Oxford University 2006a), which is managed separately from the individual College investments. External fund managers are overseen by the Investments Committee, which reports to University Council, the University\u2019s managing body. History of SRI at Oxford There may well have been earlier debates on SRI at Oxford University, but the current wave of interest \u2013 which has culminated in the creation of an SRI Committee \u2013 can be traced back at least to 2000/2001. In this academic year, partially inspired by the success of the Ethics for USS campaign and the tentative adoption of SRI principles by the University of East Anglia and Selwyn College, Cambridge, members of the Oxford University Student Union (OUSU) Ethics Committee put together a campaigning guide and template proposal for students wishing to push for SRI policies in their own Colleges. With support from students from across the campus and a few key academics, they also put pressure on the central University administration by raising the issue of SRI at the Joint Consultative Committee (JCC, the main formal point of contact between the University and OUSU). Following much discussion at the JCC and Investment Committee, in July 2004 \u201cCouncil agreed to endorse the approach contained within the Good Corporation Charter [GCC]\u201d; fund managers were to be instructed to take action in line with this decision (OUSU 2004). The GCC is a set of voluntary Corporate Responsibility principles (GoodCorporation 2006); in effect, the University was agreeing to a loose form of engagement with companies via its fund managers. By 2004, it was clear that student campaigners (organised again around OUSU and the Ethics Committee) felt that this approach was ineffective, and wished the University to adopt a more rigorous SRI policy. A proposal was submitted to JCC in November 2004 which claimed that the GCC \u201comits to cover a number of fundamental areas\u201d including \u201cthe impacts of a corporation\u2019s activities upon third parties\u201d; there was \u201cno process in place to either monitor or assure the effectiveness of the University\u2019s current approach\u201d, no mechanism for the University\u2019s investments to \u201ctend away from corporations whose actions it finds unacceptable\u201d, and no provision for the University to \u201cpursue active investment and vote against a company's board when its actions are inconsistent with the University's ethical commitments\u201d (OUSU 2004). Whilst the JCC had limited ability to act on this proposal, it sparked off a lively series of communications between OUSU and the University\u2019s Investments Committee; this included statements from Sir Alan Budd, the Chair of the latter body, in which he pointed out the difficulty of being a transparent or active shareholder when using tracker funds and the limits of his Committee\u2019s remit when it came to making ethical decisions (Budd 2005). The 2005/2006 Campaign The start of this academic year saw a rise in the profile of the campaign. A survey by Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT 2005), revealing that at least six Oxford colleges had significant holdings in arms companies, was used by on-campus campaigners to garner support for SRI. It is interesting to note that whilst communications between OUSU\u2019s Ethics Committee and the University continued to discuss SRI in the broadest sense, the publicity directed at students was focused on a few key, emotive issues: the arms trade, oppressive regimes, and environmental destruction. A leaflet distributed by the campaign asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your college got its cash in?\u201d above a picture of children fleeing from a tank. These recruitment tactics seemed to work; a student petition gathered over 5000 signatures in the first few weeks of Hilary Term, and a February 13th meeting of University Council where an SRI proposal paper from OUSU (OUSU 2006) was originally scheduled for discussion but then dropped from the agenda was accompanied by a noisy student protest outside. An alternative barometer of a segment of on-campus opinion is provided by Clark et al. (2006), who found a much greater interest in SRI amongst Oxford Geography undergraduates than amongst pension fund trustees. A debate on the issue in the Oxford Magazine led to the publication of an article by Robert Barrington, a member of F&C Asset Management\u2019s SRI team, in which he explained how the University could adopt SRI principles at very little cost by working to influence their existing fund managers (Barrington 2006). The University administration seemed less enthusiastic than the students. Council declined to consider OUSU\u2019s SRI proposal directly, instead passing it to an unpublicised working group of University officials for discussion without student representation. The report of this working group \u2013 which essentially claimed that the University was already doing all that it could on SRI \u2013 was eventually passed to Council on April 24th 2006 and approved; OUSU\u2019s original detailed proposal was not considered. The decision was then taken at a charged Ethics Committee meeting (at which I was present) to instead take the proposal to Congregation, the University\u2019s highest decision-making body - a gathering of Fellows from across the Colleges, with the power to overrule Council if necessary. The campaign then switched its tactics, targeting Fellows to gather support for a formal Resolution; when the requisite 30 signatures were gained from academics, and the proposal duly tabled for 30th May 2006, Council decided \u2013 in contrast to its earlier position on SRI - to accept the motion rather than let it go to a vote at Congregation. In essence, by accepting the proposal the University agreed to: \u2022 Take action to develop a coherent SRI policy, using advice from independent SRI consultants \u2022 Establish a Committee on Socially Responsible Investment \u2022 Publish details of its investments and periodically report on its SRI progress Further discussions between the University and OUSU determined that the Committee should consist of one student representative, two academics (drawn from the list of Fellows who signed the Resolution), and two members of the administration. The Committee is due to first meet in October 2006, to decide its exact role and remit; quite how Oxford\u2019s SRI policy develops from here will depend on its deliberations. Thoughts and Conclusions Although the SRI proposal would not have gathered the support it did from students and Fellows without compelling arguments for its adoption, in the final analysis it seems to have been accepted by University Council for reasons of expediency rather than a wholehearted embracing of its position by the administration. The final form of the Policy therefore lies very much in the hands of the new Committee. The balance of power on this body seems to lie with SRI advocates, and that despite alleged antipathy to the idea of SRI amongst senior members of the administration, a fairly robust policy could be produced. However, if it is to be effective, consistent, and acceptable to the University administration, it will require extremely careful consideration, particularly as such a policy could also set an important national benchmark. Only one other of the UK\u2019s 50 wealthiest universities (Edinburgh) has an SRI Committee.

There are several aspects to this concept.Core concepts Investment  An investment is something that you give with the expectation that you will get something in return. Investments can take many forms. We invest our time into efforts that we appreciate. We invest our energy towards doing work that we either enjoy or that we feel will return something to us that we value. In the modern age, the term investment is most often used in discussions about money.Money  Money is a convienent fiction that we have created as a method of exchange. We get money for providing goods and services, and we trade that money for the goods and services of others. The more value we are able to provide to others for a good or service, the more money they will be willing to pay. And likewise, the more we value something, the more money we are willing to pay for it.Ethics  Everyone follows some kind of code of ethics, even if it not formally defined. These codes discuss concepts such as right, wrong, good, evil, and responsibility. The struggle to define what is ethical is defined by different ways of looking at these concepts. It often depends on upbringing, the prevaling culture, or life experiences that change our perceptions and definitions of what is right or wrong, good or evil, and what our responsibilities are in our world. Ethical Investment is a combination of all of these.Goals are also important  If we invest our money, and thus our time and energy, into a particular investment, we need to understand what our goal is for that investment. If the goal is simply to get the highest monetary return on the money that you put in, then the rate of return is the end all and be all of your investment research. However, if we can set additional goals that are at least as important as financial return, the potential for what we can do with our money actually increases, and can often make up for any potential opportunity cost by the way we feel about those investments.Types of ethical investments  The primary method of determining the ethical component in any investment decision is your own set of ethical values. These values contribute by providing questions that you can ask either yourself or the person/enterprise that is asking for your financial investment. Some examples: Once we explore the answers to questions like these, we need to make decisions about where our money will be going. This brings up even more questions. This wiki can be used to explore these questions and talk about our answers. We can help each other understand our values, our goals, and track the results of our decisions. Let's work together to make our world a better place.Ethical Investment Wiki Student letter eConsultation guide for local governments Main Page Local Council e-Consultation Guide  This is a guide for local councils to set up e-consultation, especially e-forums.eConsultation guide for local governments E-Forums: Step by step guide Step 1. Setting your aims for e-Consultation  Before you decide the best combination of e-tools you want to use, ask yourself: What is my aim for my e-Consultation? For example, your aims might be: Your aim will determine which e-Consultation tools you use. Forums, polls and surveys each achieve different aims and are best used in combination. This way you are giving people an option on how they get involved and you can use a poll to attract users to the forum or vice versa. You might decide for one issue to just run a forum, whereas for another where you want more specific feedback you might use polls in addition to a forum. Brisbane City Council uses a combination of tools for each of its consultations. See E-polls and surveys In contrast Darebin does not use polls at all at present preferring to have general discussion about issues. See Darebin E-Forum: a case model The below table is a rough guide matching your aims with e-consultation tools. You may want to consult with other areas of Council in determining your aims for the e-Forum.Step 2: Get Council staff support  You need Council staff support in order to run an e-Forum. You are going to want other Departments to come up with topics and co-moderate discussions on the Forum, and spread the word about the Forum to their networks. Ideas on how to engage other staff are listed below. i. Inform your fellow Council workers about the new e-Forum Work out what your e-Forum might be able to offer the other staff or Councillors in their work and then take the idea to them via: In your information and presentations to Council areas, you can use the E-Forums:FAQs to help staff understand the rationale for e-Forums. ii. Link the e-forum to Council\u2019s core business You can also present your e-Forum as part of Council\u2019s core business as: iii. Get a champion amongst the Councillors or senior executive of the Council It helps any project to have a champion amongst Councillors or senior executive, or an advocate in the community to push the e-Forum. In Darebin the policy area which got the e-Forum off the ground secured the support of a member of senior executive to push the Forum. The senior executive was educated by the policy area in the benefits and uses of the e-Forum and its links into Darebin\u2019s overall strategic direction and hence core business. He then championed the Forum with other Council departments and chairs the internal reference group for the e-Forum, lending the project weight and momentum. iv. Piggy-back on to existing Council consultations Find out which areas of Council are about to engage in public consultation and offer them the use of the e-Forum. v. Set up an internal reference group for the establishment of the e-forum Example: Darebin e-Forum project reference group Darebin established an internal project reference group for its e-Forum when it was in its pilot phase. The internal reference group comprises a representative from each Council department and is chaired by a member of the senior executive. This group meets from time to time to set the topics for the forum and discuss forum issues. It has been a successful strategy in engaging Council staff.Step 3. Engage Councillors  A champion amongst the Councillors would be of benefit to the forum project. You could present a similar case as above to the Councillors, presenting the benefits for Councillors as follows: Note: Councillors should be participants, not controllers of the forum. It has been found in experiences elsewhere of online consultations that the Council staff are best placed to run a discussion otherwise participants grow sceptical and believe the forum to be a political vehicle rather than a real means for public participation in policy making. Councillors could therefore be amongst forum members commenting on topics, they could contribute to topic development and could be quoted in topic introductions or invited to participate as special expert guests, but they should never moderate the discussion or be seen to be too closely controlling a discussion.Step 4: Get community support  You should also consider engaging community in the actual set up and design of your forum. They could be members of an external project reference group and be consulted on the first topics that should be discussed on the forum. This will help to ensure you have a ready group of forum members when your forum goes live.Step 5: Develop topics  Next you need to develop a list of initial topics. You can run topics one at a time or run several discussions at once, depending on your time and resources. Topics should ultimately be related to a current Council policy process to ensure the relevance to Council work. However to begin with you might want to select topics of interest to your community that have been flagged by citizens, even if they are not related to any specific piece of Council work. This is a good way of getting people on to the forum so that when you begin to discuss topics related to current Council policy issues, you have a ready membership group that is already familiar and willing to participate. For example, if \u201cdogs in local parks\u201d is a topic that keeps coming up amongst community, you could start discussions with this and then move to something Council is working on more immediately, such as urban renewal policy or a new arts and leisure strategy. The topics that you then move to should have the input from all areas of Council to ensure the forum\u2019s relevance across Council. You could:Step 6: Develop participation guidelines, a discussion charter and moderation rules  See E-Forums: Rules for details.Participation guidelines  You need a basic set of rules for forum members to adhere to. These are called \u201cparticipation guidelines\u201d and includes things like \u201cbe respectful of other people\u2019s opinions\u201d and \u201cdo not post offensive or libellous comments.\u201d Sample participation guidelines Brisbane CC guidelines can be seen at http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/BCC:BASE:410773833:pc=PC_1621Discussion charter  A discussion charter will set the parameters and timeframe for the topic and what will be the outcome of the discussion. Sample discussion charterModeration rules  You should also decide on a few basic rules for moderators. For example, moderators: Moderator guidelinesStep 7: Set up the e-forum  Once you have a degree of internal and external support and a set of initial topics, you are ready to set up your forum. You should consider doing a pilot which you can user test to ensure the general usability of the site. Work with your IT department to choose a technical option which best suits your needs. Some basic requirements you should ask for in your forum are listed below. Things the site administrator (ie you or whoever is managing the forum) should be able to do: Additional requirements you may wish to include are: When you choose your forum software you have a choice between proprietary and open source software. E-democracy.org uses open source software Groupserver and recommends this for e-democracy initiatives. However it does require technical expertise to get up and running and to maintain. There are a number of other free, easy to use open source forum applications available for download from the Internet \u2013 see for example http://onlinegroups.net/. The advantage of Groupserver over these is that it has the capability for people to email their posts and the posts be directly uploaded on the forum website. However this advantage might be outweighed by the technical expertise required to run Groupserver.Step 8: Market your e-forum  Marketing your forum is a critical step to ensuring it gets used and is therefore useful to Council. The following three points were drawn from Canadian Online Consultation Centre for Expertise http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/onlineconsultation/ Remember to use your existing online and off-line reach and marketing resources: Ways to market your forum include: Online mechanisms: Off-line mechanisms: The most effective tool in marketing is going to be having an interesting and engaging forum topic. Make sure your first topics are going to be ones that people want to say something about. Remember to also market the forum internally: Advertising should be ongoing ie you should advertise each new topic as it commences.Step 9: Launch  The next step is to launch the e-forum. Your checklist before launching is as follows:Checklist  You could hold an official launch of the forum to attract interest on the first day of the first discussion. Put out a media release and invite your Mayor to launch it and other community leaders to attend. This might also attract the attention of your Mayor and Councillors and other Council staff. Make sure your e-forum website has the first topic loaded up and ready to go so that the launch is of something tangible.Step 10: Run the first discussion  Now you have started it is time to put everything into action. You have to keep discussion moving: start new and interesting discussion threads on the topic every few days and send out email updates to keep members coming to see what new posts have been added. Make sure your co-moderator is actively posting too. Try to ensure that at least one of you posts daily.Step 11: Provide e-forum input to Council  The e-forum is essentially a public consultation and so you should do a consultation report based on its discussions and provide this to the relevant staff. Provide the summary of comments on a particular topic to the relevant Council area and a brief to Councillors, highlighting the views presented and any key messages to come out of the discussion.Step 12: Act on the outcomes of the e-forum  Take away the key messages from the forum and act on them. As with any public consultation the aim of the e-forum discussion is to gather views that you use in Council deliberations and act on in some way. It is essential that you act on the input on the forum, whether this be by funnelling the views into the appropriate policy area and policy development or commencing a body of work on an issue which forum members have flagged as a concern and which Council is not currently prioritising.Step 13: Provide feedback to e-forum members  It is crucial that your e-forum members feel like their input matters. If they provide input into a discussion and then never hear from you again about what has happened with their input, they will assume that it has been filed and forgotten and will not participate in future consultations. This is a real risk of any public consultation, not just e-consultations. At the end of a discussion, you should let the e-forum members know what has happened with their input. For example if you have just had a discussion on \u201curban renewal,\u201d you could let forum members know that their input has been provided to the relevant department and being considered in the development of a new urban renewal policy. If they want further information on developments, you might offer them an option to sign up to a specific e-newsletter, the Council\u2019s general e-newsletter, or you might provide quarterly updates yourself to Forum members on how various policy issues that have been discussed on the forum are progressing.Step 14: Evaluate the e-forum  As with any project you will want to evaluate your forum after you have run its pilot stage or at another significant milestone, eg after six or twelve months. Darebin evaluated the forum pilot after four months and decided on the basis of the evaluation to continue running the forum and evaluate the forum after the first year. The one year evaluation uses four main methods:Lessons learned, obstacles identified in evaluation  A summary of the evaluation will be made available in March / April 2007.Step 15: Enhance the e-Forum using other online tools  Other tools which can be used in conjunction with the e-forum to market the e-forum and engage your citizens online include:eConsultation guide for local governments E-Forums: Sample rules and disclaimers Participation guidelines  St. Mary Monastery Oblate Forum Participation Guide and Rules Participants are responsible for reading and understanding these rules. By participating you agree to these guidelines. 1) Use your Real Name If it is determined with careful consideration by the Moderator that a participant's actual identity is in question, that person will be suspended until proof of identity is provided. If it appears that fraud, forgery, identity theft, or computer crime laws have been violated, St. Mary Monastery Oblate Forum will notify the appropriate legal authorities. Experience in other online discussion forums has shown that the use of real names rather than pseudonyms is more likely to result in a polite and respectful discussion. However, you may have a valid reason for not wanting to use your real name. In this case, an exception can be made and the Moderator can approve the use of an alias. However your identity as an SMM Oblate must be established and agreed with the moderator. This is to ensure that only Oblates and Sisters of St. Mary Monastery take part in discussions on the forum. 2) Keep to the Topic 3) Keep topics within the St. Mary Monastery Oblate Forum purpose. 4) Be Civil This is NOT a public forum but all participants are real people.

A few pointers on the following should be provided: You could provide your moderators with the information below as a general guide to moderation. Also see Gilly Salmon\u2019s work on moderation in e-learning: http://coe.sdsu.edu/eet/Articles/salmonmodel/index.htmHow to moderate  The basic steps in moderation are similar to the steps in facilitating a meeting. A good moderator will:Introduce the topic  The moderator will begin each new discussion with a short introductory paragraph or two outlining the issue and highlighting the key questions for discussion. Example: Darebin e-Forum \u201c4 key environment issues\u201d discussion group http://eforum.darebin.vic.gov.au/aaa_division/groups/environment/messages/view_email?id=176&show_thread=1 This is an introduction to a discussion thread on \u201csustainable transport programs\u201d within the \u201c4 key environment issues\u201d discussion group. Note it is short, to the point, asks a question to get discussion moving and provides html links for further information.Keep discussion on track  The moderators of a forum should be firm but not too prohibitive. If you think someone is going off topic, it is important to be respectful of their comment but bring the discussion back on track by asking a question back on topic.Example  Discussion thread: What are people\u2019s views of the use of bicycle lanes and other bicycle support programs? Comment: I think that climate change is really overstated. The academics don\u2019t speak clearly and we don\u2019t really know for sure if what they say is true. Moderator: Thanks for that comment. The topic of climate change is probably out of the scope of this discussion but perhaps you would like to discuss it in our off-topic forum or submit it as a future topic via our topic suggestion form. Back to bicycle support programs, I saw that there were some interesting earlier comments about the possibility of limiting the hours of usage of bike lanes on busy roads. Other communities in Canada which have done this indicate that this can be prohibitive to bike usage at all, defeating the purpose somewhat. Other ideas are making protective fluoro gear compulsory, driver training, and a no-liability policy for bike riders in case of traffic accidents. What are your views? In the above example the moderator has offered the forum member alternative forums for their comment and has restarted discussion on topic. If you do not have an off-topic forum or some other appropriate forum for the off-topic comment, simply thank the person for their comment and bring the discussion back on track. The moderator is also the gatekeeper, checking comments either before they go on the site or once they are already up (Darebin checks posts before they get published, whereas Brisbane lets posts go up without being checked and checks comments once they are already up in case there are comments that should be taken down). There is no hard and fast rule about what comments not to permit on to a Forum, but anything rude, offensive or potentially libellous should be eliminated. Anything off-topic should be included but a moderator comment could follow immediately afterwards, bringing things back on track.Consider involving citizens in topic creation  You might want to allow your citizens to create discussion threads and start topics themselves. However it might be best in the first instance to start up just Council starting topics and go from there until you are really used to the Forum concept and how it works. Instead of allowing citizens to start topics, you could:Charter and rules  Key Forum elements to support good moderation are: See E-Forums: RulesDevelop personal connections  You may wish to use less formal language and a more conversational tone to draw out participants\u2019 experience and show that you have a personality. To balance this with being a Council representative, it might be best to have an elected official or a third party act as moderator on sensitive policy issues. Encouraging participants to introduce themselves and making sure that everyone uses their actual names on the forum is a way to help connections being made.Balance \u201cpersonal connections\u201d with representing your Council  As a public servant you are representing your local council when participating on the forum. You can balance this with contributing your personal opinions as you would in any face-to-face consultation or meeting. If you are the co-moderator who is the subject matter expert on a topic and you want to contribute something from your personal experience to the discussion, you can do so as long as you are aware that to do this has the advantage of being seen to be \u201chuman\u201d by the other participants, but that you should also be aware that you are still representing the Council on the forum and therefore should make it clear when a post by you is personal. It may be easier in the first instance to remain relatively neutral until you are used to the online consultation environment and moderating discussions in that arena. It will also be helpful if you have an independent third party person in your subject matter area who you can call on to moderate sensitive issues and you can always deal with an especially tricky issue off-line, eg by emailing or calling a forum member if they have raised something which can\u2019t be discussed in an open forum, just as you might set up a separate face-to-face meeting with a community stakeholder or might take them aside to discuss a sensitive matter at a public meeting. Example of balancing personal experience with Council representation: Darebin e-Forum An example of where a co-moderator used personal experience in a discussion and where it was subsequently well received and stimulated discussion was on the Darebin e-Forum in discussion of green transport. The moderator contributed her personal experience of riding her bike from Lilydale to Darebin for work. This gave her a greater level of credibility amongst the forum participants and stimulated discussion dramatically. By making a personal connection which was still in line with the Darebin local council\u2019s position on green transport, the subject matter co-moderator sparked a far more enthusiastic discussion. See the below excerpt from Darebin e-Forum:Get everyone involved  As in face-to-face meetings it is up to you to draw out the people who are not saying much on the forum. You may even privately request that your more outspoken participants wait 4-5 posts before they re-post so everyone has a go. Perhaps also note that perfect grammar is not required, so that people with lower literacy skills do not feel intimidated.Be responsive  As a moderator you should \u201cacknowledge and respond to participant input in a meaningful and timely manner.\u201d Make sure that no comment goes unnoticed and each is addressed, even if the response is merely an acknowledgement.An example of moderation on the Darebin e-Forum  In the below example, the forum moderator is Monika Merkes, who oversees all forum discussions on the Darebin e-Forum and works with a subject matter expert from one of the Council\u2019s departments who is a co-moderator on each discussion topic. In the example we see one of the forum participants going off track from the topic of the discussion. He begins to talk about the quality of the paper available rather than the issue of community harmony. Monika then politely but firmly begins him back on track. http://eforum.darebin.vic.gov.au/aaa_division/groups/harmony/messages/view_email?show_thread=1&id=122#120eConsultation guide for local governments About this Guide  This Local Council e-Consultation Guide was originally developed by the Darebin City Council in collaboration with the Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights (CCHR) at Deakin University with funding from the auDA Foundation.

It has been approved by Darebin Council as an ongoing project with an evaluation after its first year of full operation. The Darebin City Council established the Darebin eForum as part of its Governing Darebin strategic plan, which recognises greater community participation in local government and better consultation in policy making as critical to good governance. Darebin eForum is run as an Internet based forum combined with an email list which means that members can post to the Forum via email as well as directly on the website. It uses open source Groupserver software. Darebin eForum is moderated, which means there is someone who oversees discussion and checks comments before they are published on the Internet. There is a key moderator who oversees all discussions and vets posts before they are published. The moderator sets a topic in consultation with other Council department officers. The moderator remains constant throughout the year, with co-moderator for each topic drawn from the relevant Council department. The moderator consults with the other Council departments via a reference group made up of officers from across the Council in order to choose topics which are relevant to current policy undertakings or hot policy issues in the community. At this stage, Darebin eForumdoes not allow citizens to create topics or start discussions. Issues discussed on the Darebin eForum so far have included: Dr Lucas Walsh, Deakin University is undertaking an evaluation of the e-Forum after one year\u2019s operation. The following are his preliminary findings. The final report will be available by April 2007 on the Darebin eForum.Benefits  Benefits listed by the Council officers who used the Darebin eForum for consultation on an issue relevant to their policy area:Lessons learned Internet-only forum software vs Groupserver Moderators as Council officers vs private citizens Providing opinion vs information Ensuring the representation of interests and technological inclusion e-Consultation needs to be integrated into broader consultation processes Potential benefits of subscriber-only topics  Darebin is planning to introduce topics on the e-Forum that are subscriber-only, that is, only visible to people who subscribe to the topic, for example in developing volunteering infrastructure in Darebin. These topics will not be moderated. The aim is to enable a virtual space in which people can be more candid and have specific / specialised interests in the topic.

Local councils use electronic media for a variety of communication with the community. You may already use online technology to: In this Guide, we are specifically focusing on the last of these, \u201ce-consultation.\u201d \u201ce-Consultation\u201d refers to the use of electronic media for: Electronic media used in e-consultation include: This Guide focuses on e-forums as the main vehicle to start up dialogue amongst community members and local government on local council policy issues. The Guide also covers online polls and online surveys as tools which can be used in conjunction with e-forums.eConsultation guide for local governments What can I use e-Consultation to do?  Consultation is a dialogue amongst community and council. e-Consultation can enhance traditional face-to-face or paper-based consultation tools. This Guide will look specifically at how you can use e-forums, online polls and online surveys.Developing greater citizen participation  You can use e-consultation tools to increase the public\u2019s level of involvement with local government. You may already do things to enhance community engagement and participation in government, such as running open forums on local issues, using surveys to find out what issues matter to your local citizenry, or having a suggestion box in your Council foyer. It is not a great leap to run the same kind of general forums and surveys on your website or have online feedback and your say forms. The key to making these tools work, as with all consultation, is to act on the community input \u2013 for example, on the basis of the e-forum discussions or survey results, your Council could pick focus areas for policy development and let the community know what action you are taking.Consulting community members in the policy making process  There are two main points at which consultation with community is particularly helpful in policy making:Blue-skying  Your Council (eg you, your boss or a Councillor) may have identified an issue which you want to have general discussion on before you start developing policy or deciding your program priorities.Consultation on proposed policy  Consultation on a proposed policy approach is a recognised step in the development of policy by government officials on behalf of government. For more information about consultation generally, visit: Currently, you might:To make decisions  You might want to get a clear direction from community members on a specific issue with their input helping to establish a clearer mandate. In this instance you could use an online poll or survey.Overview table: aims and e-consultation tools  The following table matches goals of consultation with e-Consultation tools. For further information on e-consultation and its role in policy development a further reference in an Australian context is the Online Policy Consultation document available at http://www.agimo.gov.au/practice/delivery/checklistseConsultation guide for local governments E-Forums: Examples The Darebin eForum  http://eforum.darebin.vic.gov.au/Brisbane City Council: Your Say Online  http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/BCC:BASE::pc=PC_76Surf Coast Shire Council  http://www.surfcoast.vic.gov.au Other councils in Victoria which are commencing online forums include Manningham and Kingston City Council.International examples  o http://www.e-democracy.gov.uk/toolkit/default.htm E-Democracy Toolkit developed by the International Centre for Local e-DemocracyAustralian Government Citizen E-Engagement Initiatives  Queensland Government\u2019s e-Democracy Unit WA Office of e-Government ConsultWA Citizenscape Victorian Parliamentary Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee\u2019s Inquiry into Electronic Democracy (Parliament of Victoria, 2004).eConsultation guide for local governments Why should Local Councils use e-Consultation? Benefits of e-consultation  Internet access at home is not just mainstream it is becoming the norm. The type of network connection is also quickly shifting from lower speed dial-up to high speed Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or cable connections. In 2005-06, 60% of all Australian households had home Internet access: see Australian Bureau of Statistics This figure is even higher in metropolitan areas, for example in Brisbane 76% of households have access at home with most (57%) of these having high speed connections. The benefits of e-consultation include: e-Consultation makes it possible to: e-Consultation can be quick and easy for community members to use, and provide you with fast and direct feedback on policies. This means you can:eConsultation guide for local governments E-polls and surveys  e-Polls and e-surveys are the other main tools for e-consultation.e-Polls  An online poll is a quick way to do an opinion survey. Websites of newspapers often run a poll of an issue. A key element of a poll is that they involve the use of closed questions. Many also provide immediate feedback to the participant on what the overall results to date are.Example 1  Do you think Darebin should run an annual Arts Festival? Yes / NoExample 2  Do you think we should have a citizenship test? Yes / No Be aware that if you conduct a vote at the end of a forum discussion you could be creating an expectation amongst the forum members that you might be treating the result as a vote.e-Surveys  You can use online surveys as a tool to collect data just as a paper survey is used. A survey is longer than a poll and offers more options for the types of answers obtained. You can use a poll or survey to kick start or complement a discussion on a forum.Example: Brisbane City Council, Your Say Online  http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/BCC:BASE::pc=PC_76 Brisbane City Council has used a quick poll in addition to a long survey to support a forum discussion. The quick polls were up for a month before being changed while the long survey was up for the length of the discussion topic. The polls provide a path of increasing involvement with participants who have taken part more likely to revisit the website and contribute to longer surveys and discussion forums.Brisbane City Council\u2019s online consultation home page [\u201cYour Say Online\u201d.]  Each topic has a poll, an article and/or discussion paper and a forum. Topics on the Brisbane forum are linked to current policy consultation processes.Brisbane City Council Online Poll for \u201cOpen Space Strategy\u201d topic  The poll uses a combination of yes/no and multiple choice questions. It provides another option for citizens to give their views online.Brisbane City Council: Your Say Online: Surveys  For more information about using polls and surveys, go to http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/consultationendirect/text/publications/Fact_Sheet_Surveys-e.htmleConsultation guide for local governments E-Forums: Successful elements  The following section outlines the key elements of a successful e-forum. See E-Forums: Step by step guide on how to achieve these elements.Relevance of topics  Topics on forums should:Good moderation  The moderator of an e-forum is basically an online meeting chairperson. A chairperson in a meeting will introduce each topic, guide people back on to the topic when they digress, censure offensive comments, stimulate comment when discussion flags by introducing new angles or questions, and periodically summarise discussion. The moderator does exactly the same things, but in an online environment. You can have more than one moderator. Darebin City Council uses a moderator plus a subject matter expert co-moderator drawn from Council staff, one each topic. You could also have a community member or acknowledged expert in the role of co-moderator (Richards: 2002). See E-Forums: Moderator guidelines for a detailed how-to guide on moderation.Momentum  It is essential that a discussion moves. If there have been no posts from community members for a day or more, the moderator should post something. Ways to keep discussion moving include: You can also use the Forum website to create a sense of momentum by using a communal calendar; reminders about upcoming events; invitations to join in; the use of occasional synchronous events, such as teleconferences, virtual chats and online meetings; and publications of summaries of discussions soon after they happen.Sense of membership  It is a good idea to have people register to join your e-forum rather than having an open forum that anyone can comment on without joining. This way you can ask key questions of people useful to evaluate your Forum later, you can identify people and create evolving member profiles. You can then build a real sense of membership and online community by:Accessibility  The Australian government has website access rules at http://www.agimo.gov.au/practice/mws/accessibility. Your e-forum website should comply with the same requirements that your regular website complies with, such as ensuring there are alt tags for non-text elements (an alt tag describes an image or graphic on a web page for those who cannot see the image). There is also an open standards movement and standards such as WSC http://www.w3.org When designing your forum website, you have to accept that your forum cannot include everyone, but should also not exclude particular groups, for example the visually impaired. You also have to recognize that e-forums will not reach everyone just as a public meeting does not get 100% community attendance. You also have to take into consideration who is your target audience. For example if you think that the majority of your users will have broadband then you can include larger graphical and video files on your main page. If you want the site to be accessible to those with dial-up, then you would probably link to larger graphical elements such as video files rather than embedding them in the main page, so the main page of the forum does not take a long time to download. You will probably find that your main Council website already seeks to comply with Government guidelines and your main task will therefore be to make sure that the forum site does as well. For example you might consider delivering the content in your e-Forum in languages other than English. Video or other multimedia files should also have a text-based equivalent describing the content of the files so that those with a slow connection or visual impairment know what is going on. Usability A usable website is the key to success. The following are questions asked in a story at webreview.com, taken from Bowling Together http://www.bowlingtogether.net which you should ask yourself in designing your Internet forum: You should user test your forum before you go live with it. Darebin did a four month pilot and evaluation before committing to an ongoing forum with its current website layout which is powered by Groupserver, and a one year evaluation due in March/April 2007. Readability Always use plain language on your e-forum.Advertised  You have to spread the word using offline and online mechanisms, otherwise no one will use your e-forum. A good communication plan that has been acted on in advance of the Forum launch is essential.Council action on basis of e-forum input  The Council has to use the input from the e-forum and the community needs to know what the outcomes of their comments and discussion has been, otherwise they will think it has been pointless and will become cynical about your Council\u2019s consultation processes. The best feedback clearly identifies how the public input has specifically been used or made a difference. A good example (even though it is based on a traditional meeting) is at http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/churchill/consultation.asp Given political and administrative processes can be slower than the public expect feedback to the community can be staged, you don't have to wait for the final decision. You should always look to give feedback when you can, this could be as simple as an acknowledgment email, it could also be a short report, an e-newsletter, or an update on the Forum page.Support from inside and outside Council  Your forum needs to be championed by people within the Council and outside the Council in order to get off to a good start. That way you will have people to contribute, getting the discussion going, and people on staff to co-moderate topics with you and ensure the relevance of your forum to the Council from the outset. Ways to ensure support include:eConsultation guide for local governments The tools of e-Consultation Internet Forums  An Internet forum, also known as an e-forum or an online forum, is a facility for holding discussions via the web. The basic elements of an e-forum are \u201cTopics\u201d are the issues that are discussed on the forum. They can be structured in \u201cdiscussion groups\u201d for each different topic. A \u201cpost\u201d is someone\u2019s comment on the topic. A \u201cthread\u201d is a sub-topic or line of discussion which is made up of posts by various members of the forum on a particular topic. The \u201cmoderator\u201d is the person responsible for vetting comments, checking them and allowing them to be published, and steering the discussion. The moderator may also be joined by a \u201cco-moderator\u201d for each separate discussion, the co-moderator being a subject matter expert who can steer discussion whilst the moderator continues to be responsible for general vetting and forum website maintenance and control. \u201cForum members\u201d are the people who are registered to comment on the forum (not all forums require registration).

It can be short \u2013 eg \u201cthis discussion will be about environment issues and will run from 1 January to 15 January 2007. Comments should be no longer than 200 words.\u201d The charter should also spell out what will happen with the comments received from participants, eg \u201ccomments will be used as feedback to the Council and summaries of discussion will be provided to Council and published on this website. Outcomes of policy issues which have been discussed on the Forum will be published in the Forum email newsletters/ group emails to Forum members.\u201dExample of a discussion charter  Darebin e-Forum \u201carts and leisure strategy\u201d discussion charter http://eforum.darebin.vic.gov.au/aaa_division/groups/testid/charter The charter is short and to the point, simply noting that you are bound to discuss the issues at hand, setting the timeframe for discussion and noting you are bound by the Forum Etiquette which are the rules of participation for the entire Forum.Participation guidelines  Participation guidelines set out what is acceptable and not acceptable forum behaviour. Forum participants agree to the rules by participating on the forum. Rules will include: Rules should also include information on the situations which will give rise to a moderator banning a member or editing a post, so as to provide some certainty for forum members that decisions will not be arbitrary but are following agreed guidelines. For example: Rules might also include textual parameters, for example: See E-Forums: Sample rules and disclaimers for sample participation guidelines.eConsultation guide for local governments Resources necessary for e-consultation  The resources required for e-consultation vary. There is a surprising amount you can do for low cost. All forums require time invested in initial planning to map out your aims for your forum, choose the right Forum software, either open source or proprietary, to cater to your requirements, testing the software and getting Council support and community membership of the Forum.Darebin eForum  http://eforum.darebin.vic.gov.au This uses open source software, a volunteer site administrator and existing staff time amongst council staff to moderate the Forum.Forum establishment  Darebin City Council spent $2000 on print advertising the forum using bookmarks which were distributed in the area and in public spaces such as the local libraries. Staff time was drawn from the existing staff in the Social Policy, Strategy and Governance Department. Once staff gained permission to go ahead with the e-forum approximately 1-2 hours were required per week for a period of about 12 months to: The Darebin site administrator is a volunteer, Mr Richard Solly. He estimates that if you start with a functional set of files, raw set up takes two hours and customisation takes between 8 and 40 person hours.Ongoing forum management  Darebin\u2019s volunteer administrator Mr Richard Solly notes that whilst maintenance of a fully functioning system does not require a large amount of time, time to find and fix bugs in the software can take many hours. Both commercial and open source software have bugs, so time to fix them should be factored into the project plan for e-forum implementation. Ensuring a bug free installation is the key to avoiding having to spend too much time on fixing bugs once the forum is up and running. Therefore a fully tested set of files for installation is critical. Mr Solly notes that the current release of GroupServer is not fully tested and may therefore take additional time in the set up phase to iron out bugs before commencing.Surf Coast Shire Council  http://www.surfcoast.vic.gov.au Surf Coast Shire uses different software to Darebin. Surf Coast Shire has chosen to pay a website consultant to support the forum, with minimal additional internal Information Technology resources required.Forum establishment  It cost Surf Coast Shire $1,500 to establish its eforum. With thanks to Darebin resources required to create the space, text and procedures were minimal due to Darebin sharing its resources.Brisbane City Council  http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/BCC:BASE::pc=PC_76 Brisbane City Council has a project officer whose role includes the management of the Your Say Online space and 12,000 member Your City, Your Say community reference group along with supporting work units from across Council in maximising the use of these engagement opportunities. Another team member provides support in regards to strategic directions. Members of the Council's corporate web team play a content development role bringing supporting information content together.Forum establishment:  The current discussion forum was produced in-house in 2000 and is currently being updated. The future solution will be sourced externally and will be produced and hosted for between $5,000 - $10,000.Ongoing forum management:  All forums established need to link in with Council initiated policy development or project planning. Topics will influence a resultant Council action, community input is valued and Council want to utilise the information given. The discussion forums and survey tools all rely on work units from across Council for their content. In establishing the forums we also seek to provide supporting background information to provide a level of context or to provide a point from which to respond.eConsultation guide for local governments E-Forums: FAQs What is an e-Forum?  An e-Forum is a consultation tool which uses the Internet to connect community with each other and with Council, making for a more engaged community which feels listened to and more positive about their local Council. An e-Forum is not just providing information on a website to people, or an online form for feedback. It is also not a stand-alone consultation tool and would be used in conjunction with your existing tools, such as public meetings and surveys. However e-Forums can and do attract more members of the community and deeper, more constructive dialogue over a period of time, allowing people to get into the crux of an issue in ways that meetings and more traditional forms of consultation do not always permit.What\u2019s in it for me and my area of Council?  Use of the e-Forum will help you engage your sector, get constructive feedback on policies and improve the level of trust in your community for Council staff and Councillors. It is an easy and cheap way of conducting part of your consultation phase of policy development and will provide real insights into the way people are thinking on an issue. E-forums are part of a wave of e-democracy. Australian governments are on board with the Australian Government Information Management Office (AGIMO) running an e-democracy newsgroup, WA and Qld having dedicated units to e-consultation and local councils setting up e-forums as part of their suite of consultation tools.What are the incentives for doing e-consultation? How much time, work and money will it cost me?  You will have to provide a co-moderator who will spend approximately half an hour a day for the period of your discussion topic running on the e-forum. You don\u2019t have to provide any money unless you want to provide, for example, giveaway movie tickets or other enticements to community to participate in the discussion.Have other councils used this before? What have been the benefits?  Yes. Darebin City Council has an e-forum which has run topics from its environment, arts and leisure and multicultural areas of Council. They have done an evaluation and found that the e-forum has more members than regular ward public meetings and has more constructive dialogue than most public meetings allow time for. Forum participants enjoy their participation and feel more positive about their local Council\u2019s interest in their views. Other benefits of e-consultation include engagement of people with disabilities who find it difficult to attend meetings, parents with young children, young people and time poor professionals who do not have time to make it or participate in other forms of consultation by Council. e-consultation can also be used to increase citizens\u2019 feeling of ownership and responsibility for ultimate policies. Other councils also use e-consultation, including Brisbane CC, Manningham CC and La Trobe CC. Kingston and Surf Coast Shire are developing e-Forums. Internationally e-Forums are used regularly.How do I use it? Is it hard?  The e-Forum is not hard to use. It is like a combination of email and website, where you type in comments to a website instead of into your email program and you can read all the comments before yours.eConsultation guide for local governments BCC survey screenshot.jpg  Brisbane City Council survey screenshoteConsultation guide for local governments E-Forums: Legal issues  As with all websites, your forum will require a disclaimer, privacy rules and copyright statement.Disclaimer  As long as your site has the legal disclaimers on it your Council cannot be held liable if defamatory or offensive statements are posted on your site.

Reaching down, he grabbed his mother's ass cheeks and picked her up slightly, moving her so that she now lied down on top of him, straddling his chest, with her pussy lips pushing his cock down onto his chest. Her head rested gently on his chest, her lips mere inches from his own, her eyes closed, giving him time to look at her without any interference. Nothing could be more perfect than her. He thought to himself as he stared at her. She was now asleep, and her body spread warmth throughout his body. He noticed a strand of hair had fallen down onto her face and he gently brushed it away, leaving his hand on her cheek. He brought his other hand back down and rested it gently on her ass cheek and carefully pulled her even closer to him. The tip of his cock was now pushing against the entrance to her tight pussy, but he put no force into putting it onto her yet. He leaned his head forward and pulled his mother's face in and gently pressed his lips against hers, caressing her cheek the the hand on her face. Unconsciously, she responded to him, slightly kissing back, inching closer and closer to him, crawling along his chest. As she rose, his cock was no longer pressed against his body and was poking her right in her pussy. She came back down and found a large resistance that blocked her. She opened her eyes for the first time and twisted around to see what was blocking her and saw that his cock was firmly pressing into her. Twisting back around she looked her son in the eyes and gave him a small, sly smile before she slammed her hips down, her pussy lips engulfing his cock. They both closed their eyes and moaned at the feeling, Ash at the feeling of his cock inside his mother's warm, pulsing pussy, and Delia at the feeling of his cock stretching the walls of her pussy. Ash slowly began to push in and out of his mother and watched her face as he did so. Her eyes were closed, biting her bottom lip in an effort to not scream or moan from the touch of her son. He leaned in and began to kiss her again, locking lips with her. As he did so, she melted in his arms, collapsing against him. He leaned up so that he was sitting on the bed, her legs locked around his back, breasts squeezed against his chest, as Ash picked up the pace of thrusting into his mother. He kissed her with a renewed ferocity, sliding his tongue into her mouth, fighting against her own tongue, eager to explore the entirety of her being. She began to moan as he kissed her, her hot cum leaking out of her as Ash pushed further and further into her, into a place where no one had ever reached, except for him all those years ago. Go back to that special place. She thought to herself. Go back to that place that we once shared. Her lips parted from his as a flood of his hot cum burst into her, leaking out from her pussy. Her back arched as she looked up to the sealing, a long, deep moan emanating from her lips. Ash leaned his mother down back on to the bed, as his mouth found her breasts. He noisily sucked at both of them, as Delia grabbed ahold of the sweat soaked bedsheets. Ash gave one last, final thrust into his mother before he collapsed, pulling out of her and falling into the bed beside her. Delia turned herself so that her back was facing Ash as he turned around to face reached around, grabbing ahold of her breasts, as he pulled her in, spooning her. His semi-hard member rubbed in between his mother's pussy lips as they both faded to sleep, locked in each other's embrace (view all pages)Women Wiki Portrayal of women in comics  Women have been portrayed in comic books since the medium's beginning, with their portrayals often the subject of controversy. Sociologists with an interest in gender roles and stereotyping have outlined the role of women as both supporting characters and as potential leaders struggling to be accepted as equals. Another point of study has been the depiction of women in comics, in which, as in other forms of popular culture, body types are unrealistically portrayed.Golden Age of comic books:  There was a time when more girls read comics than boys. One of the first books geared to these readers was Archie Comics, starring a group of all-American teens\u2014Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones,  and Veronica Lodge\u2014who had debuted in Pep Comics #22. During the 1930s-1940s period that fans and historians call the Golden Age of comic books, a time during which the medium evolved from comic strips, women who were not superheroes were primarily portrayed three ways: as career girls, romance-story heroines, or perky teenagers.Costumed crimefighters  Like Batman, the Phantom and other non-superpowered heroes,  female costumed crimefighters were among the first comic characters. The Woman in Red, was brought forward in Standard Comics' Thrilling Comics #2 (March 1940), and was a police officer with a dual identity. Lady Luck, appeared in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert The Spirit Section on June 2, 1940. The tough-fighting Miss Fury, appeared in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarp\u00e9 Mills on April 6, 1941, and the equally formidable Phantom Lady appeared in Quality Comics Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941). Harvey Comics had the motorcycle-riding Black Cat, that appeared in Pocket Comics #1 (also Aug. 1941). One publisher exemplified was, Fiction House: Who featured several progressive heroines such as the jungle queen Sheena.Wonder Woman  The first widely recognizable female superhero is Wonder Woman, from All-American Publications, one of three companies that would merge to form DC Comics. In the early 1940s the DC line was dominated by superpowered male characters such as the Green Lantern, Batman,  and its flagship character, Superman.  According to the Fall 2001 issue of the Boston University alumni magazine, it was Marstons wife Elizabeth's idea to create a female superhero the Boston University alumni magazine: William Moulton Marston, a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph (forerunner to the magic lasso), struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero, one who would triumph not with fists or firepower, but with love. \"Fine,\" said Elizabeth. \"But make her a woman.\" Marston introduced the idea to Max Gaines, cofounder (along with Jack Liebowitz) of All-American Publications. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed Wonder Woman with Elizabeth (whom Marston believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman). In creating Wonder Woman, Marston was also inspired by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a polygamous/polyamorous relationship. Marston's pseudonym, Charles Moulton, combined his own and Gaines' middle names.Modern Age of Comic Books: Bad Girl Trend  The trend towards sexually suggestive characters was also felt at Marvel Comics. In the early 1990s, characters such as the Invisible Woman (from Fantastic Four # 375) and the Scarlet Witch (from Scarlet Witch #1) started wearing revealing outfits. The cover of The Sensational She-Hulk #40 featured a claim that She-Hulk would be jump roping naked in the issue (but, of course, this was just a joke). It is worth noting that the first truly sexually suggestive character in the Marvel Comics mythos appeared in the Bronze Age of Comic Books in the form of the White Queen,  Emma Frost. The White Queen appeared in the X-Men during the Dark Phoenix saga and her lingerie-like outfits and dominant personality became her trademarks, which she carried on even as a superhero and member of the X-Men.Evolving themes  In the 21st Century, the roles of many women have changed. Roles and choices such as single parenting, same-sex relationships, and positions of power in the workplace have come to define many women in modern society. These roles have found their way into the comic books of the 21st Century as well. Lesbian relationships were initially featured in underground and in alternative titles, such as Julie Doucet's Dirty Plotte, before entering the mainstream with Image Comics' Gen\u00b9\u00b3 and Marvel Comics' Exiles #34 (Nov. 2003).See also: Women Wiki Kamila 064 About me  This is your user page.

A female superhero is called a superheroine (although this term has fallen out of favor in the modern era). The word superhero originated with Superman, who debuted in 1938, and the stories of superheroes - ranging from episodic adventures to decades-long sagas - have become an entire genre of fiction.Alter egos of superheroines  Ancient texts prophesied her existence.

This is the earth designation for the universe the Daredevil and Elektra movies take place in. In the MC2 Universe (aka Earth-982) the Age of Heroes (the boom of super-hero activity generally marked by the first appearance of the Fantastic Four) happened about 15 years earlier on the Marvel Universes' sliding timescale. Pragmatically speaking, this means that most of the events, history, and character history associated with the heroes of Earth-616 happened 15 years before they would have on Earth-616, but the overall political, technological, and sociological progress of the world is exactly concurrent with Earth-616. As such, a lot of the superheroes of the past have either grown up, grown old, or retired, and now new groups, new Superheroines and superheroes are proving themselves in protecting the world. By this time, Spider-Man has retired, having lost his leg in the final battle with Norman Osborn following the Gathering of Five. Captain America is finally starting to feel his age slow him down, and the Fantastic Four has now become the Fantastic Five. Younger heroes like Nova have become seasoned veterans, while others such as Cassie Lang and Kristoff Vernard have risen to prominence.Women Wiki Chamunda (goddess)  In Hinduism, Chamunda also known as Chamundi and Charchika, is a fearsome aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother and one of the seven Matrikas (mother goddesses). She is also one of the chief Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses, who are attendants of the warrior goddess Durga. The name is a combination of Chanda and Munda, two monsters whom Chamunda killed. She is closely associated with Kali, another fierce aspect of Devi. She is sometimes identified with goddesses Parvati, Chandi or Durga as well. The goddess is often portrayed as haunting cremation grounds or fig trees. The goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine, (in the ancient times human sacrifices were offered too.) Originally a tribal goddess, Chamunda was assimilated in Hinduism and later entered the Jain pantheon too. Though in Jainism,  the rites of her worship include vegetarian offerings, and not the meat and liquor offerings.

Such earth goddesses are sometimes referred to as Mother Earth or as the Earth Mother. There have been many different mother goddesses throughout history and in the present day, including such deities as the Hindu Kali Ma, ancient Greek Gaia and ancient Irish Anu. In some forms of Neopaganism, and in the Hindu idea of Shakti.Concepts of mother goddesses  Mother goddesses are present in the earliest images discovered among the archaeological finds in Ancient Egypt. One figure of a deity, depicted standing between two lionesses, exists among those on one of the earliest paintings found among the Naqada Culture. An association with animals seen as good mothers\u2014the lioness, cow, hippopotamus, white vulture, cobra, scorpion, and cat\u2014as well as the life-giving primordial waters, the sun, and the night sky and the earth herself\u2014is drawn to the early goddesses of Egypt. Even through the transition to a paired pantheon of male deities matched or \"married\" to each goddess, reached a later male deity dominated pantheon that arose much later, the mother goddesses persisted into historical times (such as Hathor and Isis). Advice from the oracles associated with these goddesses guided the rulers of Egypt and the tradition spread to other ancient cultures. The image of Isis nursing her son was worshipped into the sixth century A.D. and has been resurrected by contemporary \"cults\" of an Earth Mother.Roman  Aphrodite's counterpart in Roman mythology, Venus, eventually was adopted as a Mother Goddess figure.

Television.Awards: Women Wiki Boudicca  Boudica also spelled Boudicca, formerly known as Boadicea (and known in Welsh as \"Buddug\"), was a queen of the Iceni tribe of what is now known as East Anglia in England, who led an uprising of the tribes against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire. Boudica's husband, Prasutagus, an Icenian king who had ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome, left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman Emperor in his will. However, when he died his will was ignored, possibly because the Romans, unlike the Britons, did not recognise daughters as heirs. The kingdom was annexed as if conquered, Boudica was flogged (and her daughters raped), and Roman financiers called in their loans. In AD 60 or 61, while the Roman governor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was leading a campaign on the island of Anglesey in north Wales, Boudica led the Iceni, along with the Trinovantes and others, in revolt. They destroyed Camulodunum (Colchester), formerly the capital of the Trinovantes, but now a colonia (a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers) and the site of a temple to the former emperor Claudius, built and maintained at local expense, and routed a Roman legion, the IX Hispana, sent to relieve the settlement. On hearing the news of the revolt, Suetonius hurried to Londinium (London), the twenty-year-old commercial settlement which was the rebels' next target, but concluding he did not have the numbers to defend it, evacuated and abandoned it. It was burnt to the ground, as was Verulamium (St Albans). An estimated 70,000-80,000 people were killed in the three cities. Suetonius, meanwhile, regrouped his forces in the West Midlands, and despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated Boudica in the Battle of Watling Street. The crisis had led the emperor Nero to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from the island, but Suetonius's eventual victory over Boudica secured Roman control of the province.Location of her defeat:  The location of Boudica's defeat is unknown. Most historians favour a site in the West Midlands, somewhere along the Roman road now known as Watling Street. Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to High Cross in Leicestershire, on the junction of Watling Street and the Fosse Way, which would have allowed the Legio II Augusta, based at Exeter, to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces, had they not failed to do so. Manduessedum (Mancetter), near the modern day town of Atherstone in Warwickshire, has also been suggested.Fiction:  Boudica has been the subject of two feature films, the 1928 film Boadicea, where she was portrayed by Phyllis Neilson-Terry, and 2003's Boudica (Warrior Queen in the USA), a UK TV film written by Andrew Davies and starring Alex Kingston as Boudica. A new film is planned for release in 2010 entitled Warrior, written by Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal, directed by Gavin O'Connor, and produced by Mel Gibson. She has also been the subject of a 1978 British TV series, Warrior Queen, starring Sian Phillips as Boudica. Jennifer Ward-Lealand portrayed Boudica in an episode of Xena - Warrior Princess entitled \"The Deliverer\" in 1997. Boudica's story is the subject of several novels, including books by Rosemary Sutcliff, Pauline Gedge, Manda Scott, Alan Gold, Diana L. Paxson, David Wishart, George Shipway, and J. F. Broxholme (a pseudonym of Duncan Kyle). One of the viewpoint characters of Ian Watson's novel \"Oracle\" is an eyewitness to her defeat. She has also appeared in several comic book series, including the Sl\u00e1ine, which featured two runs, entitled \"Demon Killer\" and \"Queen of Witches\" giving a free interpretation of Boudica's story. Other comic appearances include Witchblade and From Hell. Additionally, in the alternate history novel \"Ruled Britannia\" by Harry Turtledove, Boudicca is the subject of a play written by William Shakespeare to incite the people of Britain to revolt against Spanish conquerors. Henry Purcell's last major work, composed in 1695, was music for play entitled \"Bonduca, or the British Heroine\" (Z. 574). Selections include \"To Arms\", \"Britons, Strike Home\" and \"O lead me to some peaceful gloom\". Boudica has also been the primary subject of songs by Irish singer/songwriter Enya, Dutch soprano Petra Berger, Scottish singer/songwriter Steve McDonald, English metal band Bal-Sagoth, Faith and the Muse and Dreams in the Witching House. She\u00b4s also been mentioned in The Libertines\u00b4 song The Good Old Days Ex Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark has been called Boadicea.Women Wiki Ashanti (singer)  Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas (born October 13, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actress, dancer, and model who rose to fame in the early 2000s. Ashanti is most famous for her eponymous Grammy Award-winning debut album Ashanti which featured the hit song \"Foolish\", and sold over 503,000 copies in its first week of release in the U.S. in April 2002. The album set a Soundscan record as the biggest opening week sales for a R&B female artist, outselling debuts by Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill.Ashanti's Christmas:  In November 2003, Ashanti's Christmas album, Ashanti's Christmas was released, containing almost an equal amount of original songs to Christmas standards. This album was panned by most critics; it considered to be a desperation of selling records while the artist was rocketed to stardom. In late 2003, Ashanti released a Christmas melody video for the album. According to soundscan, the album sold just around 100,000 units in the U.S.Acting career:  Ashanti got her first taste of acting as a child extra in the Spike Lee directed movies Malcolm X and Who's Da Man. She also started as a dancer in the Disney TV film Polly. After success with her music career, Ashanti starred in Bollywood film Bride and Prejudice, in which she sang \"My Lips are Waiting\" and \"Touch My Body\". Ashanti's appearance in the film was meant as homage to a tradition in Bollywood films where a celebrity would make a cameo appearance to sing a song that has no direct involvement in the plot. The rest of the characters do not interact with the celebrity but are seen in the crowd enjoying the show. In January 2005, she made her feature film acting debut in the film Coach Carter alongside Samuel L. Jackson, which debuted at #1 opening weekend. She played a pregnant teenager named Kyra who has to decide whether or not to abort her unborn child. The movie opened at number-one at the U.S. box office, eventually grossing $97 million in the U.S. Later in 2005, Ashanti beat out Hilary Duff and Jessica Simpson to star as Dorothy Gale in the made-for-television film The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, which pulled in nearly 8 million viewers. In 2006, she starred in the teen comedy John Tucker Must Die, which opened and peaked at #3 at the U.S. box office (competing with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Miami Vice) and grossed $68,818,076 worldwide. Ashanti played Heather, the head cheerleader who participates in a vengeful scheme against John Tucker, her unfaithful boyfriend and the school's biggest heartthrob. Ashanti can also be found on Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 7 episode 14: \"First Date\" and on Sabrina the Teenage Witch season 7 episode 3: \"Call Me Crazy\". In 2007, Ashanti appeared in the sci-fi horror action Resident Evil:  Extinction as a nurse named Betty.  The film entered at #1 at the box office grossing $53,678,580 in its opening week. To date the movie has grossed $83,648,679 at the US box office and around  $197,713,442 worldwide. This is Ashanti's second #1 movie, the other being Coach Carter.Other activities:  In addition to singing, Ashanti has emerged as a songwriter penning songs for Christina Milian, Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Nas, Toni Braxton, & many more. She released a book of poetry titled Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections on Love in 2002 and a fragrance, \"Precious Jewel by Ashanti,\" in October 2005, etc.Women Wiki Sarah Michelle Prinze  (born April 14, 1977,) more known by her birth name of Sarah Michelle Gellar, is an American actress. She is most known for her role as the character Buffy Summers in the acclaimed television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for which she won in total six Teen Choice Awards, and the Saturn Award for Best Genre TV Actress and received a Golden Globe Award nomination. The show made her an icon and star in the industry from the first season of the show. She won a Daytime Emmy Award for her role in All My Children as character Kendall Hart. She has subsequently become known as a film actress, starring in the family film Scooby-Doo (2002) as Daphne Blake, and the American remake of Japanese horror film The Grudge (2004) and its sequel The Grudge 2 (2006). Earlier roles include the teen drama Cruel Intentions (1999); the slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997); the other slasher film Scream 2 (1997); and the independent film Harvard Man (2001). Her many horror roles have established Gellar as a \"scream queen\".Personal life:  Gellar met future husband Freddie Prinze, Jr., during filming of the 1997 teen horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer but the two did not begin dating until 2000. They were engaged in April 2001 and married in Mexico on September 1, 2002 in a ceremony officiated by Adam Shankman, a film director and choreographer with whom Gellar had worked on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gellar's bridesmaid was her closest friend of many years, Lindsay Sloane. In 2007, Gellar legally changed her name to Sarah Michelle Prinze in honor of the couple's fifth year of marriage. In 2004, while filming The Grudge in Japan, Gellar visited the famous Japanese swordsmith Shoji Yoshihara (Kuniie III) and bought a Katana from him as a birthday present for her husband.  Gellar realized that she needed clearance from the government to remove  the sword from the country, and after eventually succeeding,  stated that it was \"incredibly difficult\" to do. Gellar has also reflected on her choices as an actress; she frequently mentions how \"proud\" she is of Buffy: The Vampire Slayer. She has also been her own critic, talking about movie roles she has taken, saying,  \"Simply Irresistible was just a bad choice - and for that, it was a great learning experience. I wasn't ready to make that movie. I was too young. The script was not ready. I knew in my heart before I left to make it that I should back out.\"Women Wiki Amazon feminism  Amazon feminism is dedicated to the image of the female hero in fiction and in fact, as expressed in the physiques and feats of female athletes, martial artists and other powerfully-built women in society, art and literature. Camille Paglia's interpretation of the \"Uranian Aphrodite\" is a good example of Amazon feminism. Amazon feminism is considered to have formed during the 1990s via the writings of Camille Paglia. Historical criticism may hope to uncover more examples of Amazon feminism in the pre-90s literature. An obvious example of this is Wonder Woman, who was conceived in the early 1940s and based partially on the Amazons in Greek Mythology. The origin of the term \"Amazon feminism\" can be traced to several sources, including Thomas Gramstad. The name itself makes reference to the Amazons, a nation of warrior women from Greek mythology.See also:  [-This article/section is a Stub This article/section is short and lacking information.

The series was created in 1997 by writer-director Joss Whedon under his production tag, Mutant Enemy Productions with later co-executive producers being Jane Espenson, David Fury, and Marti Noxon. The series narrative follows Buffy Summers played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, the latest in a line of young women known as Slayers. Slayers are chosen by fate to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a Watcher, who guides and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".Production: Origins  Writer Joss Whedon says that \"Rhonda the Immortal Waitress\"  was really the first incarnation of the Buffy concept,  \"just the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out  to be extraordinary.\" This early, unproduced idea evolved into Buffy,  which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie.\" Whedon wanted \"to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero.\" He explained: \"The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power:  having it, using it, sharing it.\" The concept was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which featured Kristy Swanson in the title role. The director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, saw it as a \"pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires.\" Whedon disagreed: \"I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing.\"Buffy Casting  The title role went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had appeared as Sydney Rutledge on Swans Crossing and Kendall Hart on All My Children. At age eighteen in 1995, Gellar had already won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series. In 1996, she was initially cast as Cordelia Chase during a week of auditioning. She decided to keep trying for the role of Buffy, and after several more auditions, landed the lead.Opening sequence  The Buffy opening sequence provides credits early in each show. The music was performed by the punk rock band Nerf Herder. The song includes a similar melody to an Austrian pop song from the 1980s called \"Codo\" by D\u00d6F, but Nerf Herder have said that they had \"never heard of D\u00d6F\", and that the similarity was coincidental. In the DVD commentary for the first Buffy episode, Whedon said his decision to go with Nerf Herder's theme was influenced by cast member Alyson Hannigan, who had made him listen to the band's music. Janet Halfyard, in her essay \"Music, Gender, and Identity in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel\", describes the opening: \"It begins with the sound of an organ, accompanied by a wolf's howl, with a visual image of a flickering night sky overlaid with unintelligible archaic script: the associations with both the silent era and films such as Nosferatu and with the conventions of the Hammer House of Horror and horror in general are unmistakable\".External links: Women Wiki Women's rights  I think the gays have the right idea.Women Wiki Amy Acker  Amy Louise Acker born December 5, 1976 is an American actress.

The series was produced by Pacific Renaissance Pictures Ltd (owned by Robert Tapert and Sam Raimi) in association with Universal Studios. It stars Lucy Lawless as Xena and Renee O'Connor as her companion Gabrielle. The show chronicles Xena's quest to seek redemption for her past sins as a ruthless warlord by using her formidable fighting skills to help people. Gabrielle becomes Xena's greatest ally, her initial na\u00efvet\u00e9 helps to balance Xena and assists her in recognizing and pursuing the \"greater good.\" The series is a spin-off of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. Aware that the character of Xena had been very successful among the public, the producers of the series decided to create a spin-off series based around her adventures.Cast:  Xena: Warrior Princess starred Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor, in the roles of Xena and Gabrielle. The original choice to interpret Xena was the British actress Vanessa Angel, but an illness prevented her from travelling, so the role was offered to another four actresses before being given to Lucy. For Gabrielle, Sunny Doench was chosen, but she did not want to leave her boyfriend in the United States and Renee was chosen. During the series, several names were being aggregated to cast, most of them natives of New Zealand. Actor Ted Raimi became an active actor in the second season onwards, in his role as Joxer. The late actor Kevin Tod Smith became popular in the cast from the third season as Ares. Other actors that were very popular among fans of the series was Hudson Leick in her role as Callisto, Karl Urban as Caesar, and Alexandra Tydings as Aphrodite.Setting:  Xena Warrior Princess was filmed in New Zealand. Some places are confidential, but many scenes were recorded in places such as the Waitakere Ranges Regional Park, part of the Auckland Regional parks often credited at the end of the episodes.Movies:  In August 1997 Hercules and Xena: The Battle For Mount Olympus a DTV animated movie was released, featuring the voices of a number of actors from both Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess. The movie plot involves Hercules' mother being kidnapped by Zeus and the release of the Titans. Xena and Gabrielle have supporting roles in the movie, and at one point Xena even bursts into song. Since the end of the series rumors have circulated that a feature length movie was in the works. In 2003 Screenwriter Katherine Fugate was approached for the project, and was quoted saying that she expects the start of production to be three to five years away, which suggests a release sometime between 2006 and 2009. Actress Lucy Lawless has been quoted in several interviews saying she would be interested in participating in a Xena film as well.Costume donation:  In 2006, Lucy Lawless donated her personal Xena costume to the Museum of American History. In an interview the same year with Smithsonian magazine, she was asked the question \"Was the Warrior Princess outfit comfortable?\" and she responded: Not at first, because they would put boning in the corset. It would cover up those little floating ribs that are so important for breathing, so I'd feel like I was having panic attacks. But it just became a second skin after a while. It was very functional, once I got over the modesty factor. I admit to being a little bit embarrassed the first couple weeks because I'd never worn anything so short.External links: Women Wiki Sabrina the Teenage Witch (TV series)  An American sitcom based on the Archie comic book series of the same name. Its first four seasons aired on ABC (ITV, In the UK) from September 27, 1996 to May 5, 2000; the final three seasons ran on The WB Television Network from September 22, 2000 to April 24, 2003.Plot:  The show chronicles the adventures of Sabrina Spellman (Melissa Joan Hart), a girl who discovers on her sixteenth birthday that she is a witch. As a novice witch, her spells often go awry. Hilda and Zelda Spellman (Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick, respectively), her aunts, counsel her on the proper use of her magic and give her moral advice. Additionally,  Hilda and Zelda must take care of Salem Saberhagen, a warlock turned into a black cat for trying to take over the world. Sabrina's basic premise and \"genial loopiness\" earned the show comparisons to the 1960s television series Bewitched.Films:  There are three television movies made for the Sabrina the Teenage Witch television series, one of which serves as the television pilot, and two are films within the series:External links: Women Wiki Images Women Wiki Madonna Louise Ciccone Ritchie  (born August 16, 1958), known as Madonna, is an American recording artist and entertainer. Born in Bay City, Michigan and raised in Rochester Hills, Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City for a career in modern dance. After performing as member of the pop musical groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her self-titled debut album in 1983, and then produced three consecutive number-one studio albums on the Billboard 200 in the 1980s and four more since year 2000. Madonna is known for exploring religious symbolism and sexual themes in her work. This drew criticism from the Vatican in the late 1980s. Madonna has acted in 22 films. Although many failed critically and commercially, she earned a Golden Globe Award for her role in the 1996 film Evita. In 1996 Madonna gave birth to a daughter, Lourdes Maria (also known as Lola) by personal trainer Carlos Leon before marrying film director Guy Ritchie in 2000. She and Ritchie have two sons, Rocco and David Banda, a Malawian boy they adopted in 2006, which caused media allegations they violated that country's adoption laws.Influences:  Madonna's Catholic background and relationship with her parents were reflected in the album Like a Prayer. It is also an evocation of the impact religion had on her career. Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata. During The Virgin Tour, she wore a rosary and prayed with it in the music video for \"La Isla Bonita\". Madonna has also referred to her Italian heritage in her work. The video for \"Like a Virgin\", features Venetian settings. The \"Open Your Heart\" video sees her boss scolding her in Italian. In Ciao, Italia! - Live from Italy, the video release of her Who's That Girl Tour, she dedicates the song \"Papa Don't Preach\" to the Pope (\"Papa\" is the Italian word for \"Pope\".) In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin\" by Nancy Sinatra and that it summed up her \"take-charge attitude.\" As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was baroque, and loved Mozart and Chopin because she liked their \"feminine quality\". In 1999, Madonna identified musical influences that impacted her such as Karen Carpenter, The Supremes and Led Zeppelin, and dancers like Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev. In an interview with The Observer, Madonna professed her inspirations\u2014Detroit natives The Raconteurs and The White Stripes, as well as New York band The Jett Set.David Banda adoption:  In October 2006, Madonna traveled to Malawi to help build an orphanage, which she also funded as part of the Raising Malawi initiative. On October 10, 2006, she filed adoption papers for a boy named David Banda Mwale, born on September 24, 2005 and renamed David Banda Mwale, Ciccone Ritchie. Banda was flown out of Malawi on October 16. The adoption raised public controversy because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting. The effort was highly publicised and culminated in legal disputes.Tours:  Madonna has had eight successful tours in the course of her career, being:See also Women Wiki Eris (mythology)  the Greek goddess of strife, her name being translated into Latin as Discordia.

In this story, the Apple of Discord was to be presented as a genuine wedding present to Thetis, and Eris is abdicated from any wrong-doing. In this retelling of the Erisian myth, it's the greed and vanity of the other goddesses that caused the squabble rather than it coming from Eris intentions.Units of Measurement Wiki Ancient Roman units of length or distance  The ancient Romans were sophisticated engineers, and consequently had well-defined units of measuring lengths and distances, and their relationships to each other are well known. However, no actual Roman standards are definitively known by the present day, so that the only way of determining the length of any Roman unit would be to measure something in modern terms whose length was given by the Romans in their units. The Romans were in the habit of putting mileposts on their roads, and these roads have, at least in some cases, survived to the present day, and thus a measurement of the distances they indicate (though requiring statistical treatment to allow for the inaccuracies of the Romans' own measurements) can be used to calculate the length of one unit, the Roman mile. (In fact, although the term Roman mile, or simply mile when the reference to Ancient Roman standards is obvious, is often used to translate the Latin mille passuum, it is not at all clear that one can consider this to be an actual Roman unit of length or distance. The Latin phrase simply means \u201c1000 paces,\u201d so that a distance given as \u201cseptem milia passuum,\u201d though usually translated as \u201cseven miles,\u201d might with more accuracy be translated as \u201cseven thousand paces.\u201d) The measurements of the distances indicated by Roman mileposts give the best estimate of the Roman mile as 1472 m = 1609.799 yd = 0.915 mi, and this distance will be adopted on this wiki as the basis for interpreting all other Ancient Roman units of length or distance, as their relation to the mile is known.Additional relationships  It may be noted that, while this table shows each unit in terms of the next smaller one, it is probably more convenient to think of the palmip\u0113s as 5 palm\u012b and the cubitus as 6 palm\u012b than the equivalences shown in the table; similarly, the gradus can better be thought of as 2 palmiped\u0113s, and the Roman mile was certainly thought of as 1000 pass\u016bs, as the name actually indicated.References Units of Measurement Wiki BRG  My first encounter with wiki editing was on Wikipedia about 2003. I did a lot of edits there, and I still do some editing there; you can see my user page on Wikipedia for a more detailed description of myself. More recently, however, I have grown tired of the direction which Wikipedia has taken, with endless disputes over notability and whether a source is reliable. More and more I have turned to the specialized encyclopedias on Wikia as a way to avoid these disputes. I currently am an administrator of six wikis on Wikia: There are also a few wikis I contribute to:Units of Measurement Wiki Units of Measurement Wiki Featured article  Ancient Greece consisted of a number of city-states, each with its own set of measurement standards. The most important of these city-states, Athens, eventially came to have dominion over much of the area, so that the Attic Greek units of length or distance (as well as their units of measurement for other quantities) became standard for a large region, and this page tabulates those Attic Greek units. Although the Greek units of measuring lengths and distances were well-defined and their relationships to each other are well known, no actual Ancient Greek (Attic or other) standards are definitively known by the present day, so that the only way of determining the length of any Attic Greek unit would be to measure something in modern terms whose length was given by the Greeks in their units. And because this procedure does not give us any clue to which unit may have been the base unit and which were subsidiary units, this distinction really does not apply to the Attic Greek units here given, so all the units really have equal status. However, such measurements have been made, and they indicate (though requiring statistical treatment to allow for the inaccuracies of the Greeks' own measurements) that the best estimate of the Attic Greek pous (foot) can be taken as 0.30856 m = 1.0123 ft = 0.3374 yd , and this distance will be adopted on this wiki as the basis for interpreting all other Attic Greek units of length or distance, as their relation to the mile is known.References Units of Measurement Wiki BRG/test  10bar (10Pa)Units of Measurement Wiki Pound (mass)  The pound or pound-mass (abbreviations: lb, lb, lbm, \u2114 ) is a unit of mass used in the imperial, United States customary and other systems of measurement. A number of different definitions have been used, the most common today being the international avoirdupois pound which is legally defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms. The unit is descended from the Roman libra (hence the abbreviation \"lb\"); the name pound is a Germanic adaptation of the Latin phrase libra pondo, 'a pound weight'. Usage of the unqualified term pound reflects the historical conflation of mass and weight resulting from the near uniformity of gravity on Earth. This accounts for the modern distinguishing terms pound-mass and pound-force.Current use  The United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations agreed upon common definitions for the pound and the yard. Since 1 July 1959, the international avoirdupois pound has been defined as exactly 0.45359237 kg. In the United Kingdom, the use of the international pound was implemented in the Weights and Measures Act 1963. An avoirdupois pound is equal to 16 avoirdupois ounces and to exactly 7,000 grains. The conversion factor between the kilogram and the international pound was therefore chosen to be divisible by 7, and an (international) grain is thus equal to exactly 64.79891 milligrams.Historic use  Historically, in different parts of the world, at different points in time, and for different applications, the pound (or its translation) has referred to broadly similar but not identical standards of mass or force.In Britain  A number of different definitions of the pound have been used in Britain. Amongst these are the avoirdupois pound and the obsolete tower, merchant's, and London pounds. The weight of precious metals when given in pounds and/or ounces usually assumes Troy pounds and ounces; these units are not otherwise used today. Historically the pound sterling was a tower pound of silver. In 1528 the standard was changed to the Troy pound.In the United States  In the United States, the avoirdupois pound as a unit of mass has been officially defined in terms of the kilogram since the Mendenhall Order of 1893. That Order defined the pound to be 2.20462 pounds to a kilogram. The following year this relationship was refined as 2.20462234 pounds to a kilogram, following a determination of the British pound. According to a 1959 NIST publication, the international pound differed from the United States 1894 pound by approximately one part in 10 million. The difference is so insignificant that it can be ignored for almost all practical purposes.Roman libra  The libra (Latin for \"scales / balance\") is an ancient Roman unit of mass that was equivalent to approximately 328.9 grams. It was divided into 12 uncia, or ounces. The libra is the origin of the abbreviation for pound, lb. The commonly used abbreviation lbs to indicate the plural unit of measurement does not reflect Latin usage, in which lb is both the singular and plural abbreviation.Byzantine litra  The Byzantine litra, more specifically the logarik\u0113 or chrysaphik\u0113 type used for gold, was equivalent to between 319 and 324 grams. Template:HarvnbFrench livre  Template:See also Since the Middle Ages, various pounds (livre) have been used in France. Since the 19th century, a livre has referred to the metric pound, 500g. The livre esterlin was equivalent to about 367.1 g and was used between the late 9th century and the mid-14th century. The livre poids de marc or livre de Paris was equivalent to about 489.5 grams (7,555 gr) and was used between the 1350s and the late 18th century. It was introduced by the government of John II. The livre m\u00e9trique was set equal to the kilogram by the decree of 13 Brumaire an IX between 1800 and 1812. This was a form of official metric pound. The livre usuelle was defined as 500 grams, by the decree of 28 March 1812. It was abolished as a unit of mass effective 1 January 1840 by a decree of 4 July 1837, but is still used informally.German and Austrian Pfund  Originally derived from the Roman libra, the definition varied throughout Germany in the Middle Ages and onward. The measures and weights of the Habsburg monarchy were reformed in 1761 by Empress Maria Theresia of Austria. The unusually heavy Habsburg (civil) pound of 16 ounces was later defined in terms of 560.012 grams. Bavarian reforms in 1809 and 1811 adopted essentially the same standard pound. In Prussia, a reform in 1816 defined a uniform civil pound in terms of the Prussian foot and distilled water, resulting in a Prussian pound of 467.711 grams. Between 1803 and 1815 all German regions west of the River Rhine were French, organised in the departements: Roer, Sarre, Rhin-et-Moselle, and Mont-Tonnerre. As a result of the Congress of Vienna these became part of various German states. However, many of these regions retained the metric system and adopted a metric pound of precisely 500 grams. In 1854 the pound of 500 grams also became the official mass standard of the German Customs Union, but local pounds continued to co-exist with the Zollverein pound for some time in some German states. Nowadays, the term Pfund is still in common use and universally refers to a pound of 500 grams.Russian funt  The Russian pound (\u0424\u0443\u043d\u0442, funt) is an obsolete Russian unit of measurement of mass. It is equal to 409.51718 grams.Sk\u00e5lpund  The Sk\u00e5lpund was a Scandinavian measurement that varied in weight between regions. From the 17th century onward, it was equal to 425.076 grams in Sweden but was abandoned in 1889 when Sweden switched to the metric system. In Norway the same name was used for a weight of 498.1 grams. In Denmark it equalled 471 grams. In the 19th century Denmark followed Germany's lead and redefined the pound as 500 grams.Jersey pound  A Jersey pound is an obsolete unit of mass used on the island of Jersey from the 14th century to the 19th century. It was equivalent to about 7,561 grains (490 grams). It may have been derived from the French livre poids de marc.Trone pound  The trone pound is one of a number of obsolete Scottish units of measurement. It was equivalent to between 21 and 28 avoirdupois ounces (about 600-800 grams).Metric pounds  In many countries upon the introduction of a metric system, the pound (or its translation) became an informal term for 500 grams, The Dutch pond is an exception. It was officially redefined as 1 kilogram, with an ounce of 100 grams, but people seldom use it this way. In daily life pond is exclusively used for amounts of 500 grams, and to a lesser extent, ons for 100 grams. In German the term is Pfund, in French livre, in Dutch pond, in Spanish and Portuguese libra, in Italian libbra, and in Danish and Swedish pund. Though not from the same linguistic origin, the Chinese jin (also known a \"catty\") has a modern definition of exactly 500 grams, divided into ten cun. Traditionally about 605 grams, the jin has been in use for more than two thousand years, serving the same purpose as \"pound\" for the common-use measure of weight. Hundreds of older pounds were replaced in this way. Examples of the older pounds are one of around 459 to 460 grams in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America; one of 498.1 grams in Norway; and several different ones in what is now Germany. Although the use of the pound as an informal term persists in these countries to a varying degree, scales and measuring devices are denominated only in grams and kilograms. A pound of product must be determined by weighing the product in grams as the use of the pound is not sanctioned for trade within the European Union.Use in weaponry  Smoothbore cannon and carronades are designated by the weight in imperial pounds of round solid iron shot of diameter to fit the barrel. A cannon that fires a six-pound ball, for example, is called a six-pounder. Standard sizes are 6, 12, 18, 24, 32 and 42 pounds; 68-pounders also exist, and other nonstandard weapons use the same scheme. See carronade. A similar definition, using lead balls, exists for determining the gauge of shotguns.Notes External links  See also wiktionary:pound in Wiktionary, the free dictionaryConversion between units Units of Measurement Wiki Old Castilian units of length or distance  The old Castilian units of length or distance are listed in the following table. The names \"pulgada,\" \"pie,\" \"vara,\" and \"milla\" are often used as Spanish translations of the corresponding United States customary units when measurements in those units are translated into Spanish. No actual Castilian standards are definitively known by the present day, so that the only way of determining the length of any Old Castilian unit would be to measure something in modern terms whose length was given by the Castilians in their units. And because this procedure does not give us any clue to which unit may have been the base unit and which were subsidiary units, this distinction really does not apply to the Old Castilian units here given, so all the units really have equal status. However, most references appear to have treated the vara (Castilian yard) as the base unit, expressing other units in terms of the vara. The values in this table are based on the figure of 0.835905 m for the length of the vara, given by Cardarelli in his tabulation, which has presumably been determined by measurements of distances expressed in terms of the vara. This value is given in Wikipedia as well. Other values have been found in the literature as well, differing slightly from Cardarelli's. Entries in this table are from Cardarelli, except that two units not cited by Cardarelli have been added: the coto = \u215b vara (not to be confused with the codo which is four times as large), and cordel = 50 varas. It should be noted that Cardarelli writes \"codo\" as \"codoc\" in his table, but this unit does not look like a Spanish name, and \"codo\" appears to be the correct name. A somewhat different table of equivalences is given by Woolhouse. Note that he gives the equivalences in terms of British linear measure as of 1864, but the difference between the standard Imperial yard of that time and the modern International yard are inconsequential. The metric values are thus given by conversion, assuming the value of the international units.References Units of Measurement Wiki Unit force-mass system Units of Measurement Wiki Conversion of units  Conversion of units is the conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors.Techniques Process  The process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose. This may be governed by regulation, contract, Technical specifications or other published standards. Engineering judgment may include such factors as: Some conversions from one system of units to another need to be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the first measurement. This is sometimes called soft conversion. It does not involve changing the physical configuration of the item being measured. By contrast, a hard conversion or an adaptive conversion may not be exactly equivalent. It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item. Nominal values are sometimes allowed and used.Multiplication factors  Conversion between units in the metric system can be discerned by their prefixes; for example, 1 kilogram = 1000\u00a0grams, 1 milligram = 0.001\u00a0grams) and are thus not listed in this article. Exceptions are made if the unit is commonly known by another name (for example, 1 micron = 10 meter).Table ordering  Within each table, the units are listed alphabetically, and the SI units (base or derived) are highlighted.Tables of conversion factors  This article gives lists of conversion factors for each of a number of physical quantities, which are listed in the index. For each physical quantity, a number of different units (some only of historical interest) are shown and expressed in terms of the corresponding SI unit.Mass  Notes:Speed or velocity  A velocity consists of a speed combined with a direction; the speed part of the velocity takes units of speed.Force  See also: Conversion between weight (force) and massTemperature  Template:DetailsInformation entropy  Often, information entropy is measured in shannons, whereas the (discrete) storage space of digital devices is measured in bits. Thus, uncompressed redundant data occupy more than one bit of storage per shannon of information entropy. The multiples of a bit listed above are usually used with this meaning. Other times the bit is used as a measure of information entropy and is thus a synonym of shannon.Luminous intensity  The candela is the preferred nomenclature for the SI unit.Radiation - source activity  Please note that although becquerel (Bq) and hertz (Hz) both ultimately refer to the same SI base unit (s), Hz is used only for periodic phenomena, and Bq is only used for stochastic processes associated with radioactivity.Radiation - exposure  The roentgen is not an SI unit and the Template:WNational Institute of Standards and Technology strongly discourages its continued use.Radiation - equivalent dose  Although the definitions for sievert (Sv) and gray (Gy) would seem to indicate that they measure the same quantities, this is not the case. The effect of receiving a certain dose of radiation (given as Gy) is variable and depends on many factors, thus a new unit was needed to denote the biological effectiveness of that dose on the body; this is known as the equivalent dose and is shown in Sv. The general relationship between absorbed dose and equivalent dose can be represented as where H is the equivalent dose, D is the absorbed dose, and Q is a dimensionless quality factor. Thus, for any quantity of D measured in Gy, the numerical value for H measured in Sv may be different.Software tools  Home and office computers come with converters in bundled spreadsheet applications or can access free converters via the Internet.

The only way of determining the length of any Ancient Hebrew unit would be to measure something in modern terms whose length was given by the Hebrews in their units. Unlike the Attic Greek and Ancient Roman units, there are not good examples of such measurable objects, so much of the information we have is based on guesswork. According to Cardarelli they are based upon two different standards: The table in Wikipedia is somewhat different, giving a range, which includes Cardarelli's secular values near the upper limit, but does not reach his values for the sacred system: It should be noted that the transliterations are according to the modern Israeli pronunciation, accounting for the difference between zeret and Cardarelli's zereth, which more closely approximates the pronunciation in ancient times. Also, the mil and parasa are importations, the former from Roman usage, the latter from Persian.References Units of Measurement Wiki United States customary units of length or distance  The United States still, for most purposes, uses the traditional, non-metric units. For length or distance, they were originally based on a prototype yard which was intended to be identical to the one used in the United Kingdom. Although in 1866 a law was passed defining the yard as /meter, since the law did not disestablish the prototype that had been in use, it is considered that the 1866 statute did not change the standard, and in fact defined a United States standard meter which was not precisely equal to the meter used elsewhere (though the difference was never measured to be enough to matter, using the instruments of the day). In 1893, an order by Thomas C. Mendenhall redesignated the yard as / m, but it is generally understood that, unlike the 1866 statute, the Mendenhall Order defined the yard in terms of the internationally recognized meter. This yard = / m = 0.9144018288 m was the standard of length in the United States until July 1, 1959, when a new definition took effect as a result of an agreement with the nations of the Commonwealth of Nations. The yard was reduced to exactly 0.9144 m, longer than the previous United Kingdom value, but equal to that which was current in Canada. The United Kingdom implemented this agreement in 1963, with a Weights and Measures Act of that year. Since a number of surveys had been performed using the older standard units, the survey foot was retained as a specialized unit = / m = 0.3048006096 m, only for the purposes of mapping places that had been surveyed under the older standards. The length units of the U. S. customary system (identical, since 1963, with the British Imperial system) are as follows:Units of Measurement Wiki Definition from SI name  10 [[{{{2}}}]]Units of Measurement Wiki Kilogram  The kilogram or kilogramme, (symbol: kg) is the SI base unit of mass. It is defined as being equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram. It is the only SI base unit that employs a prefix [1], and the only SI unit that is still defined in relation to an artifact rather than to a fundamental physical property. A kilogram is equivalent to 2.205 avoirdupois pounds in the United States customary system that is still used in the United States, although usage is officially discouraged and the metric system is the preferred system of use.Definition  The kilogram was originally defined as the mass of one liter of pure water at a temperature of 3.98 degrees Celsius and standard atmospheric pressure. This definition was hard to realize accurately, partially because the density of water depends ever-so-slightly on the pressure, and pressure units include mass as a factor, introducing a circular dependency in the definition of the kilogram. To avoid these problems, the kilogram was redefined as precisely the mass of a particular standard mass created to approximate the original definition. Since 1889, the SI system defines the unit to be equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram, which is made from an alloy of platinum and iridium of 39 mm height and diameter, and is kept at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures).

The gram was the base unit of the older CGS system of measurement, a system which is no longer widely used.Proposed future definitions  There is an ongoing effort to introduce a new definition for the kilogram by way of fundamental or atomic constants. The proposals being worked on are:Atom-counting approaches Fundamental-constant approaches  where m = 9.109382616 x10 -\u00b3\u00b9KgLink with weight  When the weight of an object is given in kilograms, the property intended is almost always mass. Occasionally the gravitational force on an object is given in \"kilograms\", but the unit used is not a true kilogram: it is the deprecated kilogram-force (kgf), also known as the kilopond (kp). An object of mass 1 kg at the surface of the Earth will be subjected to a gravitational force of approximately 9.80665 newtons (the SI unit of force). Note that the factor of 980.665 cm/s\u00b2 (as the CGPM defined it, when cgs systems were the primary systems used) is only an agreed-upon conventional value (3rd CGPM (1901), CR 70) whose purpose is to define grams force. The local gravitational acceleration g varies with latitude and altitude and location on the Earth, so before this conventional value was agreed upon, the gram-force was only an ill-defined unit. (See also gee, a standard measure of gravitational acceleration.)Examples SI multiples  * Warning!: mcg is often used because the \u00b5 symbol may be unavailable; however, this is misleading and dangerous (if not wrong) because, in SI, mcg means millicentigram, not microgram.See also External links Units of Measurement Wiki Measurable quantities  This category includes all quantities for which a unit of measurement exists.Units of Measurement Wiki Unit force-mass foot-pound-second system  In the unit force-mass foot-pound-second system, the base unit of length (equivalently, of distance) is the foot, and the base unit of time is the second. The name pound is applied to both the unit of mass and the unit of force (equivalently, of weight), though, since these are in fact different quantities, it would be better to refer to two separate units, the pound-mass and the pound-force, as base units of the unit force-mass foot-pound-second system. This system is actually in accord with the way the term pound is used by most people who are not physical scientists nor engineers, and even in some engineering applications. The pound-force, the unit of weight, is the weight (at some definite point on the Earth's surface) of an object whose mass is the standard pound-mass of the system. In the absolute foot-pound-second system, it was required to create a unit of force with a new, unfamiliar name, and similarly, in the gravitational foot-pound-second system, it was required to create a unit of mass with a new, unfamiliar name. This is unnecessary in the unit force-mass foot-pound-second system, which is an advantage to some. However, the fact that the term pound has two different meanings, the pound-mass and the pound-force, which need to be distinguished, is a disadvantage. In such a system, Newton's second law cannot be expressed simply as F = ma, but needs to be written F = kma, where k is a specific constant characteristic of the system. And k is not simply a pure dimensionless constant, but in order to make the equation consistent, if the unit of length or distance is denoted by L, the unit of force by F, the unit of mass by M, and the unit of time by T, k must have dimensions FMLT, in this case pound\u00b7second/pound\u00b7foot, where the subscripts f and m refer to the force and mass units designated by the name pound. The result is also that this value of k appears in a number of other equations.Common usage  As the term pound is used in the United States, and has been used as well in the countries employing the British Imperial system of units, to denote both a unit of mass and a unit of force, the common system in use in the US and formerly in the other countries is by implicaton the unit force-mass FPS system.See also References Units of Measurement Wiki Attic Greek units of length or distance  Ancient Greece consisted of a number of city-states, each with its own set of measurement standards. The most important of these city-states, Athens, eventially came to have dominion over much of the area, so that the Attic Greek units of length or distance (as well as their units of measurement for other quantities) became standard for a large region, and this page tabulates those Attic Greek units. Although the Greek units of measuring lengths and distances were well-defined and their relationships to each other are well known, no actual Ancient Greek (Attic or other) standards are definitively known by the present day, so that the only way of determining the length of any Attic Greek unit would be to measure something in modern terms whose length was given by the Greeks in their units. And because this procedure does not give us any clue to which unit may have been the base unit and which were subsidiary units, this distinction really does not apply to the Attic Greek units here given, so all the units really have equal status. However, such measurements have been made, and they indicate (though requiring statistical treatment to allow for the inaccuracies of the Greeks' own measurements) that the best estimate of the Attic Greek pous (foot) can be taken as 0.30856 m = 1.0123 ft = 0.3374 yd , and this distance will be adopted on this wiki as the basis for interpreting all other Attic Greek units of length or distance, as their relation to the mile is known.References Units of Measurement Wiki Toise (French pre-revolutionary)  The toise (never translated, though it was approximately the same as the fathom, and so could be rendered by that word in translation) was the base unit of length or distance of the French pre-revolutionary system of units. It was sometimes referred to as the toise de Perou. (See also Index of fathom-size units.)Value in terms of modern units  At the time the metric system was adopted in France, the toise was declared to be 1.9490365 m. This would be the equivalent of 2.131492235564308 yd. For other values of the toise used elsewhere in France, seeRelation to other French pre-revolutionary length units References Units of Measurement Wiki Pound (British Tower system)  The system called tower weight was the more general name for King Offa's pound. This dates to 757 AD and was based on the silver penny. This in turn was struck over Arabic dirhams (2d). The pound was based on the weight of 120 Arabic silver dirhams, which have been found in Offa's Dyke. The same coin weight was used throughout the Hanseatic League. The mercantile pound (1304) of 6750 troy grains, or 9600 tower grains, derives from this pound, as 25 shilling-weights or 15 tower ounces, for general commercial use. Multiple pounds based on the same ounce were quite common. In much of Europe, the apothecaries' and commercial pounds were different numbers of the same ounce. The tower system was referenced to a standard prototype found in the Tower of London and ran concurrently with the avoirdupois and troy systems, until it fell out of use and was abolished in 1527. The tower pound is equivalent to about 350 grams.References Units of Measurement Wiki Mass versus weight  In everyday usage, the mass of an object is often referred to as its weight though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. In scientific contexts, mass refers loosely to the amount of \"matter\" in an object (though \"matter\" may be difficult to define), whereas weight refers to the force experienced by an object due to gravity. In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilograms will weigh 9.8 newtons (newton is the unit of force, while kilogram is the unit of mass) on Earth (its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength). Its weight will be less on Mars (where gravity is weaker), more on Saturn, and negligible in space when far from any significant source of gravity. Objects on the surface of the Earth have weight, although sometimes this weight is difficult to measure. An example is a small object floating in a pool of water, or even a dish of water, which does not appear to have weight since buoyed by the water, but is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported and weighed on a scale. Thus, the \"weightless object\" floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container (where the pressure increases). Similarly, a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even negative weight, due to buoyancy in air. However, in the case of buoyancy, the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface (in fact the entire surface, eventually), making the weight difficult to measure. The weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. If the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the Earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread over a larger area. A better scientific definition of mass describes it as having inertia, the resistance of an object to being accelerated when acted on by an external force. Gravitational \"weight\" is the force created when a mass is acted upon by a gravitational field and the object is not allowed to free-fall, but is supported or retarded by a mechanical force, such as the surface of a planet. Such a force confers weight. Such weights can be added to by the weight created from any kind of mechanical force. For example, in the illustrative photograph, the girl\u2019s weight (force due to gravity and the inertial force resisting circular acceleration) is being supported by the swing seat and swing set. If one stands behind her at the bottom of her arc and abruptly stops her, the \"bump\" or stopping-force one experiences is due to acting against her inertia, and would be the same force even if gravity were not present. Such forces also confer a type of weight, which could be measured. While the weight of a mass is a function of the strength of gravity, the mass of an object is constant for any given observer, so long as no energy or matter is added to the object. Accordingly, for an astronaut on a spacewalk in orbit (a free-fall), no effort is required to hold a communications satellite in front of him; it is \"weightless\". However, since objects in orbit retain their mass and inertia, an astronaut must exert ten times as much force to accelerate a 10\u2011ton satellite at the same rate as one with a mass of only 1\u00a0ton. On Earth, a swing set can demonstrate this relationship of force, mass, and acceleration without being appreciably influenced by weight (downward force). If one were to stand behind a large adult sitting stationary in a swing and give him a strong push, the adult would accelerate relatively slowly and swing only a limited distance forwards before beginning to swing backwards. Exerting that same effort while pushing on the small girl would produce much greater acceleration.Overview  Mass corresponds to the general, everyday notion of how \"heavy\" something is. However, mass is actually an inertial property; that is, the tendency of an object to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force. Per Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s 331-year-old laws of motion and an important formula that sprang from his work, F =\u2009ma, an object with a mass, m, of one kilogram will accelerate, a, at one meter per second per second (about one-tenth the acceleration due to earth\u2019s gravity) when acted upon by a force, F, of one newton. Inertia is sensed when a bowling ball is pushed horizontally on a level, smooth surface. This is quite distinct from its weight, which is the downwards gravitational force of the bowling ball one must counter when holding it off the floor. Importantly, the weight of the bowling ball on the Moon would be one-sixth of that on the Earth although its mass remained unchanged. Consequently, wherever the physics of recoil kinetics (mass, velocity, inertia, inelastic and elastic collisions) dominate and the influence of gravity is a negligible factor, the behavior of objects remains consistent even where gravity is relatively weak. For instance, billiard balls on a billiards table would scatter and recoil with the same speeds and energies after a break shot on the Moon as on Earth; they would, however, drop into the pockets much more slowly. In the physical sciences, the terms \"mass\" and \"weight\" are rigidly defined as separate measures in order to enforce clarity and precision. In everyday use, given that most masses on Earth have weight and this relationship is usually highly proportional, \"weight\" often serves to describe both properties, its meaning being dependent upon context. For example, in commerce, the net weight of retail products actually refers to mass and is properly expressed in pounds (U.S.) or kilograms (see also Pound: Use in commerce). Conversely, the load index rating on automobile tires, which specifies the maximum structural load for a tire in kilograms, refers to weight; that is, the force due to gravity. Before the late twentieth century, this distinction was not as strictly applied, even in technical writing, so that expressions such as \"molecular weight\" (for molecular mass) are still seen. Because mass and weight are separate quantities, they have different units of measure. In the International System of Units (SI), the kilogram is the unit of mass, and the newton is the unit of force. The non-SI kilogram-force is also a unit of force typically used in the measure of weight. Similarly, the avoirdupois pound, used in both the Imperial system and U.S. customary units, is a unit of mass and its related unit of force is the pound-force.Converting units of mass to equivalent forces on Earth  When an object\u2019s weight (its gravitational force) is expressed in kilograms, the unit of measure is not a true kilogram; it is the kilogram-force (kgf or kg-f), also known as the kilopond (kp), which is a non-SI unit of force. All objects on Earth are subject to a gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.8\u00a0m/s. The CGPM (also known as the \"General Conference on Weights and Measures\") fixed the value of standard gravity at precisely 9.80665\u00a0m/s so that disciplines such as metrology would have a standard value for converting units of defined mass into defined forces and pressures. In fact, the kilogram-force is defined as precisely 9.80665 newtons. As a practical matter, gravitational acceleration (symbol: g) varies slightly with latitude, elevation and subsurface density; these variations are typically only a few tenths of a percent. See also Gravimetry. Professionals in engineering and scientific disciplines involving accelerations and kinetic energies rigorously maintain the distinctions between mass, force, and weight, as well as their respective units of measure. Engineers in disciplines involving weight loading (force on a structure due to gravity), such as structural engineering, first convert loads due to objects like concrete and automobiles\u2014which are always tallied in kilograms\u2014to newtons before continuing with their calculations. Primarily, this is because material properties like elastic modulus are measured and published in terms of the newton and pascal (a unit of pressure derived from the newton). For all practical engineering purposes on Earth, mass in kilograms is converted to weight in newtons by multiplying by 9.80665\u00a0m/s (standard gravity). ==Buoyancy and weight Usually, the relationship between mass and weight on Earth is highly proportional; objects that are a hundred times more massive than a one-liter bottle of soda almost always weigh a hundred times more\u2014approximately 1,000 newtons, which is the weight one would expect on Earth from an object with a mass slightly greater than 100 kilograms. Yet, this is not always the case and there are familiar objects that violate this mass\u2009/\u2009weight proportionality. A common helium-filled toy balloon is something familiar to many children. When such a balloon is fully filled with helium, it has buoyancy\u2014a force that opposes gravity. When a toy balloon becomes partially deflated, it will often become neutrally buoyant and can float about the house a meter or two off the floor. In such a state, there are moments when the balloon is neither rising nor falling and\u2014in the sense that a scale placed under it will have no force applied to it\u2014is, in a sense perfectly weightless (actually as noted below, weight has merely been redistribubed along the Earth's surface so it cannot be measured). Though the rubber comprising the balloon has a mass of only a few grams, which might be almost unnoticeable, the rubber still retains all its mass when inflated. Again, unlike the effect that low-gravity environments have on weight, buoyancy does not make a portion of an object\u2019s weight vanish; the missing weight is instead being borne by the ground, which leaves less force (weight) being applied to any scale theoretically placed underneath the object in question (though one may perhaps have some trouble with the practical aspects of accurately weighing something individually in that condition). If one were however to weigh a small wading pool that someone then entered and began floating in, they would find that the full weight of the person was being borne by the pool and, ultimately, the scale underneath the pool. Whereas a buoyant object (on a properly working scale for weighing buoyant objects) would weigh less, the object/fluid system becomes heavier by the value of object's full mass once the object is added. Since air is a fluid, this principle applies to object/air systems as well; large volumes of air\u2014and ultimately the ground\u2014supports the weight a body loses through mid-air buoyancy. The effects of buoyancy don\u2019t just affect balloons; both liquids and gases are fluids in the physical sciences, and when all macro\u2011size objects larger than dust particles are immersed in fluids on Earth, they have some degree of buoyancy. In the case of either a swimmer floating in a pool or a balloon floating in air, buoyancy can fully counter the gravitational weight of the of the object being weighed, for a weighing device in the pool. However, as noted, an object supported by a fluid is fundamentally no different than an object supported by a sling or cable\u2014the weight has merely been transferred to another location, not made to disappear. The mass of \"weightless\" (neutrally buoyant) balloons can be better appreciated with much larger hot air balloons. Although no effort is required to counter their weight when they are hovering over the ground (when they can often be within one hundred newtons of zero weight), the inertia associated with their appreciable mass of several hundred kilograms or more can knock fully grown men off their feet when the balloon\u2019s basket is moving horizontally over the ground. Buoyancy and the resultant reduction in the downward force of objects being weighed underlies Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. If this fluid is air, the force may be small.Buoyancy effects of air on measurement  Normally, the effect of air buoyancy on objects of normal density is too small to be of any consequence in day-to-day activities. For instance, buoyancy\u2019s diminishing effect upon one\u2019s body weight (a relatively low-density object) is / that of gravity (for pure water it is about / that of gravity). Furthermore, variations in barometric pressure will rarely affect one\u2019s weight more than \u00b11 part in 30,000. However, in metrology (the science of measurement), the precision mass standards for calibrating laboratory scales and balances are manufactured with such accuracy that air density is accounted for to compensate for buoyancy effects. Given the extremely high cost of platinum-iridium mass standards like the International Prototype Kilogram (the mass standard in France that defines the magnitude of the kilogram), high-quality \"working\" standards are made of special stainless steel alloys with densities of about 8,000\u00a0kg/m, which occupy greater volume than those made of platinum-iridium, which have a density of about 21,550\u00a0kg/m. For convenience, a standard value of buoyancy relative to stainless steel was developed for metrology work and this results in the term \"conventional mass\". Conventional mass is defined as follows: \"For a mass at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, \u2018conventional mass\u2019 is the mass of a reference standard of density 8,000\u00a0kg/m which it balances in air with a density of 1.2\u00a0kg/m.\" The effect is a small one, 150\u00a0ppm for stainless steel mass standards, but the appropriate corrections are made during the manufacture of all precision mass standards so they have the true labeled mass. Whenever a high-precision scale (or balance) in routine laboratory use is calibrated using stainless steel standards, the scale is actually being calibrated to conventional mass; that is, true mass minus 150\u00a0ppm of buoyancy. Since objects with precisely the same mass but with different densities displace different volumes and therefore have different buoyancies and weights, any object measured on this scale (compared to a stainless steel mass standard) has its conventional mass measured; that is, its true mass minus an unknown degree of buoyancy. In high-accuracy work, the volume of the article can be measured to mathematically null the effect of buoyancy.Types of scales and what they measure  > Technically, whenever someone stands on a balance-beam-type scale at a doctor\u2019s office, they are truly having their mass measured. This is because balances (\"dual-pan\" mass comparators) compare the weight of the mass on the platform with that of the sliding counterweights on the beams; gravity serves only as the force-generating mechanism that allows the needle to diverge from the \"balanced\" (null) point. Balances can be moved from Earth\u2019s equator to the poles without spuriously indicating that objects became over 0.3% more massive; they are immune to the gravity-countering centrifugal force due to Earth\u2019s rotation about its axis. Conversely, whenever someone steps onto spring-based or digital load cell-based scales (single-pan devices), they are technically having their weight (force due to strength of gravity) measured. On force-measuring instruments such as these, variations in the strength of gravity affect the reading. As a practical matter, when force-measuring scales are used in commerce or hospitals, they are calibrated on-site and certified on that basis so the measure is mass, expressed in pounds or kilograms, to the desired level of accuracy.Use in commerce  In the United States of America the United States Department of Commerce, the Technology Administration, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have defined the use of mass and weight in the exchange of goods under the Uniform Laws and Regulations in the areas of legal metrology and engine fuel quality in NIST Handbook 130. NIST Handbook 130 states: U.S. federal law, which supersedes this handbook, also defines weight, particularly Net Weight, in terms of the avoirdupois pound or mass pound. From 21CFR101 Part 101.105 \u2013 Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt: See also 21CFR201 Part 201.51 \u2013 \"Declaration of net quantity of contents\" for general labeling and prescription labeling requirements.See also Notes External links Units of Measurement Wiki Foot (United States customary)  The foot is a subsidiary unit of length in the United States customary system, defined as \u2153 yard. It should be noted that although the yard is officially the base unit, the foot is often taken as the base unit for comprehensive scientific and engineering systems of units. Over the course of history, it has been defined in three different ways:Prior to 1893  The original definition of the yard was based on a prototype yard which was intended to be identical to the one used in the United Kingdom, and the foot was one third of that distance. Although in 1866 a law was passed defining the yard as /meter (0.9144018288 m), making the foot equal to 0.3048006096 m, since the law did not disestablish the prototype that had been in use, it is considered that the 1866 statute did not change the standard, and in fact defined a United States standard meter which was not precisely equal to the meter used elsewhere (though the difference was never measured to be enough to matter, using the instruments of the day). This foot, based on the old prototype yard, remained the standard until 1893.1893-1959  In 1893, an order by Thomas C. Mendenhall redesignated the yard as / m (0.9144018288 m, the same definition as before), but it is generally understood that, unlike the 1866 statute, the Mendenhall Order defined the yard in terms of the internationally recognized meter. Since no measurements of the previous prototype yard have been made to current standards of precision in terms of the official meter as it was defined in 1893 (based on the prototype meter in France), it cannot be determined how great a change took place in the length of the United States standard yard in 1893. The standard foot based on this definition, equal to /meter (0.3048006096 m), was official in the United States until 1959. This foot, slightly longer than the foot which has been in use as a standard since July 1, 1959, is still in use for some mapping purposes as the survey foot.Since 1959  On July 1, 1959, a new definition took effect as a result of an agreement with the nations of the Commonwealth of Nations. The yard was reduced to exactly 0.9144 m, making the foot equal to exactly 0.3048 m, a compromise which was longer than the previous United Kingdom value, but equal to that which was current in Canada. It remains currently the official unit of length in the United States.Relation to other U. S. customary length units The foot-pound-second system of engineering units  Although the foot is officially a subsidiary unit under United States law, and the yard is the primary standard unit of length, for engineering purposes it has been normal to treat the foot as the primary length standard and build systems of mechanical units on it. Two different systems have been defined for measurements based on United States customary units: the foot-pound-second absolute system, in which the pound is a unit of mass, and the foot-pound-second gravitational system, in which the pound is a unit of force (or weight).Units of Measurement Wiki Metric system  The metric system is an international decimalized system of measurement that was originally based on the m\u00e8tre des archives and the kilogramme des archives introduced by France in 1799. Over the years the definitions of the meter and kilogram have been refined and the metric system extended to incorporate many more units. Although a number of variants of the metric system emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the term is now often used as a synonym for the \"International System of Units\" - the official system of measurement in almost every country in the world. The United States is the only industrialized country that does not use the metric system as its official system of measurement, although the metric system has been officially sanctioned for use there since 1866. Although the United Kingdom committed to officially adopting the metric system for many measurement applications, it is still not in universal use there and the customary imperial system is still in common and widespread use. Although the originators intended to devise a system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units under the custody of government or other approved authorities as standards. Until 1875, control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the French Government when it passed to an inter-governmental organisation\u00a0\u2013 the CGPM (CGPM). It is now hoped that the last of these prototypes can be retired by 2014. From its beginning, the main feature of the metric system was the standard set of inter-related base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller units and replaced a huge number of unstandardized units of measure that existed previously. While the system was first developed for commercial use, its coherent set of units made it particularly suitable for scientific and engineering purposes. The uncoordinated use of the metric system by different scientific and engineering disciplines, particularly in the late 19th century, resulted in different choices of fundamental units, even though all were based on the same definitions of the meter and the kilogram. During the 20th century, efforts were made to rationalize these units and in 1960 the CGPM published the International System of Units (\"Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s\" in French, hence \"SI\") which, since then, has been the internationally recognized standard metric system.Features  Although the metric system has changed and developed since its inception, its basic features have remained constant.Universality  The metric system was, in the words of the French philosopher Condorcet to be \"for all people for all time\". It was designed for ordinary people, for engineers who worked in human-related measurements and for astronomers and physicists who worked with numbers both small and large, hence the huge range of prefixes that have now been defined in SI. The metric system was designed to be universal, that is, available to all. When the French Government first investigated the idea of overhauling their system of measurement, Talleyrand, in the late 1780s, acting on Concordet's advice, invited Riggs, a British Parliamentarian and Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, to work with the French in producing an international standard by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies. However, these overtures failed and the custody of the metric system remained in the hands of the French Government until 1875. To help make it universal, common unit symbols that are independent of language were developed. Thus the length unit symbol \"km\" is used in French and in British English for \"kilometre\", in German, Danish and in American English for \"kilometer\", in Spanish for \"kil\u00f3metro\", in Portuguese for \"quil\u00f3metro\", in Italian for \"chilometro\", in Greek for \"\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\", in Russian for \"\u041a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\", in Urdu for \"\u06a9\u0644\u0648\u0645\u06cc\u0679\u0631\" and so on.Decimal multiples  The metric system is decimal, except where the non-SI units for time and plane angle measurement are concerned. All multiples and divisions of the decimal units are factors of the power of ten, an idea first proposed by the Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin in 1586. Decimal prefixes are a characteristic of the metric system; the use of base 10 arithmetic aids in unit conversion. Differences in expressing units are simply a matter of shifting the decimal point or changing an exponent; for example, the speed of light may be expressed as 299792.458\u00a0km/s or 2.99792458\u00d710\u00a0m/s. The use of decimal multiples results in less convenient non-integer quantities for divisions commonly used, such as by 3, 6 and 12.Prefixes  Template:Common metric prefixes A common set of decimal-based prefixes is applied to some units which are too large or too small for practical use without adjustment. The effect of the prefixes is to multiply or divide the unit by a factor of ten, one hundred or an integer power of one thousand. (This idea was first suggested by Mouton in 1670.) The prefix kilo, for example, is used to multiply the unit by 1000, and the prefix milli is to indicate a one-thousandth part of the unit. Thus the kilogram and kilometer are a thousand grams and meters respectively, and a milligram and millimeter are one thousandth of a gram and meter respectively. These relations can be written symbolically as: When applying prefixes to derived units of area and volume that are expressed in terms of units of length squared or cubed, the square and cube operators are applied to the unit of length including the prefix, as illustrated here: Prefixes are not usually used to indicate multiples of a second greater than 1; the non-SI units of minute, hour and day are used instead. On the other hand, prefixes are used for multiples of the non-SI unit of volume, the liter (l, L), or the stere (cubic meter). Examples: Initially positive powers of ten had Greek-derived prefixes and negative power of ten Latin-derived prefixes. The most familiar prefixes in everyday use are kilo- and mega-, which are of Greek origin, and centi- and milli-, which are of Latin origin. However, later SI extensions to the prefix system did not follow the Latin-less-than-one convention; instead, such prefixes (nano- and micro-, for example) use prefixes with Greek roots. During the 19th century the prefix myria-, derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 (m\u00fdrioi), was used as a multiplier for 10,000 (10).Replicable prototypes  The initial way to establish a standard was to make prototypes of the base units and distribute copies to approved centers. This made the new standard reliant on the original prototypes, which would be in conflict with the previous goal, since all countries would have to refer to the one holding the prototypes. Instead, where possible, definitions of the base units were developed so that any laboratory equipped with proper instruments would be able to construct their own copies of the standard. In the original version of the metric system the base units could be derived from a specified length (the meter) and the weight [mass] of a specified volume (/ of a cubic meter) of pure water. Initially the Assembl\u00e9e Constituante considered defining the meter as the length of a pendulum that has a period of one second at 45\u00b0N and an altitude equal to sea level. The altitude and latitude were specified to accommodate variations in gravity\u00a0\u2013 the specified latitude was a compromise between the latitude of London (51\u00b0 30'N), Paris (48\u00b0 50'N) and the median parallel of the United States (38\u00b0N) to accommodate variations. However Borda persuaded the Assembl\u00e9e Constituante that a survey having its ends at sea level and based on a meridian that spanned at least 10% of the earth's quadrant would be more appropriate for such a basis.Realizability  The base units used in the metric system must be realizable, ideally with reference to natural phenomena rather than unique artifacts. Each of the base units in SI is accompanied by a mise en pratique published by the BIPM that describes in detail at least one way in which the base unit can be measured. Two of the base units originally depended on artifacts \u2013 the meter and the kilogram. The original prototypes of each artifact were adopted in 1799 and replaced in 1889. The 1889 prototypes used the best technology of the day to ensure stability. In 1889 there was no generally accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype meter. In that year the prototype meter was replaced by a formal definition which defines the meter in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light was constant and that this provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length, the meter was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere to make their own \"standard\" meter (assuming that they have a good enough laboratory). Similarly, at the 13th convocation of the GCPM in 1968, the definitive second was redefined in terms of measurements taken from atomic clocks rather than from the earth's rotation; in 2008 the solar day was 0.002\u00a0s longer than in 1820 but it was only in the 1960s that this could be measured more accurately using clocks rather than relying on astronomy.Coherence  Each variant of the metric system has a degree of coherence\u00a0\u2013 the various derived units being directly related to the base units without the need of intermediate conversion factors. For example, in a coherent system the units of force, energy and power are chosen so that the equations hold without the introduction of constant factors. Once a set of coherent units have been defined, other relationships in physics that use those units will automatically be true - Einstein's mass-energy equation, E\u00a0=\u00a0mc, does not require extraneous constants when expressed in coherent units. The cgs system had two units of energy, the erg that was related to mechanics and the calorie that was related to thermal energy so only one of them (the erg) could bear a coherent relationship to the base units. Coherence was a design aim of SI resulting in only one unit of energy being defined - the joule. In SI, which is a coherent system, the unit of power is the \"watt\" which is defined as \"one joule per second\". In the foot-pound-second system of measurement, which is non-coherent, the unit of power is the \"horsepower\" which is defined as \"550 foot-pounds per second\", the pound in this context being the pound-force. The concept of coherence was only introduced into the metric system in the third quarter of the nineteenth century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent - in particular the liter was 0.001\u00a0m and the are (from which we get the hectare) was 100\u00a0m.History  In 1586, the Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende (\"the tenth\"). Decimal fractions had been employed for the extraction of square roots some five centuries before his time, but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life. Stevin declared that using decimals was so important that the universal introduction of decimal weights, measures and coinage was only a matter of time. The idea of a metric system was proposed by John Wilkins, first secretary of the Royal Society of London in 1668. Two years later, in 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and scientist, proposed a decimal system of measurement based on the circumference of the Earth. His suggestion was that a unit, the milliare, be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian. He then suggested a system of sub-units, dividing successively by factors of ten into the centuria, decuria, virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and millesima. His ideas attracted interest at the time, and were supported by both Jean Picard and Christiaan Huygens in 1673, and also studied at the Royal Society in London. In the same year, Gottfried Leibniz independently made proposals similar to those of Mouton. In pre-revolutionary Europe, each state had its own system of units of measure. Some countries, such as Spain and Russia, saw the advantages of harmonising their units of measure with those of their trading partners. However, vested interests who profited from variations in units of measure opposed this. This was particularly prevalent in France where there was a huge inconsistency in the size of units of measure. During the early years of the French Revolution, the leaders of the French revolutionary Assembl\u00e9e Constituante decided that rather than standardising the size of the existing units, they would a introduce a completely new system based on the principles of logic and natural phenomena. Initially France attempted to work with other countries towards the adoption of a common set of units of measure. Among the supporters of such an international system of units was Thomas Jefferson who, in 1790, presented a document Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States to congress in which he advocated a decimal system that used traditional names for units (such as ten inches per foot). The report was considered but not adopted by Congress. There was little support from other countries.Original system  The law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795) defined five units of measure: This system continued the tradition of having separate base units for geometrically related dimensions, e.g., meter for lengths, are (100 m) for areas, st\u00e8re (1 m) for dry capacities, and liter (1 dm) for liquid capacities. The hectare, equal to a hundred ares, is the area of a square 100 meters on a side (about 2.47 acres), and is still in use. The early metric system included only a few prefixes from milli (one thousandth) to myria (ten thousand), and they were based on powers of 10 unlike later prefixes added in the SI, which are based on powers of 1,000. Originally the kilogram was called the \"grave\"; the \"gram\" being an alternative name for a thousandth of a grave. However, the word \"grave\", being a synonym for the title \"count\" had aristocratic connotations and was renamed the kilogram. France officially adopted the metric system on 10 December 1799 with conversion being mandatory first in Paris and then across the provinces.International adoption  The areas that were annexed by France during the Napoleonic era inherited the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon introduced a system known as mesures usuelles which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of metric units \u2013 for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500\u00a0g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2\u00a0meters. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted a modified version of the mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact. In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced the metric system, but used pre-revolutionary names \u2013 for example 1\u00a0cm became the duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100\u00a0g and so on. Certain German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) adopted the zollpfund (customs pound) of 500\u00a0g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 the newly formed German Empire adopted the metric system as its official system of weights and measures and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, adopted the metric system in 1861. The Exposition Universelle (1867) (Paris exhibition) devoted a stand to the metric system and by 1875 two thirds of the European population and close on half the world's population had adopted the metric system. The principal European countries not to have adopted the metric system were Russia and the United Kingdom. The first attempt to have the US adopt the metric system was in the late 1920s by The General Federation of Women's Clubs for the US to adopt the metric system sending 100,000 petitions to Congress in 1927 with over seven million signatures. This first effort as with all future efforts failed as the old system had too much tradition behind it.International standards  In 1861, a committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and James Prescott Joule introduced the concept of a coherent system of units based on the meter, gram and second which, in 1873, was extended to include electrical units. On 20 May 1875 an international treaty known as the Convention du M\u00e8tre (meter Convention) was signed by 17 states. This treaty established the following organisations to conduct international activities relating to a uniform system for measurements: In 1881, first International Electrical Congress adopted the BAAS recommendations on electrical units, followed by a series of congresses in which further units of measure were defined.Variants  A number of variants of the metric system evolved, all using the M\u00e8tre des Archives and Kilogramme des Archives as their base units, but differing in the definitions of the various derived units.Centimeter-gram-second systems  The centimeter-gram-second system of units (CGS) was the first coherent metric system, having been developed in the 1860s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson. In 1874 this system was formally promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). The system's characteristics are that density is expressed in g/cm, force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs. Thermal energy was defined in calories, one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5\u00a0\u00b0C to 16.5\u00a0\u00b0C. The meeting also proposed two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties - the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of units.meter-kilogram-second systems  The cgs units of electricity were cumbersome to work with. This was remedied at the 1893 International Electrical Congress held in Chicago by defining the \"international\" ampere and ohm using definitions based on the meter, kilogram and second. In 1901, Giorgi showed that by adding an electrical unit as a fourth base unit, the various anomalies in electromagnetic systems could be resolved. The meter-kilogram-second-coulomb (MKSC) and meter-kilogram-second-ampere (MKSA) systems are examples of such systems. The International System of Units (System international units or SI) is the current international standard metric system and the system most widely used around the world. It is an extension of Giorgi's MKSA system; its base units are the meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, candela and mole. Proposals have been made to change the definitions of four of the base units at the 24th meeting of the CGPM in October 2011. These changes should not affect the average person.meter-tonne-second systems  The meter-tonne-second system of units (MTS) was based on the meter, tonne and second - the unit of force is the sth\u00e8ne and the unit of pressure is the pi\u00e8ze. It was invented in France in industry and was mostly used in the Soviet Union from 1933 to 1955.Gravitational systems  Gravitational metric systems use the kilogram-force (kilopond) as a base unit of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, TME, mug or metric slug. Note these are not part of the International System of Units (SI).International System of Units  The 9th CGPM met in 1948, fifteen years after the 8th CGPM. In response to formal requests made by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and by the French Government to establish a practical system of units of measure, the CGPM requested the CIPM to prepare recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the meter Convention. At the same time the CGPM formally adopted a recommendation for the writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers. The recommendation also catalogued the recommended symbols for the most important MKS and CGS units of measure and for the first time the CGPM made recommendations concerning derived units. The CIPM's draft proposal, which was an extensive revision and simplification of the metric unit definitions, symbols and terminology based on the MKS system of units, was put to the 10th CGPM in 1954. In accordance with Giorgi's proposals of 1901, the CIPM also recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical would be derived. The definitions for the ohm and volt that had previously been in use were discarded and these units became derived units based on the meter, ampere, second and kilogram. After negotiations with the CIS and IUPAP, two further base units, the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units. The full system and name \"Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s\" were adopted at the 11th CGPM. During the years that followed the definitions of the base units and particularly the mise en pratique to realise these definitions have been refined. The formal definition of International System of Units (SI) along with the associated resolutions passed by the CGPM and the CIPM are published by the BIPM on the Internet and in brochure form at regular intervals. The eighth edition of the brochure Le Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s - The International System of Units was published in 2006.Units outside the SI  Although SI, as published by the GCPM, should, in theory, meet all the requirements of commerce, science and technology, certain units of measure have acquired such a position within the world community that it is likely they will be used for many years to come. In order that such units be used consistently around the world, the SI Brochure, the GCPM catalogued such units in the SI brochure. The 8th edition of the brochure catalogued the following categories:\"New SI\"  When the meter was redefined in 1960, the kilogram was the only SI base unit that relied on a specific artifact. Moreover, after the 1996-1998 recalibration a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed. At its 23rd meeting (2007), the CGPM mandated the CIPM to investigate the use of natural constants as the basis for all units of measure rather than the artifacts that were then in use. At a meeting of the CCU held in Reading, United Kingdom in September 2010, a resolution and draft changes to the SI brochure that were to be presented to the next meeting of the CIPM in October 2010 were agreed to in principle. The proposals that the CCU put forward were: The CIPM meeting of October 2010 found that \"the conditions set by the General Conference at its 23rd meeting have not yet been fully met. For this reason the CIPM does not propose a revision of the SI at the present time\". The CIPM did however sponsor a resolution at the 24th CGPM in which the changes were agreed in principal and which were expected to be finalized at the CGPM's next meeting in 2014.Usage around the world  Template:Further2 The usage of the metric system varies around the world. According to the American Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook, the International System of Units is the official system of measurement for all nations in the world except for Burma, Liberia and the United States while NIST has noted that the United States as the only country where the metric system is not the offical system of units. Some sources, though, suggest that this information is out of date: an Agence France-Presse of 2010 noted that Sierra Leone was to adopt the metric system, thereby aligning her system of measurement with her Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia and reports from Burma suggest that that country is planning to adopt the metric system In the United States, where the use of metric units was authorized by Congress in 1866, such units are widely used in science, military, and partially in industry, but customary units predominate in household use. At retail stores, the liter is a commonly used unit for volume, especially on bottles of beverages, and milligrams are used to denominate the amounts of medications, rather than grains. Also, other standardized measuring systems other than metric are still in universal international use, such as nautical miles and knots in international aviation. In the countries of the Commonwealth of Nations the metric system has replaced the imperial system by varing degrees: Australia, New Zealand and Commonwealth countries in Africa are almost totally metric, India is mostly metric, Canada is partly metric while in the United Kingdom the metric system, the use of which was first permitted for trade in 1864, is used in much government business, in most industries including building, health and engineering and for pricing by measure or weight in most trading situations, both wholesale and retail. However the imperial system is often used by journalists and continues to be used in many unregulated applications. A number of other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, have laws mandating or permitting other systems of measurement in parallel with the metric system in some or all contexts.Variations in spelling  The SI symbols for the metric units are intended to be identical, regardless of the language used. For example, the SI unit symbol for kilometer is \"km\" everywhere in the world, even though the local language word for the unit name may vary. Language variants for the kilometer unit name include: chilometro (Italian), Kilometer (German), kilometer (Dutch, Malay), kilom\u00e8tre (French), \u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf (Greek), quil\u00f3metro (Portuguese) and \u041a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 (Bulgarian). Variations are also found with the spelling of unit names in countries using the same language, including differences in American English and British spelling. For example meter and liter are used in the United States whereas metre and litre are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term metric ton is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.Conversion and calculation errors  The dual usage of metric and non metric units has resulted in serious errors. These include:Conversion between SI and legacy units  During its evolution, the metric system has adopted many units of measure. The introduction of SI rationalized both the way in which units of measure were defined and also the list of units in use. These are now catalogued in the official SI Brochure. The table below lists the units of measure in this catalogue and shows the conversion factors connecting them with the equivalent units that were in use on the eve of the adoption of SI. The SI brouchure also catalogues certain non-SI units that are widely used with the SI in matters of everyday life or units that are exactly defined values in terms of SI units and are used in particular circumstances to satisfy the needs of commercial, legal, or specialized scientific interests. These units include:See also References External links Units of Measurement Wiki British Imperial units of length or distance  The British Imperial system of units was established on June 17, 1824, by the Weights and Measures Act. Strictly speaking, it is not correct to use the term British Imperial for units in use before that date, and they are better described as traditional British. The base unit of length or distance in the British Imperial system was the yard. The yard was defined as the distance between a pair of lines etched in gold plugs inserted in a bronze bar in the custody of the clerk of the House of Commons, which had been designated a standard yard in 1760, measured at 62 degrees Fahrenheit. The new yard was actually a standard that had been commissioned by the Royal Society in 1742, which in turn had been based on an earlier Elizabethan standard. In 1834, the burning of the Houses of Parliament destroyed this standard, which had served in an official capacity for only 9 years and 198 days, and new copies were prepared by reference to the best copies of the old standard that had been found. This standard became official in 1855. In 1878, an act conferming this standard was adopted, referring to one of those copies, kept in the Standards Department of the Board of Trade in London. This yard had a length of 0.914398416 m. (Cardarelli gives a value of 0.91443992 m, but this is in error.) For the pre-1963 lengths of the other units in this system, see the specific pages on those units. In 1963, a new Weights and Measures Act defined the yard in terms of the metric units, conforming to an agreement with the United States, so that the value has since then agreed with the International yard of 0.9144 m, slightly larger than the earlier value (but smaller than the value current in the United States prior to unification). In 1980, the British government began withdrawing authorization of many British Imperial units, though in 1985 the yard was reaffirmed as a standard by a new Weights and Measures Act of that year. In 1995, however, the metric system became compulsory for all official purposes in Britain. The length units of the British Imperial system (identical, since 1963, with the United States customary system) are given in the following table:References Units of Measurement Wiki Weight  In science and engineering, the weight of an object is the force on the object due to gravity. Its magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter W, is the product of the mass\u00a0m of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration\u00a0g; thus: W = mg. When considered a vector, weight is often denoted by a bold letter W. The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, about one-sixth as much on the Moon, and very nearly zero when in deep space far away from all bodies imparting gravitational influence. In contrast to this \"purely gravitational\" definition, some books use an \"operational\" definition, defining the weight of an object as the force measured by the operation of weighing it (using a force-sensitive scale, such as a spring scale), in vacuum. This is the force an object exerts on a scale, and is equal to the force required to support it (although in the opposite direction to the \"weight\" force). This force measured by force-scales is the same as what some other sources term the object's \"apparent weight\". These two definitions of weight differ, sometimes dramatically, when other factors intervene so that the force required to support a body is not exactly equal and opposite to the gravitational force acting on it. For example, in the operational definition, a mechanically accelerated object or person (as in an elevator, dragster or rocket) has a varying weight due to its varying proper acceleration (or g-force). However, according to the purely gravitational definition its weight does not change since gravity still exerts the same force (g in the equation W = mg is unchanged). In the case of an object in free fall, such as a falling apple, or an astronaut in an orbiting spacecraft, the operational definition says that the weight is zero. This is in keeping with the familiar concept that such objects are \"weightless\", and the fact that a scale indicates a zero weight as the body exerts no force on it. In contrast, by the purely gravitational definition, a body's weight in free fall is the same as if the body were at rest, again because, in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, the gravitational force acting on the body is unchanged. In everyday practical usage, including commercial usage, the term \"weight\" is commonly used to mean mass, which scientifically is an entirely different concept. On the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity (the \"strength of gravity\") is approximately constant; this means that the ratio of the weight force of a motionless object on the surface of the Earth to its mass is almost independent of its location, so that an object's weight force can stand as a proxy for its mass, and vice versa.History  Discussion of the concepts of heaviness (weight) and lightness (levity) date back to the ancient Greek philosophers. These were typically viewed as inherent properties of objects. Plato described weight as the natural tendency of objects to seek their kin. To Aristotle weight and levity represented the tendency to restore the natural order of the basic elements: air, earth, fire and water. He ascribed absolute weight to earth and absolute levity to fire. Archimedes saw weight as a quality opposed to buoyancy, with the conflict between the two determining if an object sinks or floats. The first operational definition of weight was given by Euclid, who defined weight as: \"weight is the heaviness or lightness of one thing, compared to another, as measured by a balance.\" According to Aristotle, weight was the direct cause of the falling motion of an object, the speed of the falling object was supposed to be directly proportionate to the weight of the object. As medieval scholars discovered that in practice the speed of a falling object increased with time, this prompted a change to the concept of weight to maintain this cause effect relationship. Weight was split into a \"still weight\" or pondus, which remained constant, and the actual gravity or gravitas, which changed as the object fell. The concept of gravitas was eventually replaced by Jean Buridan's impetus, a precursor to momentum. The rise of the Copernican view of the world led to the resurgence of the Platonic idea that like objects attract but in the context of heavenly bodies. In the 17th century, Galileo made significant advances in the concept of weight. He proposed a way to measure the difference between the weight of a moving object and an object at rest. Ultimately, he concluded weight was proportionate to the amount of matter of an object, and not the speed of motion as supposed by the Aristotelean view of physics.Newton  The introduction of Newton's laws of motion and the development of Newton's law of universal gravitation led to considerable further development of the concept of weight. Weight became fundamentally separate from mass. Mass was identified as a fundamental property of objects connected to their inertia, while weight became identified with the force of gravity on an object and therefore dependent on the context of the object. In particular, Newton considered weight to be relative to another object causing the gravitational pull, e.g. the weight of the Earth towards the Sun. Newton considered time and space to be absolute. This allowed him to consider such concepts as true position and true velocity. Newton also recognized that weight as measured by the action of weighing was affected by environmental factors such as buoyancy. He considered this a false weight induced by imperfect measurement conditions, for which he introduced the term apparent weight as compared to the true weight defined by gravity. Although Newtonian physics made a clear distinction between weight and mass, the term weight continued to be commonly used when people meant mass. This led the 3rd General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) of 1901 to officially declare \"The word weight denotes a quantity of the same nature as a force: the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity\", thus distinguishing it from mass for official usage.Relativity  In the 20th century, the Newtonian concepts of absolute time and space were challenged by relativity. Einstein's principle of equivalence put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant by the force of gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.Definitions  Several definitions exist for weight, not all of which are equivalent.Gravitational definition  The most common definition of weight found in introductory physics textbooks defines weight as the force exerted on a body by gravity. This is often expressed in the formula W = mg, where W is the weight, m the mass of the object, and g gravitational acceleration. In 1901, the 3rd General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) established this as their official definition of weight: Template:Quotation This resolution defines weight as a vector, since force is a vector quantity. However, some textbooks also take weight to be a scalar by defining: Template:Quotation The gravitational acceleration varies from place to place. Sometimes, it is simply taken to a have a standard value of 9.80665 m/s, which gives the standard weight. The force whose magnitude is equal to mg newtons is also known as the m kilogram weight (which term is abbreviated to kg-wt)Operational definition  In the operational definition, the weight of an object is the force measured by the operation of weighing it, which is the force it exerts on its support. This can make a considerable difference, depending on the details; for example, an object in free fall exerts little if any force on its support, a situation that is commonly referred to as weightlessness. However, being in free fall does not affect the weight according to the gravitational definition. Therefore, the operational definition is sometimes refined by requiring that the object be at rest.Template:Citation needed However, this raises the issue of defining \"at rest\" (usually being at rest with respect to the Earth is implied by using standard gravityTemplate:Citation needed). In the operational definition, the weight of an object at rest on the surface of the Earth is lessened by the effect of the centrifugal force from the Earth's rotation. The operational definition, as usually given, does not explicitly exclude the effects of buoyancy, which reduces the measured weight of an object when it is immersed in a fluid such as air or water. As a result, a floating balloon or an object floating in water might be said to have zero weight.ISO definition  In the ISO International standard ISO 80000-4(2006), describing the basic physical quantities and units in mechanics as a part of the International standard ISO/IEC 80000, the definition of weight is given as: Template:Quotation The definition is dependent on the chosen frame of reference. When the chosen frame is co-moving with the object in question then this definition precisely agrees with the operational definition. If the specified frame is the surface of the Earth, the weight according to the ISO and gravitational definitions differ only by the centrifugal effects due to the rotation of the Earth.Apparent weight  In many real world situations the act of weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used. This is usually referred to as the apparent weight of the object. A common example of this is the effect of buoyancy, when an object is immersed in a fluid (or air) the displacement of the fluid will cause an upward force on the object, making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale. The apparent weight may be similarly affected by like levitation and mechanical suspension. When the gravitational definition of weight is used, the operational weight measured by an accelerating scale is often also referred to as the apparent weight.Weight and mass  In modern scientific usage, weight and mass are fundamentally different quantities: mass is an intrinsic property of matter, whereas weight is a force that results from the action of gravity on matter: it measures how strongly the force of gravity pulls on that matter. However, in most practical everyday situations the word \"weight\" is used when, strictly, \"mass\" is meant. For example, most people would say that an object \"weighs one kilogram\", even though the kilogram is a unit of mass. The scientific distinction between mass and weight is unimportant for many practical purposes because the strength of gravity is almost the same everywhere on the surface of the Earth. In a uniform gravitational field, the gravitational force exerted on an object (its weight) is directly proportional to its mass. For example, object A weighs 10 times as much as object B, so therefore the mass of object A is 10 times greater than that of object B. This means that an object's mass can be measured indirectly by its weight, and so, for everyday purposes, weighing (using a weighing scale) is an entirely acceptable way of measuring mass. Similarly, a balance measures mass indirectly by comparing the weight of the measured item to that of an object(s) of known mass. Since the measured item and the comparison mass are in virtually the same location, so experiencing the same gravitational field, the effect of varying gravity does not affect the comparison or the resulting measurement. The Earth's gravitational field is not uniform but can vary by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth (see Earth's gravity). These variations alter the relationship between weight and mass, and must be taken into account in high precision weight measurements that are intended to indirectly measure mass. Spring scales, which measure local weight, must be calibrated at the location at which the objects will be used to show this standard weight, to be legal for commerce. This table shows the variation of acceleration due to gravity (and hence the variation of weight) at various locations on the Earth's surface. The historic use of \"weight\" for \"mass\" also persists in some scientific terminology \u2013 for example, the chemical terms \"atomic weight\", \"molecular weight\", and \"formula weight\", can still be found rather than the preferred \"atomic mass\" etc. In a different gravitational field, for example, on the surface of the Moon, an object can have a significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity on the surface of the Moon is only about one-sixth as strong as on the surface of the Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an intrinsic property of the object) but the downward force due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 pounds weighs only about 30 pounds-force when visiting the Moon.SI units  In most modern scientific work, physical quantities are measured in SI units. The SI unit of weight is the same as that of force: the newton (N) \u2013 a derived unit which can also be expressed in SI base units as kg\u00b7m/s (kilograms times meters per second squared). In commercial and everyday use, the term \"weight\" is usually used to mean mass, and the verb \"to weigh\" means \"to determine the mass of\" or \"to have a mass of\". Used in this sense, the proper SI unit is the kilogram (kg).Pound and other non-SI units  In United States customary units, the pound can be either a unit of force or a unit of mass. Related units used in some distinct, separate subsystems of units include the poundal and the slug. The poundal is defined as the force necessary to accelerate an object of one-pound  at 1\u00a0ft/s, and is equivalent to about 1/32.2 of a pound-. The slug is defined as the amount of mass that accelerates at 1\u00a0ft/s when one pound-force is exerted on it, and is equivalent to about 32.2 pounds (mass). The kilogram-force is a non-SI unit of force, defined as the force exerted by a one kilogram mass in standard Earth gravity (equal to 9.80665 newtons exactly). The dyne is the cgs unit of force and is not a part of SI, while weights measured in the cgs unit of mass, the gram, remain a part of SI.Sensation of weight  Template:See also The sensation of weight is caused by the force exerted by fluids in the vestibular system, a three-dimensional set of tubes in the inner ear.Template:Dubious It is actually the sensation of g-force, regardless of whether this is due to being stationary in the presence of gravity, or, if the person is in motion, the result of any other forces acting on the body such as in the case of acceleration or deceleration of a lift, or centrifugal forces when turning sharply.Measuring weight  Weight is commonly measured using one of two methods. A spring scale or hydraulic or pneumatic scale measures local weight, the local force of gravity on the object (strictly apparent weight force). Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal standard gravity of 9.80665\u00a0m/s (approx. 32.174\u00a0ft/s). However, this calibration is done at the factory. When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, the force of gravity will be different, causing a slight error. So to be highly accurate, and legal for commerce, spring scales must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used. A balance on the other hand, compares the weight of an unknown object in one scale pan to the weight of standard masses in the other, using a lever mechanism \u2013 a lever-balance. The standard masses are often referred to, non-technically, as . Since any variations in gravity will act equally on the unknown and the known weights, a lever-balance will indicate the same value at any location on Earth. Therefore, balance  are usually calibrated and marked in mass units, so the lever-balance measures mass by comparing the Earth's attraction on the unknown object and standard masses in the scale pans. In the absence of a gravitational field, away from planetary bodies (e.g. space), a lever-balance would not work, but on the Moon, for example, it would give the same reading as on Earth. Some balances can be marked in weight units, but since the weights are calibrated at the factory for standard gravity, the balance will measure standard weight, i.e. what the object would weigh at standard gravity, not the actual local force of gravity on the object. If the actual force of gravity on the object is needed, this can be calculated by multiplying the mass measured by the balance by the acceleration due to gravity \u2013 either standard gravity (for everyday work) or the precise local gravity (for precision work). Tables of the gravitational acceleration at different locations can be found on the web. Gross weight is a term that generally is found in commerce or trade applications, and refers to the total weight of a product and its packaging. Conversely, net weight refers to the weight of the product alone, discounting the weight of its container or packaging; and tare weight is the weight of the packaging alone.Relative weights on the Earth and other celestial bodies  The table below shows comparative gravitational accelerations at the surface of the Sun, the Earth's moon, each of the planets in the solar system. The \u201csurface\u201d is taken to mean the cloud tops of the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune). For the Sun, the surface is taken to mean the photosphere. The values in the table have not been de-rated for the centrifugal effect of planet rotation (and cloud-top wind speeds for the gas giants) and therefore, generally speaking, are similar to the actual gravity that would be experienced near the poles.See also References Units of Measurement Wiki Bar  The bar is a unit of pressure defined as 100 kilopascals. It is about equal to the atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level. Other units derived from the bar are the megabar (symbol: Mbar), kilobar (symbol: kbar), decibar (symbol: dbar), centibar (symbol: cbar), and millibar (symbol: mbar or mb). They are not SI units, nor are they cgs units, but they are accepted for use with the SI. The bar is widely used in descriptions of pressure because it is only about 1% smaller than the atmosphere (symbol: atm), which now is defined to be 1.01325\u00a0bar exactly. The bar is legally recognized in countries of the European Union. In 1985 the IUPAC recommended that the standard for atmospheric pressure should be harmonized to 100,000\u00a0Pa = 1\u00a0bar = 750\u00a0Torr. The same definition is used in the compressor and the pneumatic tool industries (ISO 2787). The bar and the millibar were introduced by the British meteorologist William Napier Shaw in 1909. He was the director of the Meteorological Office in London from 1907 to 1920. Barg is a unit of gauge pressure, i.e., pressure in bars above ambient or atmospheric pressure; see absolute pressure and gauge pressure below.Definition and conversion  The bar is defined using the SI unit pascal, namely: 1\u00a0bar \u2261 100,000\u00a0Pa. 1\u00a0bar is therefore equal to:Origin  The word bar has its origin in the Greek word \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (baros), meaning weight. Its official symbol is \"bar\"; the earlier \"b\" is now deprecated, but still often seen especially in \"mb\" rather than the proper \"mbar\" for millibars.Usage  Atmospheric air pressure is often given in millibars where \"standard\" sea level pressure (1 atm) is defined as 1013.25 mbar (hPa), equal to 1.01325 bar. Despite millibars not being an SI unit, meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars. After the advent of SI units, some meteorologists began using hectopascals (symbol hPa) which are numerically equivalent to millibars. For example, the weather office of Environment Canada uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps. In contrast, Americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in US reports of hurricanes and other cyclonic storms. In water, there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the sea surface in meters. Specifically, an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every 1.019716 meter increase in depth close to the surface. As a result, decibars are commonly used in oceanography. Many engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because, in much of their work, using pascals would involve using very large numbers. In the automotive field, turbocharger boost is often described in bars in the metric part of the world (i.e. Europe) Unicode has a character for \"mb\": \u33d4, U+33D4, but it exists only for compatibility with legacy Asian encodings. There is also a character \"bar\": \u3374, U+3374. The kilobar is commonly used in geological systems, particularly in experimental petrology.Absolute pressure and gauge pressure  Bourdon tube pressure gauges, vehicle tire gauges, and many other types of pressure gauges are zero-referenced to atmospheric pressure, which means that they measure the pressure above atmospheric pressure (which is around 1 bar); this is gauge pressure and is often referred to in writing as barg (spoken \"bar gauge\"). In contrast, absolute pressures are zero referenced to a complete vacuum and when expressed in bar are often referred to as bara. Thus, the absolute pressure of any system is the gauge pressure of the system plus atmospheric pressure. The usage of bara and barg is now deprecated, with qualification of the physical property being preferred, e.g., \"The gauge pressure is 2.3 bar; the absolute pressure is 3.3 bar\". In the United States, where pressures are still often expressed in pounds per square inch (symbol psi), gauge pressures are referred to as psig and absolute pressures are referred to as psia. Gauge pressure is also sometimes spelled as gage pressure. Sometimes, the context in which the word pressure is used helps to identify it as meaning either the absolute or gauge pressure. However, in truth, whenever a pressure is expressed in any units (bar, Pa, psi, atm, etc.), it should be denoted in some manner as being either absolute or gauge pressure to avoid any possible misunderstanding. One recommended way of doing so is to spell out what is meant, for example as bar gauge or kPa absolute.See also References External links Units of Measurement Wiki Temperature  Temperature is the physical property of a system which underlies the common notions of \"hot\" and \"cold\"; the material with the higher temperature is said to be hotter. Physically, temperature is a measure of the random agitation of matter and ambient photons, under the effect of thermal fluctuations. It is a fundamental parameter in thermodynamics and it is conjugate to entropy. More quantitatively, the order of magnitude of the fluctuations of the energy associated with an atom, molecule, or another elementary constituent of a physical system is $ k_B T $, where $ k_B $ is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature, expressed in Kelvins. Temperature in respect to matter is a property only of macroscopic amounts and serves to gauge the average intensity of the random actual motions of the individually mobile particulate constituents. Intraparticle motions apparently contribute only to the heat capacity. (See also Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)).Overview  The formal properties of temperature are studied in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The temperature of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is defined by a relation between the amount of heat $ \\delta Q $ incident on the system during an infinitesimal quasistatic process transformation, and the variation $ \\delta S $ of its entropy during this transformation. Contrary to entropy and heat, whose microscopic definitions are valid even far away from thermodynamic equilibrium, temperature can only be defined at thermodynamic equilibrium, or local thermodynamic equilibrium (see below). As a system receives heat its temperature rises, similarly a loss of heat from the system tends to decrease its temperature (at the - uncommon - exception of negative temperature, see below). When two systems are at the same temperature, no heat transfer occurs between them. When a temperature difference does exist, heat will tend to move from the higher-temperature system to the lower-temperature system, until they are at thermal equilibrium. This heat transfer may occur via conduction, convection or radiation (see heat for additional discussion of the various mechanisms of heat transfer). Temperature is also related to the amount of internal energy and enthalpy of a system. The higher the temperature of a system, the higher its internal energy and enthalpy are. Temperature is an intensive property of a system, meaning that it does not depend on the system size or the amount of material in the system. Other intensive properties include pressure and density. By contrast, mass and volume are extensive properties, and depend on the amount of material in the system.Role of temperature in nature  Temperature plays an important role in almost all fields of science, including physics, chemistry, and biology. Many physical properties of materials including the phase (solid, liquid, gaseous, or plasma), density, solubility, vapor pressure, and electrical conductivity depend on the temperature. Temperature also plays an important role in determining the rate and extent to which chemical reactions occur. This is one reason why the human body has several elaborate mechanisms for maintaining the temperature at 37 \u00b0C, since temperatures only a few degrees higher can result in harmful reactions with serious consequences. Temperature also controls the type and quantity of thermal radiation emitted from a surface. One application of this effect is the incandescent light bulb, in which a tungsten filament is electrically heated to a temperature at which significant quantities of visible light are emitted. Temperature-dependence of the speed of sound in air c, density of air \u03c1 and acoustic impedance Z vs. temperature \u00b0CTemperature measurement  Main article: Temperature measurement, see also The International Temperature Scale. Temperature measurement using modern scientific thermometers and temperature scales goes back at least as far as the early 18th century, when Gabriel Fahrenheit adapted a thermometer (switching to mercury) and a scale both developed by Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use, alongside the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale.Units of temperature  The basic unit of temperature (symbol: T) in the International System of Units (SI) is the kelvin (K). One kelvin is formally defined as exactly 1/273.16 of the temperature of the triple point of water (the point at which water, ice and water vapor exist in equilibrium). This puts the freezing point of water (which cannot be measured with high precision) and the zero point of the Celsius scale at 273.15, not 273.16. The (unattainable) temperature 0 K is called absolute zero and corresponds to the point at which the molecules and atoms have the least possible thermal energy. An important unit of temperature in theoretical physics is the Planck temperature (1.4 \u00d7 10 K). In the field of plasma physics, because of the high temperatures encountered and the electromagnetic nature of the phenomena involved, it is customary to express temperature in electronvolts (eV) or kiloelectronvolts (keV), where 1 eV = 11,605 K. In the study of QCD matter one routinely meets temperatures of the order of a few hundred MeV, equivalent to about 10 K. For everyday applications, it is often convenient to use the Celsius scale, in which 0 \u00b0C corresponds to the temperature at which water freezes and 100 \u00b0C corresponds to the boiling point of water at sea level. In this scale a temperature difference of 1 degree is the same as a 1 K temperature difference, so the scale is essentially the same as the Kelvin scale, but offset by the temperature at which water freezes (273.15 K). Thus the following equation can be used to convert from degrees Celsius to kelvins. In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is widely used. On this scale the freezing point of water corresponds to 32 \u00b0F and the boiling point to 212 \u00b0F. The following formula can be used to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius: See temperature conversion formulas for conversions between most temperature scales.Negative temperatures  For some systems and specific definitions of temperature, it is possible to obtain a negative temperature. A system with a negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero, but rather it is, in a sense, hotter than infinite temperature.Temperature ranges:  See Orders of magnitude (temperature).Theoretical foundation of temperature Zeroth-law definition of temperature  While most people have a basic understanding of the concept of temperature, its formal definition is rather complicated. Before jumping to a formal definition, let us consider the concept of thermal equilibrium. If two closed systems with fixed volumes are brought together, so that they are in thermal contact, changes may take place in the properties of both systems. These changes are due to the transfer of heat between the systems. When a state is reached in which no further changes occur, the systems are in thermal equilibrium. Now a basis for the definition of temperature can be obtained from the so-called zeroth law of thermodynamics which states that if two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium and a third system C is in thermal equilibrium with system A then systems B and C will also be in thermal equilibrium (being in thermal equilibrium is a transitive relation; moreover, it is an equivalence relation). This is an empirical fact, based on observation rather than theory. Since A, B, and C are all in thermal equilibrium, it is reasonable to say each of these systems shares a common value of some property. We call this property temperature. Generally, it is not convenient to place any two arbitrary systems in thermal contact to see if they are in thermal equilibrium and thus have the same temperature. Also, it would only provide an ordinal scale. Therefore, it is useful to establish a temperature scale based on the properties of some reference system. Then, a measuring device can be calibrated based on the properties of the reference system and used to measure the temperature of other systems. One such reference system is a fixed quantity of gas. The ideal gas law indicates that the product of the pressure and volume (P \u00b7 V) of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature: where 'T is temperature, n is the number of moles of gas and R is the gas constant. Thus, one can define a scale for temperature based on the corresponding pressure and volume of the gas: the temperature in kelvins is the pressure in pascals of one mole of gas in a container of one cubic metre, divided by 8.31... In practice, such a gas thermometer is not very convenient, but other measuring instruments can be calibrated to this scale. Equation 1 indicates that for a fixed volume of gas, the pressure increases with increasing temperature. Pressure is just a measure of the force applied by the gas on the walls of the container and is related to the energy of the system. Thus, we can see that an increase in temperature corresponds to an increase in the thermal energy of the system. When two systems of differing temperature are placed in thermal contact, the temperature of the hotter system decreases, indicating that heat is leaving that system, while the cooler system is gaining heat and increasing in temperature. Thus heat always moves from a region of high temperature to a region of lower temperature and it is the temperature difference that drives the heat transfer between the two systems.Temperature in gases  As mentioned previously for a monatomic ideal gas the temperature is related to the translational motion or average speed of the atoms. The kinetic theory of gases uses statistical mechanics to relate this motion to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in the system. For this case 7736 K = 7463 degrees Celsius corresponds to an average kinetic energy of one electronvolt; to take room temperature (300 K) as an example, the average energy of air molecules is 300/7736 eV, or 0.0388 electronvolt. This average energy is independent of particle mass, which seems counterintuitive to many people. Although the temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas, each particle has its own energy which may or may not correspond to the average. However, after an examination of some basic physics equations it makes perfect sense. The second law of thermodynamics states that any two given systems when interacting with each other will later reach the same average energy. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a system. The formula for the kinetic energy of an atom is: (Note that a calculation of the kinetic energy of a more complicated object, such as a molecule, is slightly more involved. Additional degrees of freedom are available, so molecular rotation or vibration must be included.)\n\n Thus, particles of greater mass (say a neon atom relative to a hydrogen molecule) will move slower than lighter counterparts, but will have the same average energy. This average energy is independent of the mass because of the nature of a gas, all particles are in random motion with collisions with other gas molecules, solid objects that may be in the area and the container itself (if there is one). A visual illustration of this from Oklahoma State University makes the point more clear. Not all the particles in the container have different velocities, regardless of whether there are particles of more than one mass in the container, but the average kinetic energy is the same because of the ideal gas law. In a gas the distribution of energy (and thus speeds) of the particles corresponds to the Boltzmann distribution. An electronvolt is a very small unit of energy, approximately 1.602\u00d710joule.Temperature of the vacuum  When a satellite in empty space is heated by sunshine and cooled by radiating energy away it is not in thermodynamic equilibrium and has no well-defined temperature. A system in a vacuum will radiate its thermal energy, i.e. convert heat into electromagnetic waves. If the vacuum is filled with electromagnetic waves (say, radiation from walls of vacuum chamber, or relic microwave radiation in space) then the system will exchange by energy with these waves and thermally equilibrates at some finite (non zero) temperature. Cosmic microwave background radiation being remnant of radiation of hot early universe when radiation was in thermal equilibrium with matter has Planck spectrum (black body spectrum) with the temperature (at present) of about 2.7 K.Second-law definition of temperature  In the previous section temperature was defined in terms of the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics. It is also possible to define temperature in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, which deals with entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder in a system. The second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability. Consider a series of coin tosses. A perfectly ordered system would be one in which every coin toss would come up either heads or tails. For any number of coin tosses, there is only one combination of outcomes corresponding to this situation. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails. As the number of coin tosses increases, the number of combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases. For a very large number of coin tosses, the number of combinations corresponding to ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominates and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy. Now, we have stated previously that temperature controls the flow of heat between two systems and we have just shown that the universe, and we would expect any natural system, tends to progress so as to maximize entropy. Thus, we would expect there to be some relationship between temperature and entropy. In order to find this relationship let's first consider the relationship between heat, work and temperature. A heat engine is a device for converting heat into mechanical work and analysis of the Carnot heat engine provides the necessary relationships we seek. The work from a heat engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at the high temperature, q and the heat ejected at the low temperature, q. The efficiency is the work divided by the heat put into the system or: where w is the work done per cycle. We see that the efficiency depends only on q/q. Because q and q correspond to heat transfer at the temperatures T and T, respectively, q/q should be some function of these temperatures: Carnot's theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, a heat engine operating between T and T must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between T and T, and the second between T and T. This can only be the case if: which implies: Since the first function is independent of T, this temperature must cancel on the right side, meaning f(T,T) is of the form g(T)/g(T) (i.e. f(T,T) = f(T,T)f(T,T) = g(T)/g(T)\u00b7 g(T)/g(T) = g(T)/g(T)), where g is a function of a single temperature. We can now choose a temperature scale with the property that: Substituting Equation 4 back into Equation 2 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature: Notice that for T = 0 K the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater than 100% below 0 K. Since an efficiency greater than 100% violates the first law of thermodynamics, this implies that 0 K is the minimum possible temperature. In fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nK, which was achieved in 1995 at NIST. Subtracting the right hand side of Equation 5 from the middle portion and rearranging gives: where the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system. This relationship suggests the existence of a state function, S, defined by: where the subscript indicates a reversible process. The change of this state function around any cycle is zero, as is necessary for any state function. This function corresponds to the entropy of the system, which we described previously. We can rearranging Equation 6 to get a new definition for temperature in terms of entropy and heat: For a system, where entropy S may be a function S(E) of its energy E, the temperature T is given by: The reciprocal of the temperature is the rate of increase of entropy with energy.See also References External links Airfield Management Wiki AFI 13-213  Airfield Management PublicationAirfield Management Wiki Airfield Management Wiki What's new Contribute to this wiki  To write a new article, just enter the article title in the box below.Airfield Management Wiki Circle of Safety  The circle of safety is a circular area extending 10 feet beyond the wingtips,nose and tail of an aircraft.

They possess a high potential for accidents, and their use is restricted to be compatible with aircraft operations. Runway clear zones are required for the runway and should be owned or protected under a long-term lease. Table 3-5 shows the dimensional requirements for runway clear zones. Layout of the clear zones is shown in figures 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-9, 3-10, 3-12, 3-13, 3-15, 3-16, 3-18, 3-20, 3-21, and 3-22. Manholes, hand holes, and drainage structures outside the overrun area of clear zones should be designed to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. 27% of all aircraft crashes happen in the clear zone.Class B RWY  Length: 3,000 ft\n Width: 3,000 ftTreatment of Clear Zones  The clear zone consists of two distinctly different areas, the graded area and the land use control area (governed for the Air Force by AFI 32-7063 and AFH 32-7084). The graded area of the clear zone is prepared and maintained as an aircraft safety area. Preparation of the graded area must comply with the criteria given in this manual. The remainder of the clear zone is a land use control area intended to protect people on the ground. DODI 4165.57 and individual Service component directives govern land use within this area (see Appendix B, Section 3). USAF land use guidelines are provided in AFI 32-7063 and AFH 32-7084. For US Navy and Marine Corps installations, see OPNAVINST 11010.36B.US Navy Clear Zones  -Type I Clear Zone. \n\n This zone is immediately adjacent to the end of the runway. It should be cleared, graded, and free of above-ground objects (except airfield lighting) and is to receive special ground treatment or pavement in the area designated as the runway overrun. This clear zone is required at both ends of all runways. -Type II Clear Zone. \n\n This zone is used only for Class B runways and is an extension of the Type I clear zone except that the width is reduced. The Type II clear zone shall be graded and cleared of all above-ground objects except airfield lighting. -Type III Clear Zone. \n\n This zone is laterally adjacent to the Type II clear zone for Class B runways and is used in lieu of the Type II clear zone at Class A runways and basic training outlying fields used by the T-34 aircraft. Objects in this zone shall not penetrate the approach-departure clearance surface. Trees, shrubs, bushes, or any other natural growth shall be topped 3 m (10 ft) below the approach-departure clearance surface or to a lesser height if necessary to ensure the visibility of airfield lighting. Buildings for human habitation shall not be sited in the Type III clearance surface. The land in this type of clear zone is best used for agriculture or permanent open space exclusive of any agricultural use that would attract birds or water fowl. Land uses that would include human activity for extended periods or group activities should be avoided. Transverse ways (e.g., roads, railroads, canals) are permitted provided that they would not penetrate airfield imaginary surfaces after the height of the transverse way has been increased by the distances specified in NAVFAC P-80.3, section II, paragraph B.Notes Airfield Management Wiki Airfield Inspection Airfield Inspection  Minimum requirement: one per day.

As a minimum, inspect the following items: A2.1.6.1. Obstacles and Obstructions. A2.1.6.1.1. Inspect airfield for obstacles and obstructions that violate airfield imaginary surface criteria, such as construction activities (e.g., cranes, drilling rigs, etc.), tree growth, dirt/ snow piles, sandbag bunkers. A2.1.6.1.2. Inspect runway, taxiway and apron lateral clearance areas for violations (fixed or mobile). A2.1.6.2. Construction Areas. A2.1.6.2.1. Inspect construction areas to ensure that a high level of safety is maintained. A2.1.6.2.2. Construction Barricades. Ensure construction barricades are properly positioned to define the limits of construction and hazardous areas and, if barricades are lighted, check to ensure lights are working properly and are positioned correctly. A2.1.6.2.3. Stockpiled Materials. Ensure stockpiled material and construction materials are properly stored to keep them from being moved by wind, jet blast, or prop wash. A2.1.6.2.4. Inspect construction areas for confusing or missing signs, markings or lighting that could potentially confuse or mislead pilots. A2.1.6.2.5. Equipment Parking. Determine if construction equipment (such as bulldozers, cranes, etc.) are marked and lighted and parked in designated areas. A2.1.6.2.6. FOD Debris. Ensure that debris and foreign objects are continuously being picked up around construction areas. A2.1.6.3. Airfield Markings. A2.1.6.3.1. Inspect airfield markings for peeling, chipping, fading and obscurity due to rubber buildup. A2.1.6.3.2. Ensure markings are properly sited and provide retro-reflective characteristics during hours of darkness (reflect light back to the source). A2.1.6.3.3. When markings are obscured/covered with rubber deposits, snow, etc., coordinate with Standardization and Evaluation, SE, AOF/CC and OG/CC to determine if markings are no longer adequate to support instrument procedures. Provide results to TERPS Specialist and send a NOTAM. A2.1.6.4. Airfield Signs. A2.1.6.4.1. Inspect airfield signs for correct background and legend colors, easy to read, not obscured by vegetation, dirt or snow, frangible mounted and illuminated if required for night operations. A2.1.6.4.2. Send a NOTAM when a mandatory sign (e.g., Runway Hold Sign, Instrument Hold Sign, etc.) has a discrepancy such as missing, incorrect legend, improperly sited or not illuminated when required for night operations. A2.1.6.5. Airfield Lighting. A2.1.6.5.1. Inspect airfield lighting systems to ensure they are frangible mounted and frangible devices are not more than 3 inches above the finished surface of the foundation. Drop-off at edge of foundations are to be flush with grade, but are allowed to erode to not more than a 3 inch drop-off before maintenance action is required. A2.1.6.5.2. Ensure lighting systems are not obscured. A2.1.6.5.3. Check the operation of airfield lighting systems, to include the different intensity levels (Steps 1-5), as applicable. A2.1.6.5.4. Check the operation of lighting systems that protect Instrument Critical Areas and Traffic Control Light Systems at the intersection of runways and taxiways. A2.1.6.6. Pavement Areas. A2.1.6.6.1. Inspect pavement areas for conditions that could cause ponding, obscure markings, attract wildlife or otherwise impair safe aircraft operations (e.g., scaling, spalling, cracks, holes, bumps, low spots, rubber deposits, vegetation growth, etc.). A2.1.6.6.2. Inspect pavement areas for loose aggregate or other foreign objects and contaminants. Ensure foreign objects and contaminants are removed promptly. A2.1.6.6.3. The Asphalt Surfaced Airfields Pavement Condition Index Manual can be used to determine the severity of pavement conditions and priority for repair. A2.1.6.7. Aircraft Arresting Systems. A2.1.6.7.1. Inspect aircraft arresting systems for obvious conditions that could compromise the system\u2019s operation (e.g., noticeably loose cable, improper doughnut spacing, broken rope ties, pavement erosion beneath the cable (effective pendant height), etc.). If an unsafe condition exists, notify CE or Fire Department. A2.1.6.7.2. Ensure system is sited and installed according to AFI 32-1043 or AC 150/5220-9. A2.1.7. Airfield Inspection Techniques. A varied inspection pattern is preferred to avoid complacency and the possibility of missing items that are in need of correction. When conducting an inspection on a runway and time only permits one pass on the runway, individuals should drive towards the direction of landing aircraft to see approaching aircraft and improve visibility of vehicle to pilots. However, it is highly recommended for runway inspection be done in both directions.Notes Airfield Management Wiki NAMO  NAMO (NCOIC, Airfield Management Operations) ==Qualifications== Military personnel (SSgt and above) must hold AFSC 1C771 and have at least 3 years experience in AM.

However, commanders retain the authority to stop this BAS if it is determined not to be in the best interest of the member and the Air Force. 2.3.3.22. Utilize the AFFSA AM Operations and Procedures CoP to access current Airfield Management guidance, quick references and messages. Air Force Portal registration and AFFSA AM Operations and Procedures CoP membership is required to access and download products.Notes Airfield Management Wiki Titles & Responsibilities Airfield Management Wiki RWY Lateral Clearance.jpg Airfield Management Wiki ILS  The Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a ground-based instrument approach system that provides precision guidance to an aircraft approaching and landing on a runway, using a combination of radio signals and, in many cases, high-intensity lighting arrays to enable a safe landing during instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as low ceilings or reduced visibility due to fog, rain, or blowing snow. Instrument Approach Procedure charts (or \"approach plates\") are published for each ILS approach, providing pilots with the needed information to fly an ILS approach during instrument flight rules (IFR) operations, including the radio frequencies used by the ILS components or navaids and the minimum visibility requirements prescribed for the specific approach. Radio-navigation aids must keep a certain degree of accuracy (given by international standards, FAA, ICAO...); to assure this is the case, Flight inspection organizations check periodically critical parameters with properly equipped aircraft to calibrate and certify ILS precision.Principle of operation  An ILS consists of two independent sub-systems, one providing lateral guidance (Localizer), the other vertical guidance (Glideslope or Glide Path) to aircraft approaching a runway. Aircraft guidance is provided by the ILS receivers in the aircraft by performing a modulation depth comparison. A localizer (LOC, or LLZ in Europe) antenna array is normally located beyond the departure end of the runway and generally consists of several pairs of directional antennas. Two signals are transmitted on one out of 40 ILS channels between the carrier frequency range 108.10 MHz and 111.95 MHz (but only the odd kHz, so 108.10 108.15 108.30 and so on are LOC frequencies but 108.20 108.25 108.40 and so on are not). One is modulated at 90 Hz, the other at 150 Hz and these are transmitted from separate but co-located antennas. Each antenna transmits a narrow beam, one slightly to the left of the runway centerline, the other to the right. The localizer receiver on the aircraft measures the Difference in the Depth of Modulation (DDM) of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz signals. For the localizer, the depth of modulation for each of the modulating frequencies is 20 percent. The difference between the two signals varies depending on the position of the approaching aircraft from the centerline. If there is a predominance of either 90 Hz or 150 Hz modulation, the aircraft is off the centerline. In the cockpit, the needle on the Horizontal Situation Indicator, or HSI (The Instrument part of the ILS), or CDI (Course deviation indicator), will show that the aircraft needs to fly left or right to correct the error to fly down the center of the runway. If the DDM is zero the aircraft is on the centerline of the localizer coinciding with the physical runway centerline. A glideslope or Glidepath (GP) antenna array is sited to one side of the runway touchdown zone. The GP signal is transmitted on a carrier frequency between 329.15 and 335 MHz using a technique similar to that of the localizer. The centerline of the glideslope signal is arranged to define a glideslope of approximately 3\u00b0 above horizontal (ground level). The beam is 1.4\u00b0 deep; 0.7\u00b0 below the glideslope centerline and 0.7\u00b0 above the glideslope centerline. Localizer and glideslope carrier frequencies are paired so that only one selection is required to tune both receivers. These signals are displayed on an indicator in the instrument panel. This instrument is generally called the omni-bearing indicator or nav indicator. The pilot controls the aircraft so that the indications on the instrument (i.e. the course deviation indicator) remain centered on the display. This ensures the aircraft is following the ILS centreline (i.e. it provides lateral guidance). Vertical guidance, shown on the instrument by the glideslope indicator, aids the pilot in reaching the runway at the proper touchdown point. Some aircraft possess the ability to route signals into the autopilot, allowing the approach to be flown automatically by the autopilot.Localizer  In addition to the previously mentioned navigational signals, the localizer provides for ILS facility identification by periodically transmitting a 1020 Hz morse code identification signal. For example, the ILS for runway 04R at John F. Kennedy International Airport transmits IJFK to identify itself, while runway 04L is known as IHIQ. This lets users know the facility is operating normally and that they are tuned to the correct ILS. The glideslope transmits no identification signal, so ILS equipment relies on the localizer for identification. Modern localizer antennas are highly directional. However, usage of older, less directional antennas allows a runway to have a non-precision approach called a localizer back course. This lets aircraft land using the signal transmitted from the back of the localizer array. This signal is reverse sensing so a pilot may have to fly opposite the needle indication (depending on the equipment installed in the aircraft). Highly directional antennas do not provide a sufficient signal to support a backcourse. In the United States, backcourse approaches are commonly associated with Category I systems at smaller airports that do not have an ILS on both ends of the primary runway.Marker beacons  On most installations marker beacons operating at a carrier frequency of 75 MHz are provided. When the transmission from a marker beacon is received it activates an indicator on the pilot's instrument panel and the tone of the beacon is audible to the pilot. The distance from the runway at which this indication should be received is promulgated in the documentation for that approach, together with the height at which the aircraft should be if correctly established on the ILS. This provides a check on the correct function of the glideslope. In modern ILS installations a DME is installed, co-located with the ILS, to augment or replace marker beacons. A DME continuously displays the aircraft's distance to the runway.Outer marker  The outer marker should be located 7.2 km (3.9 NM) from the threshold except that, where this distance is not practicable, the outer marker may be located between 6.5 and 11.1 km (3.5 and 6 NM) from the threshold. The modulation is repeated Morse-style dashes of a 400 Hz tone. The cockpit indicator is a blue lamp that flashes in unison with the received audio code. The purpose of this beacon is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on intermediate and final approach. In the United States, an NDB is often combined with the outer marker beacon in the ILS approach (called a Locator Outer Marker, or LOM); in Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced marker beacons entirely. Template:ClearMiddle marker  The middle marker should be located so as to indicate, in low visibility conditions, the missed approach point, and the point that visual contact with the runway is imminent, ideally at a distance of approximately Template:Convert from the threshold. It is modulated with a 1300 Hz tone as alternating dots and dashes at the rate of two per second. The cockpit indicator is an amber lamp that flashes in unison with the received audio code. Template:ClearInner marker  The inner marker, when installed, shall be located so as to indicate in low visibility conditions the imminence of arrival at the runway threshold. This is typically the position of an aircraft on the ILS as it reaches Category II minima. Ideally at a distance of approximately Template:Convert from the threshold. The modulation is Morse-style dots at 3000 Hz. The cockpit indicator is a white lamp that flashes in unison with the received audio code. Template:ClearDME  Distance measuring equipment (DME) provides pilots with a slant range measurement of distance to the runway in nautical miles. DMEs are augmenting or replacing markers in many installations. The DME provides more accurate and continuous monitoring of correct progress on the ILS glideslope to the pilot, and does not require an installation outside the airport boundary. When used in conjunction with an ILS, the DME is often sited midway between the reciprocal runway thresholds with the internal delay modified so that one unit can provide distance information to either runway threshold. On approaches where a DME is specified in lieu of marker beacons, the aircraft must have at least one operating DME unit to begin the approach, and a \"DME Required\" restriction will be noted on the Instrument Approach Procedure.Monitoring  It is essential that any failure of the ILS to provide safe guidance be detected immediately by the pilot. To achieve this, monitors continually assess the vital characteristics of the transmissions. If any significant deviation beyond strict limits is detected, either the ILS is automatically switched off or the navigation and identification components are removed from the carrier. Either of these actions will activate an indication ('failure flag') on the instruments of an aircraft using the ILS.Approach lighting  Some installations include medium or high intensity approach light systems. Most often, these are at larger airports. The approach lighting system (abbreviated ALS) assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. At many non-towered airports, the intensity of the lighting system can be adjusted by the pilot, for example the pilot can click their microphone 7 times to turn on the lights, then 5 times to turn them to medium intensity.Use of the Instrument Landing System  At controlled airports, air traffic control will direct aircraft to the localizer via assigned headings, making sure aircraft do not get too close to each other (maintain separation), but also avoiding delay as much as possible. Several aircraft can be on the ILS at the same time, several miles apart. An aircraft that has come within two and a half degrees of the localizer course (half scale deflection shown by the course deviation indicator) is said to be established on the approach. Typically, an aircraft will be established by at least two miles prior to the final approach fix (glideslope intercept at the specified altitude). Aircraft deviation from the optimal path is indicated to the flight crew by means of display with \"needles\" (a carry over from when an analog meter movement would indicate deviation from the course line via voltages sent from the ILS receiver). The output from the ILS receiver goes both to the display system (Head Down Display and Head-Up Display if installed) and can also go to the Flight Control Computer. An aircraft landing procedure can be either \"coupled\", where the Flight Control Computer directly flies the aircraft and the flight crew monitor the operation; or \"uncoupled\" (manual) where the flight crew fly the aircraft uses the HUD and manually control the aircraft to minimize the deviation from flight path to the runway centreline.Rate-of-descent formula  A useful formula pilots use to calculate the descent rate on the glideslope. where: If the glideslope is the standard 3 degrees then the formula can be further simplified to:Decision altitude/height  Once established on an approach, the Autoland system or pilot will follow the ILS and descend along the glideslope, until the Decision Altitude is reached (for a typical Category I ILS, this altitude is 200 feet above the runway). At this point, the pilot must have the runway or its approach lights in sight to continue the approach. If neither can be seen, the approach must be aborted and a missed approach procedure will be performed. This is where the aircraft will climb back to a predetermined altitude and position. From there the pilot will either try the same approach again, try a different approach or divert to another airport. Aborting the approach (as well as the ATC instruction to do so) is called executing a missed approach.ILS categories  There are three categories of ILS which support similarly named categories of operation. Information below is based on ICAO - certain states may have filed differences. Check with your state's documentation. In each case a suitably equipped aircraft and appropriately qualified crew are required. For example, Cat IIIc requires a fail-operational system, along with a Landing Pilot (LP) who holds a Cat IIIc endorsement in their logbook, Cat I does not. A Head-Up Display which allows the pilot to perform aircraft maneuvers rather than an automatic system is considered as fail-operational. Cat I relies only on altimeter indications for decision height, whereas Cat II and Cat III approaches use radar altimeter to determine decision height. An ILS is required to shut down upon internal detection of a fault condition as mentioned in the monitoring section. With the increasing categories, ILS equipment is required to shut down faster since higher categories require shorter response times. For example, a Cat I localizer must shutdown within 10 seconds of detecting a fault, but a Cat III localizer must shut down in less than 2 seconds.Limitations and alternatives  Due to the complexity of ILS localizer and glideslope systems, there are some limitations. Localizer systems are sensitive to obstructions in the signal broadcast area like large buildings or hangars. Glideslope systems are also limited by the terrain in front of the glideslope antennas. If terrain is sloping or uneven, reflections can create an uneven glidepath causing unwanted needle deflections. Additionally, since the ILS signals are pointed in one direction by the positioning of the arrays, ILS only supports straight in approaches (though a modified ILS called an Instrument Guidance System (IGS) is also occasionally used, the most famous example being that which was in use at one of the runways of Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong to accommodate a non-straight approach; IGSes are also called Localizer Type Directional Aids in the US). Installation of ILS can also be costly due to the complexity of the antenna system and siting criteria. To avoid hazardous reflections that would affect the radiated signal ILS critical areas and ILS sensitive areas are established. Positioning of these critical areas can prevent aircraft from using certain taxiways. This can cause additional delays in take offs due to increased hold times and increased spacing between aircraft. In the 1980s there was a major US & European effort to establish the Microwave Landing System, which is not similarly limited and which allow curved approaches. However, a combination of airline reluctance to invest in MLS, and the rise of GPS has resulted in its failure to be adopted in US Civil Aviation. The Transponder Landing System (TLS) is another alternative to an ILS that can be used where a conventional ILS will not work or is not cost-effective. Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV) is the latest alternative to the ILS. Based on WAAS, LPV has similar minima to ILS for appropriately equipped aircraft. As of November, 2008 the FAA has published more LPV approaches than Category I ILS procedures. An alterative to ILS is the Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS), a safety-critical system that augments the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and provides enhanced levels of service. It supports all phases of approach, landing, departure, and surface operations within the VHF coverage volume. (LAAS is the GBAS equivalent in the United States). GBAS is expected to play a key role in modernization and in all-weather operations capability at CATI/II and III airports, terminal area navigation, missed approach guidance and surface operations. GBAS provides the capability to service the entire airport with a single frequency (VHF transmission) whereas ILS requires a separate frequency for each runway end. GBAS CAT-I is seen as a necessary step towards the more stringent operations of CAT-II/III precision approach and landing. Until recently, the technical risk of implementing GBAS prevented wide spread acceptance of the technology. The FAA, along with industry, have fielded Provably Safe Prototype GBAS stations which mitigate the impact of satellite signal deformation, ionosphere differential error, ephemeris error and multipath.History  Tests of the ILS system began in 1929, and the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) authorized installation of the system in 1941 at six locations. The first landing of a scheduled U.S. passenger airliner using ILS was on January 26, 1938, as a Pennsylvania Central Airlines Boeing 247-D flew from Washington, D.C., to Pittsburgh and landed in a snowstorm using only the Instrument Landing System. The first fully automatic landing using ILS occurred at Bedford Airport UK in March 1964.Future  The Microwave Landing System (MLS) introduced in the 1970s was intended to replace ILS but fell out of favor in the United States because of satellite based systems. However, it is showing a resurgence in the United Kingdom for civil aviation. ILS and MLS are the only standardized systems in Civil Aviation that meet requirements for Category III automated landings. The first Category III MLS for civil aviation was commissioned at Heathrow airport in March 2009. The advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides an alternative source of approach for aircraft. In the US, the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) has been available to provide precision guidance to Category I standards since 2007, and the equivalent in Europe, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), is currently undergoing final trials and will be certified for safety of life applications in 2010. Other methods of augmentation are in development to provide for Category III minimums or better, such as the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). The FAA Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) office is currently working with industry in anticipation of the certification of the first GBAS ground station in Memphis, TN; Sydney, Australia; Bremen, Germany; Spain and Newark, NJ. All four countries have installed GBAS systems and are involved in technical and operational evaluation activities. The Honeywell and FAA team are working on the System Design Approval of the world\u2019s first Non-Federal U.S. approval for LAAS Category I operations; expected in first quarter 2009 and compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) Category I LAAS.Frequency list  Frequencies are in MHz.Template:Multicol Template:Multicol-break Template:Multicol-break Template:Multicol-break Template:Multicol-endSee also References External links  cs:Instrument Landing System da:Instrumentlandingssystem de:Instrumentenlandesystem es:Sistema de aterrizaje instrumental fr:Instrument landing system ko:\uacc4\uae30\ucc29\ub959\uc7a5\uce58 id:Sistem pendaratan instrumen it:Instrument landing system he:\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05e0\u05d7\u05d9\u05ea\u05ea \u05de\u05db\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd nl:Instrument landing system ja:\u8a08\u5668\u7740\u9678\u88c5\u7f6e no:Instrument Landing System pl:Instrument Landing System pt:ILS ru:\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043e-\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 sq:ILS sk:Instrument landing system sl:Sistem za instrumentalno pristajanje sr:Ils fi:ILS sv:ILS (flygteknik) tr:Aletli ini\u015f sistemi zh:\u4eea\u8868\u7740\u9646\u7cfb\u7edfAirfield Management Wiki DD Form 1801  Type of flight plan used by military pilots when they perform international flights from, to, or within international airspace.Airfield Management Wiki AMOC  AMOC (Airfield Management Operations Coordinator)Qualifications  Military personnel must hold AFSC 1C751, as a minimum.

Sie wird bei Unternehmen oft im Gesellschaftsvertrag festgelegt, der in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen (z.\u00a0B. bei der BGB-Gesellschaft) auch m\u00fcndlich oder konkludent geschlossen werden kann.Allgemeines  Die Rechtsform wirkt sich unter anderem auf Haftungsfragen der Gesellschafter und deren Recht zur Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung aus. Sie bestimmt zudem, ob die Gesellschaft eine eigene Rechtspers\u00f6nlichkeit besitzt (z.\u00a0B. Aktiengesellschaft) oder ob ihre Gesellschafter als nat\u00fcrliche Personen handeln. Je nach Rechtsform sehen gesetzliche Normen unterschiedliche Anforderungen bei deren Errichtung, Betrieb oder Liquidation vor. Insbesondere finden sich Regelungen hinsichtlich des Grundkapitals, der Anzahl und Verpflichtungen der Gesellschafter, der Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrungsbefugnisse oder bestimmter Publizit\u00e4tspflichten. W\u00e4hrend bei Personengesellschaften mindestens ein Gesellschafter auch mit seinem privaten Verm\u00f6gen f\u00fcr die Verbindlichkeiten der Gesellschaft einzustehen hat (eine Ausnahme stellt die GmbH und Co. KG dar), ist die Haftung bei den Kapitalgesellschaften in aller Regel begrenzt (z.\u00a0B. auf die jeweiligen Einlagen der Gesellschafter). Wird eine einzelne nat\u00fcrliche Person als Einzelunternehmen wirtschaftlich t\u00e4tig, so haftet sie grunds\u00e4tzlich mit ihrem vollen Verm\u00f6gen. Es sind jedoch auch Ein-Personen-Gesellschaften unterschiedlicher Rechtsformen (AG, GmbH) m\u00f6glich, in denen ein Gesellschafter alle Anteile besitzt. Diese Gesellschaften k\u00f6nnen entstehen, indem ein Gesellschafter alle Anteile erwirbt oder eine Gesellschaft kann von Beginn an von nur einer Person gegr\u00fcndet werden.

Wolle in die Waschmaschine? Mit dem Original Merino Superwash machen sie das seit 1979 m\u00f6glich. Wolle im Sommer? Ja, denn die leichte\u00a0Summer Merino Qualit\u00e4t wirkt temperatur\u00adausgleichend. Diese besonders weiche \u201ecool wool\" ist ideal auch f\u00fcr warme Tage. Innovation und Qualit\u00e4t sind der rote\u00a0Faden von MAERZ Muenchen. So hat sich das Unternehmen\u00a0von der kleinen Handstrick-Manufaktur zum international erfolgreichen Merino-Spezialisten entwickelt. Bis heute produzieren sie in ihrer eigenen Strickerei und \u00fcberwiegend in Europa. Finest Knitwear since 1920.\u00dcber MAERZ Muenchen 1920  Wolfgang und Thea M\u00e4rz gr\u00fcnden das Unternehmen. Im Hinterzimmer eines Einzelhandelsgesch\u00e4fts werden mit viel Hingabe Loferl und F\u00fc\u00dflinge gestrickt. Das Angebot wird bald um sportliche Pullover und gestrickte Bademode erweitert. Qualit\u00e4t wird zum Erfolgsprinzip des Familienunternehmens und Wolfgang M\u00e4rz pr\u00e4gt das Familienunternehmen durch seinen Grundsatz:\n\"Qualit\u00e4t ist der Respekt vor dem Kunden\".1938  Kurz vor dem 2. Weltkrieg werden die ersten motorbetriebenen und vollautomatischen Strickmaschinen installiert und damit der \u00dcbergang von der handwerklichen Manufaktur zur industriellen Fabrik eingeleitet.1947  Unmittelbar nach Kriegsende werden die in umliegenden D\u00f6rfern ausgelagerten Maschinen wieder nach M\u00fcnchen gebracht. Ehemalige Mitarbeiter melden sich bei Wolfgang M\u00e4rz. Nach zwei Jahren gemeinsamer Anstrengungen wird die \"Wolfgang M\u00e4rz Strickwaren GmbH\" gegr\u00fcndet. Gesellschafter sind Wolfgang und Thea M\u00e4rz, sowie ihre Kinder Elisabeth und G\u00fcnter M\u00e4rz.1953  Ein Pullover schreibt Geschichte! Speziell angefertigte Wollpullover begleiten die Teilnehmer der Himalaya Expedition zum Nanga Parbat. Am 04. Juli 1953 gelingt Hermann Buhl die Erstbesteigung des Nanga Parbat (8125m), sein Alleingang ohne k\u00fcnstlichen Sauerstoff sichert ihm Weltruhm.1955  Maerz erwirbt die erste \u201eCotton Maschine\u201c. Damit ist der Grundstein f\u00fcr eine Fertigungstechnologie auf h\u00f6chstem Qualit\u00e4tsniveau gelegt. (Die Maschine wurde nach dem Namen des Erfinders William Cotton 1817 \u2013 1887 benannt. Er konstruierte die Maschine innerhalb von 4 Jahren. Durch die Maschine konnte die industrielle Gro\u00dfproduktion gestartet werden, da gleichzeitig mehrere Pullover gefertigt werden konnten.)1956  Aufgrund der anerkannten hohen Qualit\u00e4t wird Maerz zum offiziellen Ausstatter der deutschen Olympia-Mannschaft f\u00fcr die Winterolympiade in Cortina d\u00b4Ampezzo berufen. Als Zeichen der Verbundenheit wird in jeden Pullover ein Gl\u00fcckspfenning eingen\u00e4ht.1979  Maerz schafft sich ein unverwechselbares Qualit\u00e4tsmerkmal durch die Verwendung von 100% nat\u00fcrlichen Rohstoffen. In den folgenden Jahren wird der Qualit\u00e4tsanspruch fortgesetzt, die Garne werden mit einer Superwash-Ausr\u00fcstung veredelt \u2013 es entsteht die erfolgreiche Uni-Serie \"Merino Superwash\" f\u00fcr Herren.1990  Die Fertigung wird nach Ungarn verlagert. In der Region Puszta haben die vielen Handarbeitsschritte zur Fertigung eines Pullovers seit Jahrzehnten Tradition.2010  Im Mai erfolgt der Verkauf aller Anteile an Herrn Mark Bezner, Eigent\u00fcmer der Olymp Bezner GmbH & Co. KG. Beide Marken werden trotz aller Synergieeffekte bewusst getrennt voneinander gef\u00fchrt und nicht miteinander verschmolzen. Der Firmensitz von Maerz bleibt M\u00fcnchen. Im Juli erfolgt die Umfirmierung in \"M\u00e4rz M\u00fcnchen GmbH & Co. KG\".2012  Katja Beibl wird neue Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrerin der M\u00e4rz M\u00fcnchen GmbH & Co. KG. Sie \u00fcbernimmt die Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung f\u00fcr Vertrieb, Produkt und Marketing. Damit bildet sie zusammen mit Clemens Ode die neue F\u00fchrungs-Doppelspitze.2013  Dieses Jahr steht ganz im Zeichen der Ver\u00e4nderung. Mit viel Motivation und neuen Ideen wird die Neuausrichtung der Marke vorangetrieben. Aus M\u00c4RZ M\u00fcnchen wird MAERZ Muenchen.Qualit\u00e4t  Qualit\u00e4t ist unsere Masche. So einfach sind wir gestrickt - ganz im Gegensatz zu unseren Cardigans, Capes & Co., in denen viel Knowhow und auch heute noch viel Handarbeit stecken. In unserer eigenen Strickerei in Ungarn wirken feinste Naturmaterialien, moderne Technik und Mitarbeiter, die ein H\u00e4ndchen haben, im wahrsten Sinn zusammen. Designed in Munich & Knitted in Europe, daf\u00fcr steht der Gro\u00dfteil der MAERZ Muenchen Strickkollektion.Knit Shop Konzept  MAERZ Muenchen wird im Textileinzelhandel bei hochwertigen Premium H\u00e4usern\u00a0auf Shop-in-Shop Fl\u00e4chen gezeigt und erfolgreich als Partnerkonzept betrieben. Insgesamt gibt es rund 60 MAERZ Muenchen Shop-in-Shop Fl\u00e4chen in Deutschland.\u00a0Die sogenannten \"Knit Shops\" wurden zusammen mit dem bekannten, bayerischen M\u00f6beldesigner Nils Holger Moormann entwickelt. Alle M\u00f6belelemente werden aus hochwertigen, nat\u00fcrlichen Materialien und in regionalen Betrieben von Hand gefertigt.

Der Schwerpunkt der Gesch\u00e4ftst\u00e4tigkeit liegt auf der Herstellung und dem Vertrieb von Table-Top-Automaten mit Filtersystem und Zubeh\u00f6r. Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer sind Michael Kieppe (CEO), Knut J. Michelberger und Stefan Sch\u00e4fer. Insgesamt besch\u00e4ftigt die Kaffee Partner GmbH im gesamten Bundesgebiet \u00fcber 530 Mitarbeiter. Im Mai 2010 haben sich die beiden Schweizer Beteiligungsunternehmen Capvis Equity Partners und Partners Group mehrheitlich an der Kaffee Partner Holding GmbH beteiligt und 2015 die gesamten Anteile erworben.Geschichte  Das Unternehmen wurde im Jahr 1973 von Fritz Ost als Automatenvertrieb f\u00fcr Waren- und Getr\u00e4nkeautomaten in Osnabr\u00fcck gegr\u00fcndet. Den Kundenschwerpunkt bildeten Schulen und Gro\u00dfbetriebe. Kurz nach der Unternehmensgr\u00fcndung zog das Unternehmen nach Osnabr\u00fcck-Hellern, um im Jahr 1980 mit dem Firmensitz an den heutigen Standort in Wallenhorst zu ziehen. Nach dem Erwerb eines 10,6 ha gro\u00dfen Grundst\u00fccks im Osnabr\u00fccker Stadtgebiet plante das Unternehmen, seinen Firmensitz im Jahr 2011 wieder nach Osnabr\u00fcck zu verlegen.Dort sind sie bis heute ans\u00e4ssig. Andreas Ost, der Sohn des Gr\u00fcnders, \u00fcbernahm in den achtziger Jahren die Gesch\u00e4ftsleitung. Sp\u00e4ter trat Michael Koch als gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrender Gesellschafter dem Unternehmen bei. Zu Beginn des Jahres 2015 traten sie die verbliebenen Anteile an Capvis Equity Partners und Partners Group ab. Im Jahr 2005 best\u00e4tigte die Mollenhauer Management Consulting AG dem Unternehmen die Marktf\u00fchrerschaft in dem Kundensegment \u201eMittelstand\u201c f\u00fcr den deutschlandweiten Vertrieb von Table-Top-Automaten und dazu geh\u00f6rigen Kaffee-Produkten und Spezialit\u00e4ten. 2014 expandierte Kaffee Partner nach \u00d6sterreich und im Jahr 2015 auch in die Schweiz.Literatur Einzelnachweise  \u00a0Unternehmens-Wiki Egeb: Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung  Die egeb: Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung ist ein multifunktionales Service- und Beratungszentrum f\u00fcr die Kreise Dithmarschen und Steinburg. Gegr\u00fcndet wurde die egeb 1971 zur Erschlie\u00dfung des Wirtschaftsraums Brunsb\u00fcttel und zur Beratung von Unternehmen.Aufgaben  Im Mittelpunkt der Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung steht die Standort- und Wirtschaftsentwicklung durch Ansiedlung neuer Unternehmen und durch gezielte Beratung und F\u00f6rderung der Firmen vor Ort. Die egeb fungiert als Mittler und Moderator in weiten Bereichen der Wirtschaft, des Verbandswesens und der Politik. Sie unterst\u00fctzt Marketingaktivit\u00e4ten, koordiniert Firmenprojekte im Bereich des Technologietransfers und informiert die Unternehmen \u00fcber aktuelle Trends der lokalen, regionalen und \u00fcberregionalen M\u00e4rkte. Der Service ist kostenlos und wird unabh\u00e4ngig von der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Unternehmen angeboten. Die egeb engagiert sich zudem f\u00fcr die Interessen der von ihr vertretenen und beratenen Gesellschaften und Unternehmen auf Europa-, Bundes-, Landes- und Kommunalebene.Ziele  Die egeb ver\u00e4ndert die wirtschaftlichen Strukturen nachhaltig und schafft Voraussetzungen, um ein optimales Umfeld f\u00fcr die Unternehmen zu schaffen. Um die Region weit \u00fcber die Kreisgrenzen hinaus sichtbar zu machen, werden gezielt \u201eVerb\u00fcndete\u201c gesucht und Netzwerke ausgebaut. Kooperationen sind ein Teil des Standortmarketings. Die Region profitiert vor allem von dem prosperierenden Umfeld der Metropolregion Hamburg, zu der auch die Kreise Dithmarschen und Steinburg z\u00e4hlen. Wesentliches Ziel der egeb ist die Verbesserung der Infrastruktur, die sich dem Wachstum der Unternehmen anpassen muss. Die Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderer setzen sich daher f\u00fcr den Bau der A 20, inklusive der Elbquerung bei Gl\u00fcckstadt, den Ausbau der Bundesstra\u00dfe 5 zwischen Brunsb\u00fcttel und Itzehoe, der Erweiterung des Elbehafens sowie einer Verbesserung der Schieneninfrastruktur zwischen Brunsb\u00fcttel und Wilster ein.ChemCoast Park Brunsb\u00fcttel  Zwischen Hamburg und Sylt \u2013 in der n\u00f6rdlichen Metropolregion - liegen die zukunftsorientierten H\u00e4fen und Logistikfl\u00e4chen der Kreise Dithmarschen und Steinburg. Angefangen hat alles mit einem Bitumenwerk, einer D\u00fcngemittelfabrik und einer Raffinerie. Das war 1930. Seitdem hat sich das Industriegebiet kontinuierlich bis zum heutigen ChemCoast Park Brunsb\u00fcttel entwickelt. Mit einer Fl\u00e4che von \u00fcber 2000 Hektar ist der kreis\u00fcbergreifende ChemCoast Park das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Industriegebiet im Land Schleswig-Holstein und der Metropolregion Hamburg. Das Gebiet liegt strategisch g\u00fcnstig zwischen den stark befahrenen Schifffahrtswegen der Elbe und dem Nord-Ostsee-Kanal. Verkehrsm\u00e4\u00dfig ist der ChemCoast Park gut angebunden an Autobahn, Schiene, Wasserwege und Flugh\u00e4fen. Als zentraler Standort zwischen Mittel - und Nordeuropa er\u00f6ffnet der Wirtschaftsraum strategische Marktchancen zum nord- und osteurop\u00e4ischen Raum. Besonderer Vorteil sind die Hafenanlagen, die neben Sch\u00fcttg\u00fctern, \u00d6l- und Gasladungen sowie sensiblen Chemieprodukten vor allem f\u00fcr den Umschlag von Containern und Projektladungen genutzt werden. Der Elbehafen ist mit einem maximalen Schiffstiefgang von 14,80 Meter f\u00fcr Seeschiffe bis zu 100.000 tdw ausgelegt. Der ChemCoast Park verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine vollst\u00e4ndig vorhandene und gut ausgebaute Infrastruktur. Voll erschlossene, als Industriegebiet ausgewiesene Fl\u00e4chen stehen auch f\u00fcr gr\u00f6\u00dfere Vorhaben zur Verf\u00fcgung. Zudem bieten die Partnerfirmen im ChemCoast Park eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen: Vom Brand- und Werkschutz \u00fcber das Facility Management bis zur Analytik k\u00f6nnen alle Einrichtungen gestellt werden, wodurch sich Investitions- und Betriebskosten erheblich verringern. 2004 wurde auf Initiative von Wirtschaft und Politik bei der egeb ein Regionalmanagement eingerichtet, um den Wirtschaftsstandort Brunsb\u00fcttel zu st\u00e4rken, zu vermarkten und die Wahrnehmung in der Metropolregion Hamburg zu verbessern. Ziel ist, die bedeutende Stellung des Hafenstandortes als Wirtschaftsmotor der schleswig-holsteinischen Westk\u00fcste f\u00fcr die Zukunft zu erhalten und auszubauen.

Weblinks:Weiterbildung  Lebenslanges Lernen ist in der heutigen Zeit wichtiger denn je. Gut ausgebildete Mitarbeiter sind ein wesentlicher Faktor f\u00fcr Unternehmen, um im globalen Wettbewerb den Anschluss nicht zu verlieren. Weiterbildung z\u00e4hlt heutzutage als Schl\u00fcssel f\u00fcr Wohlstand. Vor allem vor dem Hintergrund des demografischen Wandels werden Arbeitskr\u00e4fte in Zukunft zu einem wesentlichen Faktor f\u00fcr Wirtschaftswachstum. Um die Qualifizierungsma\u00dfnahmen in Dithmarschen zu b\u00fcndeln, schlossen sich 1989 Dithmarscher Weiterbildungstr\u00e4ger, der Kreis Dithmarschen, die Kammern und die Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit Heide in Form des Arbeitskreises \u201eBerufliche Weiterbildung\u201c zu einem Weiterbildungsverbund zusammen. Der Arbeitskreis wurde st\u00e4ndig erweitert und unter Federf\u00fchrung der egeb als \u201eDithmarscher Weiterbildungsverbund\u201c (DW) zum Forum der regionalen Weiterbildungsanbieter. Analog dazu wurde 1996 im s\u00fcdlichen Nachbarkreis der Steinburger Weiterbildungsverbund gegr\u00fcndet, bei dem die egeb: Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung ebenfalls Tr\u00e4ger ist. Aufgabe ist die Beratung von Unternehmen und deren Mitarbeiter. Aber auch Menschen, die sich aus eigener Initiative weiterbilden wollen, werden individuell \u00fcber Kurse und Finanzierungsm\u00f6glichkeiten informiert. Die Arbeit des Verbundes wird aus Mitteln des Ministeriums f\u00fcr Wissenschaft, Wirtschaft und Verkehr des Landes Schleswig-Holstein sowie der Europ\u00e4ischen Union gef\u00f6rdert. Ein Projekt zur St\u00e4rkung der Weiterbildungsbereitschaft von Unternehmen und Besch\u00e4ftigte ist das \u201eBildungscoaching in kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen (KMU) der Region Unterelbe\u201c. Gegr\u00fcndet wurde das Projekt im Februar 2006 und in Kooperation mit den Kammern, der Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit Heide und dem DGB entwickelt. Ziel des Projektes ist, Betriebe in Fragen der Weiterbildung und Personalentwicklung zu unterst\u00fctzen. Vor dem Hintergrund eines erwarteten Fachkr\u00e4ftemangels ist die Sicherung der Besch\u00e4ftigungsf\u00e4higkeit durch Weiterbildung ein wesentlicher Erfolgsfaktor. \u00dcber das Bildungscoaching werden der Qualifizierungsbedarf f\u00fcr KMU und Handwerksbetriebe ermittelt und die Mitarbeiter zur Teilnahme an einer beruflichen Weiterbildung motiviert, um damit die Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit des Unternehmens zu st\u00e4rken. Der Qualifizierungsberater hilft bei der Umsetzung einer Weiterbildungsstrategie, die die unternehmerischen Ziele und die Bed\u00fcrfnisse der Besch\u00e4ftigten ber\u00fccksichtigt. Zielgruppe sind Betriebe mit bis zu 250 Besch\u00e4ftigten aus Produktion, Handel und Dienstleistungen, dem Handwerk sowie Alten- und Pflegeheime. Das Pilotprojekt wurde bis Ende 2007 vom schleswig-holsteinischen Wirtschaftsministerium und dem Europ\u00e4ischen Sozialfonds gef\u00f6rdert. Seitdem ist die Qualifizierungsberatung fester Bestandteil der Arbeit der Weiterbildungsverb\u00fcnde Dithmarschen und Steinburg. Gegenw\u00e4rtig werden in beiden Landkreisen j\u00e4hrlich zirka 100 Unternehmen vor Ort beraten. Tr\u00e4ger der Weiterbildungsverb\u00fcnde in Dithmarschen und Steinburg ist die egeb.

Die Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung greift dabei auf langj\u00e4hrige Erfahrungen aus der vorherigen EU-F\u00f6rderperiode mit der Gemeinschaftsinitiative \u201eLeader+\u201c zur\u00fcck. F\u00fcr die aktuelle F\u00f6rderphase wurden in ganz Schleswig-Holstein \u201eLokale Aktionsgruppen\u201c, beziehungsweise \u201eAktivRegionen\u201c eingerichtet. Die \u201eAktivRegion Steinburg\u201c geh\u00f6rte Ende 2008 zu einer der ersten Regionen in Schleswig-Holstein, die offiziell als AktivRegion anerkannt wurden. Zeitgleich wurde der Verein \u201eLokale Aktionsgruppe (LAG) AktivRegion Steinburg e. V.\u201c in das Vereinsregister des Amtsgerichtes Pinneberg aufgenommen. Bei der \u201eAktivRegion\u201c ziehen Privatpersonen, die \u00f6ffentliche Hand, kulturelle Einrichtungen und auch die Wirtschaft an einem Strang. Handlungsfelder sind die Verbesserung der Familienfreundlichkeit, des Kultur- und Naherholungsangebotes sowie die St\u00e4rkung der regionalen Wirtschaft. Im Mittelpunkt steht die Steigerung der Lebensqualit\u00e4t. Mit der \u201eAktivRegion\" haben die Akteure vor Ort die M\u00f6glichkeit, eine Vielzahl von Projekten umzusetzen. Daf\u00fcr erh\u00e4lt die Region j\u00e4hrlich von der Europ\u00e4ischen Union mehr als 300.000 Euro. Zudem stehen landesweit rund sechs Millionen Euro f\u00fcr so genannte \u201eLeuchtturmprojekte\u201c zur Verf\u00fcgung. Sie sollen eine gro\u00dfe Ausstrahlungskraft \u00fcber die Kreisgrenzen hinaus haben, innovativ und vor allem nachhaltig sein. Zudem muss die Finanzierung f\u00fcr zw\u00f6lf Jahre sichergestellt sein. Bereits in der ersten F\u00f6rderrunde konnte die AktivRegion Steinburg Ende 2008 mit zwei Leuchtturmprojekten \u00fcberzeugen und erhielt den Zuschlag f\u00fcr F\u00f6rdermittel in H\u00f6he von insgesamt 900.000 Euro - so viele Gelder, wie keine andere Region in Schleswig-Holstein.

Weblink:Gr\u00fcnder- und Technologiezentrum mariCUBE  Das bundesweit erste Kompetenzzentrum f\u00fcr die blaue Biotechnologie am Meer ist 2009 in B\u00fcsum an den Start gegangen. Dahinter verbirgt sich neben einer Forschungseinrichtung, die von der Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Marine Aquakultur (GMA) betrieben wird, auch ein Technologiezentrum f\u00fcr marine Biotechnologie (mariCUBE). Gemeinsam bilden sie Schleswig-Holsteins ersten Wirtschafts- und Wissenschaftspark. Mit dem Bau des 3,1 Millionen Euro teuren mariCUBE wurde im September 2007 gestartet. Der Kreis Dithmarschen als Tr\u00e4ger der Einrichtung \u00fcbernimmt 773.000 Euro. Das Land Schleswig-Holstein beteiligt sich an dem Projekt mit 2,2 Millionen Euro aus dem Zukunftsprogramm Wirtschaft mit EFRE- und Landesmitteln. Im \u201emariCUBE\u201c finden bis zu 20 Existenzgr\u00fcnder und Jungunternehmer aus dem Bereich der marinen Biotechnologie und deren Umfeld, die eng mit der Wissenschaft verflochten sind, ein optimales Umfeld. Das mariCUBE ist eine Au\u00dfenstelle des CAT. Bereits vor der offiziellen Er\u00f6ffnung wurde das mariCUBE von der Initiative \u201eDeutschland \u2013 Land der Ideen\u201c unter der Schirmherrschaft von Bundespr\u00e4sident Horst K\u00f6hler als einer von \u201e365 Orte der Ideen\u201c ausgezeichnet. Die GMA wurde im Herbst 2004 von der egeb und der Innovationsstiftung Schleswig-Holstein (ISH) gegr\u00fcndet. Er\u00f6ffnet wurde die Forschungseinrichtung, die zu 100 Prozent aus Mitteln des Landes Schleswig-Holstein finanziert wird, im Fr\u00fchjahr 2009. In der nicht kommerziellen Forschungs- und Versuchsanlage, sollen meeresbiologisches und technologisches Wissen zur Entwicklung nachhaltiger Aquakulturverfahren f\u00fcr Meeresfische in geschlossenen Kreislaufanlagen erforscht, Produkte entwickelt und vermarktet werden. Sowohl die technischen und \u00f6konomischen als auch die biologischen Aspekte der Haltung mariner Organismen werden erforscht. Ausschlaggebend f\u00fcr das 4,7 Millionen Euro teure Projekt war, dass die Ertr\u00e4ge aus der Fischerei stagnieren, die Nachfrage jedoch st\u00e4ndig steigt. Bereits heute wird der Bedarf zu rund einem Drittel aus Aquakulturen gedeckt. Bis zum Jahr 2015 wird dieser Anteil voraussichtlich auf zirka 50 Prozent ansteigen. Gekoppelt ist die Forschung mit der Lehre. Die Stiftungsprofessur, die an der Agrar- und Ern\u00e4hrungswissenschaftlichen Fakult\u00e4t der CAU angegliedert ist, wird von der ISH bis 2011 mit rund 500.000 Euro gef\u00f6rdert.

Weblink:Konversionsmanagement  In kaum einer anderen Region Deutschlands mussten so viele Kasernen mit neuem Leben gef\u00fcllt werden wie im Kreis Steinburg. Insgesamt vier Kasernen in einem Radius von 18 Kilometer rund um Itzehoe waren von der Umstrukturierung betroffen. F\u00fcr die Region eine Mammutaufgabe, die sie mit geballter Kraftanstrengung meisterte. Von der Schlie\u00dfung der Liegenschaften der Bundeswehr waren vier Kasernen in einem Radius von 18 Kilometer rund um Itzehoe betroffen. Der Abzug von rund 2700 Soldaten war f\u00fcr die Region mit einem Kaufkraftverlust in Millionenh\u00f6he verbunden. Hinzu kam der drohende Verfall der insgesamt 95 Hektar gro\u00dfen Fl\u00e4chen und der Immobilien. Um die Aufgabe zu bew\u00e4ltigen, wurde 2006 ein Konversionsmanager eingestellt, der sich aktiv um die Vermarktung bem\u00fchte. Um die Nachteile durch den Abzug der Bundeswehr auszugleichen und die Region wirtschaftlich wieder zu beleben, wurde das Projekt mit F\u00f6rdermitteln der EU und des Landes Schleswig-Holstein unterst\u00fctzt. Im Jahr 2009 war die langfristige Arbeit von Erfolg gekr\u00f6nt. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit der Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Immobilienaufgaben (BImA), der Politik und Verwaltung in den Gemeinden, dem Kreisbauamt und den zust\u00e4ndigen Ministerien konnte die egeb trotz Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise innerhalb von f\u00fcnf Monaten f\u00fcr die Kasernen in Breitenburg, Gl\u00fcckstadt und Kellinghusen Investoren pr\u00e4sentieren. Lediglich f\u00fcr die die Kaserne in Hohenlockstedt fand sich bereits im April 2004 mit dem Itzehoer Luftsportverein relativ schnell ein Interessent. Waldersee-Kaserne in Hohenlockstedt: Im Juni 2004 verlie\u00dfen 400 Soldaten die Kaserne, die jetzt vom Itzehoer Luftsportverein genutzt wird. Marinekaserne in Gl\u00fcckstadt: Im Juni 2004 sind 500 Soldaten des Marinesicherungs-Bataillons abgezogen. Seit 2006 werden die Sporthalle und Sportanlagen von den \u00f6rtlichen Vereinen genutzt. Die Arbeitsagentur nutzt ein Geb\u00e4ude auf dem 24 Hektar gro\u00dfen Areal. Im Februar \u00fcbernahm Bauunternehmer S\u00f6nke Krey aus Beidenfleth die Kaserne, um ein Gewerbegebiet zu realisieren. Liliencron-Kaserne in Kellinghusen: Im Dezember 2008 zogen 1110 Soldaten ab. Im Mai 2009 \u00fcbernahm die f\u00fcnfk\u00f6pfige Gesellschaftergruppe der Sport- und Touristikentwicklung GmbH (STE) um den Trappenkamper Hotelier Mokhtar Charrad das Gel\u00e4nde. Geplant ist eine Mischung aus Hotel- und Sportanlagen, die von Fu\u00dfballern aus der ganzen Welt als Trainingsareal genutzt werden sollen. Freiherr-von-Fritsch-Kaserne in Breitenburg-Nordoe: Im Dezember 2007 zogen 700 Soldaten ab. Im Mai 2009 kaufte der Itzehoer Michael May die Kaserne und will dort 120 Wohneinheiten f\u00fcr junge Familien direkt am Naturschutzgebiet \u201eNordoer Heide\u201c bauen.

Produziert wird der wertvolle Naturkautschuk und qualitativ hochstehendes Kautschukholz in Lateinamerika. Zu den Gr\u00fcndern und Initiatoren geh\u00f6rt die D\u00fcsseldorfer Unternehmerfamilie Breidenstein, welche seit \u00fcber vierzig Jahren im Reifenhandel und in der Kautschukindustrie t\u00e4tig ist.Geschichte  Die TIMBERFARM GmbH wurde am 31.01.2012 in das Handelsregister eingetragen. Direkt im Anschluss begann die Vorbereitung und die Pflanzung der ersten Kautschukplantagen, beginnend mit der Plantage Las Animas. Seit Beginn an wurden alle Plantagen in enger Zusammenarbeit mit der panamesischen Umweltbeh\u00f6rde, der ANAM (La\u00a0Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panam\u00e1) anvisiert, geplant, vorbereitet und bepflanzt. Seither w\u00e4chst die Anzahl an Plantagen sowie an gepflanzten Kautschukb\u00e4umen stetig. Im Jahre 2012 wurden die ersten beiden Plantagen mit einer Fl\u00e4che von ca. 135 ha vorbereitet und mit rund 75.000 Kautschukb\u00e4umen bepflanzt. Auf Grund der hohen Nachfrage nach einer Investition in Kautschuk und Kautschukholz wurden die Kapazit\u00e4ten im Jahre 2013 deutlich erh\u00f6ht. So wurden 2013 f\u00fcnf neue Plantagen mit einer Gesamtgr\u00f6\u00dfe von knapp 320 Hektar realisiert. Selbst im Jahre 2014 wurde das Engagement durch die hohe Nachfrage weiter gesteigert, so dass weitere 430 Hektar auf sieben Plantagen bepflanzt werden konnten. Im Zuge dessen wurde das Grundst\u00fcck \"Gran Piedra\" f\u00fcr die Hauseigene Kautschukfabrik, welche ab 2017 die Verarbeitung des gewonnen Naturkautschuks verarbeiten wird, vorbereitet und weitere Umweltstudien f\u00fcr den Bau der Fabrik abgeschlossen. Gleichzeitig wurde die eigene TIMBERFARM Baumschule er\u00f6ffnet um die Produktion der Kautschukbaumsetzlinge bei einer gleichbleibenden hohen Qualit\u00e4t sicherzustellen. Aktuell bewirtschaftet die TIMBERFARM GmbH eine Gesamtfl\u00e4che von mehr als 1150 Hektar erfolgreich in Panama. Auf diesen 17 Plantagen wurden bereits weit mehr als eine halbe Millionen Kautschukb\u00e4ume (rund 635.000) gez\u00fcchtet, gepflanzt und bewirtschaftet.Engagement  Die TIMBERFARM GmbH nimmt ihre Aufgaben und die daraus entstehende Verantwortung sehr Ernst. Seit 2012 ist die TIMBERFARM aktives Mitglied des IRSG (International Rubber Study Group) welcher als der Weltdachverband der Kautschukindustrie fungiert und besitzt neben der aktiven Mitgliedschaft auch einen Sitz im Beirat des IAP (Industrial Advicsory Panel). Im Jahre 2014 nahm die TIMBERFARM GmbH erstmalig an der j\u00e4hrlich stattfindenden\u00a0EXPO VERAGUAS\u00a0in Santiago teil. Die auf land- und forstwirtschaftliche Produktion und Dienstleistung ausgelegte Gewerbemesse war ein perfektes Umfeld, um den zahlreichen Interessenten und Messebesuchern einen Einblick in die TIMBERFARM T\u00e4tigkeiten zu geben.\u00a0Hier wurden die Pl\u00e4ne mit dem panamaischen Landwirtschaftsministeriums (MIDA \u2013 Ministerio de Desarrolo Agropecuario) weiter voran getrieben, mit dem Ergebnis, dass ab 2016 die TIMBERFARM auf die Pflanzsaison 2016 hin eine regionale Informationskampagne durchf\u00fchren und zus\u00e4tzliches Setzlingsmaterial produzieren und f\u00fcr die Landwirte bereitstellen wird. F\u00fcr das Jahr 2015 tritt die TIMBERFARM GmbH als Unterst\u00fctzer der Deutsche Kautschuk Tagung (DKT2015) sowie der International Rubber conference (IRC) welche vom 29.06. bis zum 01.07.2015 in N\u00fcrnberg stattfinden wird, auf.Kundenreisen  Seit Entstehung der TIMBERFARM GmbH Anfang 2012 wurde die Transparenz zum Kunden stetig sehr gro\u00df geschrieben. So wurde nicht nur direkt der Newsletter mit stetig neuen Informationen zu den Plantagen und zu Panama ins Leben gerufen, sondern direkt eine Kundenreise f\u00fcr den Jahresbeginn 2013 anvisiert. Jedes Jahr vor Beginn der Regenzeit in Panama f\u00fchrt Timberfarm Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer Maximilian Breidenstein einen Teil seiner Kunden zu den Plantagen in Panama. Jeder Partner ist stets dazu eingeladen dieses Aufruf zu folgen und sich ein pers\u00f6nliches Bild der TIMBERFARM Plantagen im Herzen Panamas zu machen. Seitdem die erste Reise stattgefunden hat, haben dieses Angebot mehr als 60 Personen wahr genommen und ein einschl\u00e4gig gef\u00fchrtes Rahmenprogramm in Panama genossen. Die Gruppen erhalten einen tiefen Einblick in die Geschehnisse rund um die Baumschulen, die Plantagen und die Vorgehensweisen von der Erstellung bis hin zur Ernte der Kautschukb\u00e4ume. Ebenfalls bieten die Agraringenieure der TIMBERFARM vor Ort die M\u00f6glichkeit gezielte fachliche Fragen zu beantworten. Einige Eindr\u00fccke werden kurz nach den Reisen im Newsletter sowie auf dem Bilderportal Flickr schnellstm\u00f6glich zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt.Kautschukplantagen  Aktuell betreibt und bewirtschaftet die TIMBERFARM GmbH 17 Kautschukbaumplantagen mit einer Gesamtgr\u00f6\u00dfe von \u00fcber 1.150 Hektar in Panama. Alle Kautschukplantagen befinden sich im Herzen von Panama in der Provinz Veraguas. Mittendrin, in der Stadt Santiago, der Bezirkshauptstadt der Provinz Veraguas, befindet sich der Firmensitz. Santiago ist ein wichtiger Verkehrsknotenpunkt. Hier trifft die Panamericana, welche von Panama nach Costa Rica f\u00fchrt, auf die Nord-S\u00fcd-Achsen, welche die pazifischen mit den atlantischen K\u00fcstengebieten Panamas verbindet. Die agrar- und forstwirtschaftlichen TIMBERFARM Aktivit\u00e4ten lassen sich von hier gut koordinieren.Pressemeldungen Weblinks Unternehmens-Wiki NEUBERGA  2008 in Berlin-Kreuzberg unter dem Namen Grunig & Zehetner GbR gegr\u00fcndetes Unternehmen, focusiert auf die Entwicklung der Neuen Berliner Gartenr\u00e4ume. Seit 2010 von Gerald Zehetner als Einzelunternehmen fortgef\u00fchrt.Produktphilosophie  NEUBERGA - die neuen berliner gartenr\u00e4ume bietet hochwertige, bis zum Ende gedachte Holzbauten an, die sich einer zukunftsweisenden Rohstoffnutzung und -verarbeitung verpflichtet sehen. Die eleganten Massivholz-Objekte aus L\u00e4rchenholz\u00a0 werden individuell hergestellt. Klare \u00e4sthetische und harmonische Grundwerte geben den Rahmen vor. Weiters zeichnen sie sich besonders durch nachhaltige Verarbeitung in alpenl\u00e4ndischer Tradition und ihre geradlinige, massive Konstruktion aus. Altes Handwerk wurden hierbei wiederbelebt und mit zeitgem\u00e4ssen Anspr\u00fcchen verwoben. Anstelle schwer abbaubarer Anstriche wird allein durch konstruktiven Holzschutz, entsprechende Materialdimensionierung und Holzauswahl eine lange Lebensdauer gew\u00e4hrleistet. Das mit Sonne und Regen verbundene Verwittern des Holzes wird bei den NEUBERGA - Objekten billigend in Kauf genommen und bringt den zus\u00e4tzlichen, nat\u00fcrlichen Oberfl\u00e4chenschutz. Das begr\u00fcnte Flachdach (Dachbegr\u00fcnung) sorgt f\u00fcr ein angenehmes Raumklima im Inneren. Zus\u00e4tzlich bietet es die Vorteile der Regenwasser- und Staub-Bindung und ist sowohl Ersatzlebensraum als auch N\u00e4hrstofflieferant f\u00fcr K\u00e4fer, Bienen, Insekten und V\u00f6gel. Dass das Bl\u00fctenmeer im Sommer auch eine wahre Augenweide sein kann, braucht hier wohl nicht zus\u00e4tzlich erw\u00e4hnt werden! Jedes NEUBERGA - Objekt ist zudem ein Unikat f\u00fcr sich, da j\u00e4hrlich nur eine kleine Anzahl an Objekten f\u00fcr wahre Natur- und Gartenliebhaber kundenspezifisch produziert werden.Zusammenfassung Geschichte  Die junge Grunig & Zehetner GbR mit Sitz in Berlin-Kreuzberg wurde im Fr\u00fchjahr 2008 von Gerald Zehetner (Innenraumgestaltung und M\u00f6belbau) und Torsten Grunig (Produktdesigner) gegr\u00fcndet. Mit jeweils mehr als zehn Jahren Erfahrung im Umgang mit dem Material Holz und der Entwicklung und Herstellung von vielf\u00e4ltigsten Produkten entstand der Wunsch ein m\u00f6glichst ganzheitliches, nachhaltiges Gartenhaus zu konzipieren das sich stark am BAUHAUS Weimar orientiert. Es sollte ressourcensparend & umweltfreundlich sein, \u00fcber eine ausgedehnte Lebensdauer verf\u00fcgen und dem feinen Handwerk wieder die langverwehrte Daseinsberechtigung zur\u00fcck bringen. Nach Torsten Grunigs Ausstieg wird das Unternehmen NEUBERGA seit dem 01.01.2010 von dem geb\u00fcrtigen \u00d6sterreicher Gerald Zehetner als Einzelunternehmen fortgef\u00fchrt. 2011 wurde der Bereich LEBENSRAUM GARTENLAUBE weiterentwickelt und das Produktangebot um den Bereich GARTENPLATEAUS & -DECKS erweitert. In die Gartensaison 2012 starten wir mit einem Angebot einfacher, hochwertiger GARTENM\u00d6BEL, welche das Objektsortiment abrundet und komplettiert.Produktion & Ressourcen  Hier nur ein kleiner Auszug unserer Partner: - Kunst- und Bauglaserei DIRK ARLT - Bau- und Nutzholzhandlung MANFRED LUCKE - AGe Blech Bauklempnerei GmbH - MeyArtSupport - Franz Meyer - PMP Krebs GmbH - Tischlereibedarfshandel im Herzen Berlins - Berliner Schrauben - Dieter Schmid - Feine WerkzeugeWeblink  http://www.neuberga.com http://www.facebook.com/NEUBERGAUnternehmens-Wiki Johnny Controletti Willkommen  Hi Johnny Controletti - wir freuen uns, dass Untermehmens Wiki jetzt Teil der Wikia-Gemeinschaft ist!

Das der Text komplett zerpfl\u00fcgt wird und dadurch jede Information sofort in ein \"billiges\" Licht ger\u00fcckt wirid, ist ja wohl nicht zwingend notwendig.

Jul. 2010 (UTC) Hallo zusammen. Das komplette Angebot von Wikia ist bisher ausschlie\u00dflich werbefinanziert, wobei wir schon versuchen darauf Wert zu legen, die unterschiedlichen Interessen der Nutzer (die in der Regel am liebsten gar keine Werbung haben wollen) und der Werbetreibenden (denen es oft gar nicht bunt und auff\u00e4llig genug sein kann) unter einen Hut zu bekommen. Die einfachste L\u00f6sung, wenn dich die Werbung zu sehr st\u00f6rt, ist sicherlich das Erstellen eines Benutzerkontos - ein Aufwand von unter zwei Minuten. Angemeldeten Benutzer wird in der Regel keine Werbung angezeigt. Eine andere M\u00f6glichkeit w\u00e4re es, sich als Betreiber eines Wikis an unserem Probelauf zu beteiligen, wo wir Werbung externer Anbieter gegen Zahlung eines Monatsbeitrages ausblenden. --Avatar 11:16, 13.

Dies war der Beginn des Aufbaus eines Allianz-internen Shared-Services-Diensleisters, der neben IT auch die Bereiche Operations und Services abdeckt. Die ASIC war aus Allianz Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Informatik Service mbH (AGIS) hervorgegangen. Diese war im Januar 1998 durch die Auslagerung und den Zusammenschluss von drei internen IT-Einheiten von Allianz Sach, Allianz Lebensversicherung und Vereinte Krankenversicherung (heute Allianz Private Krankenversicherungs-AG) gegr\u00fcndet worden. Im Rahmen der \u00dcbernahme der Dresdner Bank durch die Allianz schloss sich die AGIS zum 1. Januar 2003 mit der IT-Tochter der Dresdner Bank DREGIS (Dresdner Global IT-Services Gesellschaft mbH) zusammen. Die AGIS verkaufte 2005 ihre Niederlassung Singapur an einen externen Provider. Im Februar 2006 wurden sieben Rechenzentren in Deutschland geschlossen und die Gro\u00dfrechner in M\u00fcnchen zentralisiert. Im Juli 2007 wurde die AGIS in Allianz Shared Infrastructure Services GmbH (ASIC) umfirmiert. ASIC hatte einen europ\u00e4ischen Konsolidierungsauftrag der Allianz Gruppe und integrierte schrittweise die IT-Infrastrukturen der europ\u00e4ischen Allianz Gesellschaften. Am 31. Oktober 2008 wurde die Umwandlung der ASIC GmbH in eine Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft (Societas Europaea) wirksam. Mit der neuen Gesellschaftsform wurde der Ausbau des internationalen Gesch\u00e4ftes forciert. Im Januar 2010 hat ASIC die ersten ausl\u00e4ndischen Niederlassungen in Gro\u00dfbritannien und Irland in Betrieb genommen. Anfang Februar 2010 wurde eine Gesch\u00e4ftsstelle in den Niederlanden er\u00f6ffnet, im Mai 2010 folgte eine Niederlassung in Belgien.Wikilinks - Wikis & Websites mit Artikeln zum Thema Unternehmens-Wiki G.I.B Bestandsoptimierung unter SAP G.I.B mbh  G.I.B, Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Information und Bildung mbH, ist ein mittelst\u00e4ndiges Unternehmen aus dem Siegerland.

The Amazons had been created around 1200 B.C. when the Greek goddesses drew forth the souls of all women who had been murdered by men. One soul was left behind, the one that would be born as Diana. That soul originally belonged to the unborn daughter of the first woman murdered by a man (whom Hippolyta was the reincarnation of). In the late 20th Century, Hippolyta was instructed to mold some clay from the shores of Paradise Island into the form of a baby girl. Six members of the Greek Pantheon then bonded the soul to the clay, giving it life. Each of the six also granted Diana a gift: Demeter, great strength; Athena, wisdom and courage; Artemis, a hunter's heart and a communion with animals; Aprhodite, beauty and a loving heart; Hestia, sisterhood with fire; Hermes, speed and the power of flight. Diana grew up surrounded by a legion of sisters and mothers. When she was a young woman, the gods decreed that the Amazons must send an emissary into Man's World. Queen Hippolyta ordered a contest to be held, but forbade Diana from participating. Diana disobeyed and did so anyway in disguise, easily winning the contest and being named the Amazon's champion. She was given a uniform fashioned from the standard of someone who had visited the island a few decades earlier. Wonder Woman did not keep her identity a secret, and she was not at first a \"super-heroine\". Indeed, her character was in many ways that of a babe in the woods, innocent and without guile. Diana spoke only Themyscirian, a combination of classical Greek and Turkish. She had to learn English when she arrived in America, rather than knowing the language intuitively. Nonetheless, Diana was trained as a warrior and had no compunction against using deadly force when called for. Diana often dealt with war, injustice, inequality, death, and conflicts involving the Olympian Gods. Before embarking on her mission, Diana was given the Lasso of Truth, forged by Hephestus himself. She was also given the Sandals of Mercury, which allowed her to instantly traverse great distances in seconds. Diana's mission was one of peace, but part of it initially involved defeating a mad plot by Ares to destroy the world. Diana ventured into the world by starting at Boston. There she met a Harvard professor, Dr. Julia Kapatelis, and her daughter, Vanessa Kapatelis, as well as the Air Force Officers Steve Trevor and Etta Candy. Diana stayed with Julia and Vanessa and over the course of a month or two, Diana learned to speak English. She was attacked at their home by Decay, one of Ares' minions, and after a battle that spilled out into the streets of Boston she first came to the public's eye and was given the name Wonder Woman. Upon discovering Ares' plan (one that involved creating a nuclear holocaust), Diana managed to foil it, battling through his sons Phobos and Deimos before finally convincing him the error of his ways with the Lasso. After defeating the God of War, Diana returned home for healing at the hands of Poseidon himself.Mortal and Immortal Challenges  After returning to Boston, Wonder Woman agreed to hire Myndi Mayer to be her publicist, getting her image out to the world at large. She spent the next several months touring the world, conducting interview and learning a lot about the world. She also met most of the Justice League, and after meeting Superman she realized that she was instantly enamored with him. She also gathered the attention of Barbara Minerva, the Cheetah, who desired to take the Lasso of Truth from Diana. She lied to Wonder Woman about having found the lost Girdle of Antiope to get close to her, but after touching the Lasso her truth was made clear. Diana was frustrated and angry over her naive trust of Minerva. That same night, Barbara decided to take it by force and attacked as the Cheetah. Diana managed to fight her off, and afterwards she decided it was time to return home again. The gods were pleased with Diana's work--one was a little too pleased, however. Zeus offered to make Wonder Woman a goddess if she agreed to sleep with him. Diana refused, amd Zeus decreed she must be punished. The other gods managed to deflect the full brunt of Zeus's wrath. He decided that Wonder Woman must pass the Challenge of the Gods. He ordered her to go into the pits beneath Paradise Island and retrieve his fondest treasure; Diana accepts the challenge. Hippolyta was not pleased, and though she could do nothing to stop Diana from descending into the depths, she did resolve to follow after her (fighting past Phillipus first). Wonder Woman battled all number of evil monsters in the pits, from the Hydra to the Echidna, but got some help from the spirit of Diana Trevor. Diana Trevor, the mother of Steve Trevor, revealed that she had been an Air Force Pilot who crash landed on the island and then died helping the Amazons in battle. It was for her that Diana was named, and it was her standard that was used to fashion the Wonder Woman costume. Hippoylta catches up with her daughter, and together they fight even more mythological beasts until they discover Zeus's treasure: Heracles himself! The demi-god had been changed to stone and made to bear the weight of the island for thousands of years. Diana and Hippolyta freed him, and brought him back to the surface. Faced with his punishment of thousands of years, Heracles was repentant and begged forgiveness for what had happened between he and the Amazons. The Amazons forgave him at last, and after a celebration he returned to Olympus. The gods were well pleased with Diana. Hippolyta was pleased as well, and ordered her daughter to return to Man's World and continue her mission. Once Wonder Woman was back, Myndi Mayer quickly arranged another publicity stunt, this time at a fair. Things got ugly, however, when the first Silver Swan arrived on the scene. Wonder Woman battled the Swan along the coast but could not capture her. Returning to Boston, Diana stayed with Vanessa while her mother was in Greece. She found herself distracted more and more with thoughts of Superman, eventually asking Myer to arrange a meeting between the two. Diana and Superman had their \"date,\" which included a battle to free Olympus from the grip of Darkseid after he had laid waste to it. Afterwards, Superman and Wonder Woman decided it would be best if they just remained friends, but Superman trusted Diana enough with the secret of his dual idendity. Wonder Woman is one of the few people who affectionately refers to him as \"Kal.\" The gods decided it was time to take a vacation (or \"Cosmic Migration\" as they called it) even as Diana decided to go with her friends to Greece, to see the ancient home of her people. She met Julia Kapetelis's parents, but felt a strange sensation in regards to one of the smaller islands that was long said to have a bad history. As it turns out, Circe made that island her home, and she sent her minions to capture Diana and drag her back in chains. Circe revealed her whole history--including the history where she murdered Antiope, Hippolyta's sister. Circe also revealed the prophesy she learned from Hecate, who was responsible for her power, and her belief that if either she or Diana kills the other than the spirit of Hecate will consume the other. Circe resolves to use a spell that will degenerate Diana back in the clay from which she was created. Even with the help of her friends, Wonder Woman only carried the day with the timely intervention of Hermes, who had not yet left Olympus When Diana returned to Boston, she learned of the death of Myndi Mayer--someone had apparently shot her in the face with a shotgun in her own home. A man named Steve London was framed for the death, but Diana learned that the man responsible for blasting her was a man named Skeeter Boyd. Skeeter died trying to escape from Wonder Woman, grabbing hold of an electrified fence and frying himself. He had not, in fact, actually killed Myndi--an overdose of alcohol and cocaine had killed her before he delivered the blast. Diana was left to question how something like this could happen. Called back to Paradise Island, Diana was summoned by the gods to come to Olympus with Hippolyta and Menalippe. It was still in ruins from Darkseid's rampage. The gods announced their decision to depart from the Earth, possibly forever, possibly not. They needed Diana's help to shatter what was left of Olympus so they could move on and allow the healing to begin. Their destiny now in their own hands, Diana called for a vote among the people whether or not they should open the gates of the island and allow men to come there. The Amazons voted yes, and Wonder Woman returned to Boston to invite Julia and Vanessa to be the first guests.Shadows of the Past  Diana is shocked when Hermes shows up in Boston. He explains that he feels the journey of the rest of the gods is foley and seeks to assert himself, as a god, in Boston. He wins a few converts through bribes and healing, despite Diana's protestations. Hermes is tricked, however, by Phobos and Eurayle into unleashing Ixion the Assassin from his prison beneath the Earth. Ixion went on a rampage across Boston, killing hundreds and damaging the old USS Constitution. Wonder Woman bound Phobos in her Lasso and Hermes decapitated Eurayle. Even together they could not stop Ixion, however, and he had to be struck down by jet fighters. Diana blamed herself for what happened, as she had not taken a stronger position against Hermes when he first arrived. Wonder Woman stood along with the rest of the world's heroes to battle against the alien alliance that tried to conquer Earth during the Invasion! crossover. Cheetah next decides to resurface. She uses a pair of Khunds, still on Earth after the invasion, to create a diversion so she can steal Wonder Woman's magic lasso. Suspecting that Dr. Baraba Minerva stole the lariat (but not knowing yet that she and Cheetah are one and the same) Wonder Woman travels to Minvera's home in England (this coincides with a trip to the first meeting of Justice League Europe, but Diana decides not to remain part of the team at this time). Minerva's manservant, Mr. Chuma, poisons Diana and proceeds to tell her the whole story of how Minerva became Cheetah. The poison has no effect on Diana, however, and she tracks Cheetah to Egypt where out in the hidden city of Bana-Mighdall she finds the lost colony of Amazons. Their leader, Queen Anahid incapacitated Diana with a poisonous dart and locked her up. The high priestess tries to kill Diana but inadvertantly poisons herself. Diana breaks free and realizes that Cheetah will be on the prowl that very night--but she is still groggy from the poison. The mercenary Amazons had been hired to pacify a nearby village. Armed for war, Wonder Woman fights them back and is attacked by Cheetah. After a very tough battle, Wonder Woman defeats her adversary and locks her up (Mr. Chuma dies in the all the fighting). Queen Anahid, mortally injured by Cheetah, dies after commanding that Diana be spared. The Amazons call off the raid and tell her their history. They are indeed the descendents of Antiope, Hippolyta's sister, though they are not immortal. They have in their possession the other Golden Girdle of Gaea. They are a nation of mercenaries and have been since Antiope's death. Pythia, blaming Theseus and all men for her mother's death, was their first leader. The city is attacked by Hermes, who has learned of the rogue Amazons and is extremely angry. He has come for the Golden Girdle. Diana manages to convince him to cease his attack. One of the Amazons, Faruka, decides to use all the chaos to try and seize power, using a (cyborg?) Amazon called Shim'tar. With Hermes weakened by Gaea's status, Diana fights Shim'tar alone, battling to a standstill. The Egyptian govenment, outraged over the massacre at one of their villages, orders an air strike on the hidden city. Not even Hermes is able to intervene. The entire city is destroyed, leaving Wonder Woman, Minerva, and Hermes alone in the desert. Wonder Woman has recovered both her lasso and the Golden Girdle. After a brief stop back in Boston, Diana returns the Girdle to her mother on Themyscira. The time has come for Themyscira to welcome the world more openly. Twelve delegates are chosen: Asmund Lindel, the Norway delegate to the U.N.; Maritza Nitumbe, a South African botanist; Phyllis Haller, an American feminist bestselling author and sociologist; Vladimir Morakov, a Russian neurosurgeon; Robert Cantwell, Scottish history teacher and war veteran; Rabbi Benjamin Hecht and Unitarian minister Reverand Alan Withersppon, the only two religious leaders to respond to Diana's invitation (the Vatican was silent); Lin Koo Teng, a survivor of Tienamen Square; Rovo Quashi, a blind man from Ethiopia; Henri Tibet, a parapelegic architect from Canada; Felix Zumac, a Haithian zoologist and anthropologist; and Lois Lane, everybody's favorite reporter from the Daily Planet. Hermes, shedding his immortality, grants Diana the ability to use her winged sandals to take the delegates to Themyscira. The delegates all arrive to a magnificent greeting by the Amazons. No one suspects that Eris, daughter of Ares, is plotting discord. She nearly succeeds in turning everyone against one another when her plans are discovered and thwarted. Afterwards, the delegates all deliver their favorable report to the U.N. while the Amazons commence the cleanup. Julia is on a dig overseas and Vanessa is at summer camp. Hermes, shorn of some of his divinity, has been staying with Steve Trevor. Wonder Woman had her second run in with the Silver Swan, now more powerful than ever, when Valerie was attempting to escape from her \"benefactors.\" Wonder Woman and Etta Candy were captured by Hank Armbruster's thugs, but working together they were able to break free. Usng her Lasso on Armbruster, Diana was able to unveil the depth of his lies to Valerie. The Swan walked away, no longer the villain. With Themyscira known to the world and the gods departed from Earth, Queen Hippolyta decided it was indeed time to take a more active role. The Amazons removed their bracelets and decided to come to Man's World and see all that it had to offer. Hippolyta, Menalippe, Phillipus, and other came to stay at a hotel in Gotham City. Diana encountered Hermes again, who had rebuilt a temple unto himself and proceeded to hit on Diana again--or did he? This Hermes turned out to be Mercury, and Wonder Woman had to help the true Hermes battle his \"evil twin\" at their temple. Mercury was able to win the battle, taunting the humbled Hermes as he departed the field. Hippolyta and the others decided they needed to present themselves as more than just an extension of Wonder Woman, and Steve Trevor told her that he needed some space as well, as Etta was growing jealous of the two of them. When Vanessa also got angry at Diana for being late to her birthday party and even Julia wanted some space, Diana decided to return home to recharge. While at home, Diana was contacted in her sleep by Hermonia as well as Pariah, both of whom offered warnings about an impending crisis. Waking from this nightmare Diana seemed to drift into another one, this one involving a badly beaten and injured Hermes. Diana suspected that Circe was behind her ill fortune lately. Back in Boston, Wonder Woman encountered Hermes--who announced his intention to destroy Boston. Diana told him she would never let it be so--but from Hermes' point of view, it was the Amazon who was threatening the city, and so they began to battle one another, all because of the illusions of Dr. Psycho, who had been posing as a therapist for Vanessa. Diana and Hermes stopped short of killing one another when one of Vanessa's teachers interrupted the insane villain. Diana and Hermes, relieved of their delusions, join together to track down their tormentor. Realizing that he had been twisting the mind of Vanessa as well, Diana was able to share her thoughts with Vanessa and track him down in his lair. There she found Vanessa's teacher, whose unborn baby had been tortured by Dr. Psycho as well. Meanwhile, the Amazons are attacked in their hotel by masked assassins, who also murder the police officers at the building and frame it on the Amazons themselves. The word quickly spreads, and by the time she takes the injured teacher to the hospital, the police try to arrest her for murder. Diana protests their innocence while alerting the police to the location of Dr. Psycho, whom she left tied up with her Lasso. However, when the police arrive, he is nowhere to be found; the Lasso is tied to a chair but no one is there. Before the Boston P.D. take her in, she convinces them to allow her to help deliver the child, which she successfully does. A news report indicated that armed Amazons broke into the hotel in Gotham and slaughtered police and civilians alike. Wonder Woman allowed herself to be taken into custody where she learned the horrible tally: Hippolyta was missing, Philippus was gravely injured, Menalippe and Epione had been arrested (the former with injuries), Mnemosyne and Timandra had been arrested in other cities, Pythia and Euboea were unaccounted for, and Hellene had been killed. There was also an unidentified Amazon who was killed at the hotel, prompting a scare that there could be dozens of murderous Amazons running about. Vanessa comes to the police station with news her mother is missing. Diana manages to convince the police to let her see the unidentified Amazon. The dead woman is unknown to her, but the tell-tale claw marks raking her body lead her to believe she was killed by the Cheetah. Comissioner Gordon reluctantly order Diana arrested, but Diana, fearful for the safety of her friends, breaks out of the jail. Recovering her Lasso, she frees Menalippe from her hospital before catching up with Pythia and Euboea and taking them all back to Paradise Island.War of the Gods  At home, many of her Amazons sisters are crying out for vengeance, believing their queen to have been murdered. Diana asserts herself as the rightful leader of the Amazons, no matter what they decide to do. As they are debating, the Oracle announces that the gods have returned. No sooner does she do so when Diana is summoned to Mt. Olympus. The gods announced that something was terribly wrong with the order of things. They too had seen Pariah and did not understand his importance. Zeus had expended much of his power just summoning Hermes from the Earth, and it had taken the combined energy of the rest of the pantheon to summon Diana there. They told her that Donna Troy had also turned up. Just then, a new set of beings walked in like they owned the place--it was the Roman pantheon, led by Jupiter himself. The Roman gods announced that they had a human champion that would battle against the Greek's Wonder Woman--that champion was none other than Captain Marvel. Diana was forced to defend herself against a possessed Captain Marvel even while Hermes and Mercury engaged in round two. Wonder Woman defeated Captain Marvel. Circe began to unveil her master plan, unleashing chaos across the globe. While Wonder Woman was on Olympus, Heracles traveled to Paradise Island. Once there, earthquakes began to rock the island. Traveling beneath it, Heracles found Atlas with the island on his shoulders. This was the Roman Atlas, and he mistook Heracles for Hercules. Once they got that straightened out, they were just as confused as anyone. Back in the U.S., Mnemosyne, Timandra, and Epione were being transported by a military escort that was attacked by Amazons--but no Amazons the three prisoners recognized! These Amazons left a few surivors in the escort to tell the tale, then gassed the three prisoners and took them with them. Diana, after her victory over Marvel, was transported back to Boston. Diana ended up at the house of a police inspector, Edward Indelicato, whom she was friends with. She recounted her story and Edwards agreed to help her. Diana, sensing that Circe trully was to blame for all the madness going on, decided that she had to track down Doctor Fate for assistance, who gave her a spell that made her invisible so she could return to Boston. The spell wore off when she (literally) ran into the Silver Swan, which was dumb luck as Valerie had been looking for Diana to give her some guidance. Diana had little to give, however, as distracted as she was by everything else going on. A call to Black Canary put Diana in contact with Batman, whom she asked to retrieve the missing Themysciran goblet that she believed would help exonerate her people for the massacre in Gotham. Diana then banded together with Zatanna, Phantom Stranger, Spectre, Dr. Fate, Flash (Wally West), Madam Xanadu, and Geo-Force to try and undo the spells Circe had woven. Circe had expected this, and planned on cultivating the energy from the spells the group was now casting--but her plan backfired and her spells were undone: yet the war continued. Circe had been betrayed by her ally Kaslak. In addition to replacing the relics Circe needed for her spell, he also allowed Pythia into Circe's lair. Phytia managed to free her captured sisters as well as Julia Kapatelis. Wonder Woman met back up with Batman, who had recovered the Goblet, but told her that it was, in fact, a forgery that had been coated with some unknown material. Diana followed the trail back to Egypt, were she discovered the temple of Bana-Mighdall that she thought had been destroyed. There she found Lobo battling Shim'tar. When some more Rogue Amazons arrived, Diana had Lobo fight them while she tackled Shim'tar, demanding to know what had become of her mother. After a tough battle, Diana manages to strike Shim'tar to the ground--only to unmask her and find that it was none other than Hippolyta! Now the truth finally came together. Cheetah had a confrontation with Edward Indelicato and explained the whole truth to him. While she had been in prison, Circe's minion Mikos came to her, transforming her permanately into the form of the Cheetah--although now, Minerva's mind remained fully in control. Circe was hardly benevolent, however, and insisted that Cheetah join her bestiamorph army. Cheetah was to help Kaslak steal the proper artifacts for Circe to cast her spell. This included the Goblet, which Circle resolved to switch with a fake that would suit her own ends. She engaged the remnants of the Rogue Amazons, all part of a plot to discredit Diana and Themyscara. She also hired Doctor Psycho to keep Diana distracted. When Hippolyta touched the fake goblet in Gotham, it transformed her into the new Shim'tar. Mikos removed Shim'tar from the building but failed to get the real goblet after Maxie Zeus's assassins showed up, hired by Cheetah to try and double cross Circe. Phillipus was attacked by one of the Rogue Amazons at the scene and witnessed Helene's death at the hands of the Cheetah. Time was running out for Wonder Woman. She tracked down Hermes, but he was unable (or unwilling) to heal Hippolyta, so Diana resolved to take her mother back to Paradise Island. She was attacked enroute by fighters, but with the help of Starman she managed to evade them. On the shores of the Island, she would face Circe at last. Circe had fought her way through Hermes to get to Diana, but she would not simply kill the Amazon and risk Hecate's curse. Cutting them off from other heroes gathered on the Island (Starman, Hawkwoman, Aquaman, and Dolphin), Circe used her magic to revert Diana back into the clay of the island, the very same clay from which she was born. Having destroyed Wonder Woman, Circe departed, ready to grasp final victory. As the Amazons mourned their fallen princess, Superman rallied Earth's heroes for the final battle. Diana was not dead--not completely. Her soul was collected by Phantom Stranger, Spectre, and Deadman. They told her that Klarion the Witch Boy had been responsible for disrupting Circe's spells. Superman, meanwhile, lead the charge against Olympus itself, where the confused Greek and Roman pantheons were still committed to destroying each other. When Circe's deceptions were made clear, she was transported back to the limbo realm where she had slain Hermes. There she found Donna Troy and Wonder Woman--restored to life. Diana battled the evil witch, and this time her power was the greater, for Hecate's power left Circe. The witch was seemingly killed, but Hecate was denied Diana's soul. The gods decided to depart again, but the long war was finally over. The war had been costly. Much of the Island was in ruins and would need to be rebuilt, and Menalippe and other Amazons had lost their lives. The United Nations, thankfully, fully exonerated Themyscara from all charges, and Queen Hippolyta was alive and well. Diana returned to the U.S. just in time to attend Vanessa's Junior High graduation.Conflict at Home and Beyond the Stars  Wonder Woman was called to action by Superman when Brainiac seized control of Warworld and started to head for Earth. Superman decided that Earth could not wait for this invasion, they had to launch a preemptive strike, and so recruited Diana and many of the world's other heroes. While Batman gathered a team to defend Earth from any advanced warriors, Diana traveled with Superman and other heroes to Warworld. She fought bravely there, but her role was a minor one and undistinguished. Diana spent some time with Vanessa and Julia, until she learned from Edward Indelicato that the Cheetah had been captured in the Balkans, in a country called Pan Balgravia, by their new president, Baron Von Nastraed. Diana contacted the god Proteus prior to leaving, enlisting her help to create a false idenity, Diana Prince. Lacking knowledge of the region, she decided to enlist Deathstroke for help. Inspector Indelicato decided to come along as well. The first location that they were lead to turned out to be a trap and they had to fight their way through some royal guards. Capturing one, Wonder Woman used her Lasso to learn that the Baron had secret and dummy prisons set up all over--and he also had mass graves. Diana and Slade went undercover to the finest restaurant in the country, where they managed to meet the Baron and get him to agree to another meeting. On the way to the meeting, Deathstroke announced that he was parting ways, prompting a fight between he and Wonder Woman that she won. After tossing Deathstroke in the trunk of the car and having Indelicato stand guard, she broke into the Baron's castle. The Baron was no so naive as they would have hoped, however, and was waiting for her with several demonic thugs. Deathstroke quickly recovered, however, and some of his \"friends\" showed up as backup. Wonder Woman was thrown in a magic cage but managed to force her way out. Barbara Minerva, reverted back to human form, was in the cell next to her, very weak from her long torment. She explained that the demon ruler needed a powerful female host for its mate. The Baron and his associate, Mr. Drax, began their demonic ritual as Deathstroke arrived on scene. As Wonder Woman fought the demon Drax, Deathstroke went after the Baron. Minerva, lapping up some spilled blood, reverts back into the Cheetah, and dives through the portal that Drax had opened, sealing it and destroying Drax in the process. The Baron vanishes into thin air after Deathstroke plunges a dagger into him--but at least the nation is now free again. Wonder Woman was prepared to testify at Indelicato's hearing, but no charges were filed against him. Outside the police station, Diana met a distraught woman who claimed her daughter had been kidnapped by her husband. The man in question got on the wrong side of some drug dealers who were shot and killed during a meeting he had with them, prompting to grab a briefcase full of money (and his daughter) and run for it. The race was on to see if the police could catch up to him before mafiosos--but luckily, Diana made it there first, rescuing the little girl and preventing her from getting shot. Doctor Psycho was still on the prowl, and he used his powers to continue to torment Vanessa in her dreams. Wonder Woman was approached by a man named Asquith Randolph, the White Magician, for a mission that would take her into space, where she was needed to save the life of a female astronaut (Tasha) on an experimental Russian spacecraft. When she was onboard, Randolph detonated an explosive and the ship was catapulted through space. Diana managed to get it under control, but they were still rocketing into the unknown. After drifting for two weeks through space, their ship was salvaged--but their rescuers were only interested in making them slaves. The slavers stripped them of their clothing and equipment and dropped them on a prison world--a prison world populated entirely by females. Tasha and Diana were bruised and battered--but not broken. They were prisoners for months (on that planet) working in the quarries. A Khund prisoner frequently fought Diana. There was another prisoner, a Daximite, who was kept in chains as a warning to the rest. After finally learning some of the other aliens' language, Diana learned their tormentors were called the Sangtree and that they existed entirely as one gender for a century, than changed to the other. She finally managed to rally some of the other prisoners, destroying the Sangtree power station, capturing their starship, and freeing the imprisoned Daximite. Taking up the role of a kind of space pirate, Diana worked hard, recruiting more ships and allies as she carved her way across the Sangtree Empire. One of her new friends creates an artifical eye to replace one of the eyes the Daximite lost. The new Daximite is named Julia by Diana and she agrees to fight. Despite treachery from within, Diana is able to force a confrontation with the Sangtree emperor and get him (or her?) to admit the folley of his people's ways. With some help from Julia, Diana finally is able to make it back home. Randolph had weaseled his way into the position of \"Hero of Boston\" during her absence. Diana returned either just before, or perhaps the day of, the Death of Superman. Either way, she was not there to help fight Doomsday. The monster tore through Justice League America before being put down by the Man of Steel--at the cost of Superman's own life. Diana gathered with past and present JLA members to mourn the death of their friend. She held a place of honor during his funeral procession, and was one of the ones who actually closed the lid on the sarcophogus. Diana gathered with the other heroes to pay a last respect--every year on Christmas Eve, Superman read some of the thousands of pieces of mail directed to him. Diana found one letter thanking Superman for help, even though her house was destroyed and her husband had left her. While the others rebuilt the woman's house, Diana tracked down the husband, who was unaware of what had happened. The Justice League was in need of being rebuilt after Doomsday's rampage, so Wonder Woman agreed to come aboard as the new field leader.On her Own in the World  Diana was shocked when she returned to Paradise Island to find it missing--the entire island simply was gone! Diana did not know what to make of it, so she went back to Boston and decided to get a job. Now, despite the fact that she was now working for the Justice League, and that she had apparently made a lot of money via merchandising thanks to Myndi Mayer, and the fact that she was Wonder Woman, Diana resolved to look for a job in the classified adds. No one seemed interested...in hiring WONDER WOMAN. So she got a job at TacoWhiz, presumably so she could better understand the common man (and woman). She also got her own apartment. Diana then met a man named Micah Rains who offered her a job (Rains was, according to Indelicato, a total \"whackjob\") as a kind of P.I. The White Magician was careful to always be close by, stealing the limelight. Diana continued her work at the TacoWhiz while desperatly trying to make a difference in some people's lives. Doctor Fate, Inza, finally got ahold of Wonder Woman, offering her help at discovering what had happened to Themyscara. The two went back to the sight of the former island, where Fate was able to use a spell to let them see events of the last few moments of the island. It seems that a golden statue in Diana's likeness washed up on the shore. The Amazons brought it before Hippolyta, but then something happened--a bright flash of light and an explosion--and the island was no more. Convinced her mother was dead, Diana knew that Circe must be at fault. Dr. Fate was able to track her down, but when they arrived in Circe's lair, all they found were her remains--she was apparently killed in the same deadly spell she used to obliterate Paradise Island. Wonder Woman began to believe there was a connection between all the recent crimes that involved hi-tech gadgets. Diana began investigating. She also went out shopping with Etta for a wedding dress and realized (after Etta passed out) that her friend was starving herself to look thinner. While talking with Etta about it, the Flash showed up, warning Diana about a hit on her and that Mayfly was the hitwoman. No sooner did he get out his warning when Mayfly showed up guns blazing. With Etta and Flash's help, Diana managed to defeat Mayfly--but was shot in the process! While Diana recooperated in the hospital, Mayfly was murdered in her cell by an attorney named Donna Milton, who was working for Ares Buchanan, the supplier of the hi-tech arms and the one who hired Mayfly. Donna was carrying his child as well. Donna Milton then introduced herself to Diana, feeding her a story of her life that caused Diana to remark \"nearly every terrible thing that can happen to a woman has happened to you.\" This, of course, was the idea. Diana was quickly taken in by the charming Donna. Ares Buchanan was, naturally, an avatar for the god Ares, who was not so prepared to completely abandon the Earth. He had easily corrupted the White Magician, making him one of his lieutenants alongside Donna Milton. After weeks of friendship, Donna betrayed her to Ares. When Donna refused to let Ares torture her, however, he shot her and then prepared to shoot Diana. With a powerful spell from Ares, Diana was unable to break the chains that had bounded her. Donna, using one Ares' weapons, created an explosion that left her and Diana plunging down hundreds of feet into a watery chamber beneath Ares' lair. The fall should have killed Donna but they survived and Donna went into labor. While Diana delivered the child, the White Magician contacted Ares's mafia boss, Sazia, letting him know that Ares Buchanan had died in the explosion and they had to act quickly to hold his power together. Sazia was not interested, however, and attempted to shoot the Magician... so the magician killed him instead. The White Magician, whose powers were increasing because of his connection to a demonic realm, began to transform some of his lackeys into supervillains. One of them, Dreadnaught, attacked Diana at the hospital--another attacked the Kapateles house, kidnapping Vanessa and seriously crippled Julia. Wonder Woman was able to save the day before more of his thugs could kill Etta and Steve. Her patience having run out, Diana contacted some of the mafia men connected to the Magician and warned them they had one hour to return Vanessa unharmed. When they failed to comply, Diana began to tear apart the gang, tracking down all of their outfits and demolishing them, leaving the words \"No quarter, no sanctuary\" as she went. Mrs. Sazia, the new head of the Sazia crime family, decided to betray the Magician to get Diana off their back. Diana found the Magician's lair and rescued Vanessa, but the Magician himself was not there. Diana, plagued by nightmares, began to have doubt about her instability. She sought out Superman and asked him to stop her if she ever got too out of control. This was after the police nearly arrested her for her recent behavior. Luckily, Doctor Fate returned and told Diana that she had been having the same nightmares--dreams about the end of Themyschra. Replaying the spell that showed the end of the island, Diana guessed that maybe it hadn't really been destroyed--it was all a complex illusion created by the witch Circe. Diana unveiled Dr. Fate, who was really Circe in disguise (or at least, an illusion of her). Circe revealed that she had not destroyed Paradise Island, but rather she had found a way to relocate it to the realm of fire where the Amazons had been fighting for their lives every day since their imprisonment. Circe offered to return the island--if Diana sacrficed an innocent life. She gave her until midnight. Battling through Circe's illusions, Diana could not save the life of a young runaway named Cynthia who was struck and killed by a car. With her death, however, Paradise Island was restored.A New Contest. A New Wonder Woman  Diana was elated--her home was back, her sisters were back, and her mother was back. Hippolyta told Diana the whole story of what had happened. Circe had led the renegade Amazons to Paradise Island, stirring them up with dreams of conquest. They caught Hippolyta's Amazons completely off guard, and for two days there was nothing but bloody battle in the city. Too late Circe's schemes became apparent. She used her magic to transport the entire island to another dimension, where for ten years in that place the Amazons were set upon by demons. Both tribes of Amazons had to band together or die, and for ten years they fought against the demons. As a reward, Hippolyta bequeathed a section of the undeveloped part of the island to her sister's tribe. Now they were back, and the nightmare was over. Diana recounted everything she had done in the months since their absence--Hippolyta was not pleased. She felt Diana had been wasting many opportunities to affect man's world as a whole. Hippolyta announced that she was not sure if she could trust Diana to represent the island anymore. Upset, Diana wandered away from the city with some friends, where she met Artemis for the first time. Diana was intrigued, if not particularly impressed, with his brash, arrogant young Amazon from the tribe of Antiope. As they were talking, word came that Hippolyta had made a decision--there would be a new contest, and perhaps a new Wonder Woman! Zero Hour caused a timeout in the action, however, and Diana had to join her friends and help save the universe. Her part was rather small, however, although she did help Power Girl deliver her baby (although that baby seems to have disappeared and been dropped from canon anyway.) Zero Hour caused subtle differences in the time stream. Now, instead of Diana having used a simple mask like all the other Amazons during the original contest, she used the Proteus Mask to literally change her appearance. Also, Diana's powers were said to not function while on the island. There were also some startling revelations about Hippolyta and her part in Heracles' madness (although these changes seem to also have been dropped in later canon.) Hippolyta meant to bar the Antiope Amazons from competing in the new contest, but she was overruled by a general vote among the Amazons. The Contest began, and Diana and Artemis quickly jump out ahead. Artemis has to discipline one of her followers who tries to assassinate Diana during the middle of the Contest--Artemis does not think that anyone but Diana can truly win, and that it is merely a means of Hippolyta getting at her daughter, but she is determined to keep her honor. Hippolyta discolosed to Phillipus that she had activated ancient magics, bringing to life monsters to battle the champions. The two were neck and neck during the last sprint--but seeing her mother ahead, Diana stumbled and fell. Artemis won the Contest--and the role of Wonder Woman. Artemis was given the Wonder Woman outfit to wear. She was also given the Sandals of Hermes, which let her fly, and the Gauntlet of Atlas, which increases the strength of the wearer by a factor of ten. She also had her bow. Diana created a new suit of black (fairly skimpy, too) and headed back to Boston, too angry with her mother to listen to anything she had to say. Diana helped Artemis battle some minions of the White Magician before visiting her friends in the hospital. Donna Milton was fully recovered, but Julia was paralyzed. Artemis went to New York City where a public relations firm picked her up, offering to make her a well known presence. Artemis promised to succeed where Diana had failed. Diana had to help her friend Micah, in trouble again, before going off to help Hawkman. Diana's teammates in the Justice League did not take kindly to the news that they was a new Wonder Woman. They refused to follow anyone other than Diana. Boston was now caught in the middle of a gang war between the Sazia Family and the Paulie Longo family. Longo had the White Magician on his side, and all the beasts and creatures that came with him. Not to be out done, Mrs. Sazia hired Cheshire, Poison Ivy, and Cheetah. Diana was captured by the three villains. Cheetah, however, helped Diana escape, figuring she owed her one from their last encounter. Poison Ivy took out some of Longo's assassins that were coming for Sazia. The crime mistress was not safe, however, as the Joker himself decided to come to Boston (things in Gotham being a little too hectic lately). Longo was displeased with the Magician's work, as it had failed to overwhelm Sazia. The Magican decided he needed to draw more power. Diana managed to track down Sazia and the Joker--who had a vest of dynamite strapped to him. The timer was a ruse, however, and it sprayed Diana with a paralyzing gel. Descending into the realm of the gods, Diana became one with the god Pan, allowing her to shake off the paralysis and become (temporarily) almost as mad as the Joker and beat him at his own game. Meanwhile, Cheetah attacked the White Magician as he was preparing a spell to eliminate Sazia and Diana, causing him to miscast it and teleport them both away. Sazia managed to murder Longo before he got to her. Artemis, frustrated and angry that the world had seemed to reject her, believed Diana was purposefully trying to disrupt her efforts as Wonder Woman. She tried to bring in Sazia, but the mob mistress evaded her. Diana, meanwhile, tracked down the Chauvenist and other thugs that Artemis had battled in her time as Wonder Woman. She discovered that they had all been hired by Artemis's agency, all for the sake of publicity. Diana managed to convince Artemis of this after a brief skirmish between the two. Afterwards, Diana decided she needed to go back home to get some answers from her mother. Diana found her mother in the woods, disciplining herself for what had happened between her and Diana. She confessed that when they were in the other dimension, she had visions of the future--a future where Wonder Woman would die. That was the real reason she called for a new contest--a contest that she rigged, so that Artemis would die and Diana would live. When Hippolyta said she expected Diana to remain with her while Artemis faced certain death back in Boston, an angry Diana responded \"then you lost me a long time ago.\" Artemis was in trouble--the White Magician was back, but coming back from whatever realm he had gone to had changed him, transforming him into a powerful demon. He transformed Sazia and Cheetah into his minions and prepared for battle. As Artemis began a desperate struggle against the demon, Diana went first to the hospital. Her friends told her they thought she must have some kind of healing power--not only should Donna Milton and her baby have died in the explosion that killed Ares Buchanan, but Julia was almost completely recovered from her paralysis. Diana, however, realized the truth: Circe had been showing up, randomly attacking her before disappearing, with no rhyme or reason. Diana realized Circe had faked her death very well when she had gotten rid of Paradise Island--she had assumed another identity, and hid her own mind so well in that other mind that maybe she did not even remember. Diana fingered Donna Milton, who denied this truth, not willing to accept it. But when Diana pressed her, Donna got angry and a spell teleported Diana to Artemis's side. The two Amazons fought together in a desperate, impossible fight against the demon White Magician, the demon Cheetah, and the demon Sazia. When all seemed lost, Circe/Donna Milton turned up, and in a single burst of magic she disappeared, along with Cheetah and Sazia. Artemis, mortally wounded by the Magician, gave the Gauntlet of Atlas to Diana. With her strength thus amplified, Diana was able to put down the demon...and then hold Artemis as she died. The two found peace in that last moment.Back to Basics  Recently moved to Gateway City to get a new start, Diana begins investigating some otherworldly technology--which leads right to Darkseid, who captures Diana and brings her and a policeman named Mike Schorr to Apokolips. With the help of Metron, Diana and Schorr escaped back to Earth. Diana learned that Darkseid was after Themyscira. They got back after Darkseid had already invaded the Island. Wonder Woman rallied her sisters to make a stand against Darkseid. The dark god called the battle after a long hard fight. His parademons could be restored to life--the Amazons could not. Darkseid left the field, content with the damage done. Twelve hundred Amazons died, five hundred were injured. This meant that half the total population of the Island had perished. Diana learned that her mother had left the island before the battle, stepping down as queen. Diana is offered the crown, but declines and returns with Mike to Gateway. In Gateway, Diana got a job at a museum, working for the curator Helena Sandsmark. She also met Helena's daughter Cassie Sandsmark. Cassie proved her penchant for getting into trouble early when she accidently reactivated a golem that had to be put down. Diana was then approached by the Phantom Stranger, who needed her help to stop a recent plot by Morgaine le Fay. Morgaine was working with Warly and had captured the Demon (Jason Blood). She used her power to sick Etrigan on Diana, but Phantom Stranger managed to lift the spell and the three of them went after Morgaine in her lair. Next she used Arion, enthralled by her spell, to attack them as they approached. Morgaine managed to capture them, and she had Vandal Savage and General Immortus as well. Morgaine had planned on using their immortality to extend her own life and power, but Diana--having given up immortality upon leaving Themyscira--disrupted the spell. She battled Morgaine, who disolved into dust. Diana had thought Artemis was gone for good--but an unlikely adventure through Hell itself saw the return of her lost sister. Diana joined up with the new Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner) to capture some renegade Khunds in Gateway. A new hero calling himself Champion appears in Gateway. Before Diana can meet him, she faces a new threat. When a scientist's young son is fatally injured in his lab, the scientist transfers the boy's mind into a computer system. Unfortunately, the boy thinks he is actually playing a computer game, and uses his father's hard synthoid technology to create recreations of Barry Allen, Sinestro, and Doomsday who all run amok in Gateway. Champion joined the fray to help Diana, and then Cassie--making quick disguise and grabbing the Sandals of Hermes and Gauntlet of Atlas--decides to assist, calling herself Wonder Girl (although here she just gets in the way). The scientists manage to help Diana from the lab, even as Decay shows up and attacks them. Cassie was eager to prove herself as Wonder Girl and Diana was eager to train her--but Helena emphatically rejected the idea. Cassie snuck out of the house, getting into a battle with Decay which almost ended in a stalemate. Diana, of course, showed up and defeated Decay. Meanwhile, back in Boston, Vanessa Kapatelis is still being plagued by nightmares because of Doctor Pscyho... but at long last she is able to turn the tables on him in her dreams. Soon afterwards, Diana helped out in the Final Night, although aside from crowd control, her part was extremely minor. After that, she got involved with some of the Earth's greatest heroes to stop Know-Man. In the wake of that, a group of aliens called the Hyperclan arrive, promising to help turn the Earth into paradise. Their cover is quickly broken, and they are discovered to be a group of renegade White Martians. After helping defeat the Martians, Diana joins with the others to become a charter member of the new Justice League. A series of minor earthquakes began to be felt worldwide. Three animal-men broke into the Gateway museum, then escaped in a transparent aircraft. They later broke into a second museum, only to escape again. Diana and Champion, using a private plane of his, tracked them to Antarctica, where they discovered the ancient city of Lansinar far beneath the ice and were captured by its inhabitants. The Challengers of the Unknown were there as well. The people there, living in darkness for 40,000 years, had no eyes, but their rulers--all who resembled ancient Egyptian deities--did. The rulers explained that long ago, theirs was an advanced city-state on a contient further north--but 400 centuries ago, the continent shifted to where it is now, burying them beneath the ice (this timeframe would seem to correspond with the fall of Atlantis as well). The four immortal rules took the form of beast men, and they traveled to Ancient Egypt and helped them build their grand civilization--but they were no match for the coming of Alexander the Great and the Greek Gods that came with him. Some of the rulers were then imprisoned for centuries. Now they desired to return their continent to its proper place. Diana pointed out to them that their loyal followers could not long survive away from the home they had always known. The leaders decided to stay where they were, and they gave Diana a Lansinar morphing disc--a transparent object that could transform into anything she wished (like an invisible jet). After they got back to Gateway, Mike Schorr expressed his attraction to Diana, but she told him she was not interested in him that way (she was also being hit on by Champion). In the many weeks or months since Diana came to Gateway, Hippolyta had been wandering the city streets under the name \"Polly,\" befriending a few people but refusing to explain her origins. She had to be hospitalized, however, when her body began to change into stone. One of her new friends, a psychic named Angelica, discovered who she really was. Diana, meanwhile, was searching for Mike Schorr, who had gone missing. She found him in the lair of a savage, feral Cheetah. Attempting to strike Cheetah, Diana missed and struck a wall--only to have her hand shatter as if made of clay! Cheetah had made a deal with Neron during Underworld Unleashed--she had sold her soul in exchange for her assistant, Mr Chuma being restored to life. Unfortunately, with no soul in place, the base, savage aspects of the Cheetah began to overwhelm Minerva. With Chuma's help, Diana managed to revert Cheetah back to human form. Jason Blood returned to help Diana figure out what had happened to her hand. As Diana went over her whole history with Jason, she had a sudden feeling--a sense that something had happened to her mother. With Champion's help, Diana was able to find her mother--who had now completely turned to stone. Diana was fast turning that way too. Champion and her friends decided to take her home. Arriving on Paradise Island, they found the entire population of the city turned to stone--all save Eudia, the Oracle, who had not yet fully turned. She said that what had happened occurred because the gods had left the earth--but she pointed to Champion, and revealed him to truly be Heracles in disguise. In anger, Diana lashed out at him--and crumbled into dust. The Greek gods now reentered the scene. They called Heracles to their location and after he explained himself--saying that originally he became Champion out of a desire for revenge but later fell in love with Diana--the gods realize that their departure from earth is what triggered the Amazons reverting to the stone and clay from which they came (although presumably, the Antiope Amazons would not have converted). They restored Diana to life, and ordered a hearing: Julia and Vanessa, Steve and Etta, and Helena and Cassie were all summoned to Olympus. After the hearing, the gods decided to return to Earth, and with their return, the Amazons were restored to flesh. Before being sent home, Cassie managed to grab an audience with Zeus, who decided to grant her wish of becoming a superhero. Diana was gathered with Helena and Cassie Sandsmark and Jason Blood when Artemis stormed in, trying to kill Blood. Diana was forced to battle Artemis. She was joined in battle when Blood transformed into Etrigan and Cassie exhibited the new powers given to her by Zeus. The fight spilled out on the streets of Gateway. Hippolyta, who had returned to visit the friends she made from her wandering days, saw the fight--and Artemis--on television. She suddenly became terrified--with Artemis alive again, would the cost be Diana's life? She and her entourage raced to the scene. Neron then showed upon the battlefield, and took all the parties present to Hell. Neron split Jason from Etrigan, tormenting the former and Helena, whom he cared for, while forcing Diana to battle Etrigan. Artemis managed to free herself and Cassie and in the process they found another of Neron's prisoners, Merlin. Artemis used the silver \"ornaments\" on her costume to injure Neron, but before withdrawing, the demon lord blasted Diana with a lethal bolt. Everyone was transported back to Gateway--with Diana lying an inch from death. Diana was taken to the hospital. Donna Troy came, herself having just lost her son and ex-husband in a car accident. One by one, the other members of the Justice League showed up. They tried to heal Diana, but they could not, and she was all but dead. As her friends, both in and out of the League kept vigil, her recovery looked bleak. Being incapacitated, Diana was not able to participate in the Genesis Crossover, which involved not only the machinations of Darkseid to control the Source, but also involved the evil of the war god Ares--evil that nearly destroyed the gods of Olympus themselves. Ares and Darkseid were both imprisoned on the Source Wall at the end of the conflict. Hippolyta, Donna Troy, and Cassandra had to rescue Diana from a rogue doctor who had hoped to transfer her consciousness into Diana's body. It only reconfirmed what they had dreaded, however--Diana seemed trully dead. The gods intervened, however, answering everyone's prayers--Diana was resurrected, not just as a mortal, but as the new Goddess of Truth. Queen Hera told Diana her days as Wonde Woman were over. Diana was uneasy in her new role, being told my her fellow goddesses that she can only aid those who call on her help. Meanwhile, on Themyscira, the Amazons decided that Hippolyta, having betrayed the trust of the island with her actions regarding Diana and Artemis, must be forced to do a pennance: she must become the new Wonder Woman. This was made all the more possible by Hippolyta's augmentation thanks to her contact with the Source during the Genesis crisis. See Hippolyta for more information regarding Hippolyta's tenure as Wonder Woman. Diana, remained on Olympus, learning the true history of the dichotomy between the Roman/Greek pantheons. It was during Hippolyta's time as Wonder Woman that the \"true\" history of Donna Troy was at last revealed. When Diana was a child, the Amazon sorceress Magdala used a spell to create a perfect duplicate of Diana to be her playmate. No one but the three of them knew. Six months later, Dark Angel, an enemy of Hippolyta's from when she traveled back in time, came to the island and kidnapped the duplicate, thinking she was the original Diana, and forced her to live a thousand different lives that all ended in tragedy. Thanks to Diana's intervention, Donna Troy was restored to life (with some help from the Flash), but Diana was \"punished\" for her interference by being made back into a mortal again. Her mother eagerly stepped aside to let her resume her role as Wonder Woman.Devastation of the Gods  Circe reemerged, seeking revenge against Hippolyta and Diana. She used her magic to cause Hippolyta to forget who she was, resulting in Hippolyta thinking she was the wife of a man who had lost his (and he thought she was his wife), and the same went for the man's son. Diana eventually broke through Circe's spell and reclaimed Hippolyta's memory, who then went back to Themyscira. The ancient god Chronus emerged from the depths of time, desiring to be the new supreme god of all. He created a new pantheon for himself, and with his pantheon created a twisted doppleganger of Diana, the child villain known as Devastation.Infinite Crisis Era  While under the mind control of Maxwell Lord, Superman brutally beat Batman and engaged in an all out violent fight with Wonder Woman, thinking she was his enemy, Doomsday. Lord also tried this with Diana and failed as she is immune to this power. Wonder Woman put up a valiant fight with the Man of Steel, and injured him badly despite injuries she sustained as well. When Superman was stunned, she realized that even if she killed Superman (which she could have at that moment) the problem would not be solved. She created a diversion after grounding the Man of Steel that lasted long enough for her to race back to Max Lord and demand he tell her how to free Superman of his control. Bound in her lasso of truth Max replied, \"You will have to kill me,\" and Wonder Woman snapped his neck. The ramifications of this action are expected to resonate in the future; her relationships with both Superman and Batman are seriously strained. The status of Wonder Woman amongst the other heroes and the public at large is uncertain; the Brother Eye satellite (the deranged Artificial Intelligence controlling the OMACs) broadcast the footage of Wonder Woman murdering Maxwell Lord, preceded by the word MURDER, to media outlets all over the world. Wonder Woman defended herself from several OMACs who attacked her in her own home. Having repelled the assailants, she was delivering an injured boy to the hospital at the close of the issue and saw a broadcast of the damaging video on the waiting room's television. She witnessed first-hand how people viewing the footage reacted with fear and revulsion; Brother Eye had managed to kill the faith the world had in her. At the start of Infinite Crisis, Batman and Superman distrust her: the latter can only see her as a coldblooded murderer, the former sees in her an expression of the mentality that led several members of the League to decide to mindwipe their villains. (When he tried to stop the League from mindwiping Dr. Light after the villain brutally raped Sue Dibny, Batman's memory was also altered.) To make matters worse, Brother Eye, acting out of vengeance for the murder of Lord, initiated the final protocol Truth and Justice which aims at the elimination of all Amazons. A full-scale invasion of Themyscira is set into motion, utilizing every remaining OMAC. Diana and her countrywomen, now isolated and alienated from the outside world, are fighting for their lives. The Amazons prepare to destroy the OMACs with a powerful new weapon. However, Wonder Woman realizes that Brother Eye is watching and transmitting, and that unleashing such destructive violence would only exacerbate the effects of her killing of Maxwell Lord. After the weapon (the Purple Ray of Death) is used once, Wonder Woman convinces the Amazons to shut it down. She then calls upon Athena, who transports Paradise Island and the Amazons remaining on it to another dimension. However, Wonder Woman chooses not to join them, and is left to face the OMACs alone.One Year Later  One Year Later Donna Troy has taken up the mantle of Wonder Woman, after a year in which Diana was missing. Diana re-appears in the familiar guise of Diana Prince, secret agent, complete with an updated version of the white jumpsuit she sported in the early 1970s (Batman has helped her create her new secret identity.) Diana joins the Department of Metahuman Affairs, and is partnered with Nemesis. During her introduction to the team, she is brought up to speed on the surveillance information available on Wonder Woman. Prior to dropping out of sight, Wonder Woman was last observed in the company of an eastern mystic named I Ching (a reference to the late 60s-early 70s version of the character). The World Court has dropped the charges against Diana for the killing of Maxwell Lord. Her first mission to save Donna Troy from a team of supervillains is joined by Cassie Sandsmark, Robin, Nemesis and the gods' new champion, Hercules. After revealing herself, Circe steals their powers and Diana is betrayed by Hercules who reveals he and Circe were the only gods who defied Athena's edict to vacate the mortal plane. Circe then betrays Hercules and de-powers him as well. Eventually Diana's powers are restored and she twirls into Wonder Woman for the first time since handing over that title to her sister Donna. Diana Prince's interaction with a women's movement that has established a series of \"Athenian Women's Help Shelters,\" to which are brought women who have been abused and have taken action to defend themselves. Diana is captured and imprisoned by the Department of Metahuman affairs, led by an imposter Sarge Steel. She is tortured and interrogated to garner information that will allow the United States government to build a Purple Death Ray like the one the Amazons revealed during Infinite Crisis. Moments prior to the Amazon assault on Washington, D.C., Diana is freed by Nemesis. Circe travels to Themyscira and resurrects Queen Hippolyta. (Hippolyta's first words are: \"Where is my daughter?\") Under Circe's influence, the queen leads an assault on the United States. Wonder Woman asks Kate Spencer (whom she knows to be Manhunter) to represent her before the Federal grand jury empaneled to determine if she should be tried for the murder of Maxwell Lord (even though she has been exonerated by the World Court). With the help of Sasha Bordeaux of Checkmate, Kate Spencer obtains a video of Wonder Woman killing Maxwell Lord which proves that Max was in control of Superman when she killed him. However, Wonder Woman will not allow Kate to use the evidence, as it would lead people to distrust Superman. Upon concluding their deliberations, the grand jurors refuse to indict Diana. Diana, Superman, and Batman meet to re-form the Justice League. After a battle against Solomon Grundy, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) and Black Canary offer membership to those involved in the last mission. The JLA and JSA join forces when members of the Legion of Super-Heroes are discovered in the 21st Century.Strengths & Weaknesses Powers  Superhuman Strength: Granted by Demeter (Goddess of the Earth). Diana is literally as strong as the Earth because of her link to the planet granted to her by Demeter. She is quite possibly capable of lifting anything on Earth. It is obvious her strength is magical in nature, given her height and weight. According to the secret files, Wonder Womans' strength is second only to beings such Superman and Captain Marvel. She has godlike strength and also invulnerability due to her aegis-made shield magic bracelets. With her superhuman strength and superior fighting abilities, she has proven to be a match for any of them at one time or another. During the War of the Gods, she was forced to fight and defeated Captain Marvel (albeit he was not himself and she used her Lasso.) Later she needed and took out the six other members of the Justice League, in Justice League; League of One. This was done in order to save their lives as well as the entire planet. She over-powered and subdued Supergirl without significant effort, suggesting that she is stronger than any Kryptonian female. She is strong enough to lift well over 100 tons with ease. Superhuman Durability: Granted by Demeter (Goddess of the Earth). High resistance to damage and magical attacks. Her resistance to injury is not quite as great as any of the above mentioned metahumans. However, due to her vast threshold for pain and her amazon ability to heal at a superhuman rate, this easily makes up for the difference. She has withstood considerable bludgeoning damage in the form of hand to hand combat with metahuman opponents (such as Superman and Captain Marvel) and physical damage (as seen when she is knocked back through two multi-storey office buildings and then buried beneath them). She has considerable resistance to human weaponries, although there are inconsistancies in her ability to resist injury, the variances are probably due to discrepancies in observation. High-powered rifle fire will cause her some pain, but no injury other than minor bruising. She can easily survive under extreme presures, freeze and heat. Born of the clay of Themyscira, and given life and divine powers by the gods themselves, Diana has heightened resistance to magical attacks. She is highly experienced in battling foes who use sorcery as a weapon. As a divine creation herself, she is far-less susceptible to manipulation by magic and mental attack than many of her fellow powerhouse heroes. Her body is also able to survive in extreme environments for long periods of time, like heat, cold, and even outer space, but cannot survive for extremely long periods of time in said environments without oxygen supply. Flight: Granted by Hermes (God of Messengers). Wonder Woman is capable of unassisted flight through an as yet unknown but probably magical means or through telekenisis. Her aerial maneuverability is not as developed as aerial combatants such as Hawkman or the Black Condor, but she is still a relatively capable aerial combatant as well. Wonder Wwoman is capable of flying at speeds of at least Earth's orbital velocity (5 miles a second) and even escape velocity. Her top speed is about half the speed of light since she could keep up with Jesse Quick. Superhuman Speed: Granted by Hermes (God of Messengers). She is able to think, react and move at superhuman speeds. She has been clocked at Mach 5 (hyper-sonic) traveling in flight just over an hour and can be presumed to be much faster when she has to be. Her super-speed, while impressive, is not as comparable to that of the Flash. Since Wonder Woman lacks a speed aura of the fastest speedsters, the environmental effects/disruptions that she causes probably give her the decision sometimes from utilizing superspeed mobility as a common mode of travel. It is unknown how long she can maintain a speedster's average pace (which we clock at approximately 125 mph (2.08 miles/second) to 200 mph (3.3 mile/sec) innercity and 225 mph (3.75 miles/sec) to 500 mph (8.3 miles/sec) over land outside of cities), though with her superhuman stamina, she can probably last as long as her counterparts, at her level. Superhuman Reflexes: Granted by Hermes (God of Messengers). Wonder Woman possesses reflex abilities similar to speedsters, such as Jesse Quick and Max Mercury, somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 times normal human reflexes with little concentration. She is able to keep up with Jesse Quick with ease, referencing her patron deity of speed and messenger of the gods, Hermes, as the source of her powers. Superhuman Agility: Wonder Womans's agility is far beyond that of even an olympic level athlete. As is her balance and coordination. Superhuman Stamina: Wonder Woman can last a great deal of time in any fight and with virtually anyone. She has held her own in combat with even a Doomsday clone. She doesn't tire out like many of her male meta-human counterparts. Enhanced Healing Factor: Granted by Demeter (Goddess of Earth). Like the Earth, Diana is constantly renewing herself, allowing her to quickly heal at an amazing rate. Her normal regenerative abilities allow her to recover from injury within seconds to minutes. She possesses an incredible immunity from poisons, toxins, as well as disease. In rare cases where she was gravely injured or where another has managed to severely poison her, Diana showed the ability to physically merge with the Earth, causing whatever injuries or poisons to be expelled from her body as she regains shape. Oneness With Fire: Granted by Hestia (Goddess of the Hearth). Apparently making her a focus of truth. Empathy: Granted by Athena. (Goddess of Wisdom) \"The Sight of Athena\" apparently grants her increased insight. (For example, Diana can often detects others' emotions, and is now so fully immune to Doctor Psycho's illusions that she usually is not even aware of what illusions he is attempting to project. Apparently most forms of mind control will not work on her either). She can also detect other people's emotions. Even other high-level telepaths would be unable to read her mind or attack her in such a manner. Enhanced Senses: Granted by Artemis (Goddess of the Hunt). Eyesight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. Dimensional teleportation: On occasion, Wonder Woman can literally leave the planet through meditaion. She did this to rescue Artemis when she was in hell, and has even conversed with the Greek Gods on occasion.Abilities  Master Combatant: Diana is the finest warrior ever born among the Amazons of Themyscira. She is a master of armed and unarmed combat, proficient with nearly every weapon ever made (especially the bow and the javelin) and the exotic martial arts styles of the Amazons. Batman once remarked that Wonder Woman is the best melee fighter in the world. Master Tactician and Strategist: Diana is also an accomplished strategist and tactician, trained in the arts of leadership, persuasion and diplomacy, and possesses a great deal of courage as well. She is a gifted leader. Multi-lingual: Diana has exhibited heightened proficiency with languages, being able to speak her native Themysciran, Ancient and Modern Greek, English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin Chinese (she expressed \"difficulty\" with the tones of Cantonese during an interview with Lois Lane), Russian and Hindi. Plus, through precise muscle control, she can mimic other peoples voices for short conversations (telephone). It is more difficult for her to mimic a man's voice than another woman's voice. Wisdom: Granted by Athena (Goddess of Wisdom). Diana possesses great wisdom and intelligence, though the degree varies from author to author. She is among the smartest and wisest members of the Justice League of America, along with the Martian Manhunter and Batman. Aviation: Expert pilot. Seen flying the Invisible Jet with ease. Expert Lasso Wielder: Can use the Lasso of Truth as an offensive and defensive weapon.Strength  Class 100+; Diana can lift 100 tons effortlessly. Wonder Woman's physical strength is superhuman to the point where she is second only to beings such as Superman and Captain Marvel. Her powers continue to grow and manifest,the longer she lives and works in \"man's world\". She is capable of lifting well over 100 tons effortlessly and she has been seen to help move objects as large as the Earth itself. Few super-villians have been able to match her capabilties as well. She is obviously wise given her age. Her amazon training and experience combined with her powers, make her nearly unstoppable.Weaknesses  Build Disadvantage: Wonder Woman really doesn't have any true weaknesses or an attack that she is automatically vulnerable to, however it is interesting to note that her height and weight make her vulnerable to perhaps a few attacks that cannot be dodged or blocked and that potentially move her from location to location. But this is common among any \"normal\" sized super-being. So, being of simular size to her male counterparts, this is a weakness shared by her powerful comrades as well. Repulsion technology might be an efficient means of attacking and partially subduing her since she has difficulty blocking area effect attacks and her true height and weight are independent of her strength. Piercing Weapon Vulnerability: Diana is extremely durable and has a vast tolerance for pain. However, Wonder Woman is somewhat vulnerable to piercing weapons. Some high powered rifle blasts or advanced machine-gun fire could cause her some pain, and minor injury (temporary bruising). Knives and swords of magical nature, as well as the attacker, will only cause pain and maybe, a temporary cut. Energy Vulnerability: She is sometimes vulnerable to extremely high electrical and energy attacks when caught off guard. On rare occasions, she has been subdued by powerful attacks from opponents such as Ares. Too Compassionate: Sometimes Diana exhibits too much restraint, arguably. Far weaker adversaries such as the Tasmanian Devil, the Cheetah and Poison Ivy, for example, have put up a fight or even grounded her temporarily, though she could easily stop or even kill anyone of them with just one hit. This has even put her life in danger on occasion. In her recent fight with a brain-washed Superman, he was trying to kill who he thought was Doomsday, and Wonder Woman still had some restraint during that violent encounter, as she refused to kill her friend and comrade, despite the destruction being caused.Equipment Transportation Weapons Trivia  John Byrne left the title with issue #136. After two issue written by Christopher Priest, Eric Luke became the regular writer for issues #139-159. Comic book fans and critics consider Perez's 60-issue run one of the highlights of Wonder Woman's history. P\u00e9rez and Potter gave her a pro-woman personality, and Perez's extensive research into Greek mythology gave more depth and verisimilitude to Wonder Woman's world than in her previous incarnation. Phil Jimenez produced a run which was likened in some ways to P\u00e9rez's, particularly since Jimenez' art bears a striking resemblance to his. Recently, the writing on the series was turned over to Greg Rucka, whose initial story arc involved a book Wonder Woman had written which caused controversy. The initial arc was full of political subtexts, but more recent storylines have involved the mythology aspect. The second Wonder Woman series was among several series that were cancelled at the conclusion of the Infinite Crisis storyline, specifically as part of the \"One Year Later...\" event focused around the weekly series 52. The final issue was #226. At the end of Infinite Crisis, we see Diana giving up the mantle of Wonder Woman to get in touch with her \"human\" side. This is probably inspired by her meeting with the Wonder Woman of Earth-Two.Tournament of Swath Wiki Deadpool Track Record  When Worlds Collide tournament - Tag team with LokiHistory Early Years  After his mother died from cancer, his father killed by a drunken friend, and he was kicked out of the United States Army Special Forces, Wade joined Project X. Little was known of Wilson\u2019s subsequent mercenary activities. At one point he was active in Tangier, Morocco, where he romanced a woman named Francie. When this relationship soured, he traveled throughout Asia, and was hired in Japan by a crimelord, the Boss, to infiltrate a sumo-wrestling ring owned by a rival criminal, the Oyakata. Wilson spent three years as a wrestler under the Oyakata's tutelage and became romantically involved with his mentor\u2019s daughter, Sazae. When the Boss finally ordered the Oyakata's murder, Wilson refused to complete his assignment, allegedly the first time he had ever done so, and relocated to the United States. In America, Wilson met and fell in love with teenage prostitute Vanessa Carlysle (Copycat), with whom he shared dreams of a better life. Wilson was subsequently hired by Middle Eastern interests to assassinate a blind British government operative named Althea, also known as Blind Al, but upon arrival at the Zaire base where she was stationed, he killed everyone except for Al who had fled. Wilson\u2019s employers sought vengeance for his failure by targeting Vanessa, who was rescued by Zoe Culloden, an employee of the interdimensional firm Landau, Luckman, Lake, and LeQuare. Culloden was keeping Wilson under surveillance, believing he was destined to play a vital part in a potential threat to the world. Learning that he had contracted cancer, Wilson broke up with his girlfriend Vanessa rather than force her to remain with a terminally ill man. He even gave up his chemo treatments, not wishing to prolong things.Weapon X  In Canada, he was offered hope in the form of Department K, a special weapons development branch of the Canadian government. Wilson became a test subject in Department K\u2019s branch of the joint U.S./Canadian superhuman enhancement project, the Weapon X Program; his cancer was temporarily arrested via the implantation of a healing factor derived from another Department K agent, the mutant adventurer Wolverine. Wilson was active in a covert field unit alongside the near-invulnerable Sluggo and the cyborgs Kane and Slayback. Vanessa herself was later affiliated with the team after having manifested mutant shapeshifting abilities, calling herself Copycat. During one mission, Wilson killed his teammate Slayback. As a result, he was rejected from the Weapon X Program and sent to the Hospice, allegedly a government facility where failed superhuman operatives were treated. However, unknown to the Canadian government, the Hospice\u2019s patients served as experimental subjects for Doctor Killebrew and his sadistic assistant Ajax (known then as The Attendant), with the patients placing bets in a \"deadpool\" as to how long each subject would live. Killebrew subjected Wilson to various torturous experiments for his own deranged satisfaction. In due course, Wilson formed a romantic relationship with the cosmic entity Death, who regarded him as a kindred spirit. Wilson started trying to kill himself, to join Death - going so far as to start taunting Ajax by saying his real name (Francis) over and over, which earned him the respect of his fellow Hospice patients. Then Ajax, angered by Wilson\u2019s taunts, lobotomized Worm, the closest thing Wilson had to a friend. At Death\u2019s prompting, Wilson killed him to end his suffering. However, under Killebrew's rules any patient who killed another was to be executed; Ajax subsequently tore out Wilson\u2019s heart and left him for dead, but Wilson\u2019s thirst for vengeance was so strong that it jump started his healing factor, regenerating his heart, although not curing his scarred body. Wilson then escaped the now-empty room and attacked the guards, making his way to Ajax. Wilson shot him in the chest with two automatic rifles, leaving him for dead. Taking the name Deadpool, escaped from the Hospice with his fellow patients.Mercenary  Following his escape, Deadpool served for a time as an enforcer alongside the surgically altered criminal Hammerhead. He soon returned to his freelance mercenary activities, donning a costume in keeping with his new identity. At some point during his mercenary career he was employed as an assassin by Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of crime. He also clashed with Wolverine, at that time a spy for the Canadian government. Also, at some point during these years, Deadpool caught up with Blind Al and kept her a prisoner in his home. Al\u2019s attempts to escape only resulted in death for those whose help she sought, leaving her no choice but to resign herself to captivity. Some years after escaping the Hospice, Deadpool, perhaps seeking compensation for the injuries inflicted upon him by Killebrew, returned to the Canadian government and was treated by Doctor Walter Langkowski, the bestial Sasquatch of Canada\u2019s super-team Alpha Flight. He also acquired a teleporter around this time. Deadpool soon found government work unsuited to his temperament, and he abandoned this endeavor. Hired by the criminal genius known as the Wizard, Deadpool at first went to the wrong address and received a job impersonating the criminal Hobgoblin. When again contacted by the Wizard, he joined with fellow criminals the Taskmaster and the Constrictor (Frank Schlichting) in a short-lived version of the Frightful Four. When this plan also failed, Deadpool sought to reclaim his position as the Kingpin\u2019s assassin, only to be challenged by fellow assassin Bullseye. Deadpool began frequenting the mercenary hangout called the Hellhouse, where the diminutive Patch issued assignments. There he clashed with T-Ray, a voodoo-sorcerer and assassin to whom he took an immediate dislike. He subsequently found employment with the time-traveling arms merchant Tolliver, in whose service he was reunited with Sluggo and Copycat. Unbeknownst to Deadpool, Tolliver subsequently sent Copycat to impersonate another mutant mercenary, Domino. Deadpool also recruited a man named Weasel to act as his weapon supplier, and the two became fast fast friends, despite numerous acts of violence against him. After some time in Tolliver\u2019s service, Deadpool was sent to kill Cable, the mutant soldier from the future who was in fact Tolliver\u2019s father and in whose company Copycat was impersonating Domino. However, Deadpool met defeat at the hands of Cable and his new charges, the young mutants in training known as the New Mutants. When Cable reorganized the New Mutants as X-Force, Tolliver was seemingly slain in battle with them, setting off a search by his various mercenaries for the advanced technology he had left behind. Deadpool\u2019s participation in the search was interrupted by the surprising interference of Slayback, who had cybernetically reconstituted himself after being slain by Deadpool and was eager for revenge. In the course of the ensuing battle, Copycat was gravely injured, and Deadpool sacrificed part of his healing ability to save her life. Deadpool subsequently helped X-Force member Siryn against the unstoppable Juggernaut and her uncle, Black Tom Cassidy, who had forced Killebrew into their service. Deadpool developed a strong attachment to Siryn, who only partially returned his feelings. The Genesis Coalition later hired Deadpool to capture Silver Sable - a mission that also threw him into battle against Daredevil, whom was then no longer going by his real identity. He took the fight to the sewers where he was 'convinced' to hand over the information of his mission, for triple his commission. He was also put on retainer, in case he thought about choosing to take a mission against Sable's interests again. Unsure of his worthiness, Deadpool sought out Copycat, only to find she was now dating Kane. Deadpool fought both Kane and Wolverine, who had been sent to check on Kane by a mutual friend. Deadpool was subsequently abducted by information brokers seeking a cure for the Legacy Virus but was rescued by Wolverine and the mutant mercenary Maverick.Mithras  Soon afterward, Deadpool was approached by Zoe Culloden of the rechristened Landau, Luckman and Lake who believed he was destined to be the Mithras, one who would help usher in a golden age for Earth. Skeptical, Deadpool turned her away, only to be hit with a string of personal failures. These included the alienation of Weasel and Blind Al (whom had been meeting, against Deadpool\u2019s instructions), a defeat at the hands of T-Ray and loss of good grace at Hellhouse. He also met up with Bullseye to do a pro-bono job in Greece, where the assassin told him that he was losing his edge - as shown by the fact he only wounded the people he was supposed to be killing. Deadpool disputed the fact, even going as far as to accuse the now-dead guards of moving the castle he was supposed to blow up with a sheep-rocket, when he hit the tower instead. Bullseye told Deadpool that he wouldn\u2019t kill him for one reason - he made him laugh. It was revealed that they had worked together before, in the army - where Bullseye nearly lost his pinky toe because they were laughing so much on a mission. Hoping to turn over a new leaf, he found that killing was not so easily left behind when, at the behest of the ghosts of his fellow former Weapon X inmates, he killed Ajax. The former Attendant had been tracing down and killing them all, one by one, mainly wanting to kill Deadpool. This was possible partly due to the help of Dr Killbrew, who lost his life to Ajax. Before he was remotely-kidnapped by his teleportation belt and Ajax, he told Blind Al that she was now free. After being employed by L, L & Lake, he was hired to be part of a Heroes For Hire mission. Much to the annoyance of Colleen, Misty Knight, Luke Cage and Iron Fist. When he found that he would have to climb a mountain to their castle destination - and that HFH lacked a flier - he decided to teleport up instead. He was at a loss for words when he was seen as soon as he appeared at the top. The essence of surprise lost, the HFH attacked, finding an iteration of Wild Pack waiting for them. After the rest of Heroes For Hire were defeated, Deadpool decided to teleport to safety. A while later, Deadpool located and freed Misty and Colleen from the room they were being held in by Madcap, including bringing their weapons to them. When asked where he concealed them, he replied with \"Do you reeeeally want to know? It involves an awful lot of lubricant.\" Deadpool and the girls met up with Luke Cage who, when they located their mark, turned out to be working to an alternate agenda. Claiming he could smell a traitor when he saw one, Deadpool opened fire. Cage managed to escape minutes later. Deadpool hoped to move forward by accepting Culloden\u2019s offer, only to be dismayed when he learned that his destined role was to kill Tiamat, a potential threat to the arriving \u201cMessiah.\u201d Deadpool instead killed the Messiah when he learned that it brought not true peace but mindless bliss instead.Continued Mercenary Life  Having lost his optimism about bettering himself, Deadpool returned to his mercenary life. Troubled by recent events, he sought the counsel of deranged psychiatrist Doctor Bong, who advised him to work out his difficulties in a fight with Wolverine. The fight indeed cleared Deadpool\u2019s mind, but his psyche was dealt a stunning blow by the resurrection of Mercedes Wilson whom Deadpool still believed to be his wife. T-Ray revealed himself not only as the one responsible for her resurrection, but also as the true Wade Wilson. The revelation did not break Deadpool\u2019s spirit as T-Ray had hoped, for the mercenary still harbored hopes of bettering himself. Swearing vengeance, T-Ray departed with Mercedes Wilson. Later, in the course of an assassination assignment against author Duncan Vess, Deadpool again clashed with Wolverine who had sensed something strange about Vess. The pair found themselves battling Vess\u2019 vengeful kinsmen after the author was revealed to be a werewolf, and they parted on good terms. Weeks later, Deadpool sought medical treatment for Siryn, who had been injured in a mission with X-Force. Allying himself with the mysterious Watchtower group, Deadpool captured Wolverine in exchange for Siryn\u2019s treatment. Siryn was cured, while Wolverine easily outfought his captors. Seeking a new place for himself, Deadpool briefly shared an apartment with fellow mercenaries Titania and the Constrictor. However, Titania proved to be Copycat in disguise, and the apartment was destroyed by the The Wizard and the Taskmaster, both seeking revenge on Deadpool. He next established a secret warehouse headquarters and took on a young sidekick who called himself Kid Deadpool, but the youth, also seeking vengeance for Deadpool\u2019s part in his father\u2019s death, blew up the warehouse. Deadpool was then tracked down by the feral mutant Sabretooth and invited to join the new Weapon X Program. Impressed by Weapon X\u2019s upgrade of his healing factor, he agreed to join, but soon found the organization\u2019s methods to be too bloody even for him. After the death of Copycat at the hands of Sabretooth, he confronted the Director, only to have his healing factor reversed to the point where he again lost physical cohesion and died. The lingering effects of Deadpool\u2019s healing factor upgrade resurrected him, leaving him amnesiac. A chance encounter with Weasel restored his memory, and he discovered that four other individuals had laid claim to the Deadpool name. These impostors were aspects of his own personality given form by a device called the Gemini Star, wielded by his nemesis T-Ray who had been hired by the intergalactic villain Thanos, himself enamored of Death and jealous of Deadpool\u2019s relationship with her. T-Ray intended to manifest and extinguish every aspect of Deadpool\u2019s personality, leaving him an empty shell; however Deadpool damaged the Gemini Star, causing his personality fragments to be absorbed into T-Ray, rendering him comatose. With T-Ray out of the way, Deadpool claimed his identity as the true Wade Wilson after all.Agent X  Following an assignment against the Four Winds crime family, Deadpool gained great status as a mercenary and formed a company called DP, Inc., aided by business partner Sandi Brandenberg. His success was short-lived, however, when the Black Swan, a fellow assassin who had actually slain the Four Winds himself, sought vengeance for Deadpool\u2019s wrongful claim. Both men were believed dead after an explosive confrontation, but the Swan\u2019s telepathic power caused the memories and skills of both himself and Deadpool to merge in the corpse of his underling Nijo. Deadpool\u2019s healing factor resurrected Nijo, whose mind was created from an amalgam of Deadpool and the Swan. Injured and amnesiac, found his way to Sandi\u2019s apartment. Sandi believed Nijo to be Deadpool and nursed him back to health. The man took the name Alex Hayden and together they started \"Agency X\", with Hayden dubbed Agent X after the company. Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool with a case of amnesia. In fact, the truth was more complicated, as discovered when the Black Swan showed up with a \"tabula rasa\" Deadpool in tow, who Hayden immediately shot in the head. Deadpool's own personality was slowly growing back, unwittingly accelerated by Hayden's bullet to his head. In an attempt to regain the parts of his mind he had lost, as well as remove the pieces of their minds he wanted rid of (\"You and Wilson have my skills, Mr Hayden. In return, I received a taste for Radiohead and an encyclopedic knowledge of pornographic knock-knock jokes. Yes, I'd like to switch back if possible\"), including Nijo's sense of honor, Swan proposed a three-way mind meld. Hayden agreed. However the Swan, being an evil cad, attempted to double cross the other two and kill them as soon as the process was complete, but while he concentrated on Hayden, Deadpool immediately stabbed the Swan in the back. Deadpool, Hayden and Hayden's allies Outlaw and Taskmaster eventually defeated and killed the Swan and had him stuffed so that the healing factor couldn't resurrect him. Hayden later used the corpse as a surfboard. Shortly after, Deadpool became one of the villains sent to find the so-called Identity Disc possessed by AIM.Partnership with Cable  Deadpool partnered with his former enemy, Cable. The two were involved with a terrorist plot aimed at unleashing the shape-shifting \"Fa\u00e7ade Virus\" upon the world. After both were infected with the virus it was necessary to merge their DNA structure, so now Cable has some of Deadpool's DNA and vice versa. If they didn\u2019t do that, Deadpool would have become a goo and Cable\u2019s techno-organic arm would have taken him over completely. That meant that whenever Cable used his teleporter to \"bodyslide\", both he and Deadpool teleported together -- sometimes literally (a \"bodyslide by one\" resulted in them being badly integrated into a single body, forcing a messy separation, which, thanks to the DNA share with Wade, Cable was also able to recover from). As a result of the Fa\u00e7ade in his system, Deadpool's skin was temporarily cured of the hideous tumor-scarring. Once Cable shut down all infections of the virus worldwide however, Deadpool was returned to his usual self. The X-Men, including Cable's father Cyclops, then hired Deadpool to put together the pieces of a mini-teleporter that they could use to stop Cable, who had achieved the peak of his powers and was causing worldwide political ructions in attempting to unite the world's populace, without quite knowing what the device was. After Cable then delivered a stark message to the world's leaders - deliberately setting them all against him by threatening to throw all their missiles into the sun - Deadpool and the X-Men mounted an attack on Providence, whereupon Deadpool promptly turned on the X-Men, shooting Wolverine and Bishop to prevent them attacking Cable. Cable then confessed to Deadpool that he'd wanted him to kill him, to show the governments that they could achieve something by working together. Cable was then attacked by the Silver Surfer and burnt out his powers in the ensuing battle. Deadpool saved his life by removing the telepathic and telekinetic parts of his brain with the mini-teleporter. He then set about recovering some non-viral techno-organic matter to replace the damage to Cable\u2019s body, crossing swords with Agent X during seeking help from the Fixer. The aftermath of this, however, left Deadpool unemployable - whereupon Cable began to covertly hire him to run missions for him, without revealing that he was the one doing so. Shortly afterward, Deadpool rescued Cable again, teleporting through several alternate worlds to retrieve him. Cable returned the favor by repairing Deadpool's brain damage before his powers burnt out once more, though his personality and powers remained unchanged. After being hired to assist local resistance in Rumekistan against Flag Smasher, and fighting with Citizen V, Deadpool decided to try and get hired to be a SHIELD-licensed bounty hunter. His job would be to hunt down super-powered individuals to get them to register with SHIELD after the Superhuman Registration Act (HR421). He did this by trying to arrest the Great Lakes Champions, only to find they had registered that morning - after being trounced by Squirrel Girl. He was hired, then followed Cable to find where Captain America, whom was on the run from the Act, might be, finding him and the main-force of the Resistance in a warehouse. In the fight that followed, he was successful until Cable showed up. Cable bodyslid Deadpool to the White House, where he spoke to the President whilst Deadpool relieved himself. Upon his return, the President ordered Deadpool to capture Cable. This failed due to Cable\u2019s technology. Whilst trying to fix his somewhat shattered reputation, he kidnapped Taskmaster and forced him to try and win a fight - whilst his own hands and feet were tied. This was to convince four Government higher-ups (also kidnapped) to hire him, after the recent set-back against Cable. Once Deadpool had indeed won the fight, he was informed that they knew how good he is, but he is too immature. After hearing this, Deadpool was dusting Taskmaster off and thanking him for losing on purpose. Taskmaster revealed that he hadn't let Deadpool win, he was just that good that he could win with his hands and feet tied. Taskmaster was then beaten further by Deadpool. Days after this, Deadpool awoke in what he thought was a very large hospital room. He had in fact been shrunk with Pym Particles, to a size where one piece of popcorn made an entire meal. Weasel later revealed that he had obtained the Pym particles and set up Deadpool so that he would take on the Rhino. Which he did. Rhino burst into the room where Deadpool was and proceeded to make him into a key-chain and take him to the Three Strikes Bar, filled with Z-list badguys. After several humiliating events, including being flushed in a toilet, Deadpool managed to beat up each and every one of them, including Rhino - whilst still only a few inches high. Deadpool was approached by Agency X to find and rescue Agent X, who had been captured by Hydra. His payment being \"Four reasons\" on the chests of Sandi and Outlaw. Deadpool and Weasel went to Afghanistan and located the Hydra base, which Deadpool (being less than a foot tall) easily entered. He used Bob, Agent Of Hydra, to locate and free Agent X (who had been turned into a 500 pound slob by Hydra's Morphogenetic Actuator), being changed back to normal size in the process (\"They had Pym Particles. Who doesn't?\"). On the Hydra plane back to the USA, Agent X asked Deadpool to take over the running of Agency X whilst he got back in shape after the effects of a Hydra device caused him to gain lots of weight. Deadpool readily agreed. After returning to Agency X, Deadpool and Agent X found that Outlaw and Sandi had been taken hostage by T-Ray. At the Three Strikes Bar, Deadpool gathered information - using violence towards alcohol - to find out where T-Ray was. At Hillsborough (New Jersey), Deadpool, Agent X and Bob Agent Of Hydra (Deadpool's semi-replacement for Weasel who was still in Afghanistan) went to save the girls. Deadpool's first choice of farm house was the wrong one. His second choice was spoilt when T-Ray happened to be stood behind where Deadpool landed after jumping the window - and hit him with a bat. When Deadpool awoke, T-Ray beat him, whilst talking about their last encounter where he 'revealed' that he was actually Wade Wilson. Deadpool managed to break free of his duct taped chair and proceeded to beat on T-Ray - and complaining about the accompanying sound effects. He told T-Ray that \"a good friend of mine, who's not any more\" helped fix his brain damage - and he now knew who he was. Then T-Ray started using his black magicks. In the ensuing fight, Deadpool was stabbed by T-Ray by a magic sword - a wound which his healing factor would take more time to fix. Being forced to choose to run away, at the expense of Sandi and Outlaw's lives, or stay and save them, possibly dying in the process. He chose to stab T-Ray in the head with a katana (\"forged by the same guy who made the one on Heroes\"). While Providence was being attacked by the space-faring entity Hecatomb, Deadpool took the Agency X jet, to help Cable (then part of the Rogue-led X-Men) against the alien. Though he arrived too late, he was in time to help Cable to fight against the Marauders. After a brief skirmish with Sabretooth where he used all of his ammunition taking apart the mutant while Irene Merryweather escaped the island. He then fought the Marauder Senyaka while Cable ran from Gambit and Sunfire, to destroy all of the future-records stored in Providence\u2019s computer systems. Cable had sent him to get the 'Back-up copy' of the data. Cable\u2019s final act was to send Deadpool back home with a \u201cBodyslide by one\u201d just as Deadpool realised that Cable would never trust him with something so important. In the past, this brought them both to the exact same place - Deadpool was the only one who arrived in his apartment. Deadpool went to Rumekistan to pay his final respects, and was asked by Cyclops to stop Wolverine from tearing through a Hydra base in Afghanistan. Knowing that Weasel was still there, he accepted the job from his \u2018fellow\u2019 X-Man and took Bob along with him. Finding Weasel before Wolverine (by a matter of minutes), Deadpool killed his fair share of Hydra shock troops. Weasel was now running this Hydra cell and strapped into a teleportation-capable suit, calling himself the \"Penetraitor\". When Wolverine turned up and decapitated Deadpool, Weasel distracted the mutant, trying to explain his plan. When that went without luck, more Hydra troops came out to attack Wolverine, dying in the process - but delaying Bob\u2019s reattachment of Deadpool\u2019s head. The only Hydra that were left, were strapped into suits similar to the Penetraitor\u2019s. They activated the suits, expecting to be able to attack Wolverine - but disappeared. The Penetraitor then had the chance to explain, telling Wolverine that the reason there was an \u2018I\u2019 in his name, was because he was going to turn against Hydra. The hope was to fit them all with teleport suits, and send them to Guantanamo Bay. With things in Afghanistan sorted, Deadpool returned to Rumekistan with Weasel and Bob to square things with Cyclops. After paying his final respects to a statue of Cable, Deadpool spoke to Weasel, asking if damage his Penetraitor suit sustained during evading Wolverine was dangerous. Just after Weasel explained that there were just a few stray chronitons, Deadpool and Bob disappeared in a flash of light. Appearing in Europe, circa World War II, Deadpool and Bob encountered Captain America and Bucky. They aided the two while having random time-skips, to find Arnim Zola. After defeating the scientist and his creations, another time-skip made Cap and Bucky forget who Bob and Deadpool were, then try to attack them. During all this, Weasel had gone to the Fantastic Four (then including Black Panther and his wife Storm) for help in returning his friend back to this time. The equipment he used aided them in pulling the time-displaced duo closer, but not far enough. Deadpool and Bob met the original FF and chatted about the predicament, shortly before nearly being lost in a time-fault. With the combined efforts of both teams of FF, they managed to be saved. Deadpool next went on several missions for Dr Strange, including stabbing a lot of mystical creatures with his katana. He later found out that the reason for this was because he needed to seal the mystical hole he created in T-Ray's head by stabbing him and killing him. This was done successfully, but Deadpool wasn't happy to hear that next he had to find T-Ray's soul and bring him back to life. To do this, he was sent on a vision quest by Brother Voodoo, where he fought T-Ray. After a long battle, T-Ray was eventually returned to life, with both realizing they needed each other to complement the other. Upon returning to Agency X headquarters, Irene Merryweather came asking for aid in locating a energy generator for Rumekistan which was based in the Savage Lands. When arriving, the team encountered a mind controlled Kazar, and had to fight the forces of Brain Child. During the conflict, Deadpool accidentally used Weasel's Penitraitor technology to warp some dinosaurs to the Latverian embassy in New York. The result was upon defeating Brain Child they had to return and help the Avenger's fight dinosaurs infected with the symbiotes they had just defeated. After a long battle, Deadpool saved the day by absorbing the consciousness of the symbiotes and killing himself (albeit briefly). Despite being hailed as something of a hero after the stunt with the symbiotes, Deadpool slipped easily back into his old ways when paid to kill Wolverine. Quite possibly still being sore that the X-Man decapitated him recently, Wade agreed and set about setting things up. For once, he planned every stage of the attack. First he shot, maimed and blew up Logan, then used an AIM device to attach to a passing subway car and drag him down the street at high speed. Wade used this time to get changed and pick up some gear. When Logan got free, he was in a feral rage, something Wade had been counting on. What he wasn\u2019t counting on was Logan to be feral-smart, cutting off the merc\u2019s fingers seconds before he attempted to fire his gun. During the fight, a woman screamed for help next to a burning car, a baby in child-seat about to be engulfed in flames. Wolverine went to help, tearing the door open which resulted in a backdraft. Logan recovered in time for the doll baby to state it had made stinky before the timer hidden inside it reached zero. Deadpool congratulated the woman on her convincing screaming, giving her something extra over her agreed \u2018fee\u2019 to \u201cget some headshots done.\u201d He said it was the most amongst the most convincing screams he had ever heard, and he had heard a lot. When congratulating her on the look of mortal fear that was on her face, he realized Wolverine had partly recovered and was about to attack. Logan managed to get three claws into Deadpool\u2019s chest, getting a dagger in return. The mutant then shoved the other three claws into the other side of the merc\u2019s chest, Deadpool still having enough strength to lift his gun to under Wolverines chin and fire with his newly regrown finger. The two slumped against each other, neither standing nor falling. Deadpool's healing factor proved to be faster in repairing the damage, as Wolverine found out when he awoke in a warehouse rented by Wade. He had tied Wolverine up to a mechanism above a full swimming pool, with the intention of pulling a handle and letting his adamantium skeleton keep him under water to drown. After a little banter, Deadpool went to pull the lever, getting his hand cut off before he could do so. He was surprised to see Daken stood there, but had little time to react other than telling him that 1985 wanted it's hair back, before Daken pulled the lever himself, plunging Wolverine underwater. This angered Deadpool who then attacked Daken, whom revealed he had the uncanny ability to be exactly where an opponent wasn't expecting him to be. Upon his other hand being cut off, he realized the resemblance between Daken and Wolverine, the former revealing he was in fact Wolverine's son. During the fight, three grenades were plunged into the water and the resulting explosion flung Wolverine out of the water. Deadpool took a slice across his midsection and nearly lost consciousness as Wolverine told Daken that what was coming wouldn't hurt - just before Daken was shot in the head with a carbonadium bullet. Wolverine revealed that the sniper was Bucky Barnes, who was also the one who hired Deadpool whilst wearing a SHIELD uniform - and there was no money coming. The only way to track Daken down was for someone to try and kill Wolverine, which Deadpool may very well have done if his son hadn't interfered. Despite being told that this was the end to it, Deadpool's thoughts were plotting revenge even as his healing factor worked.Secret Invasion  Deadpool's activities next came to light when the Skrul invasion began. He posed as the Atlanta Braves mascot, which read as a heavily armed, non-human anomaly by the Skrull ship. Who promptly blasted it. The suit was filled with para-aramid pellets that acted as heat absorption to take most of the blast's heat. He then proceeded the close the Skrull ship inside the stadium and attack them head-on when they came to investigate the suit. He hallucinated that five of the Skrull's were actually eager to get his autograph, whereas they had no idea who he was and only wanted to kill him. Two voices in his head (via caption boxes of yellow and white) argued that Deadpool himself came up with the plan, not them, thereby inferring that he has three slightly different personalities. The Skrull commander razed the combatants, Skrull and Deadpool alike, with the ship-borne weapons. Upon inspecting the mascot costume, they found it empty. They deployed their Super-Skrull (not Kl'rt, The Super Skrull), who had a mix of Iceman, Human Torch and Black Bolt's powers with Iron Man armour, to find Deadpool. Deadpool was on top of the ship, where he lowered two boxes of TNT into the cooling turbines of the Skrull ship and blew it up. He floated to the ground using a parachute, where he took in the sight of dead Skrulls, counting up their point worth with his \"Pool-O-Vision\u2122\". He approached the Commander with a proposition, apparently part of his original plan. He told the Skrull he was reporting for duty. Deadpool was escorted aboard the vessel and put before a Skrull committee. They listened to him tell his origin story before asking him to repeat, but this time speaking into the Universal Translator. Which gases him as soon as he begins his rehearsed speech, ready for transport to the Skrull's Sci-Ops division in Cheyenne Mountain, former base of NORAD. After being examined, the science chief decided Deadpool was suitable to have his DNA bound with the next generation of Super Skrull. He was given the go-ahead and Deadpool was strung up to await execution. A day later, the science chief ordered his death - but was told to wait by Deadpool himself. He claimed the new Skrulls would certainly be able to heal like him, but without being trained by him, they would not be as effective at getting things done. He offered his hand to shake to seal the deal to help each other - much to the surprise of the geneticist. After saying he'd gotten free thanks to an ancient Chinese secret, they shook hands. And Deadpool laughed, worrying the Skrull - but excusing himself and saying to get to work. The first thing he chose to do was use the Next Gen 'Deadpool-Skrulls' to fight five to one odds against the current batches of Super Skrulls. His Skrulls won, much to the anger of the science chief. Deadpool explained that the only way to beat the Earth's heroes was using his method: Madness. He then proceeded to carry on teaching the Next Gens how to do things his way, ending with them all telling a 'Knock knock' joke that has a headshot as a punchline. The science chief gives the order to send in a Purge Unit to dispose of the Next Gen's. Whilst the two sets of Skrulls battle, Deadpool had made himself scarce. The Super Skrull from the stadium finds him communicating with Nick Fury, and hallucinating again. When Deadpool came out of it, he admitted that he was a traitor, though only to the Skrulls - not to Earth or America. Then ran. On the way to come up with a plan, he argued with the voices in his head before he finally got an idea. He got into the sewer system and managed to anger the Super Skrull enough to get caught in the flow from a burst water pipe. When the science chief caught up with Deadpool, he had the Next Gens under control and ordered them to attack Deadpool. Deadpool was happy to inform the Skrull about his healing factor being engineered specifically to him, taking his cancer into account. So the Next Gens bodies would continue to manufacture replacement cells, despite not continually losing any, until \"Splorch\". He then beat the geneticist to death and went back to the communication console. He apologized for taking so long and proceeded to go through with Fury's plan and upload Skrull bio data to him. He tapped in the key sequence and the data transmitted - being intercepted by Norman Osborn. Deadpool, finding himself unemployed and unpaid for his past two jobs, got fed up after building a semtex chair. He decided to seek out the one person he reckoned could give him paying employment. He called up an old 'friend' Colonel Zeke, and was told there was something he could do. Go to Eastern Europe and kill Doctor Druek Lovosno, who turned Zeke's wife into a zombie. Further information led Deadpool to the right town, where the doctor was making people young and beautiful for a high price. This meant them eating human flesh. Deadpool was to find the wife and kill the doctor. Upon reaching the footpath to the castle, he was met with a humpback, who gave him a questionaire to fill out, seeming to believe Deadpool wished to be a patient of the doctor. He also gave Deadpool a bottle of water whilst he did so. Two hours later, Deadpool finished and had a drink. He then actually looked at the label and saw it was in fact poison. He awoke in what he thought was a BDSM session, mostly nude and shackled in place with Zeke's wife stood holding his pants. After trying to explain that Zeke had sold him down the river, as a renewable food-source for the zombie's, the doctor came in and did it. The zombie nurses began to eat him, only to find it disgusting - tasting artificial and foul. Instead of opting for incineration, Deadpool managed to broker a deal with Lovosno to get a large supply of food for the zombies. He got released and contacts Zeke, who comes to pick up his wife - with over thirty mercenary's accompanying him. Upon revealing that he didn't intend to pay, Lovosno and his zombies attack. Just as they are tearing each other apart, Deadpool left. Upon exiting the gates, he pressed the detonator for his former semtex-chair, which he had distributed around the castle.Dark Reign  After the third unpaid job in a row, Deadpool had to steal passage on a freighter bound for America. He didn't dock, however, Tiger Shark tearing through the hull. He awoke on a beach in Mexico, badly hurt, missing an arm and with his costume in tatters. He spent the next twenty-four hours in a homeless shelter, which he exited hoping to find and kill Tiger Shark. Tiger Shark however had just found Deadpool, and tried to kill him with an oversized machete.  Deadpool ducked back into the shelter with the intention of still killing Tiger Shark, but doing so to impress the shelter's nurse. He was unsucessful, only drawing police attention. He was then shot dead by the police when Tiger Shark ran. He awoke later to find himself on a pier in a body bag, unlike every other time he had unzipped his own body bag - in a morgue. Tiger Shark leapt out of the water and tried to slice off Deadpool's head again, only to be shot at by a man shouting \"Hail Hydra!\" Bob claimed he was saving Deadpool, only to be hit into the water. Deadpool followed, only to go after the rifle Bob was holding. Bob resurfaced after Deadpool had, and was waiting for Tiger shark to surface for air. The two left to sleep in a motel. When Bob woke Deadpool, they discussed strategy whilst Wade ate at least half a dozen tacos. Needing drink, he went to leave the room only to hear Bob cock his rifle. He turned to be told that, so long as he promised to promise not to kill him, Bob would let Deadpool live. Deadpool revealed that he knew all along that Bob was sent to kill him, and that he had removed the bullets from the gun - and Tiger Shark was heading down the hallway towards them. He then went into the bathroom, wanting to get the drop on Tiger Shark. Which worked for all of a few seconds, as soon as Deadpool had Tiger Shark dead to rights, Bob distracted his friend accidentally. After a struggle, Deadpool shot Tiger Shark through the motel window, then demanded Bob tell him the identity of the man who sent Tiger Shark and Bob after him. Bob revealed it was Norman Osborn. When asked who on Earth that was, Bob turned on a television to show the savior of mankind from the Skrull's Secret Invasion. Deadpool traveled back to New York and attempted to break into the Avengers tower, only to fall into a trap set up by Osborn, in which Deadpool \"accidentally\" got his hands on a teleporter, giving Osborn's Thunderbolts the location of his base. There he contacted Taskmaster and convinced him, with money, to help with a scheme. Whilst Taskmaster was on his way, Wade managed to disable all of the Thunderbolts, bar Black Widow - whom he asked if she had a boyfriend at gun point. Faking an interest, Black Widow closed the gap and kneed him in the groin, an act that only injured herself. Wade had a gun in his pocket - plus was happy to see her. Much to his surprise, that joke made the Russian femme smile. Their meeting was interrupted by Paladin firing at Wade. He teleported to Taskmaster's 'Unoccupied office building' where he regrouped and got the bullets out of his body whilst talking about how much he adores Black Widow. There, he concocted a new plan which involved there being two Deadpool's. Deadpool hired a single-propeller plane and flew it over New York trailing a banner saying \"BW <3's DP? Call 212-555-4685\". Black Widow did so upon seeing it, tracking the location of the call connection. It was picked up by Taskmaster, who claimed the line was bad and hung up, having gotten the location of the Thunderbolt's HQ. As the Thunderbolts left in an Oscorp van to go to attack Taskmaster's position, Deadpool fired upon them whilst chatting to Black Widow, whom he had called back. He kept trying to flirt with her whilst firing from the plane, but dropped the phone before crashing into the bay. He teleported to Taskmaster before he got too wet, getting his phone before calling Black Widow back. He then teleported to her and she tried to kill him, in the process getting kissed by the merc, done because he claimed he loves her. When the Thunderbolts reported that they were returning to her, Deadpool teleported again to Taskmaster, wanting someone to stall the group whilst he spent time with Black Widow. After losing Rock-Scissors-Paper, Deadpool was left taking care of the Thunderbolts whilst Taskmaster went after Black Widow. When Deadpool ran, Taskmaster convinced Black Widow to get into the Thunderstrike jet, he was sealed inside and gassed. By the time Deadpool got back to Taskmaster, Headsman was about to cut his head off. Deadpool shot the chains holding Taskmaster, allowing his double to join the fight. Deadpool went after Osborn, who had attended the decapitation and was running away in a quinjet. As he was contacting his aide, Deadpool came up behind him and told Osborn that he owed him. Osborn leapt at Deadpool, getting shot in the process, and beat his head against the floor. The quinjet crashed due to Osborns negligence, giving Deadpool a chance. He wasn't able to take it, Black Widow then shooting him through the heart. Deadpool took the chance to begin singing. Headsman stopped that by cutting off Deadpool's head. Later, Deadpool was paying Taskmaster out of an ATM, having stolen Osborn's wallet. He thanked his friend to sewing his head back on, to which Taskmaster claimed innocence. Deadpool happily announced that Black Widow must, in fact, love him back as she did it. Whilst Osborn was on a chat show, soon after, Deadpool teleported behind him holding a sign saying \"Respawn lol\" on, as Osborn thought the merc was dead. Deadpool was so desperate for money, that he was posting for jobs on Craigslist. One of which made him break into a gentleman's home and order a pizza. He was actually after the pizza boy, his employer wanting retribution for a childhood nickname he cruelly gave her. Deadpool shot the delivery boy then, as an act of kindness, let the home-owner tell the police he was robbed - by getting him to load all of his possessions into his car. When he was almost finished, Deadpool turned on the television to find a newscast about when he temporarily joined the Skrull army, denouncing the mercenary as a traitor to the human race. Seeing this as a besmirching his name, he went to find the man to get the car keys. He found him with an arrow buried in his chest. Deadpool spoke as if he thought it was suicide, but he was ready for an attack by Bullseye, now dressed as Hawkeye as part of Osborn's Avengers. At first Deadpool thought it was actually Hawkeye, but after a scuffle, he came away with the man's mask and bow, but lost his teleporter. Another brief scuffle ended in Deadpool receiving an arrow through the skull. Having thought that Deadpool is dead, Bullseye plannning on grinding up Wilson into hamburger meat, but underestemates the healing factor which heals Wade around the arrow, leading to another fight ending with a meat hook through Bullseye's chest; severely injuring Bullseye . Deadpool raced toward the mutant haven Utopia.Strengths & Weaknesses Powers  Regenerative Healing Factor: Deadpool possesses a superhuman healing factor derived from that of the mutant Wolverine that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. Deadpool is able to heal injuries such as slashes, puncture wounds, bullet wounds, and severe burns within moments. His healing factor is developed to the point that he can regrow missing limbs and organs. As Deadpool had cancer at the time of the gene therapy which endowed him with these abilities, it bound to the \"healing factor\" so that in a sense the cancer is his healing factor, which is why his skin is still horribly scarred. Unlike Wolverine\u2019s natural healing factor, Deadpool\u2019s is mentally driven to a partial extent.Abilities  Deadpool is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and is a master in multiple unarmed combat techniques. He has been shown fighting such amazingly skilled fighters as Wolverine and Taskmaster and even defeating them in hand to hand combat. This shows that Deadpool himself is among the most skilled fighters in the Marvel universe. He is a master of assassination techniques, is a master marksman, and is highly skilled with bladed weapons (frequently carrying two swords strapped to his back), and a number of other weapons. He is fluent in Japanese, German, Spanish, amongst other languages.Strength  Deapool possesses great, though not unnatural, physical strength.

Character infoboxTournament of Swath Wiki Juggernaut Track Record  When Worlds Collide tournament - Tag team with Ghost RiderHistory  Cain Marko was the son of Dr. Kurt Marko, an atomic researcher. Cain's parents separated and Cain was eventually sent to a boarding school. Kurt Marko's colleague, Dr. Brian Xavier, another atomic researcher, died in an accident, and Kurt Marko eventually married Xavier's widow Sharon for her great wealth. On marrying Sharon, Kurt Marko moved into her large Westchester County mansion, where he lived with her and her young son Charles. Cain, who had become a cruel and spiteful boy, came to live at the mansion as well. Cain immediately began bullying his new stepbrother Charles. But Cain was often secretly beaten by his abusive father. Charles' vast telepathic powers were beginning to develop, and on one occasion he found himself experiencing the anguished thoughts and emotions of Cain after Cain had been beaten by his father. The inexperienced young Charles could not control or end his contact with Cain's mind at this time. Somehow Cain sensed that Charles was reading his mind and had discovered his secret shame. Cain believed that Charles had invaded his thoughts deliberately, and from then on Cain regarded Charles as his enemy. Cain was abusive to his stepbrother at every opportunity. Getting into a disagreement with his father over money, Cain accidentally upset some explosive chemicals and caused a fire to engulf his father's home laboratory. Though Kurt Marko managed to rescue both Cain and Charles from the fire, he himself died of smoke inhalation. Sharon Xavier Marko had died sometime before, tormented by her loveless marriage to Marko. Cain Marko continued to live in the Xavier mansion, growing increasingly resentful of his stepbrother's scholastic and athletic achievements as well as his telepathic powers, which Xavier mastered as he grew older. What happened to Marko after he left home is unclear. However, it is known that he became a mercenary and was eventually imprisoned in a Third World jail when the revolutionary forces he was fighting for were defeated. In the jail he became friends with a fellow mercenary, Black Tom Cassidy, who used his mutant powers to help them escape. Later, Marko and Xavier found themselves serving together in the same U.S. military unit in Korea. Marko deserted under fire and Xavier went after him to bring him back. Xavier followed Marko into a cave that housed the lost secret temple of Cyttorak, a powerful mystical entity. Marko impulsively grabbed a glowing ruby from the lap of an idol and read the inscription (which mystically appeared to his mind to be in English): \"Whosoever touches this gem shall possess the power of the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. Henceforth, you who read these words shall become forevermore a human juggernaut.\" As Xavier watched, the gem's mystical power transformed Marko into a larger, superhuman being. Just then enemy high explosive bombardment caused a cave-in, and Marko was buried under several thousand tons of rock. Xavier survived and returned to his unit. Marko, now the Juggernaut, eventually dug himself free with his newfound power and made his way to America to use his power to kill Xavier. He was defeated by Xavier and his original team of X-Men with the help of the Human Torch. Over the years the Juggernaut has clashed with Xavier and both the original and new teams of X-Men repeatedly. He has also formed a successful criminal partnership with his old friend Black Tom Cassidy. Also in intervening years he had clashed several times with Spider-Man, The Hulk (as Merged Hulk and the Horseman War), Spider-Woman and the Avengers. The sentient psionic being known as Onslaught, actually an amalgamation of the psyches of Xavier and Magneto, would-be world conqueror and mutant Master of Magnetism, ripped the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak from Juggernaut's body and imprisoned him within. Inside the jewel, Cain learned he was an avatar for Cyttorak. As such, the otherworldly entity sought to assume control of Juggernaut's form. But Cain, through sheer force of will, destroyed the evil god and returned to Earth, stronger than ever, but unable to fully control his amplified abilities.  Cyttorak was merely one of a pantheon of eight gods, all with earthbound avatars. These Exemplars enlisted the Juggernaut's aid in constructing a machine that would enslave the human race. As the Exemplars tended to in their final preparations, Cain withdrew deep into himself, where he clashed with Cyttorak. Charles entered his stepbrother's mind to aid him in the battle, but the Exemplar known as Bedlam sensed his presence and expelled him. Still, Charles' short stay in Juggernaut's head had helped Cain regain control of his psyche. After defeating Cyttorak, Juggernaut destroyed the Exemplars' God Machine. He then turned his attention to the avatars themselves, defeating each in turn. Juggernaut again was cast as a hero when the sentient spaceship Prosh escaped the confines of a Celestial prison, returned to Earth and dispatched a group of disparate beings on a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Besides Cain, Prosh's task force included Phoenix and Iceman, members of the X-Men; and Mystique and Toad, mutant terrorists. Their mission: Save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. Juggernaut was shown that for all his physical strength, he long has lacked strength of character. Despite all his yearning for power, he has squandered his supernaturally enhanced abilities. When Prosh reassembled the members of his team in the present, they fought and defeated the enigmatic alien entity known as the Stranger, who sought to control the natural evolution of humans and mutants. If not acquiring a newfound respect for life and human dignity, at least Juggernaut gained a better sense of understanding for the mutant plight.  As the result of an undisclosed battle with Cyttorak, his patron deity, Cain lost most of the power of the Juggernaut. Thereafter, Cain reconciled with Xavier and joined the X-Men. In an unusual turn for someone of Cain's personality he immediately befriended several people at the mansion including a young mutant boy named Sammy Pare, a.k.a. Squidboy, who had a positive influence on him. Cain later allowed himself to be taken into custody and then had a one-night stand with She-Hulk, who as Jennifer Walters was representing him in his trial for all the crimes he had committed as a criminal. It would turn out later that it was, in fact, an \u2018Earth One\u2019 alternate of Ms Walters. Amazingly, Cain was exonerated of all his crimes and allowed to go free despite having numerous outstanding felonies both at home and abroad. Later, Black Tom Cassidy resurfaced and Juggernaut joined his new Brotherhood of Mutants, with the intention of betraying the group and warning the X-Men when he had the chance. Squidboy stumbled upon the Brotherhood having a meeting, and thinking that Juggernaut had betrayed the X-Men he became angry and started yelling. Annoyed, Black Tom killed the boy. Furious with rage, Juggernaut tried to kill his former friend. When the Brotherhood were sucked into a black hole by the second Xorn, Juggernaut accompanied them to make sure Nocturne (another mole) would be safe if everyone survived and to make sure the Brotherhood didn't try to attack the mansion again. He ended up in Mojoworld and became the property of Mojo along with Nocturne. To escape, Nocturne took control of Mojo's henchwoman, Spiral, and opened a portal to the X-Men's Danger Room, where they were reunited with the team. This, however, was a trap set by Spiral, who was in more control of her body than thought, leaving a portal open to allow Mojo to cross over as well. Mojo turned the X-Men into X-Babies, but they managed to overpower his forces anyway. Juggernaut still felt extremely guilty about Squidboy's death, and how the boy's last words were that he hated him. He wondered if he should remain a child, this being his chance to start over with a clean slate, but Storm comforted him and convinced him not to. The X-Men were re-aged, and Juggernaut remained with the team. In the wake of House of M, in which the majority of the mutant population has lost their powers, Juggernaut joined the new Excalibur grouping in London. More recently, Cain was among the various teams of X-Men attempting to protect Professor Xavier from the wrath of the Incredible Hulk. Though Cain had recently come into possession of the gem of Cyttorak, he was still unable to call forth his full power during his first battle with the Hulk and was quickly defeated. Cyttorak himself appeared before Cain and explained that Cain himself was the cause of his own weakness. Cyttorak intended for Cain to use the powers granted to him to fulfill his own selfish desires and needs and not for heroic purposes. Cain finally accepted his role as Cyttorak's avatar to it's fullest extent and regained his full power. He challenged the Hulk once more and the Hulk was unable to defeat him once again. As Cain continued to push the Hulk back, the Hulk used his cunning to use Cain's own momentum and near-unstoppable movement against him, which briefly removed him from the field of battle long enough for the Hulk to escape. Shortly afterward, Cain refused all of Xavier's attemps to thank him. Before leaving, he gave Xavier a warning not to send anyone to try to find him.Strengths & Weaknesses Powers  Juggernaut possesses overwhelming physical power granted to him by Cytorrak. The Crimson Ruby of Cyttorak has bonded to his soul and altered his being, giving him powers exceeding most of 'Homo Superior', though the ruby is still the root of his power, not genetic evolution. Superhuman Strength: The Juggernaut possesses vast superhuman strength which limits are unknown. He was able to go toe to toe against an enraged World War Hulk until the moment Cain was outsmarted by him . He is one of the strongest beings to ever walk the planet. His strength possibly equals Thor's strength. Superhuman Stamina: The mystical energies of Cyttorak that empower his musculature generates no fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him limitless superhuman stamina in all physical activities. Superhuman Durability: Cain is virtually impregnable to any and all forms of conventional physical injury regardless of magnitude or intensity.. Although Cain is able to be harmed by exceedingly high levels of mental or mystical attacks, these attacks have rarely been shown to cause any permanent damage. Regenerative Healing Factor: Despite his extreme resistance to physical damage, Cain can be damaged by sufficiently powerful forces such as mystical forces. If damaged, Cain possesses an accelerated healing factor that enables him to nearly instantly regenerate any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues.\n For instance, he has been injured by Shatterstar's sword, which is forged from a mixture of extra dimensional technology and magic and healed instantly. The demon being D'Spayre once flayed the Juggernaut down to a skeleton only after absorbing almost all of the Juggernaut's power and even then, the Juggernaut could not be stopped and was able to instantly regenerate all the damage done once he regained his full power. The only other time the Juggernaut has been physically injured is by the likes of Thor in a physical battle, and that was only after Thor used Mjolnir to negate his mystical enchantment. Immortality: Cain is functionally immortal. His aging process is completely halted and he is immune to the effects of all toxins, poisons and diseases. He is also sustained by the mystical energies flowing through his body and has no need to eat, drink or breathe. Force Field: The Juggernaut is capable of generating a personal force field around himself, extending to about 1 foot in diameter. He uses this force field to heighten his already impressive resistance to injury. In his earliest appearances, he is able to use this force generating ability to hurl people and objects near him away from him, but though now it seems to only function defensively. Rampant Charge: Once he begins to advance in a certain direction, it is virtually impossible to halt his movement. Some obstacles such as many tons of rocks and plasma-discharge cannons have slowed his pace but can't stop him. The only known examples of him being stopped involve physical force with mystical involvement which are Juggernaut's weakness. Thor unleashing his power was able to stop him in his tracks but his powers are mystical in origin (It should be noted that Thor was severely hampered at the time as he was extremely weakened because of an extradimensional malady.) and during a battle with War (Hulk), in which the mutant Apocalypse, increased the Hulk's strength and power enormously by grafting Celestial tech to him, which again involved mysticism.Abilities  Juggernaut is able to summon and remove his mystic armor at will. As a result of his days in the military and his experience as a superhuman criminal and hero, the Juggernaut is a formidable hand to hand combatant preferring to use street fighting and brawling techniques that allow him to make full use of his great strength.Strength  Class 100+\u00a0; The Juggernaut possesses vast physical strength which exact limit is unknown but he is able to lift far in excess of 100 tons effortlessly. He is one of the strongest beings to ever walk the Earth.Weaknesses  Cain is susceptable to exceedingly high levels of mental and mystical attack. Both have been shown to be able to at least temporarily defeat him but neither have been shown to cause any type of permanent injury.Equipment  The Juggernaut wears a helmet fashioned from an unknown mystical metal found in the Crimson Cosmos dimension of Cyttorak. The Juggernaut subsequently fashioned a skullcap from scraps of the metal used to construct the helmet. This skullcap provides him with an complete protecion from telepathic attack, even from the likes of Professor Xavier. The Juggernaut originally wore a suit of armor that he could summon around himself at will from the Crimson Cosmos. After being stripped of his powers, the Juggernaut took to wearing a suit of armor that resembled his original but was fashioned from unstable molecules. However, now that he has access to his full powers once more, he is able to summon forth his mystical helmet and armor.Tournament of Swath Wiki Sephiroth Tournament of Swath Wiki Dr. Stephen Strange Tournament of Swath Wiki Character infobox Tournament of Swath Wiki Test Page Tournament of Swath Wiki Sephiroth/doc Tournament of Swath Wiki Tournament of Tournaments  The Tournament of Swath is the creation of both RyantheGr8 and \"Mr.\" Crowley that puts heroes, villians, and starships up for battle in tournaments that have been going live on the SWATH radio show, and the Dorkside Gaming/Clan 31 forums. They have included many of the characters from movies, comics, and TV shows.Tournament of Swath Wiki JuggernautSheHulk.jpg Tournament of Swath Wiki Loki Track Record  When Worlds Collide tournament - Tag team with DeadpoolHistory Early Years  Loki himself was not a member of the Asgardians, but was actually the son of Laufey, the deceased monarch of the Frost Giants, the ancient enemies of the Asgardians. Odin himself led the Asgardians into battle against the Frost Giants and killed Laufey in personal combat. After slaying Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants. The child was Loki, and Laufey had kept him hidden from his people due to his shame over his son's small size. Odin took the boy, out of a combination of pity and because he was the son of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat, and raised him as his son alongside his biological son Thor.Resentment  Throughout their childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences in which he and Thor were treated by the citizens of Asgard. The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things and Loki was clearly inferior to his foster brother Thor in these areas. However, Loki's gifts lay in other areas, most notably sorcery. Loki possessed a natural affinity to command great magical forces and hoped to somehow use these powers to become the most powerful god in all of Asgard and to destroy Thor. As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would manifest itself and earned himself a nickname as the God of Mischief. However, instead of playing harmless pranks, his deeds grew steadily more malicious and his lust for both power and revenge was apparent to all those around him. In time, his nickname grew from being a playful and mischievous trickster god to the \"God of Evil\". Over the centuries, Loki would try to seize Asgard and to destroy Thor on many occasions. Odin, who had long tolerated Loki's attempts, magically imprisoned Loki within a tree. Loki would eventually free himself from his prison and his thirst for power and vengeance became even more consuming than it had ever been, if that were even possible. Loki and Thor would clash more and more times, sometimes with Loki confronting Thor directly and sometimes using various pawns in order to achieve his ends. Among Loki's more well known henchmen was the human criminal Carl \"The Crusher\" Creel, whom Loki would use his sorcery to transform into the superhuman criminal known as The Absorbing Man, who himself would prove to be a formidable adversary to Thor over the years. Loki would even go so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, all of which failed. Loki's schemes would eventually come to include Earth itself and these schemes would often draw some of Earth's superhuman heroes to defend Earth and, often, Asgard itself. Loki was able to manipulate the Hulk into wreaking havoc and, accidentally, would lead to the formation of the Avengers. To make matters worse, Thor would be one of the founding members of the superhuman team and often found himself undone by them, many times, even when it seemed that his goals were within his grasp. However, despite Loki's loathing for Thor and Odin, Loki would help to defend Asgard from destruction from Surtur and his fire demons. However, this was only because Surtur's goal was to destroy Asgard and Loki sought only to rule it.Ragnarok  It has been prophesied that Loki will lead Asgard's enemies into the \"Eternal Realm\" and aid them in destroying it in a final conflict known as Ragnarok, or sometimes referred to as \"The Twilight of the Gods\". Loki fulfilled the prophecy of leading the enemies of Asgard against the Asgardians. This battle consumed all who participated in it and it was revealed that the cycle of the birth, lives, and death of the Asgardians was a continuing cycle presided over by beings known only as \"Those Who Sit Above\". Thor, was able to put an end to this continuing cycle. All Asgardians perished in this last Ragnarok except for Thor who would disappear into a deep sleep. But this time \"Those Who Sit Above\" followed them in death and were unable to revive them. Whether the Asgardians will receive a reincarnation after this final battle is uncertain.As a Woman  After Thor returned, he started a quest to find the other Asgardians. After finding Heimdall and the Warriors Three he steeped up the search. Heimdall guided him to the southwest where dozens of humans were being jailed by the Destroyer. Loki had collected all of his former Asgardian allies, and Thor fell for the trap, restoring them all to their full power. Loki himself had been reborn as a female. She claimed to have no more plans now that Ragnarok was over. Time would tell if her schemes to rule had been truly set aside. Having told Balder that she would never lie again, Loki proceeded to win the Asgardians' trust by revealing that he, like Thor, was a son of Odin. Balder didn't believe, but once he was told it was true by Thor himself, he had come to think of Loki as a trustworthy confidant. During the Skrull invasion, he managed to goad a mob of Asgardians into thinking that Beta Ray Bill was a Skrull impostor.Dark Reign  Loki joined Norman Osborn's dark Illuminati. He traveled to the past was to ensure Bor, father of Odin and first king of Asgard, perished in battle against the Frost Giants. In the present day Loki revived Bor in New York City, but placed a spell on him to mistake everything around him as an enemy, therefore attacking everything in sight. Further aggrieved by the belief his son's failure to resurrect him could only mean he was killed in battle, when Thor arrives on the scene, Loki's enchantment caused Bor to see Thor as a monster. Sensing Odin's power inside what he saw as a demon, Bor attacked Thor, attempting to avenge his son. While Thor and Bor fought Loki made Balder aware of Bor's identity and the two rushed to New York to stop Thor from killing him (Thor never met Bor until now and is unaware of his identity). They arrived too late, as Thor was forced to kill Bor for fear of the entire planet being destroyed in the wake of their battle. In the aftermath of the battle, Loki reminded Balder the resurrected Bor was technically the king of Asgard when Thor killed him and the punishment for killing the king was banishment from Asgard, Balder was forced to agree. After Thor's banishment, Loki mentioned to some disgruntled Asgardians he made arrangements to have all Asgardians, but not Asgard itself, moved to Latveria at the invitation of Doctor Doom. Loki attended a dinner hosted by Doctor Doom along with Balder to secure a new home for the Asgardians in Latveria. She was caught off guard by Balder's insistence that since they were leaving Asgard, Thor should have been allowed to rejoin them. Loki was able to calm Balder before he offended Doom too much. She later appeared before Blake and Thor to tell them that she would be returning to her male form shortly and that he had \"just now\" come to the realization that his body was meant for Sif. Loki explained that, after Ragnarok, when the Asgardians were being placed into human hosts Sif's soul was placed into a dying human. When Thor sent out the call for the Asgardians to return, Sif's host was too weak to hear the call. When Thor mass-summoned the Asgardians, Sif's body was created but her soul could not be placed into it, so the body went looking for a soul with no body and found Loki. Loki claimed the transfer from his female form to his male form would probably kill Sif's host and she urged Blake and Thor to find Sif and say goodbye. Following the Hood's depowerment at the hands of Doctor Strange, Brother Voodoo, and the Son of Satan, Loki offers the Hood a second chance.[3] She presents to him the Nord Stones, a bunch of Asgardian artefacts she previously used, to grant him back his powers.Mighty Avengers  Loki took on the form of the Scarlet Witch in her astral form and recruited a team of Avengers to face the Elder God Chthon.[4] The Avengers, unaware of Loki's trick, followed this false \"Wanda's\" instructions.[5] Her goal in using these Avengers was to throw Norman Osborn off balance. Loki intended to put \"cracks in Osborn's armor\" and gradually \"widen\" these cracks through the Mighty Avengers. Pietro Maximoff, though desiring to see and converse with his sister, joined the Mighty Avengers after he raced around the world searching for her.[6] However, Loki began to see that Pietro and Cassie were becoming a problem in her plans, as they genuinely believed her to be Wanda; for the latter, was for revenge for the death of her father. She dealt with the former by cutting off communications while Pietro and U.S. Agent were in Tibet, hoping that he would die due to the main emergency he was calling about. Cassie caught her in the act and attempted to warn the others but Loki casted a spell that prevented her from saying bad things about \"Wanda\". Then, she appeared before Henry Pym, calling himself the Wasp, to convince him to expel Cassie from the team; Pym was a about giving second chances ever since their escapee with the Fantastic Four. Loki soon had enough of Cassie when she tricks the Young Avengers into summoning the \"Scarlet Witch\" to the Infinite Avengers Mansion, using Wiccan's magic, which caused Loki's disguise to appear. However, Clint Barton also done a sneak attack and by killing Loki, he could tell that she was not Wanda. Wiccan then chanted a spell to reveal Loki's deception, forcing her to erect wards to prevent they from summoning her again, thus canceling out the spell on Cassie.Strengths & Weaknesses Powers  Despite being a member of the Frost Giants, Loki possesses similar attributes to those possessed by the Asgardians. Superhuman Strength: Loki possesses superhuman strength that is substantially superior to that of an average Asgardian female or male. In fact, Loki is currently stronger now than he was while male. At his peak,he possesses sufficient physical strength to lift up to 50 tons. It is possible, however, that she can further increase her strength through mystical enchantment on a temporary basis. While as a male Loki was still superhumanly strong as an average Asgardian male , he was strong enough to lift 30 tons , however his strength could be increased through mystical enchantment also. Superhuman Stamina: Loki's Frost Giant metabolism grants her superhuman levels of physical stamina in practically all activities. She can exert herself at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue begins to impair her. However, much like her physical strength and durability, Loki can temporarily augment her stamina through magical means. Superhumanly Dense Tissue: Like all Asgardians, Loki's bodily tissues have roughly 3 times the density of the same tissues in a human being. While she has the looks and physical proportions of a much smaller person, the increased density of her body actually makes her several hundred pounds heavier than she appears. This increased density also contributes to her superhuman strength to a limited degree. Superhuman Durability: The tissues of Loki's body are superhumanly durable and are roughly equal to those possessed by the average Asgardian female. However, at times, Loki had imbued herself with magical abilities that enable her to withstand injuries that would prove fatal to another Asgardian. She is able to withstand high caliber bullets, falls from great heights, powerful impact forces, exposure to temperature extremes and powerful energy blasts without being injured. Superhuman Longevity: Like all Asgardians, Loki ages at a far slower rate than humans. However, unlike some other god pantheons like the Olympians, who stop aging completely at a certain point, Loki isn't fully immune to aging. Although she has recently been \"reborn\", she still has her memories of her previous life. While she is several millenia old, at least, she has the appearance and vitality of a young Asgardian woman in her physical prime. Loki is immune to the effects of all known Earthly diseases and infections. Sorcery: Loki has the ability to generate and control a great quantity of mystical abilities for a variety of purposes. Her known abilities include the ability to fire powerful beams of concussive force, generate highly durable force fields, bestow superhuman attributes to living beings or inanimate objects, teleport across dimensions and augment her physical attributes temporarily. He can also bring inanimate objects to life, or mystically imbue objects or beings with specific but temporary powers . He has, for example, augmented the might of human criminals as the Cobra and Sandu. These magical effects remain only for as long as he maintains the spell that created them. Loki\u2019s power has been said by the Silver Surfer during their early encounters as sufficient to \u201cdecimate a planet,\u201d and according to Dormammu, Loki\u2019s magic nearly rivals that of his own. Regenerative Healing Factor: Like all Asgardians, Loki is still capable of being injured though, also like all Asgardians, her metabolism enables her to rapidly regenerate damaged tissue much faster and more extensively than a human being. However, through the use of her sorcery, Loki's ability to heal herself is far above that of other Asgardians. Her magical energies are so imbued into her body that she can reattach severed limbs and, while still a male, even reattached her own head at least once. Psionics: Loki has demonstrated powerful psionic capabilities, the full limits of which aren't known. She has demonstrated the ability to project her thoughts telepathically across great distances as well as potent hypnotic capabilities. She is able to communicate with beings telepathically, though her ability to do so is greater with beings that serve her. Shape-shifting: Like a number of gods or goddesses, Loki possesses highly developed shape-shifting capabilities. She is able to adopt almost any form imaginable whether it be animals, other humanoid beings, or even inanimate objects. The thought has been raised that her current form is merely a shape Loki has decided to remain in. Despite this well-known ability of Loki's, he has commented to himself, as he struggled to escape from Dormammu's mystic cage, that this is his \"most soul-draining\" power, apparently meaning it is more taxing than his other magical abilities. He has become such animals such as a snake, eagle, mouse and bee, gaining the basic natural abilities inherent in each form. While he can take on the likeness of another god, giant or human, he will not necessarily gain the special physical or mental powers of the being he imitates. Loki can also transform external objects into other forms and substances by magic; for instance, he has turned clouds into dragons.Abilities  Loki has a genius level intellect and possesses a great deal of knowledge of the mystic arts, gifted with mastery superior to that of a Sorcerer Supreme's. She is also extremely cunning and an expert battle strategist. She is also a formidable combatant in her own right, particularly as a swordsman or in the use of her various energy manipulative powers in combat situations.Weaknesses  While apparently possessing some extrasensory abilities that resemble psionic powers. Loki can not directly read the minds of other beings, nor can she control their actions. Her passionate hatred of Thor, lust for power, and her tendency to alienate herself through her ignoble actions greatly impedes her ability to bring his well laid plans to fruition. Loki's powers are believed to at least be slightly weaker on Midgard than on Asgard, as her birth was not of Gaea, and even Odin's magic was on the wane on Earth.Equipment  Loki occasionally employs certain mystical power objects, such as the Norn Stones or rare Asgardian herbs, to augment his own magical powers. These objects or substances are generally used to enhance his immediate personal strength or abilities, or to create a permanent mystical transformation, such as that which gave the Absorbing Man his power. He once used the mystical sword of Surtur along with various Asgardian equipment to transform Thor into a frog while Loki was in Asgard and Thor was on Earth. The destruction of the engine drawing power from the sword resulted in Thor regaining his true form.Weapons  Her magic sword, known in Norse mythology as Laevateinn, which means \"wounding wand\"Trivia Tournament of Swath Wiki Tournament of Tournaments 2 Tournament of Swath Wiki Testing Page Tournament of Swath Wiki Professor X Track Record  When Worlds Collide tournament - Won first round in tag team with Gladiator, beating Black Adam and MetamorphoHistory Early Years  Charles Xavier was the son of wealthy nuclear researcher Brian Xavier and his wife Sharon. After Brian Xavier's death in an accident, Sharon married his colleague Dr. Kurt Marko, whose son by a previous marriage, Cain, bullied the young Charles. Kurt favored the gentle, smart Charles to his own son. Charles' telepathic powers began emerging when he was still a boy, and as he grew older he learned to control them. With his powers he had discovered that Kurt cared only about his mother's money. Kurt quickly grew neglectful of Sharon, driving her to alcoholism, and abused both Sharon and Cain. Charles once used his telepathic powers to read Cain's mind and explore the extent of his psychological damage, which only led to Cain becoming more aggressive toward him and Charles feeling Cain's pain firsthand. Sharon died soon after, and a fight erupted between Cain and Charles that caused some of Kurt's lab equipment to explode. Mortally wounded, Kurt dragged the two children out before dying. A brilliant student intent on undertaking graduate studies, he entered England's Oxford University, where he met and fell in love with a young Scotswoman named Moira Kinross. Their passionate discussions on genetic mutation gave way to an equally passionate romance. It had also been hinted that Mister Sinister interfered with Moira's and Xavier's relationship as he was posing as a professor at Oxford at the time. Charles and Moira planned to be married, but after finishing his work at Oxford, Xavier was drafted and sent to Asia during the Korean War. There Xavier and his stepbrother Cain served in the same unit. Xavier witnessed how Marko found the mystical ruby in the temple of Cyttorak that transformed him into the superhuman Juggernaut. Xavier also served alongside Shadowcat's father Carmen Pryde on search and rescue missions. Deeply depressed when Moira broke off their engagement without explanation, Xavier began traveling abroad after leaving the army. (He later discovered that Moira married her old boyfriend Joseph MacTaggert, who abused her.) While in Cairo, Egypt he met the young pickpocket Ororo Munroe and battled Amahl Farouk, the Shadow King, the first evil mutant he had ever met. This meeting led to the visionary Xavier's decision to devote his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent mutants from human oppression. Xavier next went to Haifa, Israel to meet with the head of a clinic for traumatized Holocaust victims, where he fell in love with the catatonic Gabrielle Haller, whom he awoke, and became friends with a man calling himself Erik Magnus Lehnsherr, a volunteer. Magnus and he held lengthy debates hypothesizing what would happen if humanity was faced with a new super-powered race of humans. While Xavier was optimistic, Magnus' experiences in the Holocaust led him to believe that humanity would ultimately oppress the new race of humans as they had done with other minorities. The two friends revealed their powers to each other when they fought Nazi Baron Wolfgang von Strucker and his HYDRA agents, who kidnapped Gabrielle because she knew the location of their secret cache of gold. Magnus attempted to kill Strucker but Xavier stopped him. Realizing that his and Xavier's views on mutant-human relations were incompatible, Magnus left with the gold. Lehnsherr would years later become his greatest enemy and rival, Magneto. Charles stayed in Israel for some time, but Xavier and Haller were unaware when he left that she was pregnant with his son, who would become the autistic mutant known as Legion. They separated on good terms. In a strange town near the Himalayas, Xavier encountered an alien calling himself Lucifer, the advance scout for an invasion by his race, and foiled his plans. In retaliation, Lucifer dropped a huge stone block on Xavier, crippling his legs. Xavier was freed by Sage, who had heard his telepathic cries for help. Amelia Voght, a young American nurse, made cheering him up her pet project and helped him recover during his convalescence in Bombay, India, wherein the two fell in love. But she then left him as Scott Summers moved into the X-Mansion, believing the best solution to the \"mutant problem\" being for mutants to lay low. Charles tried to force her to stay with his mental powers, but immediately ashamed by this, let her go. He worked with fellow mutation expert Karl Lykos, as well as Moira MacTaggert again, who built a mutant research station on Muir Island. Apparently, Charles had gotten over Moira in his travels to the Greek island of Kirinos. Xavier renewed his friendship with Moira MacTaggert, who was now a renowned geneticist, and they began discussing the idea of founding a school for mutants. Xavier discussed his candidates for recruitment to his personal strike force, the X-Men, with Moira, including those he passed over, which were Kurt Wagner, Piotr Rasputin, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, and Ororo Munroe. Xavier's first student was the 11-year-old Jean Grey, who had been traumatized when she telepathically experienced the emotions of a dying friend. Over the years, Charles made a name for himself as geneticist and psychologist, renowned enough that the Greys were referred to him when no other expert could help their catatonic daughter, Jean. Xavier helped Jean recover and taught her to use her telekinetic powers. Xavier also trained Tessa to spy on Sebastian Shaw.X-Men  Xavier later met with Fred Duncan, an FBI agent investigating the growing number of mutants. Xavier told Duncan of his plan to locate young mutants and enroll them in his \"School for Gifted Youngsters\", using his ancestral mansion home as a base to train them to use their powers for humanity's benefit. The base included subterranean medical labs, a training facility called the \"Danger Room\", an aircraft hanger, and Xavier's mutant detection device code named \"Cerebro\". Over the following months Xavier assembled his original team of \"X-Men\": Cyclops, Iceman, Angel, Beast, and Jean Grey, who took the name Marvel Girl. Notable menaces included Magneto, now a mutant supremacist and terrorist, and anthropologist Bolivar Trask's mutant-hunting Sentinels. Years later, when most of his original students were captured by the mutant Krakoa, Xavier sent another team comprised of Moira's students, one of whom was Cyclops' long-lost brother Kid Vulcan to rescue them. After the team freed Cyclops and Kid Vulcan revealed their connection, the team was killed. Cyclops escaped, but when he made it back to Xavier, Xavier wiped the traumatizing knowledge that his newfound brother had died saving him from Cyclops' brain. He then assembled another new team of X-Men including Banshee, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, and Wolverine to rescue the others on Krakoa, and no one else knew anything about Moira's students. Lilandra, princess of the alien Shi'ar race and the woman he shared an intense psychic bond with across the vast distance that separated their two planets, came to Earth to implore Xavier for his help against her mad tyrannical brother D'Ken. He instantly aided her by deploying his X-Men. When Jean Grey returned from the Savage Land to tell him that all the X-Men were dead, he shut down the school and travelled with Lilandra to her kingdom, where she was crowned Empress. Xavier dreamt of her and Lilandra knew they were soul mates. Xavier and Lilandra fell in love, and for a time he lived on Chandilar, the Shi'ar throneworld, as her consort. He had no other choice but to challenge the Shi'ar Imperial Guard to a duel over the fate of the Phoenix, when she destroyed a Shi'ar world. Xavier emerged victorious with help, however the Phoenix committed suicide. Jean Grey was believed dead. After the apparent deaths of the second team of X-Men, Xavier, encouraged by MacTaggart, took on a new class of mutant students, whom he named the New Mutants. The alien race called the Brood had secretly implanted an egg within Xavier's body. MacTaggart and the X-Men's spacefaring allies, the Starjammers, saved Xavier by transferring his mind into a newly cloned, somewhat younger body in which he could once again walk; he felt like a \"whole man\". Charles met with former lover Gabrielle Haller on Muir Isle and discovered that he was her teenage son's father. The autistic boy, David, suffered from multiple personality disorder and had vast psionic powers like his father. After helping him and his team to escape from David's mind, Xavier promised he would always be there for him. In subsequent months, Xavier suffered physical injuries and psychic strains that left him on the brink of death due in part to a hate crime wrought by anti-mutant students at Columbia University, where Xavier was an adjunct professor, and an attack by the children of Baron von Strucker at Magneto's court trial. Lilandra and the Starjammers took him into outer space where they used Shi'ar technology to restore him to health. After an extended sojourn in space with the Starjammers, Xavier finally returned to Earth. Both the original and second teams of X-Men reassembled under his leadership, along with new recruits like Gambit and Jubilee. Xavier led the X-Men against the Shadow King, only to have his spine broken in battle, leaving him crippled and confined to a wheelchair once more. While holding a mutant rights speech, Xavier was nearly assassinated by Stryfe, being infected with a fatal techno-organic virus, but was saved by none other than Apocalypse. As a temporary side-effect he gained full use of his legs and devoted his precious time to the youngest recruit on his team, Jubilee. Since the X-Men were all now highly trained adults, Xavier renamed the school in his mansion The Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. He took control of a private school, The Massachusetts Academy, and made it the new School for Gifted Youngsters, where yet another new class of young mutants, Generation X, was taught.Onslaught  In a battle with Magneto, Xavier lost his temper over his old friend ripping the adamantium from Wolverine's body and used his mental powers to shut down Magneto's conscious mind. In the process Xavier's mind was inadvertently infected by the evil within Magneto's psyche. The result was that the dark sides of Magneto's and Xavier's minds combined and physically manifested themselves as the nearly invincible entity called Onslaught, who usurped Xavier's psionic powers. America's greatest super heroes narrowly defeated Onslaught, who appeared to perish. However, to ensure that Xavier never again spawned a being like Onslaught, Dr. Valerie Cooper of the United States government took him into custody. Although Xavier was willing to serve as a prisoner of the United States government, he was appalled when it turned him over to the custody of Bastion, head of the anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance. Xavier was eventually freed and found by Cerebro. He briefly led the Brotherhood during this time. He then left Earth to train a group of mutant Skrulls called Cadre K. When Mystique blew up Moira MacTaggert's laboratory complex, fatally wounding her, Charles went to the astral plane to meet with her and retrieve information on the cure to the Legacy Virus, but after gathering the information he did not want to leave her alone. If not for Jean pulling him back, the professor would have died with his first love, who stated she had no regrets. After the Legacy Virus was cured, Magneto assembled an army on Genosha. Xavier went to try and dissuade him, but it took an interim X-Men team to stop Magneto, who had crucified Xavier in Magda Square, and former lover and disenchanted Acolyte Amelia Voght to free him.Going Public  Xavier regathered his X-Men as a public team and created the X-Corp in light of the incidents with Cassandra Nova Xavier, his 'evil twin.' She had revealed his mutation to the world, something he needed to do but did not want to sully his reputation over. In the wake of Cassandra Nova's attack on the Shi'ar, Lilandra had gone insane and tried to assassinate Charles on a trip to the X-Corporation branch in Mumbai. Lilandra, believing that too much disaster had come from the Shi'ar's involvement with the X-Men, annuled her marriage to Xavier. Stepbrother Juggernaut defected to the X-Men once Xavier reached out to him while he had nowhere to go. Cain redeemed himself, and the brothers came to understand one another. Shortly thereafter, Kuan-Yin Xorn seemed to reveal himself as Magneto. However, Xavier was apparently aware that the real Magneto was still on Genosha. Traveling there, he tried to start a rebuilding effort with several other mutants. When Magneto brought the comatose Scarlet Witch, he also began to try to help her. Xavier briefly returned to help Cyclops's team with Danger, whom he revealed was a sentient entity kept in the Danger Room to help make it a unique and realistic training setting. After mutant Layla Miller restored the memories of some of the X-Men and Avengers, they headed to Genosha where they discovered that Magneto erected a memorial garden for Xavier commemorating his death. They were horrified until Cloak faded into the grave and discovered there was no body inside. After a battle, Scarlet Witch again used her powers to restore reality and, as a slight against her father, caused 91.4 percent of mutants to lose their powers, leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction. With reality restored, Xavier was still missing and the X-Men were unable to detect him with Cerebro.Deadly Genesis  The truth about Xavier sending Moira's students to Krakoa all those years ago was finally discovered when an energy-mass comprised of all the mutants' powers revived Kid Vulcan, now known simply as Vulcan, and in a rage he attacked the X-Men, causing Xavier to come out of hiding; his legs had been restored to him after the House of M, though he was no longer a mutant. Vulcan made Xavier tell the X-Men what he had done. After Vulcan was defeated and flew off into space, Cyclops told Xavier that he was no longer wanted at the X-Mansion for what he did, though some of the other students were more forgiving, including Beast. Even though Xavier was no longer welcome at the Institute, he nevertheless formed a new team composed of Darwin, Havok, Marvel Girl, Nightcrawler, Warpath and Polaris for the express purpose of tracking down Vulcan before he could enact his vengeance against the Shi'ar Empire. In the midst of a coup involving Vulcan and the Shi'ar royal family, Xavier was imprisoned and briefly tortured, and then was set to be thrown into the M'Kraan Crystal. After he was rescued Professor Xavier regained consciousness and discovered that the M'Kraan Crystal had restored his mutation, and he now maintained both his telepathy and his ability to walk. He then began a search for his old colleague Magneto. His membership in the Illuminati gave him torment when the Hulk came for revenge, and made him steward of the Infinity Mind Gem.Messiah Complex  His relationship with the X-Men became even more strained when Professor X tried to get involved with the first new mutant baby since M-Day , but Cyclops refused his help. Understanding he had to act on his own, Xavier helped Cable secure the baby and find an escape route. After the final battle had taken place with blood shed and Cable jumping into the future with the baby, Bishop fired a shot to kill Cable, but instead it hit Xavier in the head. Xavier survived the bullet impact, though he suffered lingering damages to his mind and memories, while his telepathic abilities seemed uneffected. Despite Xavier's limits, he was trying to rebuild himself and his connections. Some were no longer as trusting of Xavier as before, including Scott Summers, though Wolverine had sought out Xavier to help him free his son from the Hellfire Club's designs. It remains to be seen how well Xavier would be in rebuilding his connections with his former students and friends.Dark Reign  After convincing Exodus to disband the Acolytes, he was approached by Norman Osborn for unknown purposes. Following their encounter, Xavier was taken to H.A.M.M.E.R.'s West Coast base, a restructured Alcatraz Island and slowly stripped of his telepathic powers through the machinations of Dark Bast. Eventually joined by Beast, who had been arrested during a riot, he attempted to convince him that he was the real Xavier in order to warn him. Meanwhile Osborn recruited Mystique to impersonate Xavier in public. During the Dark Avengers' arrival in San Francisco to enforce martial law and squelch the anti-mutant riots occurring in the city, Mystique, posing as Xavier, publicly denounced Cyclops' actions and urged him to turn himself in. Emma Frost managed to detect the real Professor X, later helping Emma Frost to enter the Sentry's mind. However, after Emma worked to free the Sentry of the Void's influence, a minute sliver of the entity itself remained in her mind. Xavier quickly told her to remain in her diamond armor state to prevent the Void from gaining access to her psi-powers.Strengths & Weaknesses Powers  Professor X possesses vast psionic powers and is at least an alpha-level mutant: Telepathy: able to read minds and project his own thoughts into the minds of others within a radius of 250 miles (on Earth). With extreme effort he can greatly extend that radius. When synced with Cerebro, he can connect to every mind on a planet. Whether or not this also relates to all sentient lifeforms or specifically with Humans and Mutants is not known.\n* Telepathic Illusion: ability to create realistic telepathic illusions and cause people to experience events which are not actually occurring.\n* Telepathic Cloak: can mask his presence from being detected by others. His abilities can at times go undetected or be counteracted by other more powerful telepaths depending on their level of skill in using their own psi abilities. He can extend these defenses to others around him as well.\n* Psi Link: ability to develop a mental link with any person which remains as a connection to that individual.\n* Telepathic Camouflage: ability to mask himself, and other peoples' presence from those around him. Can telepathically disguise himself, making his appearance to those around him quite different (changing the appearance of clothing, as well as more involved disguising).\n* Mind Blast: ability to place large amounts of information in another's mind.\n* Mind Control: ability to control the minds of others upon mere concentration. This power can allow him to completely shut down several peoples' minds, making it appear as if time has stopped.\n* Mind Possession: ability to possess the mind of another, and use that being's body as his own.\n* Mind Alteration: ability to alter the minds of others by force of will.\n* Mental Amnesia: ability to cause loss of particular memories and amnesia in another person or even in a group of people.\n* Psionic Shield: ability to erect a psychic shield for protection of himself and of other minds.\n* Psionic Blasts: can project psionic force bolts which have no physical effects but which can affect a victim's mind so as to cause the victim pain or unconsciousness and can even kill an adversary.\n* Astral Projection: ability to Astral Travel and communicate with others astrally through his own will, or through contact with the thoughts and memories of others. In the astral realm, he can use his powers to create \"ectoplasmic\" objects. He cannot engage in long range astral projection on the earthly plane.\n* Mental Detection: can sense the presence of another superhuman mutant within a small but as yet undefined radius of himself by perceiving the distinctive mental radiations emitted by such a being.\n* Mind Transferal: able to transfer both his mind and powers into other host bodies if his own physical body could be somehow killed.\n* Absorb Information: ability to quickly process and store information, by mental transference. Telekinesis (Formely)' Professor X also possesses low-level telekinetic abilities, though these seem to no longer exist. They seem to be part of his genes however, as Cassandra Nova has telekinetic abilities and is basically a clone of Xavier. Phoenix Force: Charles Xavier briefly possessed a fraction of the Phoenix Force during his time with the Starjammers.Abilities  Genius-level Intellect: A natural genius, Xavier is a leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psionics. He possesses considerable expertise in other life sciences. He is highly talented in devising equipment for utilizing and enhancing psionic powers. Xavier is also quite the masterful tactician and strategist, effectively evaluating situations and devising swift responses; he has, on numerous occasions, even fashioned long-term operations as complex as those of adversaries such as Sinister, Magneto, and Apocalypse. Military Training: Charles served in the United States Military, secretly employing his abilities to specialize in search and rescue missions. Expert Fighter: In his travels in the East, he became a proficient hand-to-hand combatant and gained knowledge of pressure points. Knowledge of the body: As an extension of his studies of pressure points, Xavier's knowledge of the body and its energies/chakras has gained him the unofficial degree of a seasoned Zen master, allotting him the ability to keep in the prime of his physique. In spite of his age, he has maintained an impressive Olympic chassis long since before he founded the X-Men and X-Corp, and has kept himself in perfect condition ever since.Strength  Strength of a normal man his age and size who engages in moderate regular exercise, mostly in his upper body.Weaknesses  Paraplegic (Formerly): Professor X has been normally unable to walk due to spinal damage, originally suffered while combating Lucifer. Dark Side: Xavier was shown to have a dark side, a part of himself that he struggles to suppress. Perhaps the most notable appearance of this was the entity Onslaught, which was a physical manifestation of that dark side. Also, Onslaught was created in the most violent act Xavier claimed to have done: Erasing the mind of Magneto. Once the X-Men fought images of the original team, which had been created by what Xavier said was his \"evil self... who would use his powers for personal gain and conquest,\" which he said he was normally able to keep in check. In other instances, Xavier was shown to be secretive and manipulative. During the battle against Onslaught, the X-Men found Xavier's files, the \"Xavier Protocols\", which detail how to kill many of the characters should the need ever arise, such as if they went rogue. Also it was revealed that when Xavier realized that the Danger Room had become sentient, he kept it trapped and experimented on it for years, an act that Cyclops called \"the oppression of a new life\" and equated to humanity's treatment of mutants. Later still, a de-powered Xavier was forced to admit that he had sent a group of hastily trained young mutants to Krakoa to save the original X-Men, resulting in their deaths. Because one of the mutants was Cyclops' brother Vulcan, Xavier erased Cyclops' memory of the event. He further manipulated the rescue team of new X-Men by making them think the meaningless noises the island made were intelligible speech\u2014evidence that the island was alive\u2014to match the new memories he had given Cyclops. Xavier had multiple secrets that he hid from the X-Men beyond the Xavier files, Krakoa and Danger Room incidents. Since the inception of the X-Men, he created and maintained a network of mutant espionage agents to work in dealings that were too dubious for the public eye of the X-Men, even entrapping Mystique into helping him (even though she killed his dear friend, Moira McTaggert). He had also been part of the secret Illuminati society responsible for shooting Bruce Banner into space. There is also the issue that plagues only the longest of long-time X-Men readers. Throughout the years it had been implied that Xavier had always known about mutants beyond those he chose to be his X-Men. He had admittedly hand-crafted who he picked to be his core team members. This has serious implications however, for instance, it can be implied that Xavier must have always known about \"Morlock\" mutants, those with severe physical mutations, yet out of the utility of public appeal chose young, physically attractive mutants that he gave a life of privilege (though accompanied with life-threatening missions). Xavier intentionally let some mutants be his vision in Westchester, while others lived lives of horror and daily prejudice on the streets of Manhattan and around the world. Additionally, after the events of M-Day, Xavier was nowhere to be found. Even though he knew that the X-Men were looking for him, that his ancestral home was invaded by Sentinels, and that his school and the mutant community at large were in a state of crisis. He explained that he hid in England during this time out of embarrassment over losing his abilities and his role he played in the House of M saga.Equipment  Hoverchair, Cerebro, Mind GemTransportation  X-Men BlackbirdTrivia Tournament of Swath Wiki New pages  New pages on the wiki.Tournament of Swath Wiki Tournament of Tournaments 1 Tournament of Swath Wiki Infobox character Tournament of Swath Wiki Gladiator Track Record  When Worlds Collide tournament - Won first round in tag team with Professor X, beating Black Adam and MetamorphoHistory  Gladiator's history before he joined the Imperial Guard is largely unknown. On one occasion Galactus mentioned a being that seemed to match Kallark's description as a former herald.[1] He became a fiercely loyal and powerful member of the Guard, personally trained by Deathbird, and was named Praetor. Regardless of the Majestor or Majestrix in charge, Gladiator would heed their orders. He was one of the Guard members chosen to battle the X-Men over the fate of Jean Grey, who had become the Dark Phoenix. Kallark was later charged with pursuing a group of Skrulls posing as a superhero team. He believed the Fantastic Four to be this group and attacked them. Captain America and Spider-Man found the real Skrull group and assisted in their capture. Kallark was among a number of Imperial Guard members temporarily relocated to Earth. After learning of a Phalanx invasion of Shi'ar space he confronted Cannonball, sending him, the Beast, Trish Tilby, Joseph and Rogue to assist in his stead. At another point[2], Kallark was enlisted by Pip the Troll to try and liberate the planet Skardon from the apathetic rule of the Champion of the Universe (because Skardon law would not recognize the legitimacy of any challenger unless they could beat the Champion in a boxing match). Kallark fought against the Champion, but lost because the Champion possessed the Power Gem which allows it's wearer access to all the power that has or will exist. Kallark spent a period of time recuperating from his injuries; meanwhile, She-Hulk convinced the Champion to remove the Power Gem, and subsequently pummeled him into submission. Most recently Kallark was sent to Earth to find the Uni-Power, which was traveling from host to host for help against Krosakis. He found it with the Invisible Woman, and was able to convince it to come with him. Krosakis attacked Kallark and the Uni-Power as they left Earth. The Silver Surfer intervened and returned the Uni-Power to Earth while Kallark took Krosakis into Shi'ar custody. Gladiator was able to effortlessly defeat Vulcan after several other members of the Guard were killed or seriously injured attempting to capture him. Gladiator is presumably still praetor of the Imperial Guard under Emperor Vulcan's rule.Strengths & Weaknesses Powers  Superhuman Strength: Gladiator possesses tremendous physical strength, the exact limits of which are unknown. He is one of the physically strongest beings to exist in the Universe as he has shattered planets with the mere force of his blows, and can collapse entire Stars with his level of strength. His strength level is dependent on his confidence; as such the more confident he is, the stronger he gets. He has demonstrated several astounding feats of strength such as defeating Colossus with relative ease, almost matching Hulk strength in battle, overpowering Hyperion, and even managing to hold his own for an extended period of time against Thor. Hence, Gladiator is ultimately able to lift somewhere far in excess of 100 tons. Superhuman Speed: Gladiator is capable of running and moving at speeds vastly greater than even the finest human athlete. While the exact limit of his speed is unknown, he is able to move considerably faster than the speed of sound, which is roughly 770 miles per hour. Gladiator is capable of moving at speeds in excess of light. The level of his speed depends on his confidence. Superhuman Stamina: Gladiator possesses extraordinary physical stamina. His muscles generate considerably less fatigue toxins then the musculature of human beings or most other known beings for that matter. Gladiator is able to exert himself at peak capacity for at least several days before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. Superhuman Durability: Gladiator's bodily tissues are much tougher and far more resistant to physical injury than those of human beings. He can withstand high caliber bullets, survive in space unaided, powerful concussive blasts, falls from tremendous heights, and blows from powerful superhumans such as the Hulk without sustaining injury. Gladiator is also highly resistant to extreme temperatures, particularly intense heat. He has shown himself to be capable of flying through stars completely unharmed, and has actually withstood the explosive power of a supernova unharmed. The level of his durability depends on his confidence. Superhuman Agility: Gladiator's natural balance, agility, and body coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete. Superhuman Reflexes: Gladiator's reflexes are similarly heightened and are superior to those of the finest human athlete. Flight: Gladiator is able to generate gravitons that enable him to fly. Gladiator's flight speed rivals those of the fastest known starships, and can achieve faster than light speeds in hyperspace. Heat Beams: Gladiator is capable of firing highly concentrated beams of energy from his eyes. These beams are capable of reaching extremely high temperatures. The maximum temperature his beams can reach is unknown but they can reach temperatures hotter than that of Stars as they were shown able to burn through Hulk's skin. The temperature level of his heat beams depends on his confidence. Microscopic Vision: Gladiator possesses the ability to see extremely small objects and images beyond sub atomic level. Super Breath: Thanks to his incredible lung capacity, Gladiator is also able to draw in large amounts of air and then expel it all to create gale and hurricane force winds. He can also chill his breath to freeze targets. Psi Resistance: Gladiator is capable of causing a counter-force against telepathic assaults and probes. However, telepaths of sufficient power are capable of penetrating his psionic defenses to an extent.Abilities  Gladiator is highly skilled in the combat arts of the Shi'ar, personally trained by Deathbird.Strength  Gladiator possesses Class 100 superhuman strength, enabling him to lift (press) far beyond 100 tons.Weaknesses  Gladiator is vulnerable to a certain specific wavelength of radiation. A significant portion of Gladiator's powers, especially his strength, stamina, and resistance to physical injury, are affected by his level of confidence. If his confidence in himself wavers, he has been known to weaken substantially.Equipment  Gladiator carries a Shi'ar device that helps stabilize massive objects that he lifts. He may have other devices that contribute to his powers.Transportation  Flight under his own power; access to Shi'ar starships and star-gates.Trivia Tournament of Swath Wiki Swathcharacter  Template loop detected: Template:SwathcharacterTournament of Swath Wiki SWATH Top 25 Tournament of Swath Wiki Blue Beetle Track Record  When Worlds Collide tournament - Won first round in tag team with Metallo, beating Iron Man and Human TorchHistory  Jaime Reyes was a relatively normal high school student from El Paso, Texas. His father ran a garage, his mother was a paramedic, and his little sister was a brat. Jaime hung out with his two best friends Brenda and Paco, the mediator between the hard-working Brenda and the laid-back Paco. By both Brenda and Paco's accounts, he was a good friend, the kind of person who could let them be themselves, and who could always make things better. Jaime aimed to help his father out at the garage, but Alberto turned him down, not wanting to see his son grow up too fast. Everything fell apart with the onset of the Infinite Crisis.The Blue Beetle Scarab  Some while before, Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle, had come into possession of the Blue Beetle Scarab, the artefact which had given Dan Garrett, the first Blue Beetle, his powers. The Scarab had been presumed destroyed early in Ted's superhero career, but it was discovered intact in a pyramid in the Middle East. Ted lost the Scarab on a visit to the Rock of Eternity, home of the wizard Shazam. Shortly afterwards, he met his death at the hands of Maxwell Lord, Black King of Checkmate. The Rock of Eternity was later destroyed in mystical battle between Shazam and the Spectre, its contents blasted across the world. The Blue Beetle Scarab came down in El Paso, fire and portent in its wake. Jaime discovered the Scarab on the way home from school with Paco and Brenda, half-buried in a disused lot. He took it home, curious as to what it might be. That night, the Scarab came alive, and grafted itself to the base of Jaime's spine, inducing strange dreams in Jaime. He also got in trouble with a local gang of magic meta humans called the Posse Mistaken him for a magic meta human they magically scanned him and a invited him to join. Jaime declined the offer but the Scarab had no intentioned to be scanned and it almost killed Probe. And easily bested the rest of the Posse. The next night Booster Gold sought Jaime out, and took him to meet Batman. Booster had been to the future, where he had learned that Batman would seek out Brother Eye and fail - but he had also learned the Blue Beetle Scarab was the one thing capable of seeing Brother Eye. Jaime went into space with Batman and his team. The Scarab saw where Brother Eye was hidden, and pulled the rogue satellite back into reality. Jaime, together with Black Canary and Green Arrow, destroyed Brother Eye's dimensional stabilizer, preventing it from escaping outside reality again. Once Batman's team had sent Eye plummeting Earthwards, the Scarab shunted Jaime outside dimensions itself, seeking to escape the Green Lanterns on the spaceship. Unfortunately, the chaos of the dimensional stabilizer's destruction dilated time for Jaime. As far as he knew, he'd only been outside dimensions a couple of minutes; on Earth, however, a whole year had passed.One Year Later  The next thing Jaime remembered, he had come down in the desert outside El Paso, and Guy Gardner was trying to kill him. Once Guy realized he was fighting a kid, he broke off the fight, but not without promising Jaime he would be back. Jaime eventually managed to find his way back home, only to discover his year-long absence. In that time, his father had been crippled, forcing him to walk with a cane, Paco had teamed up with the Posse, and Brenda had been taken in by her aunt after her abusive father died in a DUI. He revealed his identity as the Blue Beetle to both his parents and his two friends. Jaime's attempts to learn more about the Scarab led him to the Posse - and involved him in their conflict with El Paso's resident crimelord, La Dam], as she sought to bring the magical metas of El Paso under her control. Her henchman Diviner even got so far in manipulating The Bottom Feeder to adduct the baby daughter of the Posse leader Damper, Alina Jaime fought to save the baby, discovering he could permanently slay the Bottom Feeder but despite of the Bottom Feeders own wishes he refused as Jaime was not a murderer. After that, Jaime and the Posse launched a raid on Warehouse 13 where La Dama was holding her collection of magic-metas, only to find most of them were happy where they were. However, the Posse managed to convince a good half of them that they could return to their ordinary lives, promising the Blue Beetle would defend them. La Dama had no choice but to accept this, or risk facing her guests' 'objections'. Jaime and La Dama made a reluctant truce - both knew the other's secret identity, and could make it public whenever they chose. Jaime initially believed the Scarab was a mystical artifact, up until Peacemaker arrived, revealing that it was a piece of extraterrestrial technology. Jaime's search for more information took him back to where he'd crash landed in the desert, in an attempt to find out about his missing year. He then headed out on Dan Garrett's trail, looking to find out what the first Blue Beetle had known about the Scarab.The Reach  The current Dan Garret was the original Blue Beetles granddaughter and claimed she had the right of the scarab, but since it was stuck to Jaime's spine she let it go. However, it was Jaime's investigation into a cattle mutilation outside El Paso that would provide his biggest lead on the Scarab. His confrontation with the monstrous creation responsible led him to the Reach, the alien civilization who had created the Scarab and left it on Earth. Jaime discovered that the Reach were galactic conquerors, who planned to add Earth to their list of conquests. Initially, the Scarab had been programmed to be obedient to the Reach, and to subordinate its host's will to them as well. The Reach had intended to present the Scarab's host as Earth's protector, before moving to establish their influence over the planet. However, during the centuries the Scarab had spent on Earth, it had been infused with magic, the magical 'corruption' preventing the Reach from controlling it. With Jaime's assistance, it had started to develop free will and independence, overriding the Reach's deepest programming. Nevertheless, the Reach still intended to take over the planet, even without the Scarab to help them. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, the Reach were peaceful 'galactic traders'. Their secret bases and technology were hidden away, out of phase with the rest of the world, and Jaime was the only one who could see them. Seeing Jaime and the Scarab as the biggest threat to their plans, the Reach attempted to eliminate them through the use of deniable agents, including Earth's supervillains. Jaime, meanwhile, tried to find out what the Reach were up to, and how he could stop them. Worried that the Scarab might still be a threat, Jaime sought help from the local branch of S.T.A.R. Labs. An encounter with Livewire, who was being assessed there at the time, triggered a strange reaction in both Livewire and the Scarab, resulting in a fight. Superman put a halt to the battle, and helped to reassure Jaime about himself and the Scarab. Jaime also assisted Traci Thirteen in foiling Eclipso's attempt to kidnap a baby with great magical potential and use it as a new, uncorrupted host. During the course of the adventure, Jaime and Traci developed a romantic interest in each other, and remained in long-distance contact after Eclipso' defeat. When the Reach recruited Lobo to prevent the launch of a rocket containing anti-Reach technology, Jaime teamed up with the Teen Titans to make sure the rocket lifted off safely. Afterwards, the Titans invited Jaime to Titans Tower, so he could hang out with them, get training, and learn how to fight. Jaime took them up on the invitation - and found himself helping the Titans fight off their future incarnations, the Titans of Tomorrow. Finally, Jaime and the Scarab managed to uncover the Reach's scheme and destroy it, but also ended up destroying any evidence of the scheme, By this point, the Scarab had become an independent, free-willed entity in its own right, naming itself Khaji Da. Together, Jaime and the Scarab devised a plan to bring the Reach down before they tried conquering Earth again. Jaime allowed himself to be captured by the Reach, giving the Scarab the chance to hack into the Reach's computers and broadcast their invasion plans worldwide. The Reach's Negotiator, driven to breaking point, ordered Earth's destruction - but again, Jaime and the Scarab intervened, stopping the world-rippers before they could be activated. The Reach were forced to withdraw, claiming that the Negotiator had 'gone rogue'. The Scarab, however, had had a conversation with the other Scarabs onboard the Reach ship - a little surprise for the Reach.Strengths & Weaknesses Powers  The Scarab has displayed the following abilities since its bond to Jaime Reyes. It can opt to use its powers of its own accord, though it typically defers to Jaime. However, if Jaime doesn't want the Scarab to use a power, he can override it. Should Jaime fall prey to a body-controlling power, the Scarab will take control of the armor. Some of the Scarab's powers can function regardless of whether the armor is active or not; others, however, only work when the armor is in use. Those powers that depend on the armor are listed under its heading. According to Jaime, the Scarab has a number of 'options' beyond those listed below, some of which are apparently capable of destroying a city. Artificial Intelligence: Normally, the Reach's command sentience parameters, stored in a Scarab's database, give a Scarab sentience and serve to make it obedient to the Reach. An infusion of magical energies sometime in the distant past altered the Scarab, denying the Reach control. When the Scarab's infiltrator mode was triggered, the Scarab was able to develop its sentience without being in service to the Reach. It also had the opportunity to access the programming of other Scarabs as well. As a result, the Scarab has its own mind, with full access to its own programming, Tracking Systems: The Scarab can track anything which produces energy, be it biological, technological or mystical. It can track anyone Jaime met since it bonded with him, from at least seventy miles distant.  Scarab Sight: The Scarab can scan the people Jaime encounters, informing him of any major physical conditions (such as pregnancy). It can identify and scan metahumans. It can identify people related to those it's already encountered via genetic analysis. The Scarab is able to identify thought-patterns, enabling it to see if something is sentient. It can identify matching energy signatures, letting it see if the energy patterns were developed from the same basis. It can also see extra-dimensional objects. It is continually aware of the electricity in the surrounding environment. It can perceive magic, see how a magical effect can be dispelled, and see through magical concealment. The Scarab's scans can cover at least a five mile square. It communicates the information it gleans to Jaime in a manner he can understand. Network Connection: The Scarab can establish a connection to communication systems, enabling Jaime to speak to the person on the other end. Clothing Manifestation: The Scarab can create clothes for Jaime, apparently from recycled waste and skin, which melt when he takes them off. Concealment: The Scarab is capable of concealing itself from 21st century technology (though Skeets, from the 25th century, was able to find it). It can shut off cameras and microphones in its vicinity. The Scarab has blocked a magical attempt to probe it, lashing out at the person who tried. Healing Host Reconfiguration: The Scarab can modify Jaime's body to a certain extent (e.g., offering to give him extra fingers), although just how far the modifications can go is unknown. Blue Beetle Armor: The Scarab can create a distinctive suit of armor in response to Jaime's thoughts, or when it deems use of the armor necessary. Once the Scarab dispels the armor, it retracts back into Jaime's body.Strength  Jaime normally has the strength level of a young teenage male who engages in moderate exercise. The Scarab's armor gives him enough strength to move a small truck.Weaknesses  Green Lantern Corps: The Scarab sees the Green Lantern Corps as the 'enemy'. In Jaime's first few days as the Beetle, the Scarab did everything in its power to get him away from the Lanterns - up to and including shifting him outside the universe. As Jaime's experience with the Scarab's armor has developed, the Scarab has taken a more aggressive approach against the Lanterns, urging Jaime to kill them. The Green Lantern rings, for their part, fear the Scarab, responding in different ways depending on their wielders (e.g. John Stewart's sparks, as if afraid, while Guy Gardner's induced what can only be described as a 'super-migraine', along with an intense desire to kill the Scarab's bearer). Truce With Nature: The Scarab will not hurt nature, or the magical creatures thereof (beings who draw their power from the Green, for example), of its own volition. Alien Sentience: The Scarab's sentience is distinctly alien; while it won't hurt /nature/, it has shown no such reluctance when it comes to humans, being willing to injure or kill them. Fortunately, Jaime has so far prevented it from killing anyone.  Reach Tech: The Scarab's armor can be breached by the weapons of other Scarabs. Equally, however, the Scarab is able to breach other Scarabs' armor. Originally, the Scarab was unable to attack the Reach and their technology. Jaime overrode the Scarab's programming, 'reprogramming' it so that it was able to fight the Reach. Magic: While the Scarab is aware of magic, it doesn't understand it. It's able to perceive, absorb, and disrupt magical energies, but little else. As a result, creatures of magic are often a significant challenge. The Scarab can't analyse certain mystical creatures, and so is unable to develop countermeasures for them. When faced with certain other mystical entities, such as the Spectre, the Scarab panics, offering Jaime ever more powerful weapons to take them on. Magnetic Shielding: Strong magnetic fields block the Scarab's ability to track DNA. Dispelling The Armor: Dispelling the armor originally caused Jaime intense pain. As time has passed, however, Jaime has found the process getting easier.Equipment Trivia Tournament of Swath Wiki Battle of the Babes! Tournament of Swath Wiki Batwoman Track Record  When Worlds Collide tournament - Tag team with Wonder WomanHistory 52  Katherine \"Kate\" Kane was Ren\u00e9e Montoya's former lover and heiress to one of the wealthiest families in Gotham City, owning that which the Wayne family does not. While investigating the mysterious activities at 520 Kane Street, Renee discovered that the building was owned by the Kanes and asked Kate to help find the connection between the Kanes and the address. While still upset from their breakup, Kate agreed to help Renee, but punched her after Renee mentioned their prior relationship. Renee suggested they once loved each other, and Kate told her to leave. Not long after that, Batwoman began observing Montoya from the rooftops as Renee conversed with the Question (in his guise as \"Charlie\") in an alley. Kate met with Ren\u00e9e and Charlie in Gotham Park and confirmed that the warehouse was being leased by Ridge-Ferrick until six weeks earlier. Renee refused to tell Kate what was going on, saying that she didn't owe Kate anything, which shocked Kate and prompted her to tail them as Batwoman. When Renee and the Question broke into Ridge-Ferrick's Gotham offices, they were attacked by Whisper A'Daire's shapeshifting minions, and Batwoman arrived to rescue them. Making quick work of two monsters, Batwoman stopped Renee from shooting the third, instead kicking the monster out a window. Batwoman informed them the police were coming, asked that she not be mentioned, and left. After Renee learned that the Book of Crime, a sacred text of Intergang, contained a prophecy foretelling the brutal murder of the \"twice named daughter of Kane,\" she and the Question returned to Gotham. They contacted Kate by flashing a Bat-Signal, and the three joined forces to avert Intergang's plans. As Kate continued the case, she was joined by Nightwing, who had recently returned to Gotham and becomes infatuated with her (no doubt because of her resemblance to former Batgirl Barbara Gordon), though she assured him she wasn't his type. On Christmas Eve, he gave her an 'official' Batarang. She also celebrated Hanukkah with Renee, and the two kiss shortly before Christmas. Intergang realized that the image of Batwoman in the Crime Bible and the cited \"twice-named daughter of Cain\" were one and the same, and ransacked Kate's apartment, kidnapping her with the intention to sacrifice her. Renee found her, seemingly too late to save her, as during the ensuing fight with Bruno Mannheim, Kate pulled the knife out of her own chest to stab Mannheim and then collapsed in Renee's arms. Kate survived her wounds after Ren\u00e9e used pseudoderm to patch up the wound and stop the bleeding, leaving Kate at the hospital in Ren\u00e9e's trenchcoat. As Kate recuperated in her Penthouse, Ren\u00e9e, dressed as the Question, shined the batsignal into her apartment and asked \"Are you ready?\"One Year Later  One year after the start of 52, the Penguin suggests Batman bring a date to the opening of his club, asking, \"Why don't you bring that new Batwoman? I hear she's kind of hot.\" Batwoman later appeared when Ren\u00e9e Montoya confronted Trickster and Pied Piper to question them about the murder of Bart Allen, having trailed them from Penguin's Iceberg Lounge nightclub. Ren\u00e9e again left town, irritating Kate, though she agreed to help Ren\u00e9e in tracking down a copy of the Crime Bible, being sold via the Penguin. The book was actually part of the Lessons that the Order of Stone was attempting to teach Ren\u00e9e, and she and Kate fight over the book. In the end, as Ren\u00e9e claims she only wants it to protect Kate. Kate tells her that Ren\u00e9e never asked what Kate wanted, but lets her take the book.Final Crisis  During the Final Crisis, Kane was one of the millions who fell under the influence of the Anti-Life Equation, and became a member of the Female Furies.Batman Reborn  After the Crisis, Kane continues to act as Batwoman and, with the new Batman's blessing, investigates the 13 chapters of the Crime Syndicate in Gotham, and their new High Priestess, Alice. Her father, Colonel Kane, assists Kate in her role as Batwoman, supplying her with technology and training, as do Kyle Abbot and two other shape-shifters, who themselves are the True Believers. When Alice kidnaps Kate's father and plans to unleash a toxic gas over Gotham, Abbot commandeers a plane to stop her. Kate manages to stop the weapon and save her father, but in the final fight, Alice falls from the plane to her death, refusing to take Kate's hand and be saved. Before she falls, Alice tells Kate \"You have our father's eyes.\"Strengths & Weaknesses Abilities  As Batwoman, Kate lacks any superpowers, and instead relies on her martial artistry and Batman-inspired equipment when fighting crime. Skilled Martial Artist: In the ten years since her breakup with Ren\u00e9e Montoya, she has learned to fight and is able to defeat three monsters, as well as spy on Renee and the Question with relative ease. Heiress: Being the heiress of a family whose fortune is comparable to the Waynes, Kate possesses the finances to produce an arsenal of equipment, similar to Batman. This includes a baton-like device which can extend from the center in length and has Bat-shaped attachments at each end.Strength  Athlete: Kathy Kane possesses the strength level of a woman her age, size and weight who engages in intensive regular exercise.Weaknesses  At the end of the day Kate is only human and possesses all the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of anyone else, although her Batsuit offers her at least some protection from most conventional attacks.Equipment  Kate wears a utility belt similar to the one worn by Batman. What this belt has yet to be confirmed.Weapons  Batarangs; Bat-clubTrivia Tournament of Swath Wiki Darth Revan Samsung Moment Wiki Zefie's Kernels  Zefie's Custom Kernel offers many features not available in the stock Samsung Kernel.

\n\n\n The inspiration of Mandala* comes from my experience of making documentaries on the \u201csocial outsiders\u201d in the recent years. As a director I strongly identify with these people in my films. To me there is no clear-cut demarcation between good and evil. Mandala has the same theme that runs through all my works about these people and human frailty. It is a film about tattoo, which is unfavorably taken to signify rebel and idiosyncrasy in Taiwan. In this film however the characters embrace tattoo as a ritual to deal with personal pains and grief. It is the only exit they can find to get out of their traumatic memories. The tattoo of an exotic flower or a powerful dragon on their skin belies the frail self hidden beneath it. In Mandala I try to embed this theme in a very intriguing storyline. I hope the audience will be touched and find my film comforting.

Film biru biasanya berhubungan dengan air, laut, langit dan sebagainya. Film biru diciptakan pertama kali oleh Joko Tingkir Wingkir bersama Roy Suryo pada tahun 1266 BC. Film jenis ini diminati dan ditonton dari kalangan bayi sampai nenek-nenek migren, karena.....biru. Sialnya Film Biru ini tidak dapat dinikmati dan diminati oleh orang yang buta warna karena isi film ini berwarna biru semuaSejarah  Pada suatu ketika, kelima dewa pendamping Barney yang disebut sebagai  Teletubbies , yakni Joko Tingkir Wingkir, Jijiksih, Lara, Po Ati (dulunya Po Hindun) dan POpokbayi, sedang menjalankan rutinitas mereka, yakni berjalan-jalan di taman, berpelukan. Sebenarnya film biru itu adalah film bokep di perut mereka dan diakhiri dengan hubungan seks seperti biasa. Menyadari kehidupan mereka amat indah, mereka mulai terpikir untuk membuat sebuah film biografi mengenai kehidupan mereka. Dengan bantuan dari Roy Suryo, akhirnya jadilah film-film itu, yang diberi nama sesuai dengan warna celana dalam masing-masing, misalnya film Joko diberi nama Film Biru, film Jijiksih diberi nama Film Hijau, film Lara diberi nama Film Kuning, film Po Ati diberi nama Film Merah, sedangkan film Po pokbayi tidak diberi nama karena ia tidak pakai celana dalam. Diantara film-film tersebut, film biru milik Joko rupanya adalah yang paling laris, mungkin karena Joko adalah anggota Teletubbies yang paling homo, banci, suka pakai baju  yang pernah dipakai wanita, dan sering pergi ke Dolly. Sudah gitu mulutnya juga bau jengkol. Melihat kesuksesan Film Biru tersebut, Roy Suryo melihat kesempatan untuk menambah kekayaan dirinya, sehingga ia mulai memproduksi lanjutannya seperti Film Biru 02, Film Biru 03, Film Biru Reloaded dan sebagainya. Film-film itu sangat sukses dan terkenal, sehingga akhirnya Film Biru menjadi sebuah istilah bagi film-film tentang segala hal yang berwarna biru. Iri dengan kesuksesan pasangan homo mereka, anggota-anggota Teletubbies yang lain, yaitu Jijiksih, Lara dan Po Atipun berkolaborasi membuat film Mejikuhibiniu, sementara Popokbayi sudah bunuh diri karena malu. Sayangnya film Mejikuhibiniu itu masih tetap kalah pamor, hingga akhirnya mereka menyerah dan menggunakan lambang mejikuhibiniu itu sebagai lambang homoseksualapiens.Manfaat Film Biru  Film biru berkhasiat memberikan rasa tenang dan nyaman, sebab warna biru dikenal bisa memberikan ketenangan. Karena itulah orang biasanya menonton film biru sebelum tidur. Orang yang rutin menonton film biru sebelum tidur biasanya tidurnya lebih nyenyak dan bermimpi yang indah-indah, meskipun kadang-kadang mimpinya agak basah. Hal itu dikarenakan film biru memang banyak bercerita tentang air. air maninya roy suloyo eh surlo eh jd gg enkPenggunaan  Kesuksesan film biru membuat film ini ditayangkan hampir diseluruh channel TV. Film-film biru ini biasanya ditayangkan sekitar tengah malam agar penontonnya bisa tidur nyenyak. Bahkan jika TV anda masih katrok dan channelnya hanya sampai nomer 5, maka film-film biru akan ditayangkan untuk mengisi channel-channel sisanya. Sementara, film Mejikuhibiniu, saingan dari film biru juga sering ditayangkan di channel-channel TV malam-malam, hanya sedikit lebih jarang dipakai. Misalnya TransTV lebih memilih film Mejikuhibiniu ini.Efek Samping film biru  Terlalu banyak menonton film biru bisa menyebabkan mata menjadi biru, sebagaimana terlalu banyak memegang duit membuat orang jadi mata duitan. Hal ini bisa dibuktikan dengan melihat mata para bule-bule yang kebanyakan berwarna biru, itu dikarenakan mereka suka melihat film biru.Virus Film Biru  Sekitar tahun 1851, mulai beredar virus film biru ke berbagai perangkat elektronik, seperti komputer, TV, hairdryer, blender bahkan vibrator. Perangkat elektronik yang terjangkit virus film biru, maka akan menampilkan film-film biru secara random saat sedang digunakan, sehingga penggunanya akan tergoda sehingga malah menonton film biru tersebut dan meninggalkan pekerjaannya. Misalnya, para  anggota DPR  di Indonesia menjadi malas bekerja, itu karena laptop mereka yang seharga Paris Hilton itu sudah terjangkit virus film biru. Bahkan laptop Tukul yang terkenal itu juga mulai muncul gejala-gejala film biru. Diduga, virus ini disebarkan oleh seorang maniak film biru bernama Bill Gates.Film-film biru terkenal Contoh gambar-gambar dalam film biru  JawsLihat juga Tolololpedia Maria Ozawa  Maria Ozawa (\u5c0f\u6fa4\u30de\u30ea\u30a2), juga dikenal sebagai Miyabi (\u307f\u3084\u3073), adalah  seorang aktris film Hentai (film-film bukan untuk konsumsi anak-anak, biasanya bertopik tentang politik, bisnis, dan biologi). Selain itu ia juga medirikan perusahaan Mie Yabi yang bekerja sama dengan kota Bakmi Kuah, Baku, Azerbaijan.Kisah Hidup  Maria Ozawa lahir di Asyur, kota pusat industri film Syur di Bintang Porno dengan nama asli Maria Osyahwat (\ufee3\ufead\ufef3\ufe8e \ufe8d\ufeed\ufeb7\ufeea\ufeed\ufe8d\ufe95) pada 8 Januari 20 BC (Before Camasutra). Dadanya besar sekali sampai-sampai dilihat dari puncak monas dengan sedotan pun tidak kelihatan. Ia adalah sepupu jauh dari Mulan Jameelah. Ketika mereka sedang melakukan perjalanan ke Distrik Maksiad, modul teleportasi mereka mengalami klimaks dan mendaratkan mereka ke Mogadishu pada tahun 4 BC (Before Camasutra) Dia adalah pacar dari Kukuh Setya Nugroho dari SMAN 54 Jakarta kelas XI IPA 1 Nomor Absen 26.Maria Ozawa punya selingkuhan bernama Elfonso Robby Gunawan Hans Sitorus yang juga bersekolah di SMAN 54 Jakarta Kelas XI IPA 1 Nomor Absen 17. Dalam usahanya mencari jalan kembali ke Bintang Porno mereka juga melakukan pekerjaan sampingan sebagai penjual bakmi dan burqini keliling. Maria Osyahwat populer di kalangan Yahudi karena mi nya yang Kosher. Pada tahun 1 BC (Before Camasutra) mereka ikut para Tenaga Kerja Yahudi di Mesir untuk kembali ke negaranya dalam rangka Mudik Lebaran. Di Mesir, Mulan Jameelah mendapatkan informasi tentang kitab suci Kama Sutra yang dapat membantu ia untuk kembali ke Bintang Porno. Maria Osyahwat, merasa  berat untuk meninggalkan bisnisnya memilih menetap di Mesir. Pada suatu hari Minggu yang mendung, dalam perjalananya ke Carefour untuk membeli daging sapi dan baju dalam Maria Osyahwat menyewa sebuah taksi. Namun ternyata pengemudi taksi itu adalah antek dari Konsorsium Martabak Mesir yang merasa bisnisnya terancam oleh bakmi Maria. Sang Pengemudi taksi kemudian melarikan Maria Osyahwat ke padang gurun Sinai. Di sana ia  dipaksa untuk memberikan uangnya. Bukan hanya itu, pakaiannya yang bermerk ELLE(K) pun ikut diambil. Akhirnya Maria Osyahwatpun ditinggal hanya dengan mengenakan baju dalam saja. Tidak dapat kembali ke Mesir, Maria Osyahwat memutuskan untuk menyusul mulan Jameelah ke barat. Dengan membajak pesawat terbang milik Amerika, (masih hanya dengan mengenakan baju dalam), Maria Osyahwat terbang ke Jepang. Amerika tidak bisa berbuat apa-apa terhadap pembajakan  tersebut karena personil-personil Pasukan Khusus Angkatan Laut US dan SAS terlumpuhkan setelah melihat tubuh Maria Osyahwat. Setelah beberapa tahun tidak menemukan Mulan Jameelah, Maria Osyahwat meninggalkan pencariannya dan menetap di Jepang. Di sana ia menggunakan bakat memasaknya untuk membuka kedai Mie Yabi, singkatan dari \" YAng BIsa diantar dan dibawa pulang\". Maria Osyahwat awalnya dipanggil oleh  orang-orang Jepang Maria Ozawa namun sejak Mie Yabi menjadi sangat terkenal di seantero Honshu iapun lebih dikenal dengan nama Miyabi, yang merupakan singkatan dari nama kedainya. Kesuksesan ini diduga karena Miyabi masih belum membeli baju baru apapun sejak dari Mesir sehingga ia melayani para pelanggannya hanya dengan memakai baju dalam saja. Pada suatu hari, direktur agen model B-Open alias Buka-Open yang bernama Suparno datang ke kedainya. Ketika ia melihat tubuh Maria Ozawa, ia langsung  tertarik dan menawarkan Miyabi untuk bekerja di perusahaannya menjadi model di situs-situs web seperti cerdas.com, betakurangnafsu.org, sukatoro.com Shirouto-Teien.com, Barney.com, Teletubbies.co.uk, Al-Qaeda dan termasuk juga di Tolololpedia ini. Iapun menjadi terkenal di dunia internasional. Tawaran untuk membintangi berbagai video dari video dewasa sampai video pendidikan pun berdatangan. Itulah awal dari karir cemerlangnya. Maria Ozawa sempat berhenti memerankan video untuk mendalami ilmu Video Dewasa di Tokyo Ozawa Daigaku, fakultas Syahwat Lelaki. Namun, ia tidak lulus S2, karena ia menolak ujian akhir yang ditugaskan oleh dosen nya, A Ming Wa Chi, seorang pecinta sayur lonjong, untuk membuat film dengan terong dan timun. Maria Ozawa bahkan pernah masuk artikel dalam majalah Bobokep versi Roy Suryo, sampai sekarang masih tidak diketahui nasib Roy Suryo. Merk mi ciptaanya, Mie Yabi memiliki pesaing, yaitu Miethuania, merk mi yang paling tokcer se-Tukulnesia dan Dunia Gendeng. mie Yabi pernah kalah bersaing gara-gara varian Miethuania yang lebih banyak.Daftar Film yang Pernah Dibintangi Kehidupan Rumah Tangga  Miyabi sempat jatuh cinta dengan seorang pelaut Portugis bernama Vasco da Gama yang terdampar di daratan Kuang (dalam ekspedisinya ke daratan Amerika, Amerini dan Ameriko). Ia langsung jatuh cinta pada Miyabi pada pandangan keseratus tujuh puluh dua. Setelah dinikahi oleh Vasco, Miyabi menjadi  Ratu di Portugis. Selama pemerintahan Vasco da Gama, perindustrian film dewasa di Portugis berkembang dengan luar biasa. Sayangnya pada suatu hari, Miyabi menangkap basah Vasco da Gama sedang bermesraan dengan wanita yang jauh lebih cantik dari Miyabi, yaitu Dorce da Gama Lama. Miyabi menjadi sangat marah dan ia menendang Vasco da Gama ke ujung barat Portugis. Sejak saat itu Portugis dibagi menjadi 2 yaitu Portugis Barat yang dipimpin Vasco da Gama dan Portugis Timur yang dipimpin oleh Miyabi dimana keduanya dipisahkan oleh Tembok Berlin. Namun karena tembok itu dibuat dari kardus-kardus mie instan, masyarakat bisa dengan mudah meruntuhkannya. Namun semuanya sudah terlambat bagi Vasco da Gama, Miyabi telah pulang ke  kediamannya di Hokkaido. Vasco da Gama pun bunuh diri dengan minum Cocktail Susu Mbokmu dan Overdosis Viagra. Kini Miyabi tengah mengikuti audisi untuk tampil di acara Take Me Out, Take Him Out, dan Take A Celebrity Out siapa tahu dapat Coky Sitohang atau menggeser posisi Yuanita Christiani sebagai Co-Host jadi tunggu tanggal mainnya. Menurut cerita yg beredar di forum-forum internet Maria Ozawa mempunyai beberpa keturunan yang tak kalah seksinya diantaranya adalah Maria Magdalena, Maria Mercedes, Maria Sharapova, Maria Cinta yang Hilang, Mariang Masuk Angin, Maria Kemaria (Hey Kawan).

KRMT Roy Suryo Notodiprojo disingkat RSJ dan atau disebut juga Roy Syuryo karena senang dengan foto syur, adalah seorang pakar transgender 68% foto-foto tidak senonoh di Indonesia atau lebih dikenal dengan Pornomatika, meskipun begitu analisanya jauh lebih lamban daripada 68% anak-anak SLB. Di waktu luangnya Roy Surya suka mencari sensasi dengan menghina kehadiran 68% blogger di dunia dengan mengatakan bahwa 68% para blogger adalah penipu, Roy Suryo telah melukai hati setiap blogger indonesia. Hal ini disebabkan oleh rasa sirik karena Roy Suryo tidak tahu cara membuat blog. Anak Roy Suryo adalah Jerry Joansyah, anak haram Roy Suryo yang terkenal homoseks dan pernah merusuhi Bandung. Tahukah anda selogan asli roy suryo \"titit anda besar? kami beli dengan harga tinggi!\" dan \"titit anda putus kami ganti dengan pisang\" Tidak ada yang tahu alamat e-mailnya. Roy Suryo sendiri ketika ditanya mengklaim alasan keamanan namun 68% orang beranggapan hal ini karena memang Roy Suryo tidak tahu cara menggunakan e-mail. Kemungkinan ini didukung oleh fakta bahwa Roy Suryo lebih mendalami cara membaca metadata selama bertahun-tahun sehingga ia tidak sempat mempelajari penggunaan e-mail. Karena terlalu dalam mempelajari dada meta, maaf maksud kami mempelajari cara membaca metadata, sehingga kemampuan beliau membaca cerita bergambar sempat di ragukan.Masa kanak-kanak  68% Masa kanak-kanak Roy Suryo dihabiskan dengan menulis program menggunakan mesin tik dengan add-ons berupa sempoa yang dia colong dari teman sekelasnya beserta menggunakan kalkulator sebagai ekstensi mesin tik dan beberapa batang lidi untuk mempermudah menghitung. Masa kecilnya merupakan masa-masa dimana Roy Suryo menentukan jalan hidupnya antara memilih menjadi pakar organ genital atau pakar telematika gadungan yang belakangan ini tersebar kabar kalau dia seorang pakar porno. Sejak kecil dia sudah terbiasa mengamati 68% gambar porno yg dia temukan di gudang rumahnya, 32% dari mbokmu dan mengeditnya, jadi ia hapal antara gambar hasil jepretan dan hasil editan.Dia sok menjadi orang alim padahal dia suka banget liat foto dan video porno. Mungkin dia juga berbakat jadi sutradara film porno yang sukses. Salah satu hal yang mengindikasikan ini adalah adanya kesaksian dari 68% orang-orang sekitar bahwa Roy Suryo pernah berupaya mengawinkan anjing dengan sapi secara diam-diam.Roy Suryo kecil juga jago banget menghina 68% temannya waktu kecil,sehingga sampai dewasa pun dia masih menghina 68% orang lain yang tidak tau apa-apa bahkan 68% orang gila pun di hina juga.Pergantian kelamin menjadi wanita  Pada 30 Agustus 2018, Roy mengubah jenis kelamin dari awalnya laki-laki menjadi wanita.Prestasi Fakta - fakta Roy Sosro kandidat presiden  Menurut kata Notonogoro , presiden indonesia , ialah Soekarno, Soeharto, SusiloBambangYudhoyono, masih belum diketahuigo, dan kemungkinan besar yang terakhir adalah Roy Sosro, di prediksi bahwa saat dia menjabat menjadi presiden, orang-orang akan dianaiaya memakai cambuk.Lalu orang-orang disuruh melakukan adegan-adegan nakal (semisal nonjok orang , buang sampah pada idungnya dll.) pada saat ini diperkirakan omset negara indonesia mencapai 1 triliun $ per pekannya.Ambisi Roy Suryo pada Pemilu  Jakarta, 08 September 2011 SM, gedung paripurna telah bersiap-siap untuk berbenah, begitu pula yg di sampaikan sebagian anggota DPR RI yg ketika itu sedang menonton bokep, ketika di wawancarai di tempat nya, roy suryo selaku menjabat menteri kemaluan memandang pemilu mendatang adalah salah satu ambisi nya untuk menjadi orang nomor satu di negeri konoha, untuk mengantisipasi jika hal itu tak terealisasi, maka ia akan mengancam bergabung menjadi anggota akatsuki menggatikan madara dan akan merekrut SBY menggantikan pein nagato. Bahkan, menurut sumber-sumber yang tidak jelas dan aktual, Roy Suryo telah membentuk Tim Suksesnya untuk Pilpres mendatang. Hal ini terbukti dari dibagikannya kaos bergambar dirinya pada sebuah pameran pembasmi hama. Roy Suryo mengklaim kaos yang bergambar dirinya tidak akan rusak oleh gannguan hama seperti ngengat, tikus, dll. (Mungkin serangga takut pada gambar Roy Suryo) dia dikabar kan pernah menjalin hubungan seks dengan Badutwi selama 68 bulan dan di putusin karena dia memilih dengan BarneyAnak Haramnya Roy Suryo  di duga saat roy suryo meneliti 68% vidio bokep nya dia diam diam berhubungan dengan amingwati dan setelah itu roy suryo diduga memiliki anak haram yg bernama priyono Nyoto tapi dia menyembunyikanya dari 68% publik dan lebih memilih 68% menyembunyikanya di rumahnyaRiset Terakhir  Pada april 2012, Roy Suryo mengidentifikasi pelaku video Anggota DPR dan hingga kini, status videonya belum terbukti apakah video tersebut rekayasa atau nyata.Status PB-Garena Roy Suryo  Kill/Death\u00a0: 68% Headshot \u00a0: 68% Win/Lose \u00a0: 68% Kabur \u00a0: 68 kali Nickname \u00a0: SL_SURYO_68 Point \u00a0: 68.000.000 Cash \u00a0: 26513 Pangkat \u00a0: Tengkorak 6 kutip 8 Senjata \u00a0: AK 47 FC(malak),c5 palsu , colt pistol(permanent dari event PB(Pecinta Bokep), revolver, kriss (hibah dari Barney), SPAS 12, mp7(68 unit tersisa), pisau mainan mbokmu.Lihat Juga Tolololpedia Point Blank  Berkas:67867.jpg Point Blank atau disingkat PB atau disebut juga Permainan Bocah adalah game FPS yang kini sudah diklaim oleh Badutwi. Karena game ini sudah menjamur di seluruh warnet Indonesia, maka tak jarang ada orang Indonesia yang pangkat PB nya gede tapi tolol. Sementara pihak gemscoli menghitung uang hasil dari pemasaran game Point Blank dan penjualan cash, orang Indonesia dan dewi otakuisme menghambur-hamburkan duit ayah mereka untuk naik pangkat, padahal jelas-jelas Point Blank terbukti 100% dapat MENSUKSESKAN Ujian Nasional, saking suksesnya sampai hampir semua tidak lulus karena nilainya sangat hancur. Saat ini, Point Blank sudah dikelola oleh Garena agar tidak terjadi cheater, jaringan internet lebih cepat diatas 680000 MBps dan beberapa hadiah senjata yang menarik.Persamaan dengan Counter Strike  Di Point Blank akan dijumpai 2 kubu yaitu Free Rebels yang dipimpin oleh Badutwi dan CT Force yang 68% dipimpin Roy Suryo dan 32% dipimpin Amingwati. Selain itu anda dapt mencarinya di toko terdekat.Free Ebel Red bull  Bernama asli Lionel Messo (adeknya messi) tapi tak sepopuler dia. Red Bull pernah kalah dalam pertandingan nasional akibak kakaknya yang lagi coli saat dia tengah bertanding di lapangan hijau. Akibatnya dia disalahkan dan diasingkan oleh klub. Lalu dia dendam dan membunuh semua sahabatnya termaksud Mbokmu dan Kamu. Tapi dia akhirnya menyesal karena tak bisa membunuh sang kakak yang hoki coli sambil kabur sehingga melesat di udara dan turun dengan selamat. Dia bertekad menjadi terrorist dan menjadi tembak jitu menggunakan AK-SOPBUAH.Lopez Rica  Aslinya Rica Lopez merupakan polwan / ct force yang berpangkat sangat tinggi, tapi dia dipecat karena memakai baju polisi terlalu vulgar, setelah itu dia stress karena tidak mendapat pekerjaan lagi, karena tubuhnya yang sangat montok, suatu hari ia dibayar 1.000.000 rp untuk memuaskan birahi para pria free rebel, awalnya dia tidak mau, lalu para pria free rebel sempat kesal dan menyeretnya namun setelah Rica sadar karena sudah menerima uang bayaran dia pun pasrah. Rica pun digiring ke markas free rebel, Rica diperlakukan layaknya binatang, lehernya dirantai dan kemudian ditelanjangi lalu \"dipakai\" secara bergantian oleh para pria free rebel selama 5 hari berturut-turut. Walaupun seharusnya dia hanya dibayar untuk memuaskan birahi selama 5 hari, dia terus dipaksa, dan pada akhirnya Rica pun dipakai secara gratis selama 5 bulan full, setiap malam oleh para pria free rebel.Viper Red  Merupakan anggota free rebel yang cantik dan juga jago sniper, tapi tidak seperti Rica Lopez ia tidak pernah memuaskan birahi para teman-teman free rebel-nya, karena diketahui para teman-teman free rebel-nya itu takut akan kegalakan Viper, Viper juga setiap malam menyaksikan Rica Lopez yang selalu dipakai oleh para teman-teman pria-nya.Tarantula  Karakter yang didesain paling seksi tapi tidak memakai pakaian seminim si lonte (Rica Lopez). Tarantula suka sama laba-laba dan laba-laba pun suka sama dia. Tarantula merupakan teman baik Viper Red, mereka berdua adalah gadis yang akrab, Tarantula benci terhadap Rica Lopez karena tubuhnya kalah montok sejak Rica muncul di PB. Suatu hari Tarantula melihat Rica Lopez yang mencoba kabur dari markas Free Rebel karena sudah tak kuat memuaskan birahi para laki2 yang memakainya setiap malam, tapi Tarantula berhasil menangkap Rica Lopez, karena kesal, dia pun merobek-robek dan menelanjang Rica lalu membawanya ke para teman laki-lakinya untuk dipakai lagi.CT Force Leo Pard  Dulunya dia santri pesan tren.Ia sering adzan di masjid (padahal suaranya kambing kebelet pipis).Saat pesan trennya di bom oleh terorist yang di pimpin mbok darmi,maka ia balas dendam dan ia menjadi densus (dendam khusus).biar berhasil balas dendam adzan dulu(doa bego bukan adzan)Acid Pool  Dia adalah densus yang mukanya jelek.Tapi dia dapat merayu Hide dari pada Leo Pard gagal terus merayu.Acid Pool sebenarnya karena dia pernah kecebur ke kolam racun dan akhirnya tewas.Tapi tewas bukan karena kecebur dikolam itu,tapi dia mati di atas helikopter out post dan meledak di tembak pake RPG oleh Tarantula dan pacarnya (Red Bull)Keen Ayse  Dia adalah polisi yang kurang mulus gak kayak characther wanita lainnya. Seksinya dia dari perutnya tubuhnya yang lainnya\u00a0:P. Dia marah dengan Hide, Viper Red, sama Tarantula karena bajunya gak sevulgar mereka(klo gak percaya liat komik pb part 8 yang kedua)konon, rate HS mereka ber-3 lebih tinggi dari pada Ayse, berubungan lawan suka lengah gara2x keasyikan liat toket mereka [-_-]Hide  Dia densu yang cantik tapi nenennya gede.Karena kematian pacarnya.Dia balas dendam dengan membunuh tarantula dengan Sniper PSG-1.Akhirnya Red Bull membalasnya tapi gagal karena dia di bunuh (soal nya cuma pake dual D.Agle bukan AK Sopbuah,kalo ga percaya liat di you tube dan ketik kisah cinta pb part 2).Judy Chou  Dulu adalah pelacur seperti Rica Lopez, dia memakai celana dalam berwarna hitam juga dengan stocking nya dan payudara yg besar. Tapi kemudian tobat dan menjadi suster di sebuah puskesmas. Dia akhirnya direkrut ke CT, karena CT butuh suster.Hide Kopassus  Dia adalah begundal yang ganti baju, karena bosen pake baju  itu-itu aja, dia nyolong baju  bapaknya yang bekerja sebagai kopassus, demi dapat bergabung kembali dengan CT-Force dengan suasana baru.Dinosaurus Raptor  Raptor adalah dino karnivora yang larinya lumayan. Walau memiliki sedikit kemampuan (cakar dan gigit) namun susah sekali kabur bila menemukan dino ini.T-rex  T-REX adalah character DINO yang DIBUAT oleh bang EKO atau Incunya si ENDI.Udah tahu lah semua.

Buku kedua adalah Cinta Brontosaurus. Isinya berkisah tentang cerita cintanya waktu masih jadi makhluk bersel satu sampai ketika ia dimirip-miripin dengan Godzilla.

Dia juga terbawa fanatisme Pokemon sehingga ia menculik seorang murid SMA dan dipaksa untuk mengkomikkan KambingJantan. Maka lahirlah KambingJantan: Sebuah Komik Pelajar Bodoh berisi 5 bab yang kalau dibaca kagak bakalan puas, soalnya gambarnya ancur abis sehingga para fans dengan antusiasnya berusaha mereka ulang isi komik itu dengan Sotosop.

Bintang Porno adalah bintang paling terang di rasi bintang Hollywood, 25 tahun cahaya di utara rasi bintang Orion dan bintang nomor lima paling terang di langit malam. Bintang Porno ditemukan pada 5 Maret 1981 secara tidak disengaja oleh Dr. Boyke, yang ketika ia sedang melakukan studi tentang ritual mandi wanita-wanita sintal di sungai Gangga. Istrinya yang melihat hal itu segera meng-uppercut Dr. Boyke sehingga teleskopnya mengarah ke langit dan dari situ terlihatlah Bintang Porno.Reklasifikasi Sebagai Planet  Dari penelitian lebih lanjut oleh Dr. Long Kok cahaya di Bintang Porno mempunyai Spectral Mass yang berbeda dengan bintang lainnya. Sementara bintang pada umumnya memiliki kandungan Helium dan Hidrogen. Cahaya dari bintang porno ditemukan berasal dari gas Neon. Setelah dilakukan studi lebih lanjut, ditemukan bahwa Bintang Porno adalah sebuah planet yang bisa memancarkan cahayanya sendiri. Cahaya yang dipancarkan Bintang Porno berasal dari lampu-lampu di klub-klub malam yang menutupi seluruh permukaan planet tersebut.Permukaan  Secara geologis mempunyai inti berlendir dan mantel berbatu yang sebagian besar terdiri dari silikon. Kedua kutubnya (disebut dalam bahasa lokal sebagai kutub atas dan kutub bawah) di tutupi dengan es abadi yang menjadi tempat wisata populer para wisatawan. Seluruh permukaan bintang porno tertutup oleh pencakar langit yang tingginya mencapai beberapa kilometer termasuk permukaan yang dulunya adalah lantai samudra. Wilayah Bintang Porno dibagi secara horizontal menjadi kabupaten (yang bisa lebih besar dari negara umumnya di bumi), kecamatan, dan kelurahan. Sedangkan secara vertikal wilayah bintang porno dibagi menjadi enam distrik. Ungu, Biru, Hijau, Merah, Jingga, dan Kuning. Sebagian besar fasilitas yang ada di bintang porno adalah gedung hiburan yang melayani berbagai macam spesies asing, selain spesies manusia Bintang Porno.Makhluk-makhluk  Bintang Porno dihuni oleh makhluk hidup yang mirip dengan manusia bumi. Namun karena bintang porno sangatlah panas, makhluk-makhluk bintang porno tidak mengenal pakaian. Mereka hanya mengenakan penutup aurat yang oleh penduduk lokal disebut Sempaqqis. Selain penduduk pribumi bintang porno ada juga mahluk-mahluk dari planet lain yang mengunjungi planet ini.Teknologi  Teknologi di Bintang Porno jauh lebih maju dari tekonologi bumi. Mereka sudah mengenal teknologi teleportasi antar bintang yang di bumi masih hanya ada di karya fiksi ilmiah. Sayangnya teknologi tersebut masih belum sempurna sehingga ada beberapa makhluk dari Bintang Porno yang menggunakan teknologi teleportasi ini terdampar di sebuah planet tandus berteknologi rendah yang disebut bumi. Makhluk Bintang Porno yang telah terdampar di bumi diantara lain adalah: Maria Ozawa, Jimmy Wales dan Amingwati. Makhluk-makhluk Bintang Porno umumnya sangat berbakat dalam bidang perfilman sehingga mereka biasanya sukses sebagai aktor dan aktris.Efek terhadap Bumi  Menurut para ilmuwan, Bintang Porno memancarkan radiasi panas yang berbahaya karena dapat meningkatkan suhu di Bumi. Bahkan makhluk-makhluk bintang Porno sendiri dapat memancarkan radiasi panasnya sendiri. Orang-orang yang melihat makhluk Bintang Porno yang ada di bumi langsung berkeringat semua. Radiasi panas Bintang Porno merupakan salah satu penyebab terbesar dari Pemanasan Global. Diduga radiasi itu berasal dari kebiasaan makhluk Bintang Porno yang suka menyantap sambel uleg dan sambel petis.Penampakan  Bintang Porno dapat dilihat dari bumi dengan mata dan tubuh telanjang. Bintang Porno muncul sebagai salah satu bintang paling terang di angkasa yang berwarna merah. Ada kalanya anda dapat melihat pola berbentuk Celana dalam di permukaannya yang adalah sebuah benua terbesar di planet tersebut. Bintang Porno juga disukai oleh anggota-anggota cowok Topsport, terutama Jaran Salonan yang sangat hafal nama-nama bintang porno sampai ia memiliki sejumlah suvenir.Penampakan Dalam Sejarah  Sepanjang sejarah manusia telah melihat Bintang Porno dan terpikat oleh radiasi pesonanya sehingga mengabadikannya dalam simbol-simbol kehidupan mereka. Astronom-astronom Cina adalah penemu Bintang Porno yang pertama. Bahkan mereka juga dapat melihat keempat satelit yang mengelilinginya. Orang Cina kemudian menggunakan pemandangan tersebut dalam benderanya. Astronom Filipina juga telah melihat Bintang Porno, namun teknologi mereka gagal untuk melihat satelitnya yang keempat. Jadi mereka hanya menampilkan 3 satelit Bintang Porno dalam benderanya. Sedangkan teknologi astronomi Vietnam, Israel dan Maroko tidak berhasil menemukan satupun satelit dari Bintang Porno sehingga hanya menggunakan gambar bintang tunggal dalam benderanya. Bintang Porno juga tidak luput dari si mata juling Malaysia. Mereka mengambil desain Bintang Porno dan memakainya di bendera negara mereka yang juga dicuri dari Amerika. Kebiasaan ini kemudian ditiru oleh negara-negara lain seperti Azerbaijan, Pakistan dan Singapura. Presiden pertama Indonesia, Sukarno juga telah melihat Bintang Porno di malam ia menyusun Pancasila. Ia menggunakannya dalam Pancasila sebagai simbol sila pertama, Keuangan yang Maha Esa. Namun dari banyaknya manusia yang telah menemukan dan menggunakan Bintang Porno, Amerika Serikat adalah bangsa yang paling memuja Bintang Porno, terbukti dari mereka menggunakan Bintang Porno sampai 50 kali pada benderanya.Tolololpedia Amingwati  Whops, anda mungkin mencari Siamang atau Puput NB: selain PINGSAN, artikel ini juga bisa membuat anda MUNTAH. Juga berpotensi menyebabkan keguguran pada ibu-ibu hamil. Amingwati, seorang waria profesional, pengamen profesional, pengemis profesional, kader partai BPK (Bencong Pinggir Kali), artis, aktris, pendiri Extravaganza, tokoh masyarakat, berhala, selebriti tingkat dunia, fashion designer, anjing peliharaan, model, model bokep, model makanan anjing, sinden, penjual jamu, panutan masyarakat, seniman pornografi, pembuat pupuk kompos, penemu dari tanda tanya, pencipta Nasi Aking, Samsak tinju, penjual kain songket, penari perut, penari pinggang, penari kepala (ajeb-ajeb), penari striptis, penjual burqini, tukang pijat, tukang sedot septiktank, pemerkosa kambing bandot, dukun dan sering menuliskan pendapat-pendapatnya yang tidak penting dan tidak jelas di halaman-halaman Tolololpedia.Emitologi  Nama Amingwati berasal dari bahasa Yunani A (\u03b1) yang berarti tidak dan bahasa Thailand Ming (\u0e21\u0e35\u0e07\u0e4c) yang berarti rasa malu, yang digabung menjadi \u201cTidak punya kemaluan\u201d. Sedangkan Wati adalah gelar dari bahasa Indonesia yang berarti Waria Tingkat Tinggi. Hanya sedikit waria yang memiliki gelar ini, misalnya Cici Edrikawati, dan Sogiwati Kutilan. Fashion Sense Aming sudah diakui oleh kritikus fashion tingkat dunia, Madame Ivan. Banyak sekali artis-artis yang telah mengikuti mode berpakaian Amingwati, misalnya Olga Syahputri, Mulan Jameelah, orang-orang yang dikutip di atas, bencong-bencong Taman Lawang, bencong-bencong Dolly, Luna, monyet-monyet di kebun binatang Jakarta dan juga Kamu. Ia juga adalah anggota Extravaganza dengan IQ (Ih jijay Quotient), SQ (Somplax Quotient) dan EQ (yang sering kamu buang di toilet) tertinggi. Sebenarnya IQ, SQ dan EQ Amingwati biasa-biasa saja, hanya punya anggota Extravaganza lainnya yang kelewat jongkok.Kisah Hidup  Amingwati dilahirkan di hutan, yang bertepat di Bintang Porno, dari rahim seekor monyet Afrika yang dikirim NASA ke tempat itu. Karena terlahir dari seekor monyet, jenis kelamin Amingwati tidak jelas. Kemudian beberapa Datuk-Datuk datang dari Malaysia untuk bersafari dan mereka menemukan Amingwati sedang berak di atas pohon duren. Datuk-datuk tersebut mengira bahwa Amingwati adalah suatu spesies monyet yang baru, karena itu mereka memungut Amingwati dan membawanya ke Malaysia untuk diklaim.  Di Malaysia, Amingwati ditelantarkan. Ia menganggur sejak majikannya yang terakhir menyiramnya dengan air kencing kuda gara-gara Amingwati kebanyakan makan telek anjing, telek kambing, telek kuda, telek sapi, telek babi, telek kerbau, telek kucing dan telek ayam. Karena itu Aming pergi melancong ke Indonesia sebagai TKW (Tenaga Kerja Waria). Aming langsung jatuh cinta pada Indonesia pada pandangan yang pertama, setelah melihat betapa suburnya tanah Indonesia dan majunya pelacuran serta perbencongan di Indonesia. Iapun menjadi seorang WNI (Waria Negara Indonesia). Setelah bertahun-tahun mengamen di distrik lampu merah (perempatan jalan) Jakarta, iapun menjadi seorang waria yang sangat terkenal di kalangan para pengamen dan waria jalanan, sebab mereka telah terpikat oleh aura pesona Amingwati, atau mungkin karena Amingwati telah mengguna-gunai mereka. Ternyata, Amingwati pernah berkonsultasi dengan Mak Erot. Nasihat yang diberikan bertubi tubi dan membuat ia gak jelas. Dan pengobatannya pun mejadi malpraktek. Makanya sekarang dia jadi WNI jadi-jadian. Tetapi ketahuan oleh Satpol PP, dia menjadi WNTL (Warga Negara Taman Lawang)Karier  Amingwati memulai karirnya dengan cara menghimpun para pengamen-pengamen dan waria-waria jalanan di tempatnya bekerja dalam sebuah kelompok bernama Extravaganza=kelompok anak2 terlantar, yang bekerja sebagai penari-penari di klub-klub kabaret lokal. Selama itu Amingwati telah menciptakan berbagai macam jenis tarian antara lain: Tarian-tarian yang diciptakan Amingwati menjadi begitu populer dan merambah dunia internasional. Kelompok Extravaganza pun menjadi begitu terkenal dan kaya. Kesuksesan tersebut membuat pemilik stasiun TV TransmigranTV melirik Amingwati yang sedang mandi di WC umum didalam terminal bis umum sepertinya tidak umum. Ia kemudian menawarkan Amingwati untuk tampil TransmigranTV karena saat itu TransmigranTV sedang kekurangan model waria yang super menjijikkan. Amingwati, yang sudah memimpikan untuk tampil di TV sejak bayi pun dengan semangatnya menerima tawaran tersebut dan langsung berlari sekuat uratnya keluar dari bak mandi dengan telanjang dan berteriak \u201cEUREKA!!\u201d yang dalam bahasa Yunani berarti \u201cEmak, Aming masuk di TV!!\u201d  Maka sejak Amingwati dan rekan-rekannya dari kelompok Extravaganza tampil di TransmigranTV, karirnya melejit dan ia menjadi semakin kaya dan populer. Kini ia memiliki cukup uang untuk melakukan operasi plastik dan suntik silikon sampai 3 kali sehari. Kegemaran Amingwati adalah membaca majalah kelinci buatan Telek Tubles. Amingwati biasa membacanya 1-647856 kali sehari, makanya mukanya semakin \"bagus\" saja. Ternyata kegemaran Amingwati ini diikuti oleh para waria dan kambing. Makanya majalah kelinci ini semakin populer saja. Ia pernah mengikuti audisi Extravaganza, dan diterima oleh juri Olga Syahputri. Ia mengalahkan Mimi Hitam, maupun Pout Endah Suryo,salah satu keturunan Roy Suryo pada audisi itu, sehingga Mimi mengutuk Aming dan Olga menjadi makhluk tidak jelas. Puput juga meneposkan mereka. Namun, ia tetap diterima di Extravaganza dan bekerja di sana karena dizaman sekarang ini semua orang dijagat raya ini memang suka yang tidak jelas-tidak jelas, seperti burung belekok yang dijadikan simbol Jawa Barat, lebih parah lagi celana dalem jadi nama group band. 0,2 Julali...Julali...Prreeeettt!! 5102 SM (Selalu Mesum), Amingwati (merupakan salah satu banci asal Indonesia) pernah mengikuti parade orang-orang LGBT di New York, AS bersama para WN Amerika dan WNA dari luar negeri yang sedang menjalani hubungan (s*ks) dan menikah sesama jenis alias LGBT yang telah  dilegalkan oleh pemerintah Amerika, oleh presiden Obama (Orang-orang BAnci MAu kawin). Amingwati pernah memakan telek anjing, telek kambing, telek kuda, telek sapi, telek babi, telek ayam, telek kucing setiap 1.248.349.348 kali sehari. Ia juga membintangi sejumlah sinetron dan film-film terkenal di Indonesia antara lain: Amingwati juga sempat mewakili dirinya sendiri dalam kontes Ratu Waria Sejagad di  Amarta. Ia berhasil menyingkirkan peserta-peserta dari negara-negara lainnya seperti Alengka, dan Pringgadani bahkan tuan rumah Amarta dengan cara menyembunyikan wig dan baju dalam bersilikon mereka sebelum fashion show sehingga mereka terpaksa mengundurkan diri daripada harus tampil dengan kepala botak dan dada yang tepos. Sayangnya ia kalah dari Miss Waria Malaysia Elizabeth alias Alizah B. Hal ini karena Malaysia mengancam akan mengklaim bahwa budaya waria berasal dari negerinya (sebenarnya memang betul) jika tidak menjadi juara 1. Usaha Amingwati menyembunyikan wignya juga tidak berhasil karena ia mengakalinya dengan cara menggunakan jilbab untuk menutupi kepalanya yang botak dan panuan. Amingwati juga menekuni berbagai macam bidang pekerjaan lainnya, dari modelling sampai menjadi anjing peliharaan. Daftar pekerjaan Amingwati tidak akan cukup untuk dituliskan di sini, makanya gak perlu ditulis. Amingwati juga seorang maniak Miethuania, mi instan kelas wahid dari Dunia Gendeng. Ia menyukai segala jenis rasa Miethuania. Saking senangnya, Amingwati tidak bisa hidup tanpa Miethuania. Bahkan, sebelum tidur ia makan Miethuania 1/2 porsi. Saat ini Amingwati telah resmi bergabung dengan World Wrestling Entertainment(WWE) dan memulai debutnya sebagai pegulat Gay bernama The Pinky BoyHubungan-Hubungan Hubungan dengan Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  Amingwati tidak pernah tidur bersama presiden SBY, tepatnya di Manapun dia berada. Namun Amingwati tidurnya di rumahnya , sementara presiden SBY tidur di rumahnya. Jadi Amingwati dengan presiden SBY tidak ada hubungan sama sekali.Hubungan dengan Roy Suryo  Amingwati adalah adiknya Roy Suryo, Roy Suryo adalah produser musik yang paling  sampai 1 bulan bersama dengannya karena foto-foto Amingwati sering diedit-edit oleh Roy Suryo dan di upload ke Flickr atau Instagram. Akhirnya pada hari ke-32 Amingwati mengisi laptop Roy Suryo denjgan virus Trajong.Hubungan dengan George W. Bush  Amingwati tidak ada hubungan apa-apa dengan George W. Bush. Aming aja najis sama dia.Hubungan dengan Badutwi  Tidak ada hubungan. Karena Amingwati takut diklaim Badutwi.Hubungan Amingwati dengan Mbah Surip  Amingwati telah memberi perubahan besar dalam kehidupan mbah Surip. Konon(baca=menurut gosip) Amingwati adalah cinta pertama Mbah Surip. Mereka hanya pernah bertemu satu kali(saat itu Mbah Surip baru minum minuman keras 3 drum jadi dia agak mabok) tetapi kejadian itu terus menjadi kenangan indah bagi Mbah Surip. Sejak itu untuk mengenang cinta pertamanya, Mbah Surip selalu minum kopi. Akhirnya ia memilih mengakhiri hidupnya karena overdosis kopi(ia mengibaratkan kopi sebagai Amingwati jadi ia berpikir ia mati karena orang yang dia cintai). Cerita ini sangat romantis seandainya yang Mbah Surip cintai bukan Amingwati.Hubungan dengan Puput  Amingwati sempat menjadi ketua PolitHubungan dengan Orang Justin Bieber  Amingwati sempat diperkosa oleh pangeran malaysia dan akhirnya dia bunting. Sekarang anaknya sudah besar. Namanya justin bieber.Hubungan dengan Roman Bellic  Amingwati sering bertemu Roman Bellic disebuah diskotik di Algonquin. Sekarang suaminya Niko Bellic, karena Amingwati itu merupakan pacar Niko saat berkencan di restoran dan Roman juga galau.Sinetron Iklan  Sebagian dari iklan dibawah ini yang meranin bukan Amingwati, lho.Aming dalam berita  Templat:TokohSundaTolololpedia Indonesia  Indonesia adalah negara terkorup yang dihuni oleh para barbar dan goblin yang mayoritas hidup miskin, berpikir dan bersikeras bahwa mereka tinggal di sebuah negara yang telah maju yang katanya kaya sumber daya alam. Indonesia terkenal akan budaya korupsi, kemalasan, fanatisme, terorisme, kekerasan (terutama tawuran), kemiskinan, ketidakteraturan, ketidakdisiplinan, serta prostitusi (diskon lagi). Di Indonesia, orang akan rela berdesak-desakan mengorbankan nyawanya hanya untuk mendapatkan uang Rp10.000 atau berebut potongan daging kurban, macam orang tidak pernah makan selama seminggu. Setelah kegagalan program Keluarga Berencana (KB) sebagai instrumen pengendalian pertumbuhan penduduk, Indonesia mengandalkan buruknya manajemen transportasi pada musim mudik lebaran sebagai penggantinya, dimana setiap musim mudik lebaran, ratusan pemudik tewas dalam kecelakaan lalu-lintas. Meskipun Undang-Undang Dasar (UUD) 1945 telah menjamin kebebasan beragama bagi para penduduknya, namun elemen-elemen barbarian dan goblin yang menempati strata tersendiri dalam masyarakat Indonesia telah berhasil mengintimidasi dan melakukan tindak kekerasan atas nama agama, terhadap kelompok-kelompok lain yang dianggap 'sesat' atau 'kafir' dengan sangat kuatnya, sehingga mereka menjadi salah satu aktor pengendali negara ini, sebab pemerintah seringkali tidak mampu berbuat apa-apa, jangankan menjamin keamanan kelompok minoritas, menindak para barbarian ini pun negara tidak mampu. Istilah 'barbar' dan 'goblin' yang dirujuk kepada sebagian besar bangsa Indonesia memang tidak berlebihan, sebab mereka tidak memiliki kelayakan untuk hidup di dalam suatu negara modern dan maju, yang menempatkan penghargaan terhadap orang dan pihak lain sebagai nilai tertinggi kehidupan bermasyarakat, berbangsa, dan bernegara. Hal ini diperparah oleh maraknya korupsi yang dilakukan oleh para pejabatnya, dan maraknya kekerasan komunal, ketidakpatuhan terhadap hukum dan tata tertib, yang dilakukan oleh masyarakatnya. Indonesia, termasuk Bali, juga merupakan tujuan wisata populer selama musim liburan ketika para teroris pergi berlibur ke Australia (studi teroris kali). Bahkan selama musim puncak teroris (Januari-Desember), Indonesia tetap menjadi tujuan populer untuk tempat bunuh diri khususnya Jawakarta(dibom teroris). Terkadang para wisatawan yang berharap untuk bunuh diri bukan di bulan teroris membawa ganja di sepatu mereka.Sejarah  Penggalian arkeologi telah membuktikan bahwa Prasejarah Indonesia kebanyakan terdiri atas reruntuhan, kerangka tuyul bekas kanibalisme, pecahan gerabah, dan beberapa penemuan arkeologi yg bernama Pithechanthropus Wongdeso Javanicus. \"Peradaban\" negara kita dimulai saat raja pertama Indonesia, Gayus tiba-tiba berevolusi setelah keluar dari batu dalam bentuk kera sekitar tahun 300 SM,dan mendirikan kerajaan Indonesia. Raja Gayuslah yang menciptakan budaya korupsi. Nama Latinnya ialah Homo Gayuscus Gendengus.Zaman Kerajaan Indonesia I  Indonesia awalnya disatukan dibawah sebuah kerajaan bernama Kerajaan Indonesia. Kerajaan ini adalah tempat asal dari bahasa Jawa dan Babad Tanah Jawi. Raja-Rajanya adalah penumbuh budaya Korupsi dan Rakyat2nya sebenarnya merupakan Rakyat Tibet yg lari karena Everest Meletus dan berlari2 terus hingga mampir ke Jakarta. Salah satu Raja dari Indonesia mencoba untuk menambah Kebudayaan yg baru. Untuk itu, Indonesia mencoba untuk membeli Hal2 yg beragam dari India. Yaitu Taj Mahal, Kamasutra, Kari Ayam dan Bahkan Arsitektur yg berasal dari India. Kemudian Indonesia pun berjanji akan melunaskan Hutangnya pada Kaisar India. saat itu Ratu Mulan,Pendeta Kerajaan Indonesia memberi uang dan emas pada Management Service India yg bernama Sarukan,karena telah membuat kitabnya. Namun, Indonesia saat itu tentu saja telah menemukan dan mengembangkan ilmu korupsi] dan akhirnya tidak pernah membayar tagihan mereka, bahkan pura-pura tidak pernah menerimanya (wah, ini namanya air tuba dibalas air kencingnya Saptanu Andromeda Yuniar). Call center India terus-terusan menagih Indonesia untuk keterlambatan pembayaran mereka, tapi Indonesia menghindari tagihan dengan pura-pura tidak tahu-menahu, sambil maen GTA Tukulkarta. Pengkhianatan ini membuat bangkrut Kekaisaran India kuno, menyebabkan kemiskinan yang meluas di India dan berlanjut hingga hari ini. Akibatnya, Sarukan mengutuk Indonesia dengan mengatakan, bahwa bangsa Indonesia nantinya akan menjadi bangsa yang besar dan kaya sumber alam, namun penduduknya sebagian besar akan hidup miskin, dan Indonesia akan dilanda oleh bencana alam, kecelakaan, konflik berdarah, dan kekacauan terus-menerus. Anehnya, Indonesia dan India saat ini bekerja sama dalam Proyek Bomb Sex di mana populasi dari kedua negara berencana untuk berkembang biak tak terkendali sampai meledakkan bumi (sial, kan). Indonesia akhirnya menjadi sebuah pos perdagangan utama di dunia kuno, terutama untuk memfasilitasi perdagangan antara Kekaisaran Australia dan Kekaisaran Romawi. Kontak dengan Indonesia membuat kerajaan-kerajaan itu menjadi bangkrut, karena ya...itulah kebiasaan korup orang indonesia... Bahkan yang lebih parah, Australia kembali ke zaman ketololan karena ulah Indonesia. Komoditi utama dari Indonesia saat itu termasuk rempah-rempah (cengkeh, ganja, ketumbar dan spice girls) dan tenaga kerja atau bahasa halusnya babu, budak, dan sebagainya.Zaman Kerajaan Indonesia II  saat tahun 1200an,Indonesia dipimpin Wangsa Majapahit,yg bernama Gajah Mada dan Ayam Wuruk(samanya aja binatang),ia menguasai Kekaisaran Australia,Tanah Tarakan dan Madurapura,kemudian Indonesia rontok diakibatkan Gajah Mada jatuh dari kasurnya,dan Indonesia gempa yg selesai dengan kedatangan Portugis dan kematian Ayam WurukKolonialisme Belanda  Tertarik dengan iming-iming babu gratisan, bakiak yang terbuat dari kayu eksotis dan perempuan bohay tanpa puting yang seukuran hamburger, Belanda berusaha untuk menyerang Indonesia dengan menggunakan kapal bertenaga kincir angin yang akhirnya malah terbalik dan tenggelam. Para pelaut Belanda tenggelam juga, karena mereka memakai sepatu kayu. Setelah beralih memakai kapal RMS buatan Amerika dan sepatu Nike mereka, Belanda akhirnya bisa menaklukkan Indonesia, mendirikan Hindia Belanda untuk memonopoli obat dan perdagangan seks. Berikut adalah pengumuman yang dikeluarkan oleh Belanda saat bulan-bulan awal pendudukan mereka di Indonesia:Kolonial Inggris  Inggris mencoba mengkoloni Indonesia, dengan dipimpion oleh Alizah B., walau akhirnya diserahkan balik ke Belanda karena Inggris menyadari bahwa tak ada gunanya untuk mendidik para pribumi Indonesia yang barbar dengan ajaran mereka yang santun.Punjajahan Japan  Japan, mundeportashi banyaku sukari gadeisu Indoneshia untuku purubudakan sekusuaru (ianfu).

Dengan demikian, Pantjasila poen didjadikan sebagai dasar negara kita, dan ramai-ramai rakjat merajakan kemerdekaan Indonesia dengan makan ajam goreng. Pada saat itoe djoega didirikan restoran ajam goreng pertama di Indonesia jaitoe Century Fried Chicken. Akan tetapi, pengaruh dari McDonalds meroentoehkan ideologi Pantjasila, dan kini ideologi Pantjasila jang asli telah ditinggalkan, dan sekarang diklaim oleh Malajsia lewat Oepien dan Ipien.Orde Baru  Karena sekarang Pak Soekarno telah menjadi otaku, beliau lebih banyak menghabiskan waktu sendirian untuk mengagumi karya seni asli Jepang, bermain game online seharian, dan mengoleksi berbagai Figma dan Revoltech, dan bukannya mengelola bangsa Indonesia yang baru lahir, sehingga kualitas kepemimpinannya jatuh. PBB mengeluarkan Indonesia dari keanggotaan mereka pada tahun 1960 karena merasa risih (dan karena tidak bagi-bagi print scan komik hentai). Soekarno bukannya sadar malah mengejek Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa dengan memanggil mereka Perserikatan Bangsat-Bangsat. PBB tidak senang dan mulai mengabaikan Indonesia sepenuhnya. Soekarno, karena merasa menyesal kemudian memerintahkan Tong Sam Cong dan murid-muridnya menjajah Irian Barat pada tahun 1961 sebagai usaha mati-matian untuk menarik perhatian internasional lagi ke Indonesia. Biaya untuk penjajahan itu sangat mahal (karena Soekarno juga menyewa Keroro Shotai tentunya) sehingga menyebabkan ekonomi Indonesia mengalami hiperinflasi, dan kualitas pimpinan Soekarno malah makin anjlok (kasian Pak Soekarno). Pada tahun 1965, Indonesia secara ideologis terbagi dua antara kaum monarkis dan komunis. Kaum monarkis ingin mengembalikan Kerajaan Indonesia ke zaman kejayaan Surya Tatamungil dan memahkotai titisan raja pertama Indonesia Java Man, yaitu Soeharto sebagai raja dari dinasti Orde Baru, sementara kaum komunis membentuk G30S/PKI dan bermaksud untuk menggulingkan Sukarno dari kediktatoran Pancasila dan menggabungkan Indonesia ke Uni Soviet. Para penganut Pancasila yang setia kepada Soekarno, hanya terdiri dari kaum minoritas dan politisi pada waktu itu. Indonesia juga dilanda kekacau balauan yg diakibati Tun Bedur Aman yg ingin memborong banyak harta Budaya klaiman dari Indonesia,tapi akhirnya Tun Bedur Aman meminta Elizabeth II untuk membuat SAS(Organisasi santet) yg membunyikan sinyal Voodo,tapi Indonesia memilih untuk melakukannya dengan Santet yg akhirnya Indonesia mengirimkan DN Aidit ke Malaysia untuk menyelidikinya,tapi begonya DN Aidit malah mengkampanyekan Malaysia kembali Malaysia ke Zaman Surya Tatamungil yg berani Membayar uang ganti rugi karen Malaysia telah salah evolusi,Tapi akhirnya DN Aidit dan temannya Sahrul ditangkap di Kuching atas Perintah Tun Bedur Aman(Kan Malaysia bukan diperintah Surya Tatamungil,tapi kan diperintah ama Bomoh yg dipertu(k)an(g) (j)Agung) Pada bulan Mei 1965, diam-diam di bawah komando Soeharto, para kaum komunis Indonesia berupaya melakukan Pelacuran, memperkosa tujuh jenderal terkemuka Indonesia. Soeharto juga mengutus batalyon tentara monarkis yang mengalahkan pemberontakan komunis dalam waktu dua hari dan satu malam. Kedua kaum, komunis dan monarkis tidak pernah sadar kalau mereka diadu domba oleh Soeharto. Soekarno kemudian mengeluarkan deklarasi resmi Supersemar, dinamai berdasarkan pahlawan Semar dari cerita rakyat Indonesia. Tadinya Soekarno ingin menamainya SuperPetruk agar biar Ajigile, tetapi langsung diancam rajam oleh rakyat. Supersemar meresmikan pensiunnya Soekarno dari kediktatoran, serta pemulihan monarki Indonesia. Soeharto yang licik pun berhasil mejalankan rencananya untuk dinobatkan menjadi raja baru Indonesia. Penasehat Soeharto memperingatkan bahwa komunisme dan kapitalisme adalah ideologi asing berbahaya yang hanya bisa tergoyahkan oleh ideologi asli korupsi. Soeharto kemudian menyatakan pembentukan sebuah bangsa baru yang ambisius dan didedikasikan untuk mempromosikan ideologi korupsi di seluruh negeri. Negara ini pun berganti nama menjadi Kerajaan Orde Baru. Dengan dukungan populer, kaum komunis Indonesia di seluruh negara ini langsung dieksekusi, dan terbukti hasilnya efektif mengurangi jumlah penduduk Indonesia sebesar 30%. Selain itu Kerajaan orde baru mewajibkan agar setiap anak mudanya untuk mendengarkan lagu-lagu Rolling Stones dengan harapan setelah mendengarkan lagu tersebut melecut semangat patriotisme dalam bertani dan bercocok tanam.Krisis 1998 dan Era Reformasi  Krisis ini dikarenakan Tukulnesia yg ingin merdeka dan menghipnotis Para Mahasiswa untuk Tembak2an di depan Gedung DPR dan ikut serta menjadi Jemaah Katrokkiyyah. Belum lagi bertambah masalah karena Badutwi ingin mengklaim Monas. Akhirnya Soeharto pun Pusing untuk mengurus Negara dan Membawanya ke Jalan Kebenaran , setelah itu Soeharto pun terperayu dengan kedatangan Paha Bibi dan Untuk hal itu, Soeharto pun terpaksa menyerahkan jabatan ke Paha Bibi dan biarlah Paha Bibi yg membawa Indonesia ke Surga.Geografi Status Negara Kepulauan  Indonesia adalah negara kepulauan terbesar di dunia yang terdiri dari 17.508 pulau, dengan empat belas diantaranya dihuni manusia. Dengan populasi sebesar 222 juta jiwa pada tahun 2006, Indonesia adalah negara berpenduduk terbesar keempat di dunia dan negara yang berpenduduk Muslim terbesar di dunia tapi penduduknya tetap mempraktekkan korupsi, kolusi, dan nepotisme serta mengupdate video porno secara berkala. Bentuk pemerintahan Indonesia adalah Republik walau nyata-nyata dipimpin oleh diktator, dengan Dewan Penipu Rakyat, Dewan Pengeruk-uang Daerah dan Presiden yang dipilih langsung oleh lembaga survei pemilu. Tugas mereka tidak lain adalah korupsi, membagi kekuasaan dengan teman-teman dan keluarga, memakai fasilitas negara sesuka hati, dan membenarkan setiap tindak-tanduknya agar tetap dipandang baik oleh rakyat. Ibukota negara ialah Jawakarta. Indonesia berbatasan dengan Malaysia di Pulau Kalimantan, dengan Papua Nugini di Pulau Papua dan dengan Timor Leste di Pulau Timor. Negara tetangga lainnya adalah Singapura, Filipina, Australia, dan wilayah persatuan Kepulauan Andaman dan Nikobar di India. Dari Sabang sampai Jakarta, Indonesia sudah terdiri dari berbagai suku, bahasa dan agama yang berbeda, kalau terus sampai Merauke keanekaragaman tersebut malah terlalu berlebihan maka yang di timur itu dipaksa ikut sama yang ada di Jakarta. Suku Jawa adalah grup etnis terbesar dan secara politis paling dominan karena merupakan eksportir TKI terbesar dibandingkan sukubangsa lainnya. Semboyan nasional Indonesia, \"Bhinneka tunggal ika\" (\"Boneka Hilang Satu\"), berarti keberagaman berarti penguasa bisa seenaknya. Selain memiliki populasi padat dan wilayah yang luas, Indonesia memiliki wilayah alam yang mendukung tingkat keanekaragaman hayati terbesar kedua di dunia tapi sudahlah, itu nggak berguna buat menambah kesejahteraan penduduknya.Etimologi  Kata \"Indonesia\" berasal dari kata dalam bahasa Latin yaitu Indus yang berarti \"India\" dan kata dalam bahasa Yunani nesos yang berarti \"rumah bordil\". Jadi, kata Indonesia berarti wilayah kepulauan yang penuh dengan rumah bordil, atau rumah bordil yang berada di India, yang menunjukkan bahwa sebelum Indonesia menjadi negara berdaulat banyak bisnis rumah bordil yang ada di negara kita ini. Pada tahun 1850, George Earl, seorang pakar pornomatika ternama (yang merupakan inspirasi om Roy Suryo), menuliskan nama negara kita di media Hindia Belanda tidak menggunakan kata Indonesia, tetapi istilah Kepulauan Melayu (Maleische Archipel), karena beliau meramalkan bahwa di masa depan negara kita akn terjadi peng-klaiman besar-besaran oleh Malaysia. Murid dari Earl, James Richardson Logan, menggunakan kata Indonesia sebagai sinonim dari Kepulauan India, karena pada saat itu dia dibingungkan oleh banyaknya rumah bordil ala India di negara kita. Nlinde, atau Nlondhoh Indee (istilah ini diperkenalkan tahun 1860 dalam novel stensil Max Havelaar (1859), ditulis oleh Butatuli) juga digunakan oleh para orang Belanda yang melihat bahwa rakyat kita telah terkena demam Western Invasion yang dilakukan Raffles dan konco-konconya Westlife dan Backstreet Boys serta Tingle dari Super SM*SH Bros.. Sejak tahun 1900, nama Indonesia menjadi lebih umum pada lingkungan akademik di luar Belanda, dan golongan nasionalis Indonesia menggunakannya untuk ekspresi politik karena mereka malu-malu menyebut negara ini Republik van Java. Adolf Bastian dari Universitas Berlin memasyarakatkan nama ini melalui majalah porno Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels (Perek Indonesia incest dengan perek Malaysia), 1884\u20131894. Pelajar Indonesia pertama yang menggunakannya ialah Suwardi Suryaningrat (Ki Hajar Dewantara), yaitu ketika ia mendirikan kantor berita di Belanda yang bernama Indonesisch Pers Bureau di tahun 1913. Sayang, pada saat itu bahasa yang digunakan Ki Gebuk Dewantara adalah Java Programming yang sangat rumit sehingga orang-orang belanda yang mendengarnya langsung terjun dari jurang atau jalan sambil nabrak tiang listrik. Indonesia menjalankan pemerintahan republik presidensial multipartai yang koruptis dan diktatoris. Seperti juga di negara-negara demokrasi lainnya, sistem politik di Indonesia didasarkan pada Trias Politika yaitu kekuasaan legislatif, eksekutif, dan yudikatif namun ada kekuasaan terselubung yang dinamakan Mafia yang sering berbentuk Makelar Pemerintahan. Kekuasaan legislatif dipegang oleh sebuah lembaga abal-abal minus kerjaan bernama Majelis Penipu Rakyat (MPR) yang setelah Amandemen UUD 1945 terdiri dari DPR dan DPD. MPR saat ini diketuai oleh Taufik Kiemas, tukang mpekmpek Palembang. DPR saat ini diketuai oleh Marzuki Alie, tukang tipu & politisi karbitan, sedangkan DPD saat ini diketuai oleh Irman Gusman, pedagang kaki lima besar suara doang. Lembaga eksekutif berpusat pada presiden, wakil presiden, dan kabinet. Kabinet di Indonesia adalah Kabinet Presidensial sehingga para menteri bertanggung jawab kepada presiden dan tidak mewakili partai politik yang ada di parlemen. Meskipun demikian, Presiden saat ini yakni Susi-olo Mbambang Uooyono yang diusung oleh Partai Demoberkarat juga menunjuk sejumlah pemimpin Partai Politik yang rata-rata penjilat untuk duduk di kabinetnya. Tujuannya untuk menjaga stabilitas pemerintahan mengingat kuatnya posisi lembaga legislatif di Indonesia. Namun pos-pos penting dan strategis umumnya diisi oleh menteri tanpa portofolio partai (berasal dari seseorang yang dianggap ahli dalam bidangnya dan tentu saja mendukung iklim korupsi dan nepotisme). Lembaga Yudikatif sejak masa reformasi dan adanya amandemen UUD 1945 dijalankan oleh Mahkamah Agung, Komisi Yudisial, dan Mahkamah Konstitusi, termasuk pengaturan administrasi para hakim. Meskipun demikian keberadaan Menteri Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia tetap dipertahankan kalau dibahas di media massa.Pemerintahan  Birokrasi Indonesia dinilai oleh Organisasi Perdagangan Dunia, WTO, sebagai yang paling efisien dan efektif di dunia, terutama dalam penanggulangan masalah korupsi. Mereka memberikan prestasi sangat hebat dengan menangkap ribuan tersangka korupsi. Tentu saja setelahnya mereka dilepaskan kembali, karena yang disyaratkan WTO dalam penilaian ini hanya prestasi menangkap para tersangka korupsi. Adalah hal sangat tidak efisien mengadili para koruptor karena dengan demikian seluruh penegak hukum, penuntut, pengacara, dan pengadil terpaksa berpindah ke kursi terdakwa. Hal ini membuat proses peradilan menjadi berbelit-belit dan tidak pernah tuntas. Tentu tidak efisien sekali mengurus Berita Acara Pemeriksaan sekaligus membuat pledoi. Baru-baru ini dibentuk sebuah kementerian, yaitu Kementerian Pemercepat Penghancuran Negara Dengan Terorisme, Korupsi, Kolusi, Nepotisme, dan Uang Sehingga Negara Ini Kembali Menjadi Negara Terkorup Sepanjang Masa Mengalahkan Filipina dan Negara Koruptor Kelas Kakap Lainnya(KPPNDTKKNUSNIKMNTSMMFNKKKL) untuk merebut kembali posisi negara terkorup. Indonesia memiliki sebuah negara tandingan yang bernama republik mimpi. negara tandingan ini dipimpin oleh pemimpin yang sama yaitu SBY. Masih belum diketahui apakah mereka berdua sama-sama berasal dari Surabaya, namun SBY presiden republik mimpi merupakan singkatan dari \"Si Butet Yogya\" sehingga mungkin dia berasal dari Yogyakarta. Republik Mimpi ini lebih berbahaya daripada partai oposisi manapun dan mempunyai daya saing yang tinggi, sebab masyarakat lebih banyak menertawai Republik Mimpi ini daripada Republik Indonesia. Sampai-sampai Menteri Informasi Indonesia meminta secara pribadi pada Pemerintah Republik Mimpi agar mengubah bentuk negara mereka menjadi Kerajaan. DPR/MPR di Indonesia juga memiliki sebuah lembaga tandingan yang bernama DemoCrazy. Belum ada klarifikasi dari kedua belah pihak, apakah kedua-duanya memiliki banyak perbedaan. Atau sama saja.Demokrasi  Pihak Barat sebagai tempat munculnya paham demokrasi sangat mengagumi perkembangan demokrasi di Indonesia. Bangsa Indonesia sangat kreatif dalam memahami dan mengembangkan demokrasi sehingga melebihi kemampuan pihak Barat dalam pelaksanaannya. Hal ini terlihat dari sangat banyaknya protes massal dan jalan-jalan yang diblokir. Tentu saja bisa dimaklumi karena bangsa Indonesia memiliki kemampuan yang tidak dimiliki oleh Barat, yaitu memandang dari sisi lain. Kata demokrasi bisa sedikit dipelesetkan menjadi demo-crazy atau terjemahan bebasnya gila demo. \"Democrazy\" dianggap ilmiah oleh kebanyakan masyarakat Indonesia. Saking ilmiahnya tidakan ini, sangat banyak demo yang tidak digubris, atau dibiarkan berlalu begitu saja. Hal ini sama dengan ungkapan Anjing menggogong, kafillah ndak digigit. Selain itu, demokrasi dan atau democrazy, di Indonesia hari ini sedang di teliti oleh pihak Barat, untuk mereka kembangkan di negara-negara mereka. Terlebih lagi, MalingSia yang sedang merencana akan mempatenkan Democrazy ini. Muncul pertanyaan di sebagian kalangan, apakah memang demokrasi cocok untuk bangsa Indonesia. Mekanisme demokratis antara lain pemilihan umum dilaksanakan di seluruh daerah guna memilih gubernur, bupati dan walikota. Pada pelaksanaannya, pemilu kepala daerah sering menimbulkan kerusuhan, konflik berdarah dan kekacauan yang kadang menimbulkan korban jiwa. Ada pengamat yang sinis, yang menilai bahwa bangsa Indonesia belum siap berdemokrasi, yang pada intinya adalah menghargai pihak lain yang menang sekaligus mengakui kekalahan. Bahkan ada yang menyebut bahwa memberi demokrasi kepada rakyat Indonesia bagaikan memberi pisau kepada sekumpulan monyet. Hasilnya sama, yaitu penyalahgunaan alat-alat tersebut, yang pada akhirnya berbahaya dan mengancam keselamatan dan keamanan pihak lain.Militer  Mungkin tentara Indonesia digunakan untuk mem-bully militer negara tetangga seperti Australia, Malaysia, Timor Timur, Papua Barat, Aceh, dan Singapura. Anehnya, saat berhadapan dengan Allied Force, Indonesia-Tan akan langsung menyembah-nyembah: \"Sumimasen...Amerika-Sama....sakjane kulo nek iso mbayarke utang kulo sesuk...sumimasen desu kara...\". Tentara Indonesia, bernama ABRI (Assasin dan Bandit Republik Indonesia), yang paling dikenal untuk jasa mereka menyelamatkan dan membuat nyaman rakyat Indonesia, di ranjang. Militer Indonesia juga terkenal sebagai militer yang memiliki alat utama sistem persenjataan (alutsista) yang berkualitas rendah, mulai dari pesawat tempur yang tidak dapat digunakan untuk berperang, periskop kapal selam yang rusak, sampai dengan mesin kendaraan perang yang dikanibal. Hal ini disebabkan oleh minimnya anggaran pertahanan Indonesia, yang tidak mampu memenuhi kebutuhan minimal untuk mempertahankan wilayah Indonesia yang sangat luas. Ironisnya, anggaran pertahanan Singapura yang ukuran negaranya hanya seluas Provinsi DKI Jakarta pun lebih tinggi daripada anggaran pertahanan Indonesia. Mengenai masalah anggaran pertahanan ini, Indonesia mengalami kesulitan bahkan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan minimal, sebab memang APBN kita secara nominal terlalu kecil untuk membiayai negeri ini, apalagi ditambah dengan kebiasaan korupsi para pejabat kita, yang kabarnya kini fee untuk mereka sudah harus dimasukkan terlebih dahulu kedalam mata anggaran. Penambahan pada alokasi anggaran tertentu akan berarti mengurangi jatah korupsi para pejabat. Komando Pasukan Khusus (Kopassus) adalah satuan militer terhebat yang dimiliki Indonesia, yang prestasi utamanya adalah menculik dan membunuh jutaan penjahat, aktivis politik, dan orang-orang yang dianggap mencurigakan. Satpol PP juga adalh militer terkuat yang dimiliki indonesia, tetapi tentu saja tidak akan menandingi FPI dan Banci dalam hal tawuran. Dukun adalah pemimpin para militer di Indonesia, dengan super majik spell-nya akan membuat semua orang tewas seketika.Bahasa  Tidak ada yang tahu pasti bahasa nasional kita. Bahasa Indonesia? kelihatannya tidak juga. Banyak sekali yang membuat aliran sesat dalam penggunaan bahasa kita. Bahasa 4L4Y, sok Nihongo, sok English, mungkin itulah sebenarnya bahasa nasional kita. Bahasa 4L4Y:H4L0 54Y4N6!! Bahasa Minangkabau: Bahasa Kaskus:' PERTAMAXXXX GAN!!!!! Broken English: Dipraktekkan oleh orang-orang yang gemar menonton Top GearTube8. Susah bagi orang asing, khususnya Inggris atau Amerika untuk memahami Broken English versi kita. \"Hei, gud murnin' serrr....wot ar ya duin' hier...yes..no...ahhhh...yesss...no...ffuuuuccckkk....\". Erroneous Japanese: Siapa lagi yang mempraktekkannya kalu bukan para otaku dari Otakuland. Bahasa Jepang yang mereka gunakan biasanya sangat bagus, sayang mereka melakukannya sambil oral sex sehingga terdengar gibberrish dan susah memahaminya. '\"gomenasai....aishiteru yo...aishiteru yo...\".Demografi  Menurut sensus penduduk 2010, Indonesia memiliki populasi sekitar 237 juta jiwa dan diperkirakan pada tahun 2016 berpenduduk 265.130.000 juta saking rajinnya masyarakat kita bereproduksi.Grup penduduk  Grup etnik yang berada di negara kita sangat beragam, contohnya:Penduduk  Mayoritas penduduk Indonesia adalah Wong Ndeso. Dikarenakan hanya sebagian kecil penduduk yang tinggal di kota besar ataupun berpenghasilan seperti Wong Kota. Komposisi penduduk di Indonesia adalah sebagai berikut\u00a0:Berdasarkan Usia  Dilihat dari usianya maka penduduk di Indonesia bisa dibedakan menjadi:Berdasarkan Berat Berdasarkan Penghasilan Berdasarkan kehebatan melakukan operasi plastik Berdasarkan preferensi seksual  Yang aslinya: Versi asli terbaru (2006-2010)Kendala-Kendala Penduduk Indonesia Ekonomi  Secara kehidupan ekonomi, sebagian besar masyarakat Indonesia (sekitar 75%) hidup di bawah garis kemiskinan, pada garis kemiskinan, dan berbaring di atas garis kemiskinan. Mereka yang berpendidikan rendah dan miskin ini juga sangat gemar menggunakan kata makian \"Anjing!\" dalam kehidupan sehari-hari mereka, meskipun banyak diantara mereka yang biaya hidup dan taraf hidupnya tidak lebih baik daripada seekor anjing ras peliharaan orang-orang kaya yang tinggal di kawasan elit perkotaan dan pinggir kota di kota-kota besar seperti Jakarta, Surabaya, dan Medan. Biaya makan dan salon untuk seekor anjing ras peliharaan orang-orang kaya di Indonesia dalam waktu satu bulan misalnya, lebih tinggi daripada gaji kepala keluarga sebagian besar keluarga Indonesia. Beruntung bagi Indonesia, sebab ada sebagian rakyatnya yang kreatif dalam mencari peluang usaha, sehingga mampu menjadi wirausahawan mandiri yang tidak tergantung pada pemerintah, atau tergantung pada Upah Minimum Regional (UMR), seperti rekan-rekan mereka yang menjadi buruh, yang untuk menuntut kenaikan UMR sebesar satu rupiahpun, berisiko dipecat dari pekerjaannya, atau menghadapi pentungan polisi, yang sebetulnya kesejahteraannya juga buruk. Pada tingkat pemerintahan/kebijakan di bidang ekonomi, pemerintah Indonesia tidak lebih dari panitia pelaksana kepentingan Amerika Serikat (AS) dan lembaga-lembaga punggawa kapitalisme dunia (yang tentunya disetir oleh kepentingan nasional AS), seperti Bank Dunia dan IMF. Indonesia dipaksa untuk mengikuti arus perdagangan bebas, yang sering didengung-dengungkan akan menciptakan daya saing ekonomi Indonesia yang pada akhirnya menciptakan kesejahteraan rakyat, namun pada praktiknya semakin menempatkan lapisan besar masyarakat miskin Indonesia kedalam kasta paria. Masyarakat kelas bawah tidak mampu mengakses layanan kesehatan dan pendidikan yang mahal, yang diserahkan begitu saja kepada mekanisme pasar, sementara penduduk Indonesia tidak difasilitasi negara dengan jaminan sosial. Oleh karena itu, terdapat ironi yang disimpulkan kedalam ungkapan 'jangan jadi orang miskin di Indonesia', atau 'orang miskin di Indonesia dilarang sakit', dan sebagainya. Dari sisi ekonomi menunjukkan, bahwa nasionalisme orang Indonesia yang terkenal sangat tinggi ternyata sekadar berada pada tataran wacana atau 'di mulut doang'. Sentimen anti-Malaysia yang didengungkan dalam bentuk slogan 'Ganyang Malaysia!' dimentahkan oleh kenyataan bahwa banyak orang Indonesia berbondong-bondong mencari makan di negeri jiran tersebut sebagai tenaga kerja kasar terutama pembantu rumah tangga, dan malah terbukti bahwa Indonesia-lah yang kena ganyang oleh Malaysia melalui para majikan Malaysia yang menganiaya pembantu rumah tangga Indonesia mereka. Ada yang dipukul, ditendang, diseterika dan disiram air panas. Namun orang-orang yang pergi menghamba ke Malaysia ini tetap masih lebih mencintai ringgit Malaysia daripada bendera merah-putih. Hal ini wajar-wajar saja, mengingat nilai mata uang rupiah yang rendah, serendah harga diri bangsa Indonesia. Salah satu sektor penting yang menggerakkan perekonomian Indonesia adalah sektor jasa seks, yang dibagi lagi menjadi jasa prostitusi dan jasa pijat plus-plus, yang ujung-ujungnya ya prostitusi terselubung juga. Meski tidak pernah diukur, namun diyakini bahwa jasa-jasa ini berkontribusi sebesar 30% dari Produk Domestik Bruto (PDB) Indonesia sebesar US$989 miliar, meskipun tentu saja, ini tidak pernah dihitung atau diukur secara resmi oleh para analis (bukan 'ahli anal' lho ya!) dan ekonom.Ekspor Impor Budaya  Seperti yang kita ketahui, Indonesia memiliki budaya yang sangat banyak. Dan seiring dengan waktu, budaya Indonesia pun menjadi bertambah banyak Berikut adalah budaya-budaya yang terkenal di Indonesia:Tolololpedia Pemuatan  Berikut ini adalah daftar artikel-artikel yang dianggap sangat lucu, atau lucu, atau artikel yang dibuat oleh anak orang sangat menasihati. Artikel-artikel berikut juga dapat dimuat di Halaman utama.Game Negara Artikel gak maksud Politik Film  Templat:TopsportTolololpedia Naruto  kontol (\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8, Naruto) adalah manga yang dikarang oleh Masashi Kishimoto setelah beliau terlalu banyak menonton acara Ninja Warrior.

Anime Naruto adalah anime terbaik di dunia maupun di bulanStory Arc Prologue  Sekitar tiga belas tahun sebelum cerita ini, muncul monster anjing jengking berdubur 9 atau Kyuubi. Kyuubi dimanfaatkan oleh anggota FPI bernama Madara Uchiha untuk menghancurkan desa Konohagakure akibat penduduknya menolak desa mereka dijadikan tempat syuting acara religi. Lalu munculah Hokage (Sultan Keraton Api) ke-4 bernama Minato Namikaze. Ia mengajak serigala itu bermain petak umpet dan nonton bokep bersama. Karena serigala itu selalu ketemu saat bersembunyi dan selalu cepet keluar saat nonton bokep, ia akhirnya bersembunyi di perut Naruto yang baru lahir. Kemudian Yondaime memanfaatkan hal itu dengan cara menyegel binatang malang itu di dalam perut Naruto.Awal  Naruto Uzumaki atau yang bernama samaran Sunarto Bin Uzumaki adalah seorang murid ninja biasa, hingga suatu hari Seorang Jounin bernama Kakashi Hatake yang menjadi ketua tim 7 disuruh Hokage untuk memasukkan Naruto dan kedua temannya ke tim 7 agar nantinya berlomba membakar rumah dengan kelompok lain dalam rangka pemilihan Hokage. kelompok pemenang akan mendapatkan sebuah buku 1001 jurus & 1001 sihir yang dapat diisi dan difotokopi seenak perutnya.

Tapi kemudian Orochimaru menghancurkan tempat ujian chunin untuk dijadikan panti pijat.Ketua Jendral tertinggi ke-3 lalu bertarung dengan Orochimaru dan berhasil menjilat tangan Orochimaru sehingga tidak bisa digunakan.Namun karena rasanya Super tidak enak 68% pahit dan 32% beracun, Sarutobi(Gubernur ke-3) meninggal akhirat. Hahahaha,,Perginya Sasuke  Naruto dan murid lainnya,kembali mengikuti misi(operasi militer) dan berlatih(ilmu sihir).Namun Sasuke kurang puas dengan misinya dan latihannya itu sehinngga ia membiarkan dirinya ditodong ke markas Orochimaru.Naruto yang kehilangan temannya itu mengejar Sasuke dan membawa temannya.Namun ditengah perjalanan Naruto dihadang ninja mesum dari desa Bunyi, akhirnya Naruto digantikan Lee & Gaara melawan Kimimaro dan Naruto melawan Sasuke,Neji melawan Kidoumaru,Tayuya melawan Shikamaru & Temari,Jirobou melawan Chouji,Sakon melawan Kiba & Kankuro. Semuanya menang dan berhasil melumpuhkan semua lawannya kecuali naruto kalah karena Sasuke menghomoinya (Mengguna-gunainya) terlebih dahulu.Kembalinya Naruto dari Dunia Gendeng  Naruto yang diajak Jiraiya ke salah satu panti pijat terbesar di dunia yang bernama Dolly terletak di Dunia Gendeng akhirnya kembali setelah 3 tahun lamanya.Tapi Naruto tidak lama di Kononha sebab Garaa ditodong Akatsuki untuk diperkosa bijuunya.Naruto dan timnya bersama tim Lee pergi ke Sunagakure untuk merampas Gaara.Setelah mendapat informasi markas panti pijat Akatsuki, Naruto dan timnya bersama Nenek Chiyo pergi ke markasnya.Setelah Sakura dan Nenek Chiyo menang dan mengeklaim semua senjatanya Sasori, ketika melawan sasori, sakura nyaris tewas karena sasori saking nafsunya masukinnya. sedangkan Deidara tangannya patah akibat Kakashi dan kabur ke bunker. Nenek Chiyo menyembuhkan(menghidupkan) Garaa, tetapi Nenek Chiyo meninggal akibat doping.Naruto vs Orochimaru  Naruto,Sakura,Sai(pengganti homo Sasuke),dan Yamato(pengganti Kakashi) pergi ke tempat pertemuan(homoan) Orochimaru dan Sasuke menurut informasi dari Sasori.Yamato menyamar menjadi Sasori tapi ketahuan oleh Kabuto yang telah biasa berhomoan dengan Sasori.Akhirnya terjadi pernikahan.Naruto marah karena Orochimaru tidak memberi tahu dan dimana Sasuke karena Orochimaru makan lontong pedas. Naruto akhirnya menjadi Kyuubi berekor 4,perhomoan sengit pun dimulai. Yamato mencoba menyegel Kyuubi dengan mantra titisan Bayu Gendeng dan berhasil. Orochimaru dan Kabuto kabur ke tempat persembunyiannya di gunung merapi.Hidan dan Kakuzu  Pasangan homo ini ditugaskan pemimpin Akatsuki untuk menodong orang khusus untuk dijual ke panti pijat. Tsunade(Ratu Keraton Konoha ke-5) mengetahuinya dan menugaskan Shikamaru dkk untuk menghentikan aksi bejat dari duo Hidan Kakuzu. Setelah perhomoan sengit, Hidan berhasil mengutuk Asuma dengan jurus terlarang Mak Erot sehingga penyakit(Gila)nya pindah ke Asuma dan akhirnya Asuma ditodong buat dijual ke panti pijat Miyabi.Shikamaru marah dan menghancurkan 1000 unit RSJ kemudian pergi mengejar pasangan homo tersebut dengan tim Naruto. Hidan berhasil disodomi oleh Shikamaru. Kakuzu berhasil dikeroyok dan semua jantungnya diperkosa oleh Kakashi dan Naruto dgn jurus andalannya yaitu cepirit dan cuton cincang culiken.Penghianatan Sasuke  Saat di Sarangnya Orochimaru, Orochimaru dan Kabuto mendengar Hidan dan Kakuzu boker begituan lamanya, telah diberantas oleh Naruto. Setelah mendengar hal itu, tubuh orochimaru muntaberna (muntah berak celana). Saat itu Sasuke ingin memuaskan Orochimaru sampai mampus. Pada saat ia melihat Orochimaru sudah menderita pusing-pusing gara-gara ramuan Buah Pakmu, ia lalu berpaling ke Suigetsu yang dikurung oleh Orochimaru di Aquarium. Berhubung nafsu Sasuke tidak tertahankan lagi maka ia pun segera memecahkan Aquarium. Karena otak kotornya tidak puas dengan layanan Suigetsu, malah ingin minta 2 lagi. Maka ia bergegas mencari Karin serta Juugo dan mereka pun segera three some di atas pohon. Maksudnya sih merencanakan strategi gituan.Pencarian Itachi  Mendengar nafsu Sasuke bertambah, Itachi memohon kepada anggota Akatsuki yang lain membantunya agar dia tidak diperkosa. Maka Akatsuki pun membagi 2 prioritas antara mencari Monster anjing dubur 9 dan Sasuke. Di saat yang sama Naruto mendengar Sasuke telah mengalahkan nafsu Orochimaru. Ia sangat senang, dan ia memohon kepada Tsunade untuk menghomoi Sasuke dengan bantuan dari orang 8. Namun nafsu Sasuke lebih besar dari nafsu Kelompok Orang 8 Naruto. Dan akhirnya Naruto pun tetap gagal.Latihan Menjadi Petapa Kotor  Setelah gagal mencari Sasuke, ia memutuskan untuk menambah nafsunya dengan menjadi Petapa Genit seperti gurunya Jiraiya. Caranya adalah dengan makan makanan yang menjijikan bersama katak. Setelah itu lalu memasukkan seluruh kodok kodok yang ada ke dalam mulutnya. Akhirnya ia menguasai ilmu petapa kotor dengan bukti mata dengan bintit lingkaran merah yang menandakan sedang berpikir kotor.Invasi Pain  Karena hampir semua anggota Akatsuki gagal mencabuli si Ekor 9. Akhirnya ketua Akatsuki turun tangan. Karena dia pikir kalao ber 7 (ditambah konan) akan lebih mudah daripada ber 2. Setelah tiba di Konoha ia menunjukan aksi aksi yang merangsang penduduk Konoha. Pain dkk memakai Lorem Ipsum ke semua jenis binatang (akamaru,pakun,berbagai jenis burung,semua jenis serangga,3 piring Tukul Arwana,dan Barney dkk), menghomoi semua jenis tumbuhan, dan mengklaim gedung besama Malaysia. Karena Tsunade tidak terima dengan aksi aksi seronok dan senonoh tersebut karena dianggap menyaingi dirinya, ia memutuskan Naruto kembali ke Konoha. Kakashi Bertarung seru dengan Pain, Tapi dia kelelahan gara gara Pein memakai Lorem Ipsum Ke Kakashi dan Membuat Kakashi Ngebacot terlalu lama, Tiba tiba Serius Black menyelamatkan nyawanya meskipun dia mampus ditempat. Selamatlah Kakashi dari kejaran maut. Chouji dan Chouza juga unjuk gigi. Sialnya Pein menyerang dengan jurus AAAAAA! yang membuat Chouji dan Chouza Pusing PusingPain vs Naruto  Setelah Naruto belajar jurus-jurus yang kotor, ia kembali ke Konoha, ia terkejut melihat desanya sempoyongan dan lemas karena telah digarap (dan diklaim) oleh Pain dkk dan Anggota DPR. Naruto lalu bertarung dan berhasil menyodomi ke-6 Pain(kecuali Konan, karena ia kabur ke Panti Pijat.Akhirnya dalam pertempuran yang sengit hanya tersisa 1 Pain. Tetapi pada akhirnya Naruto yang menang, karena Kyubinya bisa melindunginya dari kutukan Lorem Ipsum.Pertemuan 5 Kage  Karena Tsunade teler digarap oleh Pain, Danzo akhirnya mengambil alih pimpinan dan pergi ke pertemuan 5 kage yang diadakan oleh Raikage di Nusa Kambangan. Ditengah tengah rapat tersebut, Sasuke yang makin besar Nafsunya ingin membunuh Danzo. Karin mencoba mendeteksi keberadaan Danzo, namun karena sasuke tidak sabar ia lalu mencoba menghamili Raikage dkk.Lalu tibalah pertarungan sengit. Raikage sudah berkali-kali menyodomi Sasuke, namun yang terkena sodomi adalah susanoo.Setelah Karin mengetahui bahwa Danzo berada di Gedung DPR.Kemudian perhamilan antara Sasuke dan Danzo dimulai... Karena Terlalu Lama menunggu Karin dan Sasuke jadi Nonton Bokep Di Gedung DPR bareng Roy SuryoSasuke vs Danzo  Sasuke saking nafsunya langsung menyerang Danzo dan mengeluarkan Magic Sharingan. Namun tenyata Danzo mengeluarkan tangannya yang berisi beberapa mata sihir Sharingan. Dan mengeluarkan jurus yang terdapat dalam komik.....Latihan dengan Bang Killerbee  Karena Jiraya mati dibool oleh Pain, Kakashi lemas gara-gara membacot terlalu lama gara gara Lorem Ipsum, Yamato sibuk menanam pohon Vodka dalam acara anti global warming, Naruto bingung mau latihan sihir bareng siapa. Lalu tetangga dari Desa sebelah ingin mengajak Naruto latihan cabul bareng dengan ilmu ninja yang tinggi, serta fasilitas latihan yang lebih canggih dari Konoha. Naruto pun pergi latihan bersama killerbee di desanya. Di sana, naruto diajari oleh Killerbee bagaimana caranya memotong anunya kyubi. Karena naruto susah di ajari dia frustasi dan memotong anunya sendiri. Killerbee yang melihat kejadian itu langsung nepsong berat dan membool naruto, saat itu kyubi yang ada di tubuh naruto berontak dan bekerja sama dengan naruto untuk melawan killerbee. Saat itulah naruto dapat menguasai kyubi yang ada di tubuhnya!Kemampuan Trivia Naruto Itu Ide Pembuatannya Dari Indonesia, Lho!  Mungkin yang pernah belajar Bahasa Jepang, tahu hal ini. Lidah orang Jepang itu agak \"belibet\", jadi ada perbedaan pengucapan orang Jepang untuk kata dengan konsonan yang dobel. Misal: Dragon > Doragon, Restoran > Resutoran, dll. NARUTO ditulisnya pake huruf KATAKANA bukannya HIRAGANA, berarti NARUTO itu adalah nama yang berasal dari luar Jepang. Karena, kalo nama jepang selalu ditulis dengan HIRAGANA.....dan NARUTO adalah memang berasal dari NARTO. Sekedar Info: Naruto Shippuden = Narto Syaifudin. Naruto dikisahkan berasal dari negara Api dengan iklim yang cerah dan hangat. Dimana lagi negara tropis dengan banyak gunung api aktif, selain di negara kita tercinta? Penggemar serial ini pasti tahu Desa Konoha, yang berarti Desa Daun. Agan tahu di manakan letak Desa Daun yang sesungguhnya? Coba cek di Google: Desa Daun terletak di Kecamatan Sangkapura, letaknya di Pulau Bawean, Jawa Timur. Danzo Anbu masa pemerintahan Tsunade. SBY Menhankam masa Megawati. Setahu ane, Danzo itu hanya pejabat sementara, yang menggantikan Tsunade waktu sakit parah. Jadi belum resmi menjadi hokage keenam. Para Tetua menyarankan agar Danzo sementara menjalankan tugas Hokage, untuk ikut pertemuan para Hokage. Justru saat kekacauan itu, para shinobi dari Konoha lebih memilih Kakashi untuk menjadi Hokage. Apalagi setelah Danzo terbukti \"berkhianat\" dan kemudian tewas. Walaupun nggak jadi karena Tsunade sehat kembali, dan dapat bertugas menjadi Hokage... Kondisi ini mirip dengan presiden kita. SBY adalah presiden pertama yang dipilih langsung oleh rakyat. Kalau yang sebelumnya, kan dipilih oleh MPR/DPR, kalau di Konoha ada Dewan Penasihat (Elder) gitu... Penggemar Naruto pasti tahu dengan Akatsuki, yang sekarang ini menjadi musuh utama para Shinobi di semua negara. Agan pasti juga familiar dengan jubah yang menjadi kostum para anggota Akatsuki. Nah, tak disangka tak diduga, ternyata, motifnya mengambil dari batik Mega Mendung dari Cirebon!Kenapa Suaranya Naruto Jengkellin????  Suara naruto dibikin cewek sih!!! kenapa suaranya jadi KAYAK Jeng Kellin???? KAN MALU IIIIHHHHH!!! Tapi, ada suara naruto dibikin cowok. yg buat ujank. Gw liat di Spongebob JawaHal-Hal yang TIDAK Mungkin Ada di Anime Naruto Lihat Juga Tolololpedia Mulan Jameelah  Whops, mungkin anda mencari Mulan Jamidong\n\nAtau mungkin anda mencari Mulan Jamahlah Mulan Jameelah(Arab: \ufee3\ufeee\ufefb\ufee5 \ufe9f\ufee4\ufef4\u0644\u0629, Ibrani: \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05df \u05d2\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4, Suriah: \u0721\u0718\u0720\u0722 \u0713\u0721\u071d\u0720\u0717, Kan'an: \ud802\udd0c\ud802\udd05\ud802\udd0b\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd1f\ud802\udd02\ud802\udd0c\ud802\udd09\ud802\udd0b\ud802\udd04, Jawa:) adalah makhluk Tuhan yang paling sexy menurut kitab suci Kama Sutra (dikenal sebagai Primbon Jawen oleh orang Indonesia) yang diterjemahkan langsung oleh Mbah Maridjan. Dengan demikian telah ditetapkan bahwa untuk 574 tahun ke depan, wanita-wanita yang dilahirkan di muka bumi ini tidak akan ada yang lebih sexy darinya. Pada akhir jaman beliau akan memimpin para pengikutnya melawan Anti-Jamila, seorang dokter bedah plastik. Transliterasi asli dari \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 di Indonesia sebenarnya \"Jamilah\" (ingat lagunya Jamal Mirdad), tapi Mulan lebih memilih memakai \"Jameela(h)\" untuk menghindari kesan ndeso. Sebagai makluk tersexy di dunia, Mulan Jamilah berhasil menciptakan sebuah aliran agama Jamiliyah, yang ummatnya kebanyakan adalah orang yang mau kawin dengan-Nya tapi gak kesampaian. Aliran agama ini berperan dalam menggencet perkembangan ajaran Shitanisme dan Koruptisme. Sebelum penobatanya sebagai makhluk Tuhan yang paling sexy, nama aslinya adalah Wulansari. Ia berselisih dengan kakaknya, Mayangsari, dalam memperebutkan status tersexy. Perebutan status tersexy ini berpuncak ketika Mayangsari terlibat dalam dalam baku hantam dengan geng tante Dolly, ia mendapat sebuah garis luka di mukanya karena karena sebuah sisir salon sehingga ia tidak lagi se-sexy adiknya....Melainkan LEBIH RUSAK dari adiknya Mulan Jameelah dikenal juga sebagai Mulan Kwok, sodara kembarnya Aaron Kwok dari Hongkong, karena ia adalah anak keponakan menantu kakek kakak perempuan besan ibu mertua sepupu keponakan Donal Bebek, yaitu Kwik, Kwak, dan Kwek. Sejak ia mengajarkan cara menari perut yang hakiki sesuai Primbon Mbah Maridjan di Arab Saudi, namanya dikenal orang sebagai Mulan Jameelah. Mulan Jameelah juga dikisahkan berusaha menjadi Wonder Woman namun hikayat Wonder Woman ini di anggap oleh kebanyakan orang sebagai hikayat palsu belaka.Kisah Hidup  Berikut adalah kisah hidup sesuai dengan surat Jameelah di dalam kitab suci Kama Sutra versi Jamaah Jamiliah. Maka Tuhan melihat bahwa wanita-wanita di bumi masa sekarang kurang bergairah dan banyak yang melakukan penyuntikan silikon, karena itu Ia memutuskan untuk menciptakan maha karya dari tulang rusuk Adam. Namun oleh karena tulang rusuk Adam terjangkit osteoporosis Iapun menggunakan tulang selangkangannya. Kepada tulang selangkangan itu ditiupkan hawa-hawa sexy dari Tuhan dan jadilah Mulan Jameelah itu. Tuhan melihat Mulan Jameelah itu sexy adanya, karena itu ia mengirimkannya ke dunia untuk menebus dosa wanita-wanita yang terlalu banyak bedah plastik dan penyuntikan silikon agar mereka yang percaya padanya tidak tergantung oleh gincu dan pupur yang mahal melainkan beroleh keseksian dalam diri yang kekal dan hakiki. Mulan Jameelah diturunkan dari khayangan ke sebuah dusun di Indonesia. Kedatangannya ditandai dengan sebuah bintang yang sangat terang di timur, yang kemudian dilihat oleh gembala kambing dan 3 anggota DPR yang sedang berlibur di desa itu. Mereka mengikuti bintang itu sampai ke sebuah danau yang di sana mereka menemukan Mulan Jameelah sedang mandi sehingga Mulan marah dan melemparnya dengan cowek dan sandal jepit. Salah seorang gembala kambing bernama Joko Korup mencuri selendang Mulan Jameelah sehingga Mulan Jameelah tidak bisa kembali ke khayangan dan terpaksa harus menikah dengannya. Demi menebus dosa wanita-wanita jaman sekarang yang telah tergantung oleh operasi plastik dan kosmetik-kosmetik palsu, Mulan Jameelah memanggil 12 orang murid. Ternyata, 11 murid dari 12 murid yang dipanggilnya adalah kaum setengah lelaki sehingga Mulan mencampakkannya di danau Toba. Murid yang terakhir adalah seorang wanita tulen bernama Maia Iska-Erot. Maiapun menjadi pengikutnya yang paling setia. Namun setelah menyebarkan ajarannya bersama Maia sekian lama, Maia mengkhianatinya dan menjualnya ke geng tante Dolly di Surabaya. Mulanpun kehilangan keperawanannya. Sementara itu, Maia yang mengkhianati Mulan terkena kutukan sehingga saat ia kawin lari dengan Ahmad Dhani ke Amerika pesawatnya nabrak layang-layang dan jatuh di Amerika Tengah. Di sana kemudian Maia membangun kebudayaan Maya. Sesuai dengan Primbon Jawen Mbah Maridjan, Mulan bangkit pada hari yang ketiga dan saat itu pengikut-pengikutnya bisa menyaksikan tubuh Mulan dimuliakan dan beliaupun diangkat kembali ke khayangan dengan tanpa busana. Maka itulah kisah hidup Mulan Jameelah, makhluk Tuhan yang paling sexy sesuai dengan kitab suci Kama Sutra.Turunnya Kembali mulan  Menurut surat Jameelah Setelah kepergiannya, para wanita akan kembali melakukan bedah plastik dan menggunakan pupur dan gincu yang mahal. Hal ini berkulminasi pada munculnya seorang Anti-Jamila dari Komite Dokter Bedah Plastik. Anti-Jamila ini juga akan menyebarkan fitnah dan pertengkaran diantara para wanita. Di waktu yang penuh kekacauan ini Mulan Jameelah akan turun kembali dari khayangan untuk mempimpin pengikutnya yang tersisa melawan pasukan Anti-Jamila. Perang melawan Anti-Jamila akan berlangsung selama tujuh tahun, tujuh bulan, tujuh hari dan tujuh jam, menit ke enam, detik ke lima puluh tiga dan ketika perang usai Mulan Jameelah akan memimpin dunia dalam kedamaian dan keseksian yang hakiki.Kontroversi dengan Jemaah Jamiliyah  Pada akhir tahun 1456 mulai muncul kelompok orang yang menamakan dirinya Jemaah Jamiliyah, mereka melakukan kegiatan terorisme dan meresahkan warga misalnya mencoret-coret jemuran, menjilati sambel yang baru diuleg dan melempari kucing dengan sandal. Mereka terutama memusatkan aksinya pada tempat-tempat spa dan rumah kecantikan. Mereka menyatakan bahwa mereka mendasarkan aksinya pada ajaran Jamilah yang menyatakan bahwa pada akhir jaman para wanita akan menghabiskan banyak uang dan menghalalkan berbagai cara untuk mempercantik diri , misalnya memakai minyak nyongnyong atau memakai topeng Amingwati di wajah. Mengenai kelompok ini, Mulan Jameelah menyatakan tidak ada hubungan dengan mereka dan menyatakan kelompok itu sesat. Bahkan Mulan Jameelah melaknat kelompok itu karena pusat spa miliknya pernah diisi kecoak oleh anggota JJ tersebut.Kemunculan Mulan Jameelah  Mulan Jameelah disebutkan di dalam berbagai kitab dalam Kama Sutra dan buku-buku(BOKEP) lainnya antara lain:Char PB Mulffffan Jameela  Kill/Death: 76% Headshot: 89% Nickname: Mulan_peri-bumi Point: 90000 Cash: 50000 Pangkat: Makhluk Tuhan yang Paling Seksi (mbahmu!)

Bibirnya sering diurus oleh Mak Erot, tetapi tanpa sengaja, Mak Erot mengurusnya dengan minyak virus Katrokus Wongndesois, sejenis minyak dari keringat Tukul Arwana sendiri yang bisa mengubah seseorang menjadi keturunan dari species Tukulus Arwani. Jadi, saat ini ia sedang mencoba menghidupkan kembali spesies nya dengan menebar virus Katrokus Wongndesois dan Homo Bibiris melalui acara Empat Mata, yang menyebabkan orang yang terinfeksi bertingkah laku dan merubah penampilannya menyerupai Tukul Arwana (karena dia sering meludah). Rencananya setelah ia menulari cukup banyak orang, ia akan membentuk pasukan Tukulus Arwani dan menyerbu Istana Merdeka dan Gedung DPR untuk mengambil alih pemerintahan Indonesia dan mengganti nama Indonesia menjadi Tukulnesia.Nama Lain  Tukul juga sering dipanggil dengan panggilan Reynaldi, yang sebenarnya adalah nama monyet peliharaannya. Tukul Arwana juga secara rahasia menjadi seorang Superhero dan masuk ke jajaran Justice League sebagai Supertukul the Bibirman, di Liga Juragan Petis ia menjabat sebagai ikan mas koi untuk hiasan akuarium. Nama Tukul sendiri adalah sebuah singkatan dari pekerjaan lamanya waktu jaman purbakala, yakni TUkang puKUL, yang kemudian disamarkannya agar jangan sampe ketauan. Selain jadi tukang pukul sebenarnya dulu Tukul jadi pegawai lepas pada pabrik kosmetik yang sangat terkenal yaitu Mukjizat Ratu pimpinan Kanjeng Gusti Ayu Moer Baut Soetibo. Pada pekerjaan ini si Tukul setiap harinya keluar masuk kampung mulai dari Rogoitan Blambangan sampai kampung Melayu yang di Batavia, untuk menawarkan jasanya 'mlentesi kukul' (atau bahasa kerennya adalah Agen Anti Acne)para gadis-gadis bahenol dan emoh menservis kalangan ibu-ibu apalagi yang sudah emak-emak. Dari pekerjaan itu Tukul hanya mendapatkan bayaran sebesar dan selebar bibirnya saja yang hanya pas untuk keperluan bibir sehari-harinya (padahal pada waktu itu tukul banyak hutangnya termasuk hutang beli kutang satu lusin untuk nutupi bibirnya yang konon belum terselesaikan sampai sekarang). RE RE RE RE RE RE REynaldi Yang Maha NdesoIstri-istri Tukul  Tukul Arwana tercatat pernah memiliki 18 orang istri, namanya antara lain: Suminem, Suminah, Suminten, Sumarjinah, Sumur, Subur, Sumpel, Susu, Suri, Sumbing, Kambing, Wedhus, Wedhus Gembhel, Wedhus Gibhas, Rihanna, Amingwati, Maya dan Mulan, serta Fatin Shidqia Lubis. Namun rumah tangga Tukul selalu terpecah oleh berbagai macam alasan. Misalnya, Istrinya Nomor 1 Hilang dan di temukan Tewas Di Laboratorium Rahasia miliknya, Istrinya nomor2-5 meninggal karena keracunan gas beracun yang biasa dikeluarkan Tukul setelah makan jengkol, istrinya nomor 5-10 terinfeksi penyakit Chikunguya dari ludah, keringat dan kencing Tukul, Istrinya nomor 10-14 kabur dari rumah setelah melihat tubuh Tukul yang sedang tidak pakai baju, istrinya nomor 15, Rihanna meninggalkan Tukul setelah sukses di Amerika, diduga lagu Rihanna \"Umbrella\" berasal dari kebiasaannya memakai payung di rumah karena takut tertular virus Chikunguya Tukul. Istrinya yang ke 16, Amingwati ketularan gila sehingga sedang dirawat di RSJ Extra. Istrinya nomor 16 dan 17 meninggalkan Tukul setelah menangkap basah Tukul berselingkuh dengan buaya-buaya di Taman Safari Indonesia, dan itu adalah asal mula lagu \"Lelaki Buaya Darat\". Namun Mulan, sebelum meninggalkan Tukul ia mengambil harta kekayaan Tukul dan membawanya ke negeri Arab dan di sana ia merubah namanya jadi Mulan Jameelah. Sementara istri tukul yang ke-18 bernama tukulwati, akhirnya mental ke Tolololpedia setelah ditampar Tukul pake Bibir. Istri Tukul yang sekarang, yang bertahan paling lama bernama Yusi Raini Similikiti Weleh Weleh, karena ketahanannya merawat dan memberi makan Tukul, diduga ia adalah keturunan langsung atau reinkarnasi dari Nyi Roro Katul, Ratu Ubur-ubur penguasa Pantai Selepan yang dulu mengguna-gunai Tukul sehingga bibirnya tumbuh melewati batas normal dedaunan.Tukul dan Jason Mraz  Jason Mraz ditemukan tukul pada zaman Cartolos Maksud los di habitat Tukulus Arwani ketakutan tukul tukul takut jika iya cere ama bininya saking banyak instrinya iya sampai takut melihat jari jempolnya sendiriTukul dan 1cakers  Saat 1cak mengejeknya Tukul menyerang 1cakers dan tukul sadar 1cakers adalah makhluk ciptaan Mak Erot yang diciptakan untuk mengejek apapun. Tukul tahu kelemahan 1cakers. Lalu tukul memukul dengan bibirnya.1cakers menjadi takut dengan tukul. Setelah kejadian itu 1cakers tidak berani menyebutkan hal hal yang berbau \"Tukul\" dimanapun.Karier  Selain membintangi sejumlah channel manca negara seperti Animal Planet, BBC Two, CNN , Fox News Channel, Star World dan Disco Very dan channel-channel manca makluk Tukul Arwana juga membintangi sejumlah acara yakni: BIBIR LOETukul Arwana Dalam Bukannya Empat Mata  Dalam acara ini Tukul Arwana disuruh masuk ke sebuah pintu dimana kemudian dia harus mengadakan talkshow dengan siapapun yang dia temui di situ hanya dengan bermodalkan laptop (tapi tanpa listrik) dan kentongan. Acara ini ditutup setelah Tukul Arwana mengadakan Talkshow di sebuah kandang Orang Utan yang mengakibatkan 90% Orang Utan betina di sana menjadi hamil. Orang-orang yang terlahir dari persilangan antara oangutan dan tukul itu menghasilkan apa yang kini kita ketahui sebagai gorila, simpanse, lutung, dan babun. Jika kalian lihat secara teliti wajah kera-kera itu persis tukul bukan?. Oh ya, persilangan ini juga menghasilkan para pemain srimulat.Tukul Arwana Dalam Juga Bukan Empat Mata  Dalam acara ini, tukul akan mengajak bintang tamu pergi ke pulau kampung halamannya melalui penerbangan pesawat pribadi ArwanaAIRLINES. Disana mereka akan disambut keluarga tukul, susi similikiti weleh-weleh, pepi, dan orang-orang katrok plus yang terkena penyakit chikungunya.Tukul Arwana Dalam Lebih Bukan Empat Mata  Kali ini, Tukul mengundang bintang tamu yang benar-benar lebih. Contoh, Tukul mengundang Prabu Revolusi sang \"kompeten\" karena kelebihannya dalam bidang K-popologi. Walau Tukul bukan ahlinya, ia tetap membicarakan hal itu meskipun ia sendiri tidak mengerti arah pembicaraannya.Tukul Arwana Dalam Ternyata Bukan Empat Mata  Setelah dicek, ternyata memang bukan empat mata, tetapi hanya dua saja. Kalau matanya empat, orang-orang jadi takut gitu loh. Tukul sendiri tidak pernah terlibat dalam acara fiktif ini karena ia sibuk menjalani profesi sampingannya sebagai Bibirman.OKE TUKUL DAN MANTAN PACARNNYA  Acara sampingan Tukul Arwana yang ditayangkan pada tengah malam bersama Maria Ozawa. Acara ini mengenai bagaimana menjaga kecantikan kulit dengan cara mengolesi muka dengan berbagai bahan seperti maskara jahe, lengkuas, lombok, pupuk kandang, pupuk bawang, susu onta dan sebagainya. Tukul yang menjadi bahan percobaan di sini namanya diganti menjadi Tyukyul Aw Aw Na.Tukul Arwana Dalam Cidera Mata  Cidera Mata sebenarnya adalah acara talkshow lain yang dibawakan oleh Parto bersama Mak Bongki dan lebih mengenai talkshow dengan banci-banci berpenampilan norak yang bikin mata jadi cedera. Dalam Talkshow ini Tukul berperan sebagai nanas untuk hiasan meja.Kontes Bibir Terseksi Bersama Tukul Arwana  Acara ini tidak jadi ditayangkan, karena mendapatkan kecaman dari MUI (Mas-mas Ubanan tapi Imut). Acara ini dinilai terlalu vulgar dalam mengumbar bibirnya tukul, dan dikhawatirkan dapat merusak amoral bangsa.Tukul Arwana dan 3069 Bungkus Miethuania  Acara ini mengharuskan Tukul memakan Miethuania sebanyak 13 kali dalam sehari dan memberi 3069 bungkus Miethuania ke teman dekatnya. Selain itu, Tukul juga menyumbang 26513 bungkus Miethuania ke kafe dan kantin. Ia semakin dikenal karena gemar makan Miethuania sehingga ia ditunjuk menjadi Ambassador Brand Miethuania untuk 26 tahun ke depan.Tukul Arwana dan Laptop  Sekitar tahun 1600, ilmuwan-ilmuwan kacung Presiden Jojon Wadingten Bush dari Amerika (dulu masih bernama Ame-Ame Belalang Kupu-Kupu) menemukan laptop pertama di dunia. Bush memakai Laptop itu untuk membuka situs-situs porno, namun karena terlalu banyak sensor ia mengamuk dan menembakkan bom ke arah laptop itu sehingga laptop tersebut melayang dan jatuh ke pedalaman Jawa. Beberapa spesies Tukulus Arwani yang sedang mencari kutu menemukan laptop tersebut jatuh dari langit. Setelah melihat isinya, mereka menganggap benda itu adalah barang suci milik khayangan, karena itulah bangsa Tukulus Arwani menyembah Laptop dan mewariskannya turun temurun ke keturunan-keturunannya. Jadi sebenarnya Tukul Arwana adalah pamakai Laptop paling pertama di Indonesia. Setelah menemukan laptop tersebut, Tukul pun berguru kepada roy suryo untuk belajar bagaimana mengakses situs porno dan mendownload majalah bobokep. pada saat tukul sedang asik melihat gambar mak erot dan Vega striptease di alun alun kidul, tiba - tiba ada satu virus bernama \"cengceremet\", yang kemudian menyerang laptop beserta bibirnya, dan sampai sekarang virus itu pun masih berkumpul didalam bibirnyaAstaga, Tukul ada di Google Translate!  Karena itu, Tukul sering diterjemahkan dalam Google Translate sehingga diartikan menjadi Hammer. Padahal hammer itu palu khan?

Dalam bahasa Malaysia, mouse komputer disebut sebagai petunjuk-tetikus, yang dalam bahasa saudaranya, yaitu bahasa Indonesia bisa diartikan sebagai suatu petunjuk yang menunjukkan letak tikus-tikus di rumah Anda. Mouse komputer dijelaskan dengan baik sekali dalam kalimat kalimat bahasa Inggris yang diterjemahkan ke bahasa Malaysia berikut ini:   Terjemahan bahasa Malaysia:Asal mula  Pada zaman dahulu kala, hiduplah seekor tikus bernama Miki yang sangat bandel. Ia tak pernah mendengar nasehat Bapak dan Ibunya. Pada suatu ketika, Bapak Miki meninggal dunia, hingga yang tinggal hanyalah Miki dan Ibunya. Meskipun demikian, Miki tak juga mau menuruti kata-kata ibunya, bahkan ingin meninggalkan ibunya untuk mencari peruntungan di negeri tikus lain. Berangkatlah Miki dengan suatu kapal ke suatu negeri yang jauh. Sesampainya di negeri itu, ternyata Miki berhasil menggaet seekor tikus cewek yang cantik bernama Mini dengan mengguna-gunainya. Mini terlena. Sekarang, Miki bebas meracuni ayah dan ibu Mini, dan harta keluarga Mini pun jatuh ke tangannya. Pada suatu hari, Miki kembali berangkat berlayar setelah mencampakkan Mini dan menguasai seluruh harta Mini. Sampailah ia kembali ke kampung halamannya sebagai tikus kaya-raya. Semua tikus terkagum-kagum, terperangah, ngiler, dan iri hati dengan kekayaannya. Ibu Miki yang sudah tua-renta mengenali anaknya dan memanggil-manggil, tetapi Miki tak mau mengakuinya sebagai ibunya, malahan menendangnya dengan kasar. Karena marah dan sedih, ibu Miki mengutuknya sehingga Miki pun berubah menjadi mouse komputer. Itulah akhir si Miki Kundang, anak Duralex, dibanting gak pecah.Struktur  Mouse komputer berbentuk bulat lonjong. Di tengah-tengahnya terdapat sebutir bola karet (maaf, bukan permen karet bundar atau kelereng). Di dalamnya terdapat alat pemindai gerak bola yang kemudian meneruskan data gerakan bola ke komputer. Namun sekarang ini, bola itu sudah digantikan oleh sinar ultraviolet agar anak-anak tak lagi menyalah artikannya sebagai permen karet. Dan kelebihan lain yang didapat dari mouse ultraviolet ini adalah sebagai alat bantu penerangan dikala lampu kamar mati buat mencari cincin atau benda2 kecil yang jatuh.Menggunakan mouse Daftar Pustaka Lihat juga Komputer Alat-alat untuk menghitung Tolololpedia Bahasa Inggris  Bahasa Inggris (English: English) is a very confusing language for you, not for me. It is caused by difficulties on pronunciation or reading for you due to your inability on English such as: i pronounced aye, g pronounced ji, h pronounced eitchs, and w pronounced dabel yu. Likewise, the word: \"honey\" pronunced hani or \"funny\" pronunced fani. Whereas English is quite easy for me somehow you would never see English easily as easy as natives do. Obviously all things you have to do is to practice and practice. But you spent your money for attending so many courses as well as made your mbok wants to die due to your idiotic sense of learning. In this page, you are considered as an idiot reader for sure. Everyone who resolves any dilemmatic problem on English usually is the genius man as me, yet most non-natives like you waste so many times learning English. So like obviously to be a fluent in English we should consider the boundaries of our abilities and break it even though only a few people that able to do sort of thing so that is why I did not take or enroll any courses since I was born. There is only one chance for you of which I hesitate to work: stay in US or UK. However, you do not need to feel grief, this article is going to be presented for you to involve the real spoken English, not to learn paper based English any longer like you did on your fucking course.History  History means \"sejarah\" or in Javanese-English is pronounced like \"histori\" as for instance \"historine tiyang Jawi\" (sejarahnya orang Jawa) though obviously is pronunced \"hiscwi\" by using BrE (British English) accent. It is history of which you would not even get it this fookin language (by using mandems' accent: \"fookin fam yo\"). Well it is all got to do is the history of English yet I will put up your so-called lemot minded, so then I am going to use Bahasa on this section. Okay, sejarah Bahasa Inggris dimulai sejak abad 30 SM dimana saat itu belum ada Bahasa Inggris, yang ada Bahasa Jermania (Germanic) di daratan Eropa timur laut. Suku Angles di Saxony (Sachen, sebuah kota kuno di Italia) transmigrasi ke Pulau Britney. Di sana mereka membentuk komunitas kesukuan yang selalu berperang dengan suku-suku pribumi \"Brittony\" (julukan bagi Native Britney); yaitu Suku Celtic, Suku Gaelic, Suku Quraishic, dan Suku Sundaic. Bahasa Jermania aksen Angles yang disebut Anglo-Saxon mulai kentara di sini. Namun lama-kelamaan cikal-bakal Bahasa Inggris mulai muncul sejak klan Smith mengenal tradisi tulis-menulis surat seperti \"Epic of Beowulf\" dengan menggunakan Bahasa Inggris Kuno (Old English language; or formally called as \u00c6nglisc sprak). Ketika klan Norman (Normandy) berkuasa di Britney, Bahasa Inggris Kuno mengalami pergeseran grammar menjadi Bahasa Inggris Pertengahan (Middle English language; or those gents called it as Englisc langsprak). Kemudian Arthur Shakespeare memperkenalkan tenses seperti berikut: 1. I love you (present tense).\n 2. I loved you yesterday (past tense).\n 3. I will love you next year (future tense).\n 4. I have loved you since you were born (present perfect tense).\n 5. I have been loving you as you like it (present perfect continuous tense).\n 6. I love you till death do us part (present perfect modus tense).\n 7. I must love you whenever you pass by (present pickup line tense).\n 8. I love you unless you are quite rich (present perfect matre tense).\n 9. I will always love you (past houston song tense).\n 10. I know you love me (present geer tense).\n 11. I love her (present playboy tense).\n 12. I cannot live without your love (present disgusting tense).\n 13. I am loving it (present mekdi tense). Sejak itu lahirlah Bahasa Inggris yang mana mbokmu norak kalau melihat orang yang bisa berbahasa Inggris.Alphabet  The English alphabet is \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstvwxyz\". Oh no, I miss \"u\". h3h3Spelling  The real spelling of English is quite much such as \u00e6, \u0101, \u00fe, (r), \u00e8, \u00df, and so. But in this article, the author uses a special version for spelling by using Indonesian-influenced. They are:Grammar  English grammar is not the same as Indonesian grammar. Oh cum on, who would dare to say the same? Whoever dare saying both same is either stupid or crazy. Sort of thing makes you dizzy so that . Therefore, you should take a comprehensive conversation class in English language. Hell yeah, don't you wanna lose to the other people who could speak English \"cas cis cus\" like this: a big black bug beat a big black bear but a bug black bear beat a big black bug back? It's easy innit? The English grammar consists of very-easy structure for smart people, not for you and your mbok. In real spoken English, however, natives and those who are fluent in English never think of grammar at all, they speak naturally, and most intellectuals speak automatically, grammatically, and seriously yet most stay on their own habit. Now I am gonna show you a bit tenses of English in a sample completed paragraph as follows: 1. \"I work for Mr. Jojon\" (Present Tense)\n 2. \"But he slapped me yesterday\" (Past Tense)\n 3. \"Because I will take his money tomorrow\" (Future Tense)\n 4. \"I have told him not to take it seriously\" (Present Perfect Tense)\n 5. \"He has been calling me DooDoo back then\" (Present Perfect Continuous Tense)\n 6. \"And I am feeling so mad at him now!\" (Present Continuous Tense)\n 7. \"Now I am going to hijack his company\" (Present Evil Tense)\n 8. \"He has a beautiful daughter by the way\" (Present Perfect Daughter Tense)\n 9. \"And I want to marry her as soon as possible shortly after killing him\" (Present Perfect Impossible Tense)\n 10. \"If I was smart as Cassini and understood the rings around Titan, I might have fucked his daughter\" (Present Perfect Imaginator Tense)\n 11. \"And I certainly have been to kill God as well\" (Present Kafirun Tense)\n 12. \"Ahh... never mind, it was only bad storytelling. I'd rather read tolololpedia than to be tolol in reality\" (Future Perfect Tolololpedian Readers) Another grammar: 1. Passive Voice: \"Amingwati was fucked by Roy Suryo\".\n 2. Question Tag: \"You're idiot aren't you?\".\n 3. Modals: \"I may lend my panty to you but I'm worry it's gonna be jamuran\"\n 4. Command Prompt: \"If .... then ...\"\n 5. Comparison Degree: \"I am way too smart than you\"Example Conversations  Conversation derives from an abbreviation stands for \"convert\" (tukeran) and \"sanction\" (hukuman).

Pengucapan yang digunakan dalam Bahasa Inggris sebenarnya tidak ada aturan baku, tapi supaya tes TOEFL dan IELTS laku, maka Lembaga Bahasa Inggris (English Language Foundation) di Teheran memutuskan untuk menggunakan 2 aksen dalam pronunciation, yaitu Formal British (BrE) dan Common American (AmE). Namun Organisasi Bahasa Inggris Ternama (ORBIT) di Indonesia memutuskan 3 aksen utama; yaitu BrE, AmE, IndonE.BrE  BrE (British English) adalah aksen Inggris utama tertua di dunia. Aksen ini dituturkan di Inggris (ya iyalah, namanya juga aksen utama). Aksen ini adalah aksen tersulit buat kamu dan kebanyakan orang Indonesia (rata-rata dari kalangan alaytokrat). Mungkin disebabkan oleh rendahnya IQ kamu sehingga tidak akan pernah bisa menguasai BrE. Sekalipun IQ kamu tinggi pun, paling banter kamu hanya akan bisa aksen AmE (American English) yang gampang banget. Karakteristik BrE: Contoh-contoh BrE pronunciation:AmE  AmE (American English) adalah pronunciation Bahasa Inggris dengan aksen Amrik (Common American) yang lebay-lebay seperti Chint\u0259 Lowra yang neyk ojhekh jhealan bechek-bechek. Sebenarnya tidak lebay, tapi karena Cinta Laura dan kamunya sendiri yang lebay pengen keliatan keren bisa berbahasa Inggris, tapi tidak bisa-bisa sehingga aksen Amrik tereduksi sedemikian rupa menjadi aksen lebay. Pronunciation AmE adalah pronunciation tergampang dalam Bahasa Inggris, tapi kamu tetap merasa AmE itu susah sehingga AmE menjadi lebay. Karakteristik AmE: Contoh-contoh pronunciation AmE:IndonE  IndonE (Indonesian English) adalah pronunciation Bahasa Inggris dengan aksen pribumi Indonesia. Kebanyakan orang Indonesia (seperti kamu salah satunya) justru tidak bisa IndonE. Tokoh-tokoh Indonesia pengguna IndonE di antaranya adalah Wimar Witoelar, Timothy Marbun, Habibie, Prabowo, rata-rata jurnalis TV di Indonesia (seperti Rosiana Silalahi, Bayu Setiono), dan rata-rata pelacur ratusan juta (seperti AA). IndonE sering disalahpahami sebagai aksen kampungan, padahal yang kampungan itu aksen AlayE. Berikut adalah perbedaan pronunciation IndonE dan AlayE:Word Connection  Word Connection (WC) adalah keterhubungan antar kata sebagai trik dalam speaking yang kilat dan cepat. Tidakkah kamu sadari bahwa bule-bule pribumi Inggris itu bisa ngomong cepet karena pake trik WC? Tentunya kamu tidak menyadarinya karena kamu bodoh. Berikut ini adalah WC antara 2 aksen BrE dan AmE yang membuatmu gak bakalan pernah bisa ngomong cepet cas cis cus kayak bule: - kamu: betti bout \u0259 bit of biter beter bater.\n - BrE: betti baut\u0259 bitt\u0259wbitt\u0259 bett\u0259 battah.\n - AmE: beddi baurr\u0259 bid\u0259 bid\u0259r bed\u0259wr bad\u0259wr. - kamu: \u0259 bik blek bak bit \u0259 blek ber bat blek bleh bla bla bla (putus asa).\n - BrE: \u0259 bigblak bag bi\u0259t\u0259 bigblak be, batt\u0259 bigblak be bi\u0259t\u0259 bigblak bag bakh.\n - AmE: eibig bl\u00e6kbag bid\u0259big bl\u00e6kbewr bar\u0259big bl\u00e6kbewr bid\u0259big bl\u00e6kbag b\u00e6k. - kamu: Wans yu lov tu woc futbol den yu ar going tu bi lov tu stey ap et nait.\n - BrE: Wonsy\u0259u l\u0259uft\u0259u w\u0153tc\u0259futb\u0153len y\u0259ua goint\u0259ubi l\u0259uft\u0259u st\u00e6yap\u00e6'nayt.\n - AmE: Wansyu louftu wotc\u0259futbol den yugann\u0259bi louftu st\u00e6yap \u00e6dnayt.

Depending on the high quality IQ, this section is not suggested for you whose your mbok's feeling regret to gave birth such a wit like you. You may ignore this section by scrolling down your mouse. Somehow I could not understand why most non-English native people would like to be an expert in BrE (British English) whereas obviously no certain dealing on the fixed BrE. In United Kingdom, there are numbers of particular accents as you can see in \"Accents\" section above, such as Southern London, Northern London, Manchester, Scouser, Upper Countries (Welsh farmers, Gaelic, Celtic, Irish), and sort of kampungan slang like Mandem or Thug. There is no significant difference with Indonesian local accents like logat Betawi, Betawi cekak, Banten pesisir, Sunda, Jawa, Jawa ngapak, Jawa misuh, Timur, so on. However, I realize that speaks in BrE is much better than to speak AlayE. So, in this section I would share the following directions which may describe the rule of Queen's English or \"Received Pronunciation\" (RP) spoken in southern Britain (England and Wales), rarely ever used in the modern-day United Kingdom, but the foreigners' stereotypical view of how the way the \"Real\" Englishmen speak. Let's get down to business! If it is a sentence, do not pronounce the \"r\" after the vowel, but draw out the vowel and put a \"ww\"-lookalike for the infix \"-r-\" (instead to say \"ww\", some words with 3 syllables are pronounced the \"r\" very clearly like \"rr\"). You may sometimes add an \"-ah\" like a sket moaning, for example: \"Harry Potter\" (Hewwi Pottah or Pott\u0259), \"haters\" (heit\u0259s), \"mirror\" (mirrah or miww\u0259), \"squirrel\" (skwirr\u0259l). Example sentence: \"Harry Potter puts his haters behind the mirrors together with squirrels\" (Hewwi Pott\u0259 putsis heit\u0259s bihaynd'miwwah tugeth\u0259 wift skwirr\u0259ls). Avoid the AmE's \"u\" for particular words such as \"stupid\" or \"duty\", do not ever say \"stupid\" or \"juti\", but \"st\u0259upid (or \"sch\u0259upid\")\" or \"d\u0259wti\", it is almost like \"styupid\" or \"dyuti\". Example sentence: \"your duty is being stupid because you live in delusion\" (yod\u0259wti's biying st\u0259upid bikahz y\u0259u livin del\u0259usi\u0259n). And the word \"a\" has to be very clear, for example: \"father\" (fathah), \"far\" (fa), \"standard\" (standad). Example sentence: \"your father didn't qualify, too far from our qualification due to his IQ standard\" (yofath\u0259 di'n quollifay tufa fr\u0259m aw\u0259 quollifikesy\u0259n d\u0259utu his ayqyu standad). 'Ayn in Arabic is one of huruf IQRO which pronounced in stressing consonant as well as used in BrE's \"tt\" in front of the vowel and \"nt\" behind the vowel. You may hold the vowel on your throat like Indonesian \"-k\" in \"kayak\" (kaya'), \"tidak\" (tida'), \"rokok\" (roko'). For example: \"unforgotten\" (anfogat'n), \"important\" (impot'n), \"mountain\" (maunt'n). Example sentences: \"I can't think of time when you fell down from the mountain and dead, it was the most important moment in my life\" (I ka'n think\u0259taym weny\u0259u feldawn f\u0259m d'maunt'nen ded, itw\u0259s d'm\u0153stimpot'n momn inmaylayf).Old English  Old English adalah Bahasa Inggris kuno yang tidak pernah diajarkan dalam setiap kursus Bahasa Inggris. Bahasa ini diucapkan oleh orang Inggris di masa lampau dengan kosakata yang mirip Bahasa Jerman dan Bahasa Belanda (ya iyalah, Bahasa Inggris itu adalah rumpun Bahasa Jermanik cuy). Contoh kosakata Bahasa Inggris kuno adalah: Contoh-contoh kalimat Old English:Shakespearean English  Shakespearean English adalah Bahasa Inggris ala William Shakespeare. William Shakespeare adalah seorang mantan ketua Karang Taruna di Tanjung Belati (Capeshank), 100 meter ke arah timur laut desa Kepangeranan (Earldom) perbatasan antara Pelabuhan Congor (Portsmouth) dengan Dusun Karang Tengah (Middlerock County) di sebelah utara Kota London, Jerman. Shakespeare kemudian beralih profesi menjadi pujangga bak Arjuna Wiwaha setelah bertapa di bawah pohon mengkudu (apple tree) bersama Isaac Newton. Setelah menjadi pujangga, Shakespeare menuai es magnum opus (karya-karya emas) seperti Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Epic of Beowulf (Epos Beowulf), Legend of Avatar, dan Legend of Jake Baring (Legenda Jakabaring). Dalam salah satu novel karyanya yang berjudul \"Sakarepmu\" (As You Like It), Shakespeare menggunakan kosakata-kosakata (vocabularies) dan grammar yang aneh. Para sejarahwan dan filolog sepakat bahwa Bahasa Inggris ala Shakespeare adalah cikal-bakal Bahasa Inggris Modern, yang merupakan transisi dari Bahasa Inggris Pertengahan (Englisc l\u00e6ngsprak) ke Bahasa Inggris Modern (English language). Berikut ini adalah ciri-ciri Shakespearean English: Berikut adalah contoh-contoh kalimat Shakespearean English: - I loveth thee. - The lady doest not wanteth to beest the mistress of mine. - Thou doth not wanteth to geteth the fucketh hence from hither, doth thou? I doth not wanteth to seeth thee for any longer, no more! - Heigh-ho, broth'r! Passeth that fucking pizza ov'r hither, I'est wasting to beest hunger! - This ist thy neuw college, Andy! Taketh these papers, these art thyne!Contoh Percakapan Shakespearean  Earl William of Cambridge (W)\nKing Edward of England (E)\nPrincess Isabelle of Wales (I)\nAbdi Dalem (AD)\n\n AD: \"Thy Highness, My Lord! The 1st Earl of Cambridge hast coming back from the Underworld\"\n E: \"Please cometh in!\"\n W: \"The King of mine!

Para native speakers (pribumi Inggris) dan bule-bule asli Inggris saja tidak pernah bisa mencapai skor di atas 500, tapi banyak yang non-native seperti orang Sunda, Padang, Jawa, Bali, Papua, Arab, yang skornya di atas 550. Tapi ketika diajak ngomong Inggris, rata-rata cuma bisa \"e a u\" saja, tidak bisa cas cis cus. Maka dari itu, sering kutekankan bahwa jika score TOEFL kamu bagus, belum tentu kamu bisa berbahasa Inggris. Bisa jadi sertifikat TOEFL kamu aspal. TOEFL dibagi atas 2 tes: TOEFL-PBT (Prank Based Test) yang diselenggarakan dalam rangka iseng (prank) saja dan TOEFL-IBT (Idiot Based Test) yang diselenggarakan khusus untuk orang-orang bodoh yang ingin mencari kerja di luar negeri tapi nggak kesampean seperti kamu. Berdasarkan partisinya, TOEFL test dibagi atas 4 bagian: 1. Listening.\n In this section, you will hear short conversation by using audio speaker. Each conversation contains a strange keyword by which some sorts of TOEFL courses always give you trick to understand it. What a silly. For example:\n\n Man: \"Would you mind if I pick you up at 9 PM?\"\n Woman: \"Never mind\"\n\n What does the fucking woman mean?\n\n a. She is quite busy at the hotel at night.\n b. She is way too young for the man.\n c. She wants to get rid of the man.\n d. She refuses to appear in this question.\n\n Jika tidak ada jawaban yang benar, maka pilihlah jawaban yang tidak benar. Maka dari itu, jawaban di atas adalah semua tidak benar.\n\n2. Structure.\n In this section, you may fill the blank with a correct structure of the fucking grammar. You are considered as a kindergarten boy or girl indeed if you are not able to choose the correct answer.\n\n Tommy .... his father by .... a shotgun.\n a. kiss, fucking.\n b. kicked, aimed.\n c. killed, using.\n d. sucking, shaking.\n\n Jawaban di atas sebenarnya semua benar. Tapi dalam section ini, kebenaran kurang penting, yang penting sesuai struktur gramatikanya. Maka jawaban yang sesuai adalah C.\n\n3. Reading.\n In this section you are treated like a newbie who just able to read English articles even though your reading ability is merely cheesy like your mbok. Read the passage below and answer correctly.\n\n In 1234, an American neuroscientist conducted research on ants due to sexual pleasure of them and the result was fiercely shocking. In fact ants always foreplay before mating with their opposite genitals and share their female to each other. Scientist called this invention theory of animal mating as \"gang bang theory\". Related to this research, recently an 18-year-old Irish-Canadian girl was raped by a gang of niggas in Manhattan. This story was adopted to some Japanese Adult Video's fantasies such as gangrape, interracial bang, and so on. a. Stephen Hawking.\n b. Albert Einstein.\n c. Roger Penrose.\n d. John Lennon. a.

Tapi tenang aja, mimpimu bisa menjadi kenyataan. Begini caranya:Slang language  Slang language adalah bahasa gaul Inggris yang benar. Banyak orang salah kaprah mengira bahasa gaul Inggris itu seperti ini: \"Don't do this dong, not worthed!\". Padahal bule Inggris-Amerika sendiri tidak seperti itu. Bahkan, gobloknya orang Indonesia macam kamu itu sering mencampur-aduk gramatika Bahasa Indonesia lalu ditranslate ke Bahasa Inggris dalam hal formal. Contohnya: \"Thanks before\" (tidak ada kalimat seperti ini dalam Bahasa Inggris). Slang language of English is not hard as you thought from earlier. All you got to do is to make it used to be yours. Slang does not mean you break the grammar, you even could not let it out. Slang means you would rather choose being chilled than to think lemot like go blog man translating word by word in brain, even in google translate unless you are chating on Line or Whattsap. There is a Javanese proverb states: \"Witing Inggr\u00eds Jalaran Soko Kulino\" (To able to speak English caused by habitual). So, if you want to be smart and fluent in English, you need to stop translating on your mind. These are the example slang conversation in Nigga's accent: Nicoulae (N)\nCarl Johnson (CJ)\n\n N: \"Ssup nigga?\"\n CJ: \"Don't call me nigga man. You ain't us! Like I said it's kinda impolite you know because you ain't us!\"\n N: \"You anus?\"\n CJ: \"Ain't us you fool!\"\n N: \"O..o.. sorry. Yeah I see!\"\n CJ: \"Russian!\"\n N: \"Well anyway what we gonna do now man? Killing pedestrians, stealing vehicles, and having fun with tons of chicks in Las Venturas my man? Yeahaha...\"\n CJ: \"Nah man. I'm scold this time pal, those gang makes me sick and tired of this type of junkie life!\"\n N: \"Arrgh cum on CJ. Beating some hippies or killing 'em is our daily duty right? We've been programmed to be a game's chars, so do never think such a real human man!\"\n CJ: \"Nah Nico. I'm just feeling sorry 'bout that. Well man, I've gotta go now there's one mission I wanna complete. Sorry my man, but you can pick up my men the groove street to hit some gangs unless you ain't pickin' up me anymore. I'll see you later Nico!!\"\n N: \"Sounds good. Anyway take care man! Don't chit-chat a cheat code!\"Bahasa gaul  Nah, ini baru yang disebut Bahasa Gaul Inggris dimana saat ini sedang sangat \"ngetrend\" sebagai bahasa gaul lokal Indonesia. Bahasa gaul bukan slang language. Berikut ini adalah contoh percakapan gaul di kalangan anak-anak muda:\n\nCheryl (C)\nNisa (N)\n\n N: \"Yesterday I go shopping to Singapore dong\"\n C: \"Wow, cool very!! Shopping what this Nis?\"\n N: \"Ah usual, buy thing-thing branded original you know!\"\n C: \"Iyeuh. How money that you waste to there?\"\n N: \"Ah, only a few Dollar Singapore only Ryl, not many\"\n C: \"Wew, funny must dong!\"\n N: \"Sure dong. Eh, eh, I see a handsome guy in Singapore lho. Don't jealous ya?\"\n C: \"Ih who jealous iyeuh! I have boyfriend river, more handsome must than the guy that you meet\"\n N: \"Tuh jealous kaaan... hahahaha\"\n C: \"Stop ah. Later I show you my boyfriend!\"Kampung Inggris  Kampung Inggris (English Village) adalah sebuah perkampungan imigran Inggris dari berbagai belahan Bumi Nusantara. Kampung ini terletak di dusun Helpking (Tulungrejo), district of Pare (dibaca: Peir), regency of Toself (Kediri), di Provinsi Jawa Ngetan. Tutor-tutor di Kampung Inggris kebanyakan belajar Bahasa Inggris secara otodidak, tapi mereka lebih lancar dan fasih cas cis cus dibanding mereka yang kursus di lembaga-lembaga ternama sekaligus termahal. Namun sayangnya impotensi mereka hanya diakui oleh orang-orang ndeso. Itulah sebabnya mereka mengadakan long march menuntut kesejahteraan tutor terhadap Pemerintah di setiap tanggal 1 Mei (May Day). Murid-murid yang belajar Bahasa Inggris di Kampung Inggris berasal dari kalangan aristokrat berduit yang rata-rata adalah anak-anak labil (ababil) yang tujuan utamanya bukan belajar Bahasa Inggris, melainkan cari cewek (bagi cowok), cari cowok (bagi gay), pelarian dari broken home, atau traveler yang iseng-iseng singgah sejenak menikmati secercah Peradaban Eropa Barat di Kampung Inggris. Di hari libur, para warga Kampung Inggris biasanya jadi pecinta alam dadakan, atau pendaki gunung dadakan, atau backpacker dadakan. Itulah sebabnya mereka dijuluki traveler-wannabe.Parean Accent  Parean Accent (Aksen Pare) adalah sebuah logat unik yang digunakan mayoritas penduduk Kampung Inggris. Aksen ini banyak diisi dengan fillers seperti \"eee.... aaa.... mmm...\". Hal itu disebabkan karena mereka sangat hati-hati dalam berbicara Bahasa Inggris, mereka takut salah grammar atau vocabulary-nya. Selain itu, bila mengobrol, mereka juga menggunakan password: \"how to say\" untuk mengucapkan sebuah kata dalam Bahasa Indonesia yang tidak diketahui kosakata Inggrisnya. Hal ini disebabkan karena mereka sangat mencintai Bahasa Indonesia sehingga enggan untuk buka-buka kamus dan menghapalkan vocab-vocab Inggris. Inilah bukti nasionalisme rakyat Kampung Inggris. Di bawah ini adalah contoh percakapan Inggris dengan menggunakan Parean Accent:\n\nStella (S)\nTessa (T)\nMarlina (M)\n\n S: \"Ehh guys!! Do you all ee.... know that I meet eehh... aaa... met a... handsome boy on eeee..... this afternoon class\"\n M: \"How is... eh.. does he look like, Stell?\"\n S: \"Umm... he is very cool, handsome with a long nose... ee... how to say mancung... and his muscle is so sixpack!\"\n T: \"Stelll I'm sorry. What is the meaning of muscle? I forget!\"\n M: \"Otot!\"\n T: \"Ooo.. okey, tengkyu!\"\n M: \"So where is he come from?\"\n T: \"Where does he come from kaleee... You have been in Pare for 3 months not smart-smart iihh... always wrong grammar. Iyeeeuuhh....\"\n M: \"Yes, sorry Tess. Calm down kaleee... So Stell, where is he from?\"\n S: \"Oh he said eeee... he come from Ambon. Ehhh... comes from Ambon!\"\n T: \"Ambon?? Wooow... so far yah?!\"\n S: \"He said his purpose to come to Pare is for study English. I think he is how to say pura-pura\"\n T: \"For studyING. I dunno why you always forget -ing after for verb!!\"\n S: \"O iya. For studying. Ahh... it's not important you know!\"\n M: \"Baidewei, what's your name... eehh... his name?\"\n S: \"Oohh his name is Michael or Mikail I forget the name exactly Lin!\"\n M: \"So what you gonna do with him tomorrow?\"\n T: \"What ARE you gonna do Marlina!!\"\n M: \"Shut up Tess! The ee..... real foreigner pun eee.... usually speak ee.... without aaa.... grammar you know!\"\n T: \"You wrong! Natives always speak grammatically you know, but they faster because using word connection like this: \"Watcuganadu\"!\"\n M: \"Ahh you alone also wrong. \"They ARE faster\" not \"they faster\"\n T: \"It's because I speak quickly like natives and you couldn't catch it! I said \"dei(r)fasta\". It's British, \"r\" almost lost\"\n M: \"I never hear eehh.. heard the British eee.... speaks like you. Try watching Harry Potter! I never find eee..... the way to pronounce like you do!\"\n S: \"Hellloooow guys?! What are you talking about? I'm talking about aaaa..... a boy and ee... you both is... eee... how to say malah talking about grammar!!\"\n T: \"Sorry, sorry Stell. Continue it!\"\n S: \"No! I'm not mood again now!\"\n M: \"Stell! Don't how to say ngambek dong....\"\n T: \"Stell! Don't say you how to say mangkir from promise to treat us tansu (ketan susu)!\"\n S: \"I'm not how to say mangkir. I will treat you eee.... tansu later... maybe tomorrow... now I'm gonna back to ee... my camp! I want to how to say nyapu and how to say ngepel ee... my room! My room is so dirty, there are eee.... so many ee... how to say debu!\"\n T: \"Dust!\"\n S: \"Yes... dust! Hei.. how about how to say sapu Tess? I always forget the English of sapu\"\n T: \"Broom!\"\n S: \"Yes... groom!\"Pickup Lines  Dalam Bahasa Inggris dikenal istilah \"pickup lines\". Kalau kamu ke Google Translate, Google tidak tahu arti dari \"pickup lines\" karena Google tidak pernah ngegombalin cewek seperti kamu yang tukang modus murahan. Oleh sebab itu, kamu dapat menanyakan padaku arti dari \"pickup lines\" dan contoh-contohnya. Di bawah ini adalah contoh-contoh pickup lines:Romantic Pickup Lines Cheesy Pickup Lines Vulgar Pickup Lines Literary Pickup Lines  DISCLAIMER: These are literary pickup lines which are used for intellectuals. Don't try these to your crush, because these are intellectual chat up lines. You are not worth because you are not intellectual.Indonesian Modus Speech  Speech means \"pidato\". Dalam berpidato berbahasa Inggris, usahakan fokus dan jangan kebanyakan e.... a... anu..... dll. Yang terpenting dalam English speeching adalah mind-mapping, body language, gesture, eye gaze, dan sex appeal. Di bawah ini adalah contoh Standard English speech: Ladies and gentlemen. It's nice to see you all here. As the more perceptive of you probably realize by now, this is hell. And I'm the devil, good evening! But you can call me Toby if you like. We're gonna keep things informal here, as well as infernal. Well, you're all here for eternity, which I hardly need to tell you is a heck of a long time. So you'll get to know each other pretty well by the end. But for now, I'm gonna have to split you up into group. First, murderers, over here please! And then.... looters and pilladgers over here, beside murderers. And also thieves, if you could join them? Ahh... yes, lawyers coupled with corruptors, will you join them? Thank you. Then, fornicators! If you could step forward please? O My God, there are lots of you... umm, if you could split into two, male adulterers and bitches for the rest. For male adulterers, if you could form a line in front of that abattoir devil on the corner then, please? Thank you. And next is atheists! Atheists, over there please, form a line by yourselves! You must be feeling right bunch of nitwits? Never mind. And finally theists. All theists from any religion, form a line behind atheists please. I'm sorry I'm afraid the Pagans were right. So you can stop fighting, started from now. Next... ah! The French!! Mr. Napoleon Bonaparte and your army. If you could come down with the Germans and Adolf Hitler over here please! I'm sure you have plenty to talk about. Well now I'd like to tell you the most important thing related to the hell that we don't have any toilet here. If you read your Holy Books, you might have seen that hell was a damnation without relief. So if you couldn't enjoy yourself in hell, then I believe that's the point. Well, it's all over for now. I'll catch you all later for dessert. Bye-bye!Translation  Translation (ilmu tarjamah) adalah ilmu tentang penerjemahan dari Bahasa Inggris ke Bahasa Indonesia dan atau sebaliknya. Menerjemahkan suatu bahasa itu tidak bisa dilakukan oleh sembarang orang dengan sembarangan, walaupun orang itu jago berbahasa Inggris. Sedikitnya butuh waktu 5 abad 5 tahun 5 bulan 5 hari 5 jam 5 menit 5 detik 5 milidetik untuk mempelajari ilmu tarjamah.

Inilah akibat dari mengandalkan Google Translate.Serapan Bahasa Indonesia ke Bahasa Inggris  Sejak kecil di sekolah kita diajarkan bahwa bahasa Indonesia banyak menyerap bahasa-bahasa asing seperti Bahasa Arab, Bahasa Cina, Bahasa Portugis, Bahasa Belanda, dan bahkan Bahasa Inggris. Padahal kenyataan yang sebenarnya merekalah yang menyerap bahasa kita. Kehebatan Indonesia di masa lampau tidak diketahui karena sedikit sekali prasasti yang ditemukan. Namun kalau kita sadar, banyak sekali ditemukan bukti Bahasa Indonesia adalah sumber dari setiap bahasa asing. Dalam hal ini, di bawah ini adalah daftar kata-kata Bahasa Inggris yang diserap dari Bahasa Indonesia.Tips dan Trik Belajar Bahasa Inggris  Dalam mempelajari bahasa Inggris, ada beberapa kata yang paling gampang diingat oleh orang-orang yang baru belajar bahasa Inggris, terutama oleh orang Indonesia, dimanapun dia berada, yaitu kata 'Yes' dan kata 'No'. Kata ini sangat mudah dihapal bahkan oleh anak balita sekalipun karena hanya terdiri dari tiga dan dua huruf. Tapi tanpa disadari oleh mereka, justru dua kata inilah kata yang paling jorok dan vulgar dalam bahasa Inggris.\nTidak percaya? Silakan Anda tonton film-film porno, baik itu buatan amatir maupun profesional, terutama film-film porno buatan WiWid, BrangBros dan sebagainya. Cara mendapatkannya terserah Anda, mau beli di Glodok bisa, di kaki lima juga banyak, atau minjem sama temen yang berotak mesum boleh, unduh sendiri dari internet ga masalah asal punya bandwidth yg cukup, atau ngintip orang yang lagi nonton juga bisa. Bahasa Inggris yang paling sering diucapkan dalam film-film tersebut adalah \"Oh, No... Oh... Yes... Yes... Yes...\" Sangat vulgar sekali bukan? Bahkan sejauh mata penulis memandang dari kejauhan, kata ini pun mulai digunakan oleh para pembuat film porno dari negara lain. Singkat kata, kata 'Yes' dan 'No' itu identik dengan film porno, hampir semua film porno menggunakan kata ini baik tercatat dalam naskahnya ataupun sekedar improvisasi dari sang pemeran, kecuali film porno bisu dan film porno yang sama sekali bukan bahasa Inggris, tentunya.\n\nUntuk itu, berhati-hatilah dalam mengajarkan bahasa Inggris, terutama pada anak-anak di usia dini. Jangan mendahulukan mengajarkan kedua kata ini, karena apabila anak-anak sudah dididik vulgar sejak dini, mau jadi apa generasi kita nanti???Lihat pula Trivia Tolololpedia Mainan Tolololpedia Kentut  Jingle Programs Channel 6 Kentut adalah kegiatan dimana mahkluk hidup mengeluarkan gas buangan dari lubang yang berada di bawah belakang (anus), seperti sebuah knalpot kendaraan. Kentut berbeda dengan kentu yang berarti suatu kegiatan yang disukai oleh cewek yang masih rapat lubang yang membuat para pria senang memainkannya. Namun gas buangan ini tidak terlalu jelas terlihat, kecuali sedang berada dalam air. Gelembung-gelembung udara akan tampak di belakang orang yang sedang kentut. Kentut, sama seperti bau mulut: hanya bau akibat containernya. Oleh karena itu sering-seringlah gosok gigi agar tidak bau mulut. Namun jangan gosok anus dengan sikat gigi, karena selain jorok, hal itu sangat tidak higenis. Apalagi sikat gigi tersebut dipakai untuk menggosok gigi juga. Kegiatan ini sangatlah merugikan karena mencemari lingkungan sekitar dengan polusi udara atau suara (bahkan sampai menyebabkan GOMBAL WARMING dan perubahan iklim), namun belum ditemukan cara untuk mencegahnya sampai saat ini. Untuk memperjelas persoalan kentut, alangkah baiknya kita membaca buku \"The power of fartness\" Rumus ilmiah:Definisi Kentut  Guru Matematika: \u201cSesuatu yang tidak bisa dikali namun baunya bisa dibagi-bagi\u2026\u201d Guru Kesenian: \u201cBunyi nadanya terletak pada kunci K.\u201d Guru Fisika: \u201cInilah yang di sebut inner power, tenaga yang di gunakan kecil namun hasilnya luar biasa.\u201d Guru Biologi: \u201cInilah ciri makhluk hidup melanjutkan hidupnya.\u201d Guru Agama: \u201cIni salah satu penyebab batalnya wudhu dan shalat.\u201d Guru Geografi: \u201cPosisi keberadaannya mengikuti arah mata angin.\u201d Guru Sosiolog: \u201cPerilaku menyimpang pada sikap manusia.\u201d Guru Sejarah: \u201cSalah satu penyebab terjadinya perang mulut\u2026\u201d Guru Bahasa: \u201cKalimat bisa di tulis namun aromanya tak bisa di ungkapkan dengan kata-kata\u2026\u201dAliran-aliran Kentut  Pada dasarnya aliran kentut, menurut kentutologis ada tujuh belas saja yaitu:Aliran keras, mungkin terpengaruh oleh musik rock.  Intinya suara kentut terdengar sangat keras dan tanpa tedeng aling-aling. Mereka berpendapat bahwa kentut haruslah disampaikan secara nyata, tidak boleh sembunyi-sembunyi. Namun aliran keras ini terpecah belah menjadi beberapa kelompok yang masing2 ngotot dengan pendapatnya dan merasa paling benar, seperti \"aliran keras dan lama\", \"keras namun sebentar\", \"keras dan bau\", ada juga aliran sempalan lainnya.Aliran sunyi alias diam-diam  Intinya mereka berpendapat bahwa kentut merupakan masalah \"privat\" yang merupakan rahasia, sehingga harus dinyatakan dalam kesunyian. Aliran sunyi ini juga tak luput dari perpecahan, yang paling seru adalah antara kelompok \"sunyi tapi bau\", dan \"sunyi tapi lama\". Mereka berselisih pendapat, mana yg lebih diutamakan \"lamanya\" atau \"baunya\". Sekarang, sudah terbit buku The Power Of Kentut. Jadi, kentut juga sudah jadi komoditas yang diperjualbelikan. edan...! Pendapat aliran sunyi ditentang keras oleh aliran keras dengan menganggapnya sebagai \"munafik\", namun aliran keras juga dianggap terlalu \"vulgar\" dan kurang \"memiliki citra rasa\" dalam berkentut. Akhirnya, perdebatan kedua kelompok diakhiri dengan demonstasi dari jagoan kentut dari kedua aliran. Sayangnya, penilaian tidak berlangsung dengan baik akibat semua penonton pingsan, mengakui kehebatan kedua aliran tersebut...Aliran sesat  Nah, ini dia aliran kentut yang tidak peduli dengan segala kaidah-kaidah yang ada. Pengikut aliran ini, biasanya kentutnya menyimpang dari orang normal, misalnya kentut melalui hidung, melalui puser, mulut, bibir (seperti mas Tukul), bahkan Malah ada juga pengikut aliran ini yang ngomong biasa pun ababnya bau kentut. Pengikut aliran ini yang terkenal, adapun Amingwati, Olga Syahputri, Paris Hilton dan Cinta Laura(karena itu ngomongnya monyong-monyong, karena sebenarnya ia sedang kentut). Aliran ini diciptakan Barney. Sebagai bukti, sebenarnya jika perkataan Barney itu dikaji secara cermat dan oksilat secara slowmotion, akan terdengar: \"Ai....brot brot...lop.....brot brot...brotot...brotot...brotot brot.....yuuu......pretperetpetperetpetpet...broooooooooooottt...pret...yuuu....brot...lop....brot.....mi.....bruoootttt.......wi arrrrr...brot brot....hepi..brot....fe..brot..mi..brot..liiiii...........brot brot brot brot JEDUARRRRRR\"Qualitas Kentut  Menurut kesepakatan terakhir para kentutologist dalam Konvensi Kentut Sedunia yang diadakan di bawah pohon petai,Konvensi Kentut Sedunia 2 diadakan di bawah pohon jengkol, qualitas kentut dirumuskan dengan: Di mana: Kecepatan kentut\u00a0: Di mana \u00a0: Kk = Kecepatan kentut (km / jam) Jk = Jarak yang ditempuh kentut Waktu = Waktu yang dibutuhkan kentut untuk sampai tujuanMetode Pengukuran Kentut  Menurut Handbook of Professional Kentut, terbitan Kentut University of Alien (KUA) disebutkan bahwa metoda pengukuran kentut yang diakui ada 4, di mana masing-masing memiliki efek samping. 1. Metode Endus Metode ini paling simple tapi juga paling presisi. Caranya adalah dengan mendekatkan hidung ke sumber kentut, dan enduslah jika kentut sudah mencapai titik extrimnya. Efek samping metode ini dikenal dengan efek 4M 1P, yaitu \"Mendelik, Mual, Mabok, Pingsan dan mati 2. Metode Tangkap Metode ini kurang presisi namun justru paling populer. Caranya adalah dengan menangkap sampel kentut dengan tangan, kemudian sampel tersebut dibuka di depan hidung sendiri. Efek sampingnya adalah \"Nyengir dan Merem-Melek\". 3. Metode Hidung tetangga Ini metode yang kurang populer namun sebenarnya sangat memenuhi standar kesehatan. Caranya sama dengan metode kedua, bedanya adalah hidung yang dipakai adalah hidung orang lain (tetangga). Jika kurang hati-hati bisa menimbulkan efek 3D 1M, \"Dimaki dan Didamprat, dimusuhi bahkan yang paling berbahaya adalah tetangga itu mati. 4. Metode Kentutmeter Metode ini jarang digunakan tapi pernah dipakai oleh Obama, Albert Enstein, Benyamin Franklin, Napoleon, Archimedes, Micheal Faraday, Issac Newton, SBY bahkan keluargamu. Alat ini bisa dibeli diwarung atau beli sama Alien.Satuan kentutmeter ada 4 yaitu busuk, pesing, tengik dan apek. 1 busuk = 5 pesing = 25 tengik = 50 apek Silakan para pemerhati memilih metode yang cocok. Adapun resiko ditanggung sendiri oleh pelaku.Jenis-jenis kentut  Jenis kentut paling umum. Kentut ini bunyinya saja kencang, tapi tidak ada baunya. Dapat membuat orang yang mendengarnya jadi tuli. Kentut ini bisa dipakai sebagai pengganti beduk dan bagus saat takbiran. Kentut ini kebalikan jenis kentut yang di atas; tidak berbunyi, namun baunya tidak karuan menakutkan.

Kadang dibenci kadang dirindukan. Coba deh misalnya lolo pas lagi di busway terus ada yang kentut di samping lolo, pasti rasanya mau lolo kentutin balik karena ga terima udah di kentutin dengan semena-mena.. Dan percayalah.. kalo ga bisa kentut itu juga sangat menyakitkan.. ga percaya? Coba sumpel pantat lolo deh sehari aja.. Nah buat lolo yang hobi kentut gue pengen bagi tips supaya kentut lolo Bau nya ga terlalu mainstream, sehingga tidak menyebabkan warga satu kabupaten pingsan atau terjangkit penyakit2 menular.. 1. Perbanyak Boker Seperti halnya sampah di tempat sampah yang lama gak diangkut, Sisa makanan yang udah terlalu lama terkurung di dalam usus besar yang sudah berbentuk kotoran tentu menghasilkan bau yang sanggup membuat mad dog pingsan sekalipun. Bila tinja ini cepat dibuang, maka usus besar akan cepat kosong dan gas yang ada di dalamnya pun cepat keluar. 2. Jangan merokok dan mengunyah permen karet Saat merokok dan mengunyah permen karet kita terpaksa menelan udara lebih banyak. akumulasi udara ini bakal mengakibatkan kembung, buat perut tertekan, serta menyebabkan gas. 3. Batasi makanan yang memicu gas di perut Terlalu banyak mengkonsumsi makanan yang tinggi serat seperti kacang-kacangan dan umbi-umbian dapat memicu gas di perut. Semakin banyak gas yang terakumulasi maka kentut semakin bau. 4. Jangan Makan sambil membaca Komik Si Juki Oke, ini kelihatan kepedean, tapi gak bisa dipungkiri seluruh dunia udah mengakui kelucuan komik gue. Makan sambil tertawa menyebabkan udara yang masuk ke perut lebih banyak. Udara yang masuk bakal terakumulasi menjadi gas yang mematikan. Apalagi di support sama gambar muka gue yg bakal mensugesti kentut lolo jadi semakin bau.. PUAS LOLO PUAS? 5. Pakai deodoran di pantat Deodoran biasanya dipakai di ketek, namun itu terlalu mainstream sob.. cobalah sekali-sekali pake di pantat. Bila terjadi sesuatu yang enggak diinginkan anggep aja lolo gak pernah membaca tips sesat ini..Tolololpedia Kaskus  Kaskus adalah komunitas internet Indonesia, yang, menurut versi PC Magazine Indonesia (PMI) dan koran Lampu Merah, merupakan komunitas online terbesar dan  terpecaya di Indonesia. Dalam perkembangannya, Kaskus akhirnya mencapai tingkat kedewasaannya sebagai situs komunitas penggemar pornografi dan pornomatika terbesar di Indonesia dan masuk kedalam peringkat 10 besar di Dunia Gendeng. Dibuat di Seattle, USASubforum The Lounge  Tempat mangkalnya Kaskuser. Biasanya mereka membahas berita-berita hot ataupun gosip yang sedang in di Lounge. Kalau ada yang lagi gila, biasanya munculin bokep sebelum akhirnya di-close momod. Disini juga tempat rawan kejahatan kata-kata dengan munculnya berbagai klonengan, nubitol, dan para maho yang sangat kurang waras. Lounge juga merupakan tempat praktek para Pertamaxxx Hunter yang doyan teriak-teriak Pertamaxzx! (yg single atau dari organisasi perpakin atau IPO) untuk menerapkan ilmu jari gesitnya tapi sekarang dah tambah susah soalnya butuh waktu 120 detik sebelum berak kembali. Tapi perlu diwaspadai adalah ada beberapa TS iseng yang sengaja menggunakan embel-embel BB17+ maupun BB lain yang isinya justru gambar panas dan nakal MAHO bahkan WARIA, sukur2 jika Nong Poy yang berperawakan cantik daripada WARIA macam di Indonesia (contohnya Amingwati, Olga Syahputri) juga ada BB68+ yang isinya kakekmu dan nenekmu. ada baiknya anda menyediakan plastik untuk jaga-jaga jika anda merasa mual atau jijik.Forsup (Forum Supranatural)  Tempat berkumpulnya penggila dukun bomoh, penggemar kuntilanak, tuyul, santet, voodoo, dan hal-hal mistis lainnya yang berasal dari Dunia Gendeng.

Biasanya tempat ini digunakan untuk memperdebatkan siapa yang paling maho diantara para maho. Grunkers bintang keturunan gay laknat adalah penghuni tetap diimari, dan sudah siap menularkan sifat genetiknya. DE siprop1000 sudah kena. tiap hari kerjaannya suka gesek gesek titid ke pantat emak2 di KRL jurusan bogor. Ngeri ngeri sedap emang maen di DC, event D'bacot sudah memakan tumbal, salah satu cewe tewas gara2 ikut turnamen disitu..wallahualam. phonx adalah member tetap DC yang tidak bisa lepas dari ketergantungan menenggak pil anjing gila, dengan bicara kotor ala manusia low life hasil persimpangan perek dengan bekantan, menjadikan DC semakin terkenal sebagai SF paling tolol se-kaskus. drtommy94 adalah mantan moderator DC, yang suka ngaku paling ganteng sedunia ternyata aslinya bukan hanya paling ganteng tapi sangat sangat paling the most ganteng ever ever banget dah!!! sehingga meskipun sudah lama mengundurkan diri dari jajaran moderator kaskus tapi namanya tetap dikenang seperti halnya Indonesia tetap mengenang Toeanku Imam Bonjol sebagai Pahlawan nasional meskipun belakangan doi ketahuan sering maen perek perek padang gratisan. Debate club pada masa kepemimpinan drtommy94 adalah masa masa keemasan yang sampai sekarang tetap dikenang.Berita & Politik  Berita & Politik atau yang disingkat bp, berpol, dll adalah tempat berbagi berita terkini khusus dalam negeri yang juga berbagi opini. Di sinilah tempatnya bersemayam makhluk legenda (dibaca: op warnet) yang biasa disebut Panasbung dan Panastak. Mereka berdualah yang menguasai dan mengisi sub forum ini dengan trit yang isinya menggiring opini dari sumber yang semalem jadi, belum lagi dipenuhi trit yang menyinggung SARA dan terkadang insult pribadi diantara 2 kubu itu.

Dan masih banyak hal yang akan anda jumpai di SF terlaknat ini, silahkan ada kunjungi sendiri.Anime Manga Haven  Anime Manga Haven yang disingkat AMH dulunya bernama Anime Manga Hentai. Tempat ini adalah sarangnya anak2 autis yang hobi masturbasi pake imajinasi mereka berbentuk gambar 2D yang kawaii dan moe-moe. Sejak UU-ITE diberlakukan maka Thread khusus Hentai disembunyikan, barangkali hanya khusus untuk konsumsi pribadi moderator. penghuni2 AMH ada beberapa tingkatan, mulai dari yang teredah\u00a0: Newcomer, Mainstreamer, Pleb, Hardcore, Ethusiast (alias Entut), Elitshit, lalu moderator. Moderator AMH ialah moderator yang paling tidak netral sekaskus raya, kalau ada keributan/perkara sering memihak kelas Elitshit / entut / hardocre, sedangkan orang2 yg otakunya dibawah hardcore sering dibully, lantaran \"you haven't watch thousands of animes\". Moderatornya dulu banyak tapi sekarang cuma dua dikarenakan yang lain sudah masuk Rumah Sakit Jiwa karena mengidap Delusi Kartun Kronis, moderator tersisa cuma Omegampret dan Kaitoein, cuma Kaitoein yg rada baekan. Penghuni2 AMH juga gampang dibedakan, newcomer (noob), mainstreamers, dan normalfags biasanya demen bahas anime2 & manga mainstream macam Narutard, Baju renang, Silit Asu Onlen dan sebagainya. Kalo yang agak tinggi dikit biasanya demen anime/manga lebih sophisticated lagi kyk Berserk, , Re:tard, Fuuka, Mekibau Shitty Actor, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, anime2 jebolan Studio Geblek, dan sebagainya. Ada pula yang kelompoknya penyuka anime2 khusus JONES macam\u00a0: IDOLM@STER, K-On!, Kantai Collection, Lucky\u2605Star, Love Live!, Pretty Cure dan sebagainya. Sedangkan biasanya yang Elitshit jarang mau nimbrung di sub anime / manga, merasa dirinya ekslusif & lebih sering nimbrung di Lounge Fanstuff entah membahas hal2 keautisan apa lah yang orang2 normal tidak akan mengerti, terutama username Galapeak07 (ter-Pe'ak) serta otaku_idiotic, songongnya setengah mati, padahal aslinya hanya seorang Hikikomori yg gara2 keseringan di depan komputer sudah merasa paling sok jago Programming / computer art design. Kalo elu bukan penghobi yg Hardcore ke atas, sebaiknya jauhi dan hindari conversation dengan orang-orang ini. Jangan kepancing debat sama orang2 tingkat Elitshit kecuali elu sudah menonton anime 1000x lebih banyak daripada orang2 tsb. FAKTA\u00a0: Semua kalangan di atas Hardcore (entut, elitshit, termasuk Moderator AMH) adalah penyuka objek seksual Anak kecil, alias PedopilMukaloe  Berbagai hobi bisa anda temukan dan dibahas disini.dari hobi merajut, menyulam, menyiksa, menyodomi, sampai hobi melakukan garkon (garuk-garuk kontol)/galer (garuk-garuk peler). Namun Jangan harap bisa menemukan bokep disini, apalagi celana dalemnnya Cincau LawrahNightlife  Subforum yang isinya informasi dari lokasi bar dan/atau tempat pijat yang menyediakan pelacur-pelacur beserta harga; rekomendasi pelacur dan testimoni dari member kaskus yang sudah menggunakan para pelacur.Movies  Subforum yang melegalkan sharing film bajakan ilegal Indonesia secara cuma-cuma. Akibatnya ketika Kaskus bikin film sendiri malah filmnya jadi nggak laku soalnya pada lebih suka nonton lewat downloadtan film ketimbang bioskop. Selain itu juga, terdapat review film yang isinya sok menjelek2kan padahal orang-orang yang mereviewnya sendiri kalo disuruh bikin film juga kagak bisaGosip Cok!  Biasanya orang-orang disini sangat cepat mencari berita infotainment sehingga kadang-kadang orang TransTV datang mencuri berita. Kecepatan berita di kaskus.us adalah 360 KM/jam, sehingga kadang kejadian yang belum terjadi sudah nongol duluan di kaskus.us dan sudah muncul beritanya... ((Hebat amat)), atau bisa juga malah berita palsu karena sang pembuat trit pengen terkenal kayak Roy Sukro.Sains & Teknologi  Subforumnya anak2 NERD. Sub saintek adalah surganya orang2 Atheis yang amat bangga dengan segala pengetahuan yang ia punya. Terutama username Pedo-one, mantan anak AMH yg nyasar di forum Saintek, sangat mati2an membela Teori Evolusinya Darwin, sering memojok2an agama samawi (islam, kristen, yahudi), padahal secara gak langsung ia mengakui bahwa dirinya keturunan monyet. Paling seru kalau Pedo-one adu debat sama username Bakairu, kaskuser tertolol yg berargumen hanya berdasarkan asumshit belaka + kebanyakan Cocoklogi.Mandi Cuci Kaskus & FJB Kaskus  Mandi Cuci Kaskus gunanya untuk mandi, pipis dan boker. Sedangkan FJB kaskus, atau Forum Jongkok Bareng kaskus atau Forum Jualan Bamfava (bahasa Ghana dari kakus), adalah tempat jualan kakus/toilet di Kaskus. Pilihannya beragam, mulai dari yang toilet duduk, jongkok, berdiri atau bahkan tiduran. Mereknya juga banyak. Misalnya Toto, American Standart, Ina, sampai yang gak ada mereknya juga banyak. Kalau anda mau beli kakus disini, harap berhati-hati. Kadang kakus yg dijual disini adalah kakus second hasil rekondisi (bergaransi pin 1 minggu dan mesin 1 bulan), dan kebanyakan adalah kakus selundupan melalui batam jadi jangan heran kalo anda masih dapat mencium aroma2 yg tidak diinginkan pada toilet yg dijual disini, bahkan tidak jarang uang anda bakal lari duluan dibawa kabur TS nya.User yang harus dihindari jika ingin aman berbelanja di FJB Fight Club  Ini adalah Debate Club sebelum akhirnya diganti namanya karena ancaman UU-ITE User-user tolol & dongo pun muncul di sini semacam si raja homo(atau maho alias manusia homo) semacam lie78 yang nangis nangis karena id bokepnya di banned. dan Akhirnya lahir kembali dengan Nick Id yang so sweet banget , Katak4n_Cint4_P4d4koe_S4y4n6 .capek DeH... Mirip banget kaya id Clarita_b0k3p. yah mungkin memang soulmate atau memang lahir bareng kembar siam nempel di kontol, kebetulan saat di operasi dapet kontolnya fifty-fifty? Si kemenyan anak pantat pun dilahirkan dari FC ini. beliau berhasil menjadi moderator dengan sejumlah konspirasi, solusi & halunisasi. Sekali lagi ini bisa terjadi karena kemalasan si american_riviera yang suka berak di celanaBB+17  Atau disebut BB\u306e\u5341\u4e03(BB j\u016b nana?) (bahasa miyabi)Seharusnya anda daftar Kaskus sebelum datangnya rezim UU-ITE karena BB+17 bisa memuaskan nafsu anda. Ini adalah rumahnya bokep sebelum akhirnya tentara Roy Suryo datang dan meniduri semua wanita disana. Biasanya kamu atau Kaskuser pasti liat ini 'katagori' sebelum temen kamu liat yang lain, bahkan sebelum kamu liat kaca utk berhias bagaikan maho di pagi hari. BB++17 kebanyakan gambar cewe jepang sexyDisturbing Picture  Tempat dimana semua bokep pemuas nafsu birahi atau BB+17 legal setelah diberlakukannya UU-ITE. Diasuh oleh Zeza, moderator yang ngaku-ngaku terganteng di kaskus.KSPsK  Tempat dimana para Kaskuser (terutama dari DC) mewek entah itu ama sesama Kaskuser, Momod, atau bahkan Mimin. Biasanya, Anda akan menjumpai terjadinya shitnetron di tempat ini.Fenomena MAHO  Istilah maho ditujukan kepada orang yang suka kepada sesama jenis atau biasa disebut makhluk hombreng, makhluk hot, manusia homo, mahasiswa homo, malingsial homo, atau apalah yang seperti itu. Awal nya kata MAHO DItemukan oleh Rotiapelke4 (aka applebreadke4, sekarang jaman canggih, roti apel pun bisa ngaskus), Pada saat krisis kaskus, roti apel ke4 membuat kata maho untuk mendingin kan kaskus, ternyata kata maho di maling oleh andrew darwis sang momod dan roy suryo untuk men-tag temen mereka yang homo. Kata maho singkatan dari MAhluk HOmo kayak Yang lagi baca. Riset yang dilakukan oleh roy suryo mengatakan bahwa, 68% pengguna kaskus merupakan kaum-kaum maho. Riset ini dibuktikan dengan maraknya pemberitaan tentang ryan si penjagal dan kasus MAHOnara,serta penggunaan font Mahoma yang kerap muncul di kaskus. Clarita menjadi Icon maho paling terkenal disini .. . . bla bla blaFenomena SARA  Fenomena SARA (Suku Agama Ras dan Antar golongan) memang sudah bukan rahasia umum lagi di kaskus semenjak kaskus baru mulai berdiri. SARA akan ditemukan di mana saja selama ada sosmed yang menggunakan username anonymus. contoh username2 yg doyan SARA sudah disebutkan di atas. Orang bijak pernah berkata\u00a0: \"Jika kau ingin mengetahui karakter asli seseorang, berilah ia sebuah Topeng. Maka ia akan menunjukkan muka aslinya.\"Penyebab-penyebab SARA Cara moderator kaskus menghukum pelaku SARA  Moderator menindak SARA sesuai dengan keparahan & kekambuhan si pelakuSFRO  Atau Sub Forum Ragnarok Online, tempat berkumpulnya orang-orang mesum yang suka coli di WC umum untuk membicarakan masalah seputar RO, suatu game di mana sebagian besar pemainnya adalah MAHO. Di dalam sub forum ini, biasanya para MAHO saling membuat janji ketemu maupun janji dengan om-om. Terkadang maho-maho ini menjadi sombong dan menganggap forum tersebut adalah miliknya sendiri, sehingga mereka biasanya mengusir, melempar bata, atau mengeban para anak-anak maho baru yang ingin bergabung. Biarpun maho hati mereka sangat sensitif. Tapi kalau sudah marah jadi seperti gorilla bencong sama kaya yg bikin tulisan ini.Tolololpedia Mak erot  Penulis artikel ini yang pemenangnya XLR8 WE AKU SAYA BENCI BELLWOOD Mak Erot adalah ratu yang paling terkenal di Indonesia.

Tolololpedia Barney  Barney adalah mahluk hidup yang tidak jelas kebinatangannya. Barney bernapas lewat bokong, berwarna ungu, dan ia suka menjilati meki Hande Pamuk . Barney lahir dalam keluarga yang gila melakukan hal-hal yang tidak senonoh. Karena itu, Barney dan adiknya yang berwarna hijau menjadi terpengaruh, selain adiknya barney juga memiliki 4 pengikut setia dari perwakilan ras: si item, si negro dan 2 si amrik. Setiap hari si makhluk ungu gambris ini juga membawa ajaran cabul dengan kitab suci Kama SutraKarier  Barney \"Maha Laknat\" adalah sang anak homosexual sekaligus penggemar pelacuran dan sodomi di kalangan anak-anak. Dia sering muncul di stasiun televisi bule dan menghibur anak autis untuk menarik perhatian mereka agar pelacurannya selalu sepi selalu ramai dikunjungi terutama oleh anak-anak . Dalam melaksanakan tugasnya, Barney biasanya dibantu ke-4 temannya yaitu Teletubbies. Barney sebenarnya tidak berkelamin, karena itu dia suka melihat anak sange melakukan perbuatan orang dewasa. Agar dikira berkelamin, Barney mempunyai kebiasaan untuk menempelkan pisang ungu yang sangat besar di selangkangannya yang baunya seperti TPA Bantar Gebang. Barney juga suka pergi ke warung membeli sutra dan jika sutra di warung habis dia akan membeli Album Julia peres yang berhadiah Sutra, agar dikira 'nggak punya'. Anak kecil menyukai Barney karena Barney memiliki kemampuan hipnotis yang dia pelajari dari Roy Suryo. Sihir Barney yang paling ampuh adalah 'Ai lov yu, yu lov mi, wi ar meki femeli'. Karier Barney melunjak semenjak membuka cabang pelacuran di taman lawang dan Dolly. Pelanggan utama Barney adalah anak-anak berpenis kecil yang pandai ngeseks. Karena itu, anak kecil adalah nilai plus baginya agar tidak menimbulkan rasa sakit yang berlebih dan tidak menyumbat saluran pernafasannya. Dalam ajaran Barney, terdapat seseorang yang sangat doyan makan dan sangat diidolakan oleh Barney, sehingga Barney mengirim makhluk tersebut ke Neraka, makhluk tersebut adalah Chowder, tetapi dora merupakan pujaan orang-orang yang lebih suka makan(tai) ketimbang melakukan hal-hal yang diajarkan Barney Cabul Barney menciptakan sebuah agama yang mengajarkan ummat manusia agar bebas melakukan homoseksual dan pelacuran, tentunya agama tersebut tidak diridhoi dan merupakan jalan yang sesat, Barney mengatakan jika semakin banyak hal sesat seperti apapun akan dibalas oleh iblis penyiksa yang warnanya juga merah seperti devil dengan wajah yang tidak jelas, satu - satunya cara agar hidup senang dalam agama Barney adalah berbuat sesat , semakin banyak bejat , anda akan selalu dekat dengan iblis karena anda telah menjalankan perintah si Barney yang cabul kayak si om Roy. (ini mungkin karena Barney masih ada hubungan kerabat dengan Roy Suryo.) Untuk menarik perhatian anak anak, Barney menggunakan sihir aneh berupa nyanyi nyanyian yang dapat 'merangsang' gairah seksual anak anak kecil manapun. Banyak contoh lagu Barney yang telah tenar, seperti MANTRA TERKUAT SEPANJANG MASA!!! yang ber lyric an seperti berikut; \"ai lap yu, yu lap mi, wi ar meki femeli wit e big ug an big 'penis' tu yu lod u say u lov me tu\" namun, mantra sihir ini merupakan mantra yang telah di revisi, salah satu cuplikan lyric asli lagu tersebut adalah; \"aim horni, yu horni, let's start apter yu redi\". namun lagu tersebut tak di publikasikan karena barney takut dengan mak Erot. Contoh mantra lain dari Barney yang tak sempat di publikasikan adalah \"buaya darat\", yaitu lagu yang keburu di publikasikan oleh duo ratu karena saat akan mempublikasikannya, barney sedang pergi ke mak Erot untuk di pijat agar pisang miliknya semakin besar, sehingga ia di sangka 'punya' (padahal waktu itu mak Erot tertipu untuk memijat pisang ungu dia, bukan 'barang' sesungguhnya. Barney sempat bekerja selama 12 abad di rumah mak Erot sebagai pemuas nafsu mak Erot. seusai bekerja di sana barulah barney memulai debut nya dengan menyewa sebuah kontrakan kecil yang merupakan tempat kerja para Teletubbies, yaitu sebagai PSK (Pelaku Seks Kanak - kanak) di mana mereka menarik anak anak sekitar dan memperkosa mereka satu satu tanpa pandang bulu, baik lelaki maupun perempuan secara nafsu. barney merasa tertarik dengan pekerjaan para Teletubbies tersebut, sehingga barney ingin bekerja sama dengan para makhluk hina tersebut untuk membangun sebuah Padepokan Pambejateun di daerah Ciawi, dimana para balita diajarkan cara untuk 'ngentot' oleh Barney dan Teletubbies. Para kru televisi yang anak anaknya hilang mendadak langsung menyiarkan agama cabul Barney beserta kegiatan maksiat Barney serta antek - anteknya melalui liputan khusus. Sialnya, saat sedang diliput, anak anak mereka tidak keburu di hipnotis dengan mantra sihir andalannya; \"ai lap yu, yu lap mi, wi ar meki femeli\" sehingga anak anak mereka memperbolehkan para orang tuanya untuk menjelek jelekan Barney di depan layar kaca. Sejak saat itulah Padepokan Pambejateun Barney anjlok, sehingga ia 'dibenci' oleh anak anak di kalangan dunia, luar angkasa, maupun makhluk halus dan makhluk jadi-jadian lainnya seperti Tukul, Olga Syahputri, Roy Suryo dan JKT48. Saat bisnisnya anjlok, iapun berteman dengan pembalap mobil dan atlet olahraga nggak karuan seperti Michael Schumacher dan Mediakus. Mereka berdua dikenal sangat sangat bersahabat dengan Barney. Ia sangat sering menelpon maupun SMS, bahkan chatting BBM dan Line dengan mereka. Walaupun Barney tidak mengerti Bahasa Jerman dan Bahasa Lithuania, ia bisa mengerti apa yang dikatakan oleh mereka. Sejak berkenalan, Barney mengajak Michael Schumacher untuk berguru dengan Mulan Jameelah untuk belajar menciptakan agama. Setelah Schumi lulus, Barney pun senang dan mengajak bule-bule yang lain untuk menganut ajaran Schumi. Sejak pengikut Schumi bertambah, Barney pun menjalankan bisnis lagi dan hubungan Barney dengan Schumi lekat hingga menjadi  sahabatnya. Kebiasaan Barney dan Schumi saat bekerja adalah diskusi bareng teman kerja, percobaan dan penelitian. Di waktu senggang Mereka sering mendengarkan lagu Kontes Lagu Eurovision  dan menonton semua saluran Eurovision TV. Akhir-akhir ini ia sedang senang-senangnya dengan Eurofest, sinetron Tvrki dan konser dadakan.Agama Yang Dibawa oleh Barney  Barney membawa sebuah ajaran yang dia sebarluaskan di Televisi, sejak ia membuka Padepokan Pambejateun di Ciawi, Bogor. Ajaran ini hanya mengandung hukum mencabuli anak di bawah umur, pelacuran, homoseks dan sebagainya. Tololnya, agama ini didukung oleh banyak negara (khususnya Amerika Serikat dengan gelar \"Negara Terbejat Di Jagat Raya\" ), dan tokoh ternama seperti Sm*sh, coboi junior, Roy Suryo, dan lain sebagainya. Walaupun 68% penduduk di bumi saat itu telah menganut agama Barney sehingga agama Islam dan Kristen pun bergeser. Contohnya di Indonesia, kasus pencabulan 200 anak yang dilakukan Emon, itu adalah dampak ajaran Barney. Walau  begitu, Agama Barniesme cukup merugikan para Jameelahisme. Ada sekitar 68.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868.686.868 insiden yang melibatkan Jameelahisme, dan insiden yang paling besar adalah insiden ketika Mulan Jameelah hampir dicabuli oleh 68 pengikut fanatik Barney, disitulah Agama Barney mulai banyak pertentangan. Anti Barney mulai muncul setelah insiden itu, dan mayoritas adalah Jameelahisme dan orang tua anak yang menjadi korban nafsu bejat Barney dan sekutunya. Anti Barney dikomandoi oleh  Hiccup (Bahasa Inggris\u00a0: Cegukan, sungguh tolol orang ini), bocah Skandinavia yang (sok) pintar dan memiliki dendam yang luar biasa terhadap Barney, karena pernah dicabuli oleh makhluk yang satu spesies dengannya, namun dia sendiri pernah berbuat bejat dan itupun atas inisiatifnya sendiri. Hiccup disanjung-sanjung dan disebut sebagai \"Juru Selamat Umat Barneytopia\" karena menurut manuskrip kuno Barneytopia, tertulis: \"Akan datang kepada ummat Barneytopia seseorang dari barat, berambut kecoklatan seperti banci Taman Lawang, tampan(g) blo'on, sok pintar, sok mirip dengan Bajak Laut hanya karena memiliki kaki palsu yang sudah termakan usia, namun akan membebaskan ummat Barneytopia dari kejahatan iblis ungu yang berbahaya dengan kekuatan sihirnya mengendalika semua tokek yang ada di muka bumi ini.\" Toh memang benar kejadiannya. Suatu saat, Hiccup bersama tokek hitam andalannya, Toothless (bahasa Inggris\u00a0: Ompong *bener-bener tolol tuh orang*) diikuti oleh mak Erot dan beberapa orang lainnya menyerbua padepokan Barney, ketika itu Barney sedang mempraktekkan posisi membuat anak dengan baik dan benar tanpa luka atau lecet, ke 68 santri-nya. Seketika 34 santri diculik, dan Barney berhasil dihipnotis olehnya dengan kekuatan sihir 10 tangan. Namun naas, Joko Tingkir Wingkir datang dan menampar wajah barney, alhasil Hiccup dicabuli Barney dan Teletubies. Untung dia berhasil keluar hidup-hidup. Walaupun dia memiliki ilmu mengendalikan tokek yang tingkatannya sudah maqom, tapi tetap dia tidak mampu mengendalikan Barney karena iblis telah menyusup dalam diri Barney. Tapi ia berhasil mengendalikan tokek-tokek lain yang telah disusupi pengaruh jahat dari Barney. Justru bukan Hiccup sang Juru Selamat yang menghancurkan Agama Barney, tapi sebuah kesalahan teknis TvOne saat meliput tentang biografi Padepokan Pambejateun pada azan magrib yang ditayangkan. Disana tertulis \"Padepokan ini adalah asu, anjing, tolol, bego, antek yahudi, dan sebagainya\". Sejak itulah orang2 penganut agama tersebut meninggalkan agamanya.Lihat Juga Tolololpedia Bobokep  Majalah Bobokep adalah sebuah majalah pembunuh akhlak bangsa. Bobokep 68% sering dibaca oleh anak SD, SMP, SMA,Orang GEndeng, sampai SLB. Sisanya adalah kakek-kakek yang kena penyakit stroke lalu diberikan majalah ini kemudian sehat kembali. Bobokep pada awalnya adalah alat yang dibuat oleh orang Belanda, yang tujuannya untuk menjadikan si pembaca menjadi anak buah Dolly, syurkurlah majalah Bobokep ini tidak laku. Lalu Bobokep dipublikasikan oleh perusahaan Kompos Gramedia dan PT tegalan, yang kantornya berada di kota wonosari.Sejarah  Bobokep lahir hari Kamis tanggal 14 Maret 1973. Harganya saat itu Rp.68,- saja tapi karena itu edisi paling pertama, dimurahkan jadi Rp.32,-. Kemudian mereka terbit dengan mereka anggap \"tahap baru\" hari Kamis tanggal 15 Februari 2007.Siklus Penerbitan  Bobokep terbit setiap hari Kamis minggu ke-1 tiap bulan, tapi paling hari Senin udah terbit, mungkin karena para pembaca cepat banget gak sabarannya. Majalah Bobokep berharga Rp.10.000 di Taman Lawang sebenarnya harga di Dolly dan sekitarnya Rp.11.000 tapi banyak orang murahkan jadi Rp.10.000 juga. Sedangkan di Tukulnesia harganya 10.000 Rupiah Ndeso. Di Dunia Gendeng, harganya 7 kolor buluk. Sedangkan saja di Qayyumnesia, Wardinesia, Republik Rio, Melodinesia, dan Widhinesia, harganya mengikuti harga Indonesia.Daftar rubrik  Majalah ini berisi beberapa segmen, atau biasa dibilang rubrik oleh Bapakmu (itu bukti bahwa Bapakmu juga suka baca juga). Diantaranya sebagai berikut:Apa Kabar, Bo(kep)?  Rubrik ini berisi surat-surat penggemar yang ditujukan kepada Bobo(kep), kadang malah surat tagihan listrik dari PLN atau surat tilang, bahkan surat cinta dari kamu untuk Roy Suryo pun ikut ditampilkan. Rubrik ini dulunya diasuh oleh Roy Suryo, tetapi karena jawabannya selalu \"68%\" atau \"32%\", rubrik ini pun diserahkan hak asuhnya kepada Dr. Boyke nan Ganteng Bagi Para Homoers sekalian termasuk Coboy Junior dan Sm*sh. Pernah rubrik ini tidak ditampilkan karena banyaknya SPAM alias Surat Penggemar Antar hoMo yang masuk.Profil  Seperti namanya, rubrik ini berisi profil-profil bintang-bintang porno. Superkonde mencetak rekor dengan 8 kali masuk rubrik ini di majalah Bobokep. Mbokmu pernah masuk kedalam rubrik ini untuk diwawancarai seputar perselingkuhannya dengan Gorila dan Roy Suryo. Edisi yang memuat profil Mbokmu langsung terjual habis karena edisi tersebut sangat disarankan oleh Departemen Kesehatan dan Barney sebagai kertas untuk muntah dan cebok. Selain Edisi Bobokep Mbokmu, edisi bobokep yang selalu habis adalah Edisi Maria Ozawa dan Ariel-Luna-Cut Tari.Pengetahuan  Rubrik ini berisi segala pengetahuan  yang membuat anda menjadi lebih tahu, dan bisa juga membuat anda tidak tahu, karena tahu-tahu, pemilik perusahaan tahu sumedang memiliki sebuah istri bernama Tak Hoe dari Cina.Ensiklobobo(kep)  Sebuah ensiklopedia (tentang bokep pastinya) yang biasa diselipkan di setiap edisinya. Mungkin majalah ini ingin menyaingi tolololpedia yang lebih canggih lagi, lebih benar lagi, dan yang lebih edan lagi, hanya ada di TOLOLOLPEDIA. Bagian ini membahas tentang dan cara .Potret Negeriku  Rubrik ini memotret setiap kehidupan di negeriku, mulai perjuangan Amingwati membuka usaha toilet anjing herder, sampai teman sekelas kamu yang minta dibelikan film bokep Maria Ozawa kepada ibunya. Diduga rubrik ini mendapatkan potret2 tersebut karena mereka memasang sebanyak lebih dari 70 juta kamera tersembunyi dari Sabang sampai Merauke, termasuk juga dikamar tidurmu dan dikamar tidur ibumu.Arena kecil dan Tak disangka  Arenanya ada di tempat yang jauh di sana, Bobokep hanya membagikan kupon masuk bagi pemenang pertama lomba Mencabuli Mulan Jameelah dan Amingwati dalam 1 jam. Kupon keluar hanya bisa didapat jika tidur bersama Roy Suryo selama 1 bulan. Tak Disangka adalah rubrik tentang orang-orang yang tidak menyangka akan didatangi bintang-bintang bokep dan diselingkuhi (atau bisa juga menyelingkuhi). Arena Kecil sendiri adalah sebuah arena kecil-kecilan bagi orang yang ingin \"mencoba\" Bintang Porno milik Bobokep.Cerpen  Cerpen adalah cerita pendek yang isinya tentang bagaimana seseorang dapat  dengan orang yang . Kadang-kadang cerpennya malah catatan harian pribadi penulisnya. Lihat aja di beberapa cerpennya. Tokoh utamanya disebut \"Aku\", tapi malah kadang nama aslinya di disebutkan. Biasanya pula, tokoh utama yang disebut \"aku\" itu, perempuan.CERBUNG  Cerbung itu Cerita Bersambung, kalau di Bobokepnya Roy Suryo bisa jadi \"Cerita Gembung\". Katanya sih supaya 68% lebih bokep! Untuk lebih jelasnya silahkan lihat , kebanyakan membaca Cerbung bobokep dapat mengakibatkan anda 68% lebih maho.Bona dan Bokong  Bona dan Bokong adalah dua sahabat, Bona berbentuk seperti omprengan, sedangkan Bokong adalah hasil peranakan antara Gayus dan Roy Suryo, mereka selalu mengajarkan anak-anak kecil cara berganti teman homo atau lesbi, secara praktis serta cara menggunakan pil penenang.Dear Nimala  Isinya curhat cewek SD yang ngeluh gak bisa minta  sama cowok pujaanya. Suratnya akan dibalas dengan Nirmala yang punya cara (gak) jitu dan ampuh. Tapi kadang-kadang isinya curhat cowok SD yang mencari . Kadang-kadang, sarannya bukan asli oleh Nirmala, tapi Roy Suryo!!

This is where users request Testing Administrator rights and permissions. Generally, users who are Administrators on other wikis, or are reasonably established users in whom other wikis have placed demonstrable trust, and would like to test the administrative tools, can request to become Testing Administrators here at ATW. \u00a0Important: Testing Administrator privileges are granted at the sole discretion of the adjudging Bureaucrat.

I want to make sure that this wiki stays how Spike left it. He put a lot of hard work into setting it how it is and I wish to continue his legacy (there are several recent edits I have made that should have been made by an admin or bureaucrat, and I notice that a recent test admin was promoted without an RfR, something which Spike would \"turn in his grave\" about if he knew, since he put a lot of work into creating(?) and maintaining the process ). I had asked Spike previously about being given bureaucrat, he gave me some additional tasks to do (I can't remember what they were) as a way of earning it. I am already a Testing Administrator and an AbuseFilter Editor, and I am bureaucrat/sysop on several other (now defunct and unused) wikis, so I'm aware of the role and how it should be handled. Bureaucrats are the ones who close RfRs here on ATW, so Administrator isn't really much further use on top of Testing Administrator. Jeff G. is also the only Active Bureaucrat (as Spike was for a long time too), which means if he were to fall into inactivity, the wiki would be dead.  \u2014 Spydar007 (Talk) 08:55, March 25, 2018 (UTC)Support/Oppose/Neutral/Comments Bureaucrats\u2019 closing notes and conclusions Decision Pagafanta  Pagafanta (talk \u2022 message \u2022 contribs \u2022 WMFglobal contribs \u2022 deleted contribs \u2022 page\u00a0moves \u2022 user creation \u2022 block\u00a0user \u2022 block\u00a0log \u2022 24 edits \u2022 source logs \u2022 target logs \u2022 | WPrfa \u2022 WPrfb \u2022 WPrfarb \u2022 WPrfc \u2022 WPlta \u2022 WPcheckuser \u2022 WPspi \u2022 WPsocks |rfr \u2022 spi \u2022 socks | current rights \u2022 rights log \u2022 WMFrights log \u2022 WPrights log |  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022 rollback \u2022 admin | UHx \u2022 UtHx \u2022 UtE) (assign permissions)\n\nHello, I am sysop on Italian Wikipedia and I wanted to test some scripts here.

I've been in the process up cleaning up the wiki, removing unused redirects and fixing links. The current admin is the only admin active on the wiki, and she sometimes is gone for several days at a time. I was sort of thrown into the moderator roles and am still trying to figure everything out. I'd like to become an administrator here so that I have a space to be able to mess with settings and not worry about harming my home wiki, and also be ready to take over in the future if the current admin becomes less active. Someone should be ready who knows what they're doing.

I suggest you change that slightly. Instead of recreating an entire signature code from scratch, make your original signature take paramaters and default those paramaters to what your 'default' signature uses. Then, when you wish to create a new signature, simply alter thos paramaters. For example, your Halloween signature could look something like this instead.  or something similar. You basically route the new template through the old template instead of creating a brand new one that will need to be error checked each time. If you have any questions, or want me to configure your original signature to accept what I am proposing, let me know and I will be happy to ablige.

This is the second time I am telling you this. Look at how many lines of code you\u2019ve left in this heretofore small thread? I told you to speak to Gracey or Rappy about how to minimize your sig\u2019s footprint on pages on which it is placed. A signature that is too long to fit in the box provided for signatures at Special:Preferences, must be transcluded and not substituted. Since you\u2019re here, you can also ask HBH to tell you how to transclude and not substitute your signature. After all, that\u2019s how he was putting his old signature \u2014 that also contained tonnes of code \u2014 on talk pages. If you keep cluttering up talkpages with so much signature code, we are going to have to limit your access until you get it fixed. Thanks! \u2014 SpikeToronto 07:57, November 9, 2011 (UTC) HBH: If you are looking for a variation of the pulldown signature, you might want to look at the one at User:SpikeToronto/sigDropdown. The way it works is that the first two lines are local, and the last two lines are your home wiki. So, in my case, were I to use the sig at Central, the first two lines would be links to my Central user and talk pages, while the last two lines would be links to my home wiki\u2019s user and talk pages. \u2014 SpikeToronto 07:57, November 9, 2011 (UTC)Your wikia.css  Why am I in your Wikia.css?

Artix Kreiger (talk) 13:38, July 30, 2018 (UTC)Admin Tools Wiki Administrators  Administrators, commonly known as admins or sysops (system operators), are wiki editors who have access to technical features that help with maintaining wikis. Different users have access to different site functions. While anyone can do most things on the site, including reading and editing, Administrators can access a few additional functions. For a complete list of users who currently have Administrator access, see Special:Listusers/sysop.Types of Administrators  At Admin Tools Wiki (ATW), there are two types of Administrators:Active Administrators  Active Administrators are ATW\u2019s actual Administrators, who assist the Active Bureaucrats Group (ABG) with the maintenance of the wiki. The following comprise the Active Administrators Group (AAG): Like the Active Bureaucrats Group, the members of the Active Administrators Group are available to assist you should you have any questions. \u00a0Note: The highlighting for the Active Administrators Group is a darker shade of green than that for Testing Administrators.Testing Administrators  Testing Administrators are those members who have been granted the sysop bit at ATW primarily for testing the Administrator tools, and other non-admin testing. These Administrators are welcome to assist with the day-to-day maintenance of the wiki, but generally do not, preferring instead to use what they glean here on their home wikis. Like all members of ATW, Testing Administrators are welcome to participate in all aspects of the ATW community (e.g., talkpage discussions, Noticeboard discussions, Requests for Rights, Requests for Bot Approval, etc.) Finally, through participation and maintenance activities, a Testing Administrator may become an Active Administrator. It\u2019s really up to the individual! \u00a0Note:\u00a0\u00a0The highlighting for Testing Administrators is a lighter shade of green than that for members of the Active Administrators Group.Administrative tools  Administrators have \u201ctools\u201d to do certain things that help with maintenance. See the Administrators\u2019 how-to guide for a guide on using Administrator functions and tools. At ATW, Administrators are permitted to wheel war in the context of testing (i.e., continuously and repeatedly revert Administrator testing actions).Deleting  Administrators can delete and undelete pages, page histories, and uploaded files. On other wikis, deletion is normally done to remove vandalism or not needed pages. On Admin Tools Wiki, deletion is also done to delete vandalism and not needed pages, but deletion can be done as tests, which means Administrators can delete any page as long as it doesn\u2019t have Category:Pages not to be tested on on it. Should a Testing Administrator delete any other page, s/he must restore it immediately thereafter.Protection  Administrators can protect and unprotect pages. On other wikis, protections are usually done to prevent vandalism or disruptive editing to certain pages. It is also done to protect widely used pages that have high-risk. On Admin Tools Wiki, while page protection may occur for the very same reasons, it is usually done as tests. This can be done to any page as long as it doesn\u2019t have Category:Pages not to be tested on on it. Should a Testing Administrator alter the protection settings of any other page, s/he must return the protection settings to their previous state immediately thereafter.Blocking  Administrators have the ability to block and unblock users from editing for a period of time, which is determined by the blocking Administrator. (See Admin Tools Wiki:Blocking policy (shortcut \u2192 ATW:BLOCK).) On other wikis, blocks are usually done to prevent users from vandalizing or disruptive editing. On Admin Tools Wiki, blocks may also be performed for testing purposes. Should a Testing Administrator perform a test block, and that block is not set to expire soon thereafter, s/he must unblock that user immediately.Other  For more information on when and when not to use administrative tools, please refer to our testing policy.Adminship  Bureaucrats have the ability to grant Administrator privileges to users. Users can become an Administrator by requesting it at Admin Tools Wiki:Requests for rights (shortcut \u2192 ATW:RFR) where the Admin Tools Wiki community will review your request. An active Bureaucrat will make the final determination whether or not to grant the requestor the sysop bit.De-sysoping  Bureaucrats are able to \u201cde-sysop\u201d Administrators. This can occur through one of two processes: In most cases, it is not unusual for a de-sysoped Administrator to also receive a block of some duration.See also Admin Tools Wiki Check mark templates Admin Tools Wiki Wikipedia skin Admin Tools Wiki Bureaucrats  Bureaucrats are Admin Tools Wiki (ATW) users who have the technical ability to grant Bureaucrat, Active Administror, Testing Administrator, AbuseFilter Editor, ChatModerator, Rollback, and/or bot privileges to other users via Special:UserRights. They, along with the Active Administrators Group, are the maintainers of this wiki, and help the wiki run smoothly having access to a few more features than do regular users. Bureaucrats manage and watch Admin Tools Wiki:Requests for rights (shortcut \u2192 ATW:RFR), an important place here at ATW. They promote users to Testing Administrators soley via formal requests made at ATW:RFR. For other privileges, users may approach an active Bureaucrat via the latter\u2019s talkpage. Bureaucrats also monitor and maintain the Noticeboard, making sure that all the posts have been resolved.

(I think) I just created the Wikia Classic Menswear Wikia I appear not to have admin status. I Googled this, and the two other cases of this occuring someone had accidentally taken over a blank and defunct Wikia and in the other case, the user had logged into an account other than the one he used to create the Wikia. I don't think either of these are occurring here. Under my preferences, I just have the title \"user\" and \"emailconfirmed\"Admin Tools Wiki Rswfan Admin Tools Wiki Qweedsa About me  Hey there, I'm Qweedsa, user and adminisrator of this wiki since 23rd February 2009 and a bureaucrat since 25th June 2009. Also, I'm an administrator of a specific project here on Wikia. My username on Wikimedia projects is also Qweedsa. I'm active at russian Wikipedia, where I'm an editor and rollbacker (link), and also make episodic contributions to enwiki. For more information you may visit my Central Wikia user page.Admin Tools Wiki  If you want to test the tools by being an administrator of this site, you're welcome to visit the requests for rights page. However, in case you have any problems, or questions, or suggestions, or something else worth to talk about, feel free to let me know by editing my talk page . For non-public issues, you can e-mail me. Additionally, you can find me on freenode IRC channels:  and .

This policy applies to all users at Admin Tools Wiki.Testing Administrators  Testing Administrators are able to do multiple things with the tools they have. The following is what is allowed to be done:Page protection  Pages can be protected and unprotected whenever an admin wants in order to test the protection tool. Testing Administrators may protect and unprotect any page they want to test the undeletion tool. Repeated protections and unprotections of pages are not considered wheel wars on this wiki, but may be considered wheel wars on other wikis depending on those wikis\u2019 policies.Notes Deletions  You may feel free to test page deletions on almost any page on the wiki, subject to the following notes.Notes Blocks  Users can be blocked and unblocked whenever an admin wants to in order to test the block tool. But it is very important that if a user is blocked that you know if it was a test block or a real block. In order to tell them apart, users that have been blocked as tests will be marked as a category, Category:Test blocked users or no category at all. Real blocked users will be marked with the category, Category:Blocked users. The templates for blocks are the following: For tests, add {{Test block}} to users user pages and for real blocks, add {{Real block}} on their user page. When you block a user whether it is for tests or if it was real, please add the appropriate block templates to their user pages. Not adding the correct template or adding the template at all to user pages when issuing real blocks is highly frowned. Another thing that should be avoided is making mass numbers of test blocks. Please do not do this. You may be desysopped if you abuse the sysop powers.Bureaucrats  Bureaucrats should not use the tools as tests. Using the bureaucrat tool has to be done in serious purposes, like when promoting a user who has proven they are a trusted editor on an established wiki either by talk page, email, IRC or at Admin Tools Wiki:Requests for rights. Using the bureaucrat tools as tests will also be frowned and will possibly lead to losing the bureaucrat permission depending on the situation.Editing  All users are able to make tests edits around the wiki. Users are allowed to create any page with any title and edit any page unless it has the category, Category:Pages not to be tested on. Any type of editing here can generally be done here at Admin Tools Wiki unless it constitutes vandalism, advertisement, or anything else that harms the wiki. If a page has not been editing for a while, preferably about a week and if the page has very little meaning or text, it may be deleted by any administrator. Pages that are quality pages that have a substantial amount of good content should not be deleted until more time passes.General  Pages that have the Category:Pages not to be tested on at the bottom should not be tested on. Abusing this policy may result in you being desysopped and possibly blocked, depending on the situation.Admin Tools Wiki Pages not to be tested on  Pages listed here should NOT be tested on in any way. This means that administrators shouldn't delete, protect, or make test edits. This applies to non-admins as well. Admin actions and edits should only be done if necessary, not as a test. Many of the pages in this category are important pages or pages that help with maintenance of the Admin Tools Wiki. Test edits made to pages listed here are frowned upon and may result in your desysoping depending on what kind of test edit you made.  \nPurge this pageAdmin Tools Wiki Qweedsa Thanks  Thank you for processing my RfR so promptly.

Since that time, Rappy and I have taken the bull by the horns and worked up a new look for the main page. It can be viewed at Admin Tools Wiki/2012 Revision. It is still a work in progress and is not ready to be rolled out. For instance, in the Recent Wiki Activity module, we still need to insert in the h2 an Add a page button. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Please leave comments, suggestions, etc., right below here on this talkpage.

The file MediaWiki:Common.css/tabView.css is then imported into MediaWiki:Common.css. What I do not know how to do is to limit these modifications to the mainpage only. An unfortunate side effect of the current, wiki-wide implementation is that it impacts the use of TabView anywhere at ATW (example). If anyone can figure out how to limit the application of MediaWiki:Common.css/tabView.css to the mainpage only, that would be great!

I see your point that if we go ahead and add social networking stuff to our site, then it may send the message to Wikia that we have been successfully co-opted to their social networking goals and objectives. However, Wikia is not going to deviate from its corporate strategic plan, an integral part of which is Wikia challenging Facebook, Twitter, etc., for a share of the social networking market. That train has left the station and is going full steam ahead to Wikia\u2019s intended destination smack in the middle of social networking territory. As for the Google+ icons, etc., I assume you are talking about the footer way at the bottom of the page. For now, that is just some experimentation that is being gone through. Like the tabs, it is not entirely final. But, the Google+ and the Facebook buttons are on the user\u2019s account, not ATW\u2019s. What I mean is that when one clicks on the Facebook button, one is connected to one\u2019s Facebook account, not ATW\u2019s; ATW does not have a Facebook page and, with all probability, never will. Finally, the Twitter button is not for tweeting; it merely subscribes the user to ATW\u2019s newsfeed (which, as you can see, is highly popular ). I hope this clarifies things somewhat. I too am not overly sympathetic to Wikia\u2019s social networking plans, but these small implementations let us here at ATW approach that realm on our own terms.

When I first read your comment, back when you posted it, I didn\u2019t really have anything to add. But, since you\u2019ve nudged me to take another look, here are some thoughts. Visually the bloglist takes up space because the left side of the main page is currently tabbed. As I said, the tabs may be dropped, with us returning to the fully opened up mainpage; I seem to be the only one who likes the tab idea. And, while I like the tabs, I do not like the imbalance it creates between the two sides of the page. As for productivity, I was referring to the rest of the right, mainpage, \u201csiderail\u201d and other things to be added to it. The bloglisting is not intended to be a productivity tool, per se. Hence why it is at the bottom of the column. From time to time, certain blogs, could fall into the productivity category when they are presenting new changes to the wiki in greater detail than a sitenotice or tweet permits. For the most part, however, the blogs are for community building. I would like anyone who wants to, to write a user blog on whatever topic is of interest to them (so long as it is not simply nonsense, and is coherent, salient, and has something to say). I\u2019d even like to see Kangaroopower write a blog! St. Valentine\u2019s Day is coming up. Want to give us your thoughts on love and romance? The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre? Whatever you did it would be uniquely your own and topical! \u2014 SpikeToronto 06:40, January 22, 2012 (UTC)Changing skins  --218.186.15.10 (talk) 08:53, March 14, 2012 (UTC)Admin Tools Wiki Requests for rights/PlasmaTime/2   PlasmaTime (talk \u2022 message \u2022 contribs \u2022 WMFglobal contribs \u2022 deleted contribs \u2022 page\u00a0moves \u2022 user creation \u2022 block\u00a0user \u2022 block\u00a0log \u2022 245 edits \u2022 source logs \u2022 target logs \u2022 | WPrfa \u2022 WPrfb \u2022 WPrfarb \u2022 WPrfc \u2022 WPlta \u2022 WPcheckuser \u2022 WPspi \u2022 WPsocks |rfr \u2022 spi \u2022 socks | current rights \u2022 rights log \u2022 WMFrights log \u2022 WPrights log |  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022 rollback \u2022 admin | UHx \u2022 UtHx \u2022 UtE) (assign permissions)\n\nHello, I am PlasmaTime, formerly, TheBen10Mazter.

Despite the name, these titles have nothing to do with how much you crunch. They are based solely on the number of posts you make. Here is how it breaks down:Official titles  World Community Grid Tech [Project name] ScientistWorld Community Grid Wiki Security  New members often have security concerns about World Community Grid. Letting any organisation use your computing resources isn't a decision to take lightly. Here are answers to the most common questions:Can I be sure IBM really runs World Community Grid?  World Community Grid isn't merely funded by IBM - it is managed and run by IBM staff. IBM often promote World Community Grid on ibm.com. Here is the latest press release from IBM concerning World Community Grid: http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ibmgives/news/african_climate_home.shtml Also, have a look at this video where Stanley S. Litow (President, IBM International Foundation and Vice President, IBM Corporate Community Relations), and Ligia Elizondo (Deputy Director, Bureau for Resources & Strategic Partnerships, United Nations Development Programme) talk about World Community Grid.Can I be sure the software is what it says it is?  All the World Community Grid software is digitally signed. The BOINC software is signed by the University of California.Can I be sure the software has no known vulnerabilities?  IBM does regular security audits of the software. This includes the agent software that you download, and the project software written by the scientists. The BOINC software is open source, so security bugs are usually found very quickly. Make sure you use the version of BOINC recommended by World Community Grid. Other versions have not undergone the rigorous testing process by World Community Grid.How is the grid kept safe from hackers?  The World Community Grid servers are located in a secure IBM data center. Their physical security is as good as it gets. All the communication between World Community Grid and your computer uses SSL. This is the same level of encryption used by websites for online shopping and banking. The last part is up to you. You need to keep your own computer secure and up to date, running the latest firewall and antivirus software.Is there anything I can do to further reduce BOINC's attack surface?  Yes! Run BOINC with minimal permissions, as a service/daemon. In addition, you can set these advanced options in cc_config.xml:<disallow_attach>  This option prevents users from attaching BOINC to additional BOINC projects. Make sure you attach to World Community Grid before setting this option!<dont_contact_ref_site>  To determine if a physical network connection exists, the client occasionally contacts a highly-available web site (google.com). If this flag is set, this behaviour is suppressed. This flag also suppresses a periodic fetch of a project list from boinc.berkeley.edu. Note: BOINC 6.2.28 contacts ibm.com instead of google.com.<suppress_net_info>  Prevent sending your private IP address and domain name to servers. Note: even if you don't set this option, your information is not visible to anyone except World Community Grid.World Community Grid Wiki Installation Windows Vista  If you want step by step directions, use the installation walkthrough (Vista).Quick start  Download the installer from the World Community Grid website.External links Linux (Ubuntu) Packages  boinc-client boinc-managerExternal links Linux  http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/ms/viewThankYouAll.do?platformPick=linuxMac OS X  http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/ms/viewThankYouAll.do?platformPick=macWindows  http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/ms/viewThankYouAll.do?platformPick=winFreeBSD  http://people.freebsd.org/~pav/boinc.htmlOpenBSD  http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/forums/wcg/viewthread?thread=16481World Community Grid Wiki Result status codes  Tasks can be tracked through their entire life-cycle using the Results Status page. Here is a more detailed explanation of each World Community Grid result status:Translations  Result statuses in languages for which website translations are available:Related topics External links World Community Grid Wiki Deadlines  Standard deadlines World Community Grid requires work sent to volunteers' computers to be returned within a set time limit. This is to ensure the overall project batches do not get delayed. At the same time this facilitates the participation of devices that are on only a few hours per day. E.g. home computers can process a project in the background whilst doing email, web browsing and other housekeeping chores. The principle is that every cycle counts and a work unit eventually does get completed. Frequent checkpoints will let these jobs resume very near to where they were shut down the previous time.High priority tasks  Rush jobs to make up for tasks missing deadlines are usually a fraction of the original task deadline, but are generally sent to those computers known to World Community Grid for quick, valid returns and high current uptime history. The deadline algorithm is: A reliable host is one that: This measurement includes the impact of queue size because a larger queue size will lengthen the 'turnaround' time for a task and push the computer out of the 'reliable' metric.Beta tasks  Beta tasks have varying deadlines depending on criteria like pre-launch testing or bug resolution. Again they have short return time requirements and are only distributed to those volunteers that specifically elected to participate in the testing programs and usually have their computers on 24/7 with permanent internet connection. The maximum cached amount of work by a BOINC client 10 days and can either be set in the My Grid \u2192 Device Manager \u2192 Device Profile \u2192 Profile of Choice \u2192 Custom Options \u2192 Cache, or in the versions 5.10 and higher of BOINC clients using the Advanced menu \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Network Usage \u2192 \"Additional Buffer Days\" option.How BOINC manages deadlines  BOINC does not run work in deadline order. Normally, BOINC schedules tasks in the order they were received. Rush jobs will show messages like \"Running - High Priority\" and others like \"Waiting to Run\" if paused or preempted during the general state of Earliest deadline first (EDF) by some referred to as panic state when the order of processing is strictly according to which jobs needs to be completed soonest, irrespective of project. It is not recommended to exceed 8 days of work buffer if e.g. running the 10 day deadline sciences, alone or in a mix, simply because of potential outages, particularly if work is only returned periodically. Take computer down time and variability of buffered task run times into consideration! Secondly, do not fill up the buffer with brand new projects as they could have infant bugs in the new science software. An initial full size production could reveal those late ones and cause a client to process large volumes of work that might in fact be bad. WCG can remotely cancel that work when aware of a high failure rate, but only if the host is on-line and has a scheduled contact with the project servers. For information on the number of copies circulated to arrive at proper quorum validation visit the FAQ: Minimum quorum & Initial Distribution of Work Units (Tasks) Late tasks generally do not get credit granted unless completed and sent back before the Extra Copy is returned. If not in time they get marked as \"Too Late\" on the Result Status page and get zero credit!Related topics World Community Grid Wiki Result log warnings  Result logs contain the raw log data from the science application. Some of the messages marked as errors or warnings are benign and expected. Sometimes, these warnings can be misleading when a task fails for some other reason.

The other measures of contributions (results and runtime) are not suitable for comparison because there is considerable variation in result size, and runtime treats fast and slow computers equally. Over the years, World Community Grid have tried various improvements to the credit system, attempting to make it fairer, and discourage cheating. Since points are perceived as having value, it is an emotive subject.United Devices credit system  The discontinued United Devices agent used a weighting system that scored different components of each computer system. The system had some major limitations, and was discontinued at the same time as the United Devices agent.Normalisation based on quorum claims Classic BOINC algorithm  The standard method used by BOINC projects is to discard the highest and lowest claims and average the rest. This average is then granted to every valid result. World Community Grid used this method until inaccurate benchmarks introduced an unacceptable bias.Outliers  To compensate for inaccurate benchmarks (both accidental and deliberately inflated) World Community Grid developed a method for discarding only statistical outliers. Claims that were slightly anomalous were simply excluded from the average, and extreme outliers were not only excluded, the result was granted half credit in an attempt to discourage the use of clients with grossly inflated benchmarks. This method is no longer used.Normalisation based on past performance  This method was developed to allow quorums to be reduced to 2. With only two claims to consider, there is insufficient information to choose which claim is most accurate, and simply averaging the two claims leads to a sizeable distortion in granted credit if a computer consistently over claims or under claims. The way that credit is awarded in a quorum of two is that the two claimed credits are compared and if they are within 30% of each other, then they are averaged and the average value is granted. Over 85% of workunits have the granted credit determined this way. If the two claimed credit values are further then 30% apart, then the code looks at a field in the database which stores the recent average credit granted per second for each computer. Whichever computer's claimed credit per second for the workunit is closer to their recent average credit granted per second has its claimed credit used as the credit granted for the workunit. What we found was that there were a few computers that were extremely consistent about claiming very low so they always caused the workunit to check the recent average history. Because they were consistently claiming low and it was matching their average granted credit they were being selected as the credit to use for the granted credit. We determined that these computers were claiming low by looking at the history of computers they were paired with and seeing their history - and indeed those other computers had a much lower grant when paired with one of these computers. As a result, we are going to change how the 2nd part of the process works. Instead of selecting the credit that is closest to its history, we will average the recent average histories for the two computers. We have been simulating the impact of this for the past couple of days and it turns out that in a strong majority of cases the result cpu time * host recent average credit per cpu second is actually quite consistent between different computers even if their claimed credit are further apart. This is what we had hoped to see and as a result we will start to use this policy in the near future.Related topics References World Community Grid Wiki BOINC beta testing  When Berkeley release a new version of BOINC, World Community Grid do not adopt it immediately. Instead, new releases undergo a thorough vetting process:How to help  There is no formal process. All members need to do is try out the new software and report any problems.Are Berkeley releases supported before they are adopted by World Community Grid?  Yes and no. Members are free to use versions not officially recommended by World Community Grid, but if problems emerge, the first troubleshooting step will be to downgrade to the recommended version. Note: Berkeley pre-release (alpha) versions are not supported at all. Support is available directly from Berkeley instead.World Community Grid Wiki Checkpoints  Complex models do not provide many opportunities to save the status of the task to disk. Some projects would just grind to a halt and make the PC less responsive. It is the objective of World Community Grid to ensure that this does not happen and make the process strictly 'in the background and unobtrusive'. For that reason checkpoints are used to secure the data already computed. These checkpoints also are a good moment to close the BOINC client without it resulting in substantial progress loss on restart. The timing of checkpoints are not always easily to determine, but sometimes the graphics provide a visual indication. Some of these checkpoints usually translate to some or considerable flickering of the hard drive light for a number of seconds, but only if the files to save are larger. The graphical screens for this agent has less detailed elements or depending on operating system are not available. To see them, go to the Tasks tab of the advanced view (version >= 5.8), select the task in progress and click the 'Show Graphics' button in the left margin. If the button is grayed, no graphics are available. Accurate time intervals cannot be given between checkpoints as they are very dependent on the speed of the computer and how much idle time is available to perform the science projects. When running on BOINC and interested to see an actual record of check-pointing shown in the Message Tab, you need to create or edit a file called cc_config.xml  and turn on the logging with <task_debug>1</task_debug>. Restart BOINC or from 5.8.11 and up, use the 'Advanced' menu > 'Read Config File' to activate the additional message recording. Deactivation can be done by replacing the 1 by 0 and repeat the restart/read action. Set your BOINC throttle at 100% otherwise you will get a ton of output (other utilities can emulate the throttle outside of BOINC!). From BOINC version 5.8.16 logging of all checkpoints can be activated with the <checkpoint_debug>1</checkpoint_debug> log flag entry in the cc_config.xml file. All parameters in this file can be changed with a text-editor and effectuated immediately by using the 'Advanced' > 'Read Config File' menu option.

Thanks! --116.48.73.246 12:15, 31 August 2009 (UTC)Translation of Akapit \"Getting Started\" into German completed  Hello Didactylos, I am happy to inform you, that I completed the translation of the huge akapit \"Getting started\" into German. This is one third of the World Community Grid Help. In my opinion, it would be really good to start using this text as official help text. In other words: I kindly ask you to transfer this text on the WCG website. I did the hole text as one person and I am ready to certify for its quality and style. If needed, I am ready to go to the IBM branch in Berlin, Germany, to identify myself and give information about my qualifikation and funktion. In this way, I could, if needed, underline, that you can trust in my translation. In my opinion, we should not wait for the completition of the whole text, I cannot guarantee that I will go on translating at this speed. And It would be really necessary and helpful, if the German users of WCG could start benificiating of a German version of WCG help right now. Be sure that I will not ask for transfering the next texts into official help before completing the next huge accapit \"Overview\". Sincerely waiting for an answer. Yours Martin Schnellinger Hello Didactylos, thank you for the information. With your answer you give me the possibility to ask a question which is really important: Is the grid officially working on an official translation into German? The reason I would like to know this, is as follows: If they work on an official translation of the WCG website into German, especially the help resources, they will for sure prefer their own translation. If so, I would stop translating in the German viki, because it seems of little sense translating the same thing twice. I hope you agree. Even if I like the Grid and I like translating, nevertheless it still is work, not only fun. When I have looked on the screen doing somthing with concentration for two hours, then my eyes tell me that they feel it. Of course, in the end, this is my problem. Nevertheless, to me it seems that World Community Grid should make a fundamental decision whether to accept volunteer translations. I have heard, that you yourself make an English WCG Viki. Could you please explain to me, for which people and for which purpose the VIKI is made? The whole WCG website already is in English, so what for a Viki??? In the end, I would like to tell you, that even if I did sensles work translating I will still suport the grid. No need to worry. Please give me an answer to my question. All the best to you.

The email addresses are not visible to the sender but are to the receiver, which is why World Community Grid allows members to specify a different email address for this purpose. In instances where a captain created a team and went dormant or AWOL for longer and no response is received, the member can start by bumping the team thread in the Teams forum asking to the leadership to show their countenance. Quite a few teams actually have their own forum, unaffiliated with World Community Grid. The team page often provides a link to find that. Some captains rarely or never post on the World Community Grid forums, yet chat away elsewhere quite abundantly.Replacing a missing team captain  If the former does not result in waking the captain up and the mail contacts lead to no reaction or the mail function was not activated, the World Community Grid staff can intervene. Send Support@WorldCommunityGrid.org a request to poll the captain. A team member in that case could ask for a message to e.g. handing over of the function. WCG will send a message to the captain's last known email address and if no response is received within a reasonable time, the admin will clear the position for another team member to assume the job. After the exercise either the WCG support team will reply, confirming or rejecting the request or will execute the change for the 'active' team member. Mind you, this is a routine related to team captaincy. WCG will not facilitate contacting one or the other member because of a best body being silent. Privacy is highly respected. If a member joins a team but did not switch on the mail function, then that will not be bypassed. Similar requests for removal of a team member will not be acted on. Circumstances have to be very exceptional would deviation of that policy be entertained.

Below are changes due to happen, which will affect the terminating points of services. Changes to timetables are included. Services highlighted in Yellow are newly added to list/ /2018  This is a list of all the Network West Midlands bus routes in the West Midlands County, England.UK Transport Wiki National Express Coaches  National Express is the brand under which the majority of long distance bus and coach services in the United Kingdom are marketed, and also the company that manages this network and operates some of the services. Most services are subcontracted to local bus and coach companies throughout the UK, as specified below. The brand and company are based in Birmingham and are owned by the National Express Group, a group of diverse transport interests also including passenger rail operators and local bus operators.History  The National Express brand was created in 1972 by the state-owned National Bus Company (NBC) to bring together the express bus and coach services operated by companies within the NBC group. The National Express network was largely a branding and management exercise, with services continuing to be operated by the individual companies. With the privatisation of the NBC in the 1980s, National Express was subject to a management buy-out in 1988. In 1992, National Express Group plc was floated on the London Stock Exchange with a remit to acquire new businesses in the passenger transport market, with National Express as a subsidiary company. During 2001, National Express took a very unpopular decision to end the historic on-board steward/ess service, leaving many passengers on buses for up to six hours without food or drink. Phil White, their then MD had stated he felt they made the company look old fashioned and passengers did not need them. The ensuing campaign by the hundreds of sacked staff, and thousands of complaints from customers did not produce any result. For most of its existence National Express Coach Division had little, if any, competition in the long distance coach market. However, in 2003 Stagecoach Group introduced a \"no-frills\" service, Megabus, whose GBP \u00a31 fares sparked a price war with National Express in autumn 2004 which is still raging on many services in and out of London today. The competition has recently intensified when in 2007 Megabus transferred its London terminus from the Greenline Coach Station into National Express UK mega-terminus Victoria Coach Station. Passenger numbers on core routes have also suffered severely due to cut-price rail fares, such as Virgin Trains' value tickets and the Megatrain (Stagecoach & Virgin) web fares.Accidents Service Brands 2007/8 rebranding  As part of a group wide restructuring and rebranding exercise, the National Express coach fleet is set to receive a slightly different livery, retaining the red white and blue theme, but with \"National Express\" changing to \"national express,\" with coaches appearing in the new livery from December 2007.2003 brands  Most domestic National Express services fall into this category, with the exception of: Frequent services from London operate as National Express Shuttle services. Most of these services operate at least once an hour and operate over direct routes - some other services deviate to serve smaller destinations. The London - Birmingham and London - Bristol services are marketed as NXL (National Express London) services and operate with Irizar PB / Scania K124 coaches. Unusually, the London - Birmingham service is operated directly by National Express and is not franchised out. Also the 040 Bristol - London Shuttle defies National Express's norm by continuing to Burnham on Sea (a small westcountry seaside resort) once a day in each direction, usually early morning to London and late evening from, but still retains its NXL shuttle branding. Shuttle services: From / To London Non-London Shuttle services National Express Airport services operate to a variety of destinations from London Gatwick, Heathrow, East Midlands, Luton and Stansted. The Airport brand was created in 2003 when the National Express image brand was updated - it merged the former Airlink, Flightlink and Jetlink brands, which were confusing, especially to passengers travelling between Heathrow and Gatwick airport. Most coaches on these services operate with the National Express Airport brand, the airport being in white inside a red box below the 'National Express' name on the side of the coach. The exception to this is the 210 service between Wolverhampton and Gatwick Airport, operated by National Express Group company Travel West Midlands, for which new vehicles purchased in early 2006 carry the standard National Express livery. It is not unusual to see 'Airport' coaches on other services. Selection of Airport services:Accessible coach routes  National Express is introducing a new generation of coaches onto the UK network that feature a wheelchair lift incorporated into the passenger entrance. The easy access coach features a wider entrance and a completely flat floor throughout the coach to aid mobility for all. A streamlined NX Magic Floor Lift is incorporated into the passenger entrance and when deployed, the wheelchair is locked in place and the customer safely and securely uses the same standard three-point seat belt as other customers. Other features include reclining leather seats, air conditioning and a large toilet. A programme of routes is currently being planned to roll-out the accessible coach across the network, with the whole network being fully accessible by 2012. The routes currently operating with the wheelchair accessible coaches are:Franchise operators  Tha majority of National Express services are contracted to local bus and coach companies. As part of the contract, operators who run services every day are required to use coaches in full National Express livery although there are a few exceptions for operators who operate irregular services (for example extras laid on at weekends). There are also some occasions where an operator will use a private-hire vehicle due to lack of availability. In addition to this, coaches from outside companies can be hired in at anytime to work \"Duplicate Coaches\" which can run alongside a route for all or some of it-an extremely common practice during busy periods. Recently some of the operators who are not contracted to provide National Express liveried coaches have begun to break away from this by using vehicles in plain white with a National Express logo on the side and a few have also acquired coaches that are no longer in regular service on the network. One such operator - Stagecoach, have created something of a quandary on many routes by being both a National Express franchisee and also operating Megabus services, the direct competitor to National coach services. Passengers watch with interest to see if this strange arrangement will have an impact on services and fares in time to come, or indeed competition laws. A current illustrated list of Coaches and their operators is available:[1] For bus enthusiasts, transport manual publisher Transport Diversions Emporium publish a weekly fanzine/annual, entitled the National Express Handbook, which details the latest official franchisees, along with detailed, up-to-date fleet information, and associated commercial developments in the scheduled coach operating field. This yearly publication is available in most bookstores, plus the internet.Discount Fare Brands  National Express offers a range of coachcards to customers which allows discounts on National Express tickets. At one point this consisted of a Student, Young Persons and Advantage 50 coachcards which allowed the holder up to 30% of the price of coach tickets. This has since been rationalised with the company only offering an NX2 card, offering the same discount to Students and Young Persons cards. Since the introduction in 2004 of half price fares for the over 60's the Advantage 50 card was scrapped, although cards are still valid until expiry. A Family coachcard is also offered and is cheaper than the NX2 card and allows the holder of the card to take one child free with them, in many cases the cost of the Family Coachcard is cheaper than the fare for a child. This is a card valid for a set period of time which allows non-UK residents (a passport of another country is needed to purchase this) travel as a standby passenger on all National Express services, the holder does however for a small fee have the option to reserve a seat. Launched as a result of severe competition from easyBus and Megabus, funfares are cheap single fares, some as low as \u00a31, purchased only on the internet as an 'e-ticket', similar to low-fare airlines, thus reducing overheads. Further restrictions are put on these tickets such as the inability to change the time on the ticket or to travel on a different coach. Funfares were launched on Shuttle services but have since been rolled out across the network. A percentage of seats on off-peak services can be booked in this way. For frequent travellers, packs of ten separate journeys can be bought for a saving of ten percent on regular fares. Tickets are valid for up to six months.Major destinations Interesting Facts  The longest service is the 336 from Penzance to Edinburgh run by FirstGroup. The entire journey takes an estimated 18 hours and 30 minutes. It stops at 41 destinations en route and is a journey mostly undertaken at night. Other long journeys include the 539 service from Bournemouth to Edinburgh run by Bruces(Salsburgh), which takes an estimated 13 hours and 20 minutes. Most destinations have easy access to London with nearly every town and city having a direct service to the heart of the English capital. Cross country services often link with north / south services at Milton Keynes Coachway on the M1 at Junction 14, a location with park and ride facilities and 24 hour cafe. To partly alleviate the continued frustration of customers who are still without hostess / refreshment services on board, overnight services using the M1 often stop at motorway service stations en route.See also External links References  Template:Scottish Bus OperatorsUK Transport Wiki National Express West Midlands  National Express West Midlands (NXWM), is the trade name of West Midlands Travel Ltd (part of the National Express Group), a company which operates bus services in the cities of Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, as well as the Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull and Walsall in the West Midlands County of England, and some adjacent areas. It is one of the largest bus operators in Great Britain, and the largest in the West Midlands area. The operator carries approximately 1 million passengers every dayHistory  West Midlands Travel Ltd came into existence on 26 October 1986, as part of the deregulation of the bus industry in England and Wales. It was previously the bus operations of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE). West Midlands Travel remained in public ownership under the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority until December 1991, when it was sold to its management and employees. In April 1995, the company was purchased by the National Express Group, and rebranded as Travel West Midlands in September 1996. On 9 December 2002, the Coventry services were rebranded Travel Coventry. The former Travel Your Bus and Travel Merry Hill subsidiaries have been merged into the main fleet. In February 2008 as part of a rebranding of all National Express subsidiaries it was renamed National Express West Midlands. The Coventry service was rebranded as National Express Coventry. The current red and white is the sixth livery to be used by the company. A seventh livery of crimson and maroon is being introduced from 2015 starting with Birmingham routes 9 and 50. Previously, the company and its predecessors have operated garages in Stourbridge, Dudley, Merry Hill Shopping Centre (Part of Travel Merry Hill), Harts Hill, Sutton Coldfield, Hockley, Cotteridge, Selly Oak, Washwood Heath and Quinton. The Dudley garage closed on 28 August 1993 to make way for the Dudley Southern By-Pass (which opened in 1999) and was replaced, along with the former Travel Merry Hill depot, by the depot at Pensnett. In July 2010, NXWM closed its Lea Hall depot. National Express West Midlands aimed for the whole fleet to be low floor by March 2010. This was achieved in July 2010, with the withdrawal of the final MCW Metrobuses in operation at Acocks Green garage.Ticketing  A two-tier flat fare structure is in operation within the West Midlands county boundary; there is a standard single fare for any distance and a cheaper short-hop fare. Cash fares can be bought from the driver on the bus, but as with some other urban operators, no change is given for security and speed of boarding. Child fares are available at half the adult cost. Graduated fares apply on some services outside the West Midlands. Daysaver tickets can also be purchased from the driver, which allows unlimited travel on all NXWM services for the whole day. Selected services have special daily and weekly return tickets available. Various types of tickets are sold in advance (off-bus), for varying periods from 1 day to 1 year, covering different parts of (or the complete) operating area. The all day Daysaver ticket, also available on-bus, includes NXWM routes running outside the West Midlands County (where single fares are sometimes higher) and services operated by sister company, National Express Coventry. NXWM generally increases fares at least once a year, with January the month of choice. Fares were increased at the start of 2016 with most fares increasing by 10p. Senior citizens (aged 60 or over) and disabled persons are eligible for free concessionary travel pass in a similar fashion to that offered in other areas. Following successful trials in Yardley Wood of the new 'Smart' system for Concessionary Travel Pass holders, smart-card technology has now been introduced on all NXWM buses. An early-bird add-on ticket can be purchased to extend the concession to cover weekday travel within the West Midlands county before 09:30. On-bus ticketing systems and point of sale units are supplied by Parkeon.Routes  Routes of significance include: Route 11 which forms the Birmingham Outer Circle is a roughly circular, 27 mile (43\u00a0km) bus route in Birmingham, England (a small section crosses into Sandwell). It mainly follows the city's outer ring road, the A4040. Operating as routes 11A and 11C, it is the longest urban bus route in Europe. Route 50 which is one of the most frequent bus services in the UK outside London and it is often suggested that it is one of the most frequent in Europe. Britain's first low floor double decker bus operated on this route. Route 65 was the first bus route in the UK to operate on a Guided Busway. Route 97 which now operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - the night service began on the 24th March 2013 making it the first regular night bus service in Birmingham for several years. Previously Birmingham had been one of the largest cities in Europe without a night bus operation. Many routes can be traced back to the days of municipal operation but network reviews have resulted in major changes to the route numbering in recent years.Route Branding  The latest route branding uses a variety of colours to differentiate routes to make it easier to see buses operating on a particular route. It is now easier to identify high frequency routes as these are generally the routes which are being branded. On some corridors routes are grouped together in the same colour scheme where they are operated with the same buses. The Platinum branded routes additionally operate in an all over silver & grey livery and WN route 1 in an all over light green and white livery (Hybrid Electric buses). So far routes which have been branded in the new scheme are as follows: Next for branding: X7/X8 (Platinum) - Purple, and X20/X21/X22 (Platinum) - CyanNetwork Reviews  At the end of April 2008, NXWM in conjunction with Centro, Dudley Council and other operators, re-routed, re-timed, and renumbered buses in the Dudley, Halesowen and Stourbridge areas. Following this, a similar process took place in Solihull in January 2009. The next one took place in October 2009 for South and West Birmingham. In April 2010 a network review for Walsall North (Bloxwich, Brownhills & Aldridge) took place. That was shortly followed by a review of services in West Birmingham. This happened at the end of July 2010. The first review of 2011 was in March for services in East Birmingham/North Solihull. That was shortly followed by a review of services in Wolverhampton and West Walsall in July 2011. A review of services in Sandwell took place in October 2012. North Birmingham and the Sutton Coldfield areas had their services reviewed in June 2013. A network review for areas around West Birmingham, West Bromwich, Oldbury and Blackheath was implemented in April 2017. In June 2017, a bus service review for east Birmingham, North Solihull and Chelmsley Wood was made. In July 2018 a network review took place for South Birmingham.Garages and Travel Shops  NXWM has ten garages - Acocks Green, Bordesley, Coventry, Birmingham Central (Digbeth), Pensnett, Perry Barr, Walsall, West Bromwich, Wolverhampton and Yardley Wood. The Bordesley garage is the newest location, having opened in 2005. NXWM has six Travel Shops located in Solihull Town Centre, Coventry Pool Meadow Bus Station, West Bromwich bus station, Dudley bus station, Birmingham Pavilions Shopping Centre and Walsall Bus Station. Additionally there is a Centro travel shop at Wolverhampton bus station and also a Centro travel shop in New Street Station. The Dudley, Birmingham Pavilions, West Bromwich and Walsall all sell all types of Travelcards, National Express Coach Tickets and assist customers with timetable information, Information on bus/coach fare and route planning. The Solihull travelshop closed, it closed on Friday 28 April 2017.Operations  National Express West Midlands unveiled in 2013 a \u00a31.6 million AVL (control) centre from which all services are monitored to help identify problems and cut response times.[16] But there are also Route Managers and Inspectors present to identify and solve issues on the road, particularly in Birmingham City Centre where most frequent routes converge.Anti-social Behaviour and Ticket Inspections  Crime (such as robbery and assault) and vandalism are an ongoing problem on NXWM buses, with travel on the upstairs deck sometimes being particularly challenging. The installation of CCTV on buses was part of the failed attempt to stabilise the level of crime. In the 2009-10 accounting period, 3,341 incidents were recorded on West Midlands buses, including theft, property damage, and drug possession. National Express West Midlands is part of the Safer Travel Partnership, created in 2005 its members also include Centro (responsible for bus, train and Midland Metro tram transport in the West Midlands) and West Midlands Police. The partnership is committed to reducing crime and anti social behaviour across the West Midlands bus network whilst providing reassurance to the travelling public. The partnership achieves this through a variety of tactics including Gateway Operations. These operations are intelligence led and are based on the established link between those who evade paying their fare and those responsible for crime, disorder and anti social behaviour. The operation involves partners including NX Revenue Inspectors and Police Officers and Police Community Support Officers from the dedicated Safer Travel Police Team. The activities of the partnership have resulted in very significant reductions in recorded crime across the West Midlands bus network. Most of the cost of 'Safer Travel' is met from public funds, rather than those of NXWM. This contrasts with most commercial enterprises, such as football clubs, which have to pay a substantial amount for policing. The 'Safer Travel' name is also used for presentations for schools 'educating children about how to respect their buses'. The 'See Something, Say Something' campaign, where passengers are encouraged to anonymously send information about nuisance behaviour on buses by text message, has led to 134 arrests and a cut in crime of 15% since April 2010. Crime on the West Midlands bus network has fallen to its lowest level in the last five years.Fleet  National Express West Midlands is one of the largest bus operators in the UK, with a fleet of nearly 1600 vehicles. A variety of bus types are used, including double-decks, single-decks, articulated 'bendy' buses, and midi-buses. In 2011 National Express West Midlands began investing in new greener vehicles, with the addition of 120 new buses to the fleet, including 18 'hybrid' vehicles. Alexander Dennis supplied 9 Enviro 400H hybrid-power double-deck models alongside 50 EEV-approved diesel Enviro 400 double-deck models, while Volvo suppied 9 B5LH Wrightbus Eclipse Gemini 2 hybrid-power double deck models, with 52 B7RLE single-deck models. The new buses were to be progressively introduced to various garages from September 2011, however due to some delays these buses began to enter service in November 2011, with the full rollout completed early in 2012. 2012 saw a further 100 new vehicles enter service, with the addition of more Wright Eclipse Urban 2 single-deck buses at Wolverhampton, Acocks Green, Birmingham Central and Pensnett garages to replace older single deckers such as Mercedes-Benz O405N and some Volvo B6LE at Pensnett garages, Volvo B10L at Acocks Green and Optare Excel at Wolverhampton. A further 30 new Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart buses have entered service on routes 99, 222 and on routes at West Bromwich garage, replacing Volvo B6LE's. An extensive refurbishment programme has seen many older buses repainted into the new livery, as well as having etched windows and upholsteries replaced. The investment is continuing in 2013, as Green Bus Funding has assisted again in the purchase of a further 21 new Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 hybrid-powered double-deck buses which have entered operation at Wolverhampton garage on route 1 (Tettenhall Wood-Dudley).

The name is a neologic version of the Latin omnibus, which means \"for all.\"History  The omnibus, the first organized public transport system, may have originated in Nantes, France in 1826, when Stanislas Baudry, a retired army officer who had built public baths (run from the surplus heat from his flour mill) on the city's edge, set up a short line between the center of town and his baths. The service started on the Place du Commerce, outside the hat shop of M. Omn\u00e8s, who displayed the motto Omn\u00e8s Omnibus (\"Omn\u00e8s for all\") on his shopfront. When Baudry discovered that passengers were just as interested in getting off at intermediate points as in patronizing his baths, he shifted the line's focus. His new voiture omnibus (\"carriage for all\") combined the functions of the hired hackney carriage with the stagecoach that travelled a predetermined route from inn to inn, carrying passengers and mail. His omnibus featured wooden benches that ran down the sides of the vehicle; entry was from the rear. There is also a claim from the UK where in 1824 John Greenwood operated the first \"bus route\" from Market Street in Manchester to Pendleton in Salford. In 1828, Baudry went to Paris where he founded a company under the name Entreprise g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des omnibus de Paris, while his son Edmond Baudry founded two similar companies in Bordeaux and in Lyons. A London newspaper reported in July 4, 1829 that \"the new vehicle, called the omnibus, commenced running this morning from Paddington to the City\". This bus service was operated by George Shillibeer. In New York, omnibus service began in the same year, when Abraham Brower, an entrepreneur who had organized volunteer fire companies, established a route along Broadway starting at Bowling Green. Other American cities soon followed suit: Philadelphia in 1831, Boston in 1835 and Baltimore in 1844. In most cases, the city governments granted a private company\u2014generally a small stableman already in the livery or freight-hauling business\u2014an exclusive franchise to operate public coaches along a specified route. In return, the company agreed to maintain certain minimum levels of service. In 1831, New Yorker Washington Irving remarked of Britain's Reform Act (finally passed in 1832): \"The great reform omnibus moves but slowly.\" The omnibus encouraged urbanization. Socially, the omnibus put city-dwellers, even if for only half an hour, into previously-unheard-of physical intimacy with strangers, squeezing them together knee-to-knee. Only the very poor remained excluded. A new division in urban society now came to the fore, dividing those who kept carriages from those who did not. The idea of the \"carriage trade\", the folk who never set foot in the streets, who had goods brought out from the shops for their appraisal, has its origins in the omnibus crush. The omnibus also extended the reach of the emerging cities. The walk from the former village of Paddington to the business heart of London in the \"City\" was a long one, even for a young man in good condition. The omnibus offered the suburbs more access to the inner city. More intense urbanization was to follow. Within a very few years, the New York omnibus had a rival in the streetcar: the first streetcar ran along The Bowery, which offered the excellent improvement in amenity of riding on smooth iron rails rather than clattering over granite setts, called \"Belgian blocks\". The new streetcars were financed by John Mason, a wealthy banker, and built by an Irish contractor, John Stephenson. When motorized transport proved successful after c. 1905, a motorized omnibus was for a time sometimes called an autobus. Bus lines proliferated in the U.S. as streetcar lines were torn out of the major cities by \"bus manufacturing or oil marketing companies for the specific purpose of replacing rail service with buses.\" This was accompanied by a continuing series of technical improvements: pneumatic \"balloon\" tires during the early 1920s, monocoque body construction in 1931, automatic transmission in 1936, the diesel-engine bus in 1936, the first acceptable 50+ passenger bus in 1948, and the first buses with air suspension in 1953. Bus services were a focal point in the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s in the United States. In the period after the American Civil War ended in 1865, racial segregation in public accommodations, including public transport such as rail and bus services, was enforced through Black Codes and Jim Crow laws in the South. These were made to prevent African-Americans from doing things that a white person could do. For instance, Jim Crow laws required bus drivers to enforce separate seating sections. These laws and enforcement varied among communities and states. In 1955, after a long day of work, Rosa Parks, a black seamstress, was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat to a white man on a public bus, bringing attention to the injustice of differential and degrading treatment based solely upon race. This incident, boycotts of bus services, other protests, and court challenges led to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling banning segregation on public buses and helped lead the U.S. Congress to pass the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act which clarified the unconstitutionality of public racial segregation laws. In some areas of the United States, a school busing system has been used to achieve racial desegregation of public schools. Under such a busing plan, children do not necessarily go to the nearest school geographically, but to such a public school in the same district where there is an appropriate mix of racial diversity.Types of bus service  Bus services can fit into several classes. Local transit buses provide public transit within a city or one or more counties, usually for trips of only a few kilometers. Intercity, interstate or interprovincial buses provide transit between cities, towns, rural areas and places usually tens or hundreds of kilometers away. They generally provide fewer bus stops than local bus routes do. Trailways Transportation System is an example of US interstate bus systems. Some local transit systems offer bus lines to nearby cities or towns served by another transit agency. Intercity bus services have become an important travel connection to smaller towns and rural areas that do not have airports or train service. Some public transit bus systems offer express bus service in addition to local bus lines. Local lines provide frequent stops along a route, sometimes two or more per kilometer, while express lines make fewer stops and more speed along that route. For example, an express bus line may provide speedier service between a local airport and the downtown area of a nearby city. Shuttle bus services provide transit service between two destinations, such as an airport and city center. Shuttle bus services are often provided by colleges, airports, shopping areas, companies, and amusement destinations. Tour bus service shows tourists notable sights by bus. City tour buses often simply pass by the sites while a tour guide describes them. Longer distance tour coaches generally allow passengers to disembark at points of interest. Some tourist buses are decorated to resemble pre-PCC streetcars in order to attract tourists or for other appearance purposes. A similar phenomenon is Duck Tours, which uses amphibious DUKWs converted into buses/cruise boats for tours. School bus service provides transit to and from school for students. Some private schools use school buses only for field trips or sports events. Some school systems, such as the San Francisco public school system, do not operate their own school bus system but instead rely on the local public transit bus system to provide transportation. Charter bus operators provide buses with properly licensed bus drivers for hire.Bus manufacturing  Early bus manufacturing grew out of carriage coachwork builders, and later out of automobile or truck manufacturing enterprises. Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body plus chassis approach has continued into modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exists integral manufacturers of complete bus or coach products. Specialist builders also build buses for special uses, or modify standard products. Modern day bus manufacturing combines a number of advanced technologies, including GPS location, passenger information systems and electronic control, and increasingly features technology to aid accessibility. Manufacturers are also investigating alternatives to the traditional combustion engine powered approach, with electric, fuel cell and hybrid bus technologies. As with the auto-industry, bus manufacturing is developing from a localised enterprise to increasingly becoming a globalised industry, with groups of manufacturers forming consortia. As with the car industry, new models are often exhibited at industry motor shows.Types of bus  In the US, due to road restrictions, the maximum width of motorcoaches is Template:Convert/in, and a maximum length of Category:Aldwych Branch The Short Streach Of Line Between Holborn And Aldwych Was Closed In 1994.The Line Was Due To be extended to Waterloo but never was.There will be a bit of Aldwych In My Website when added or Category:Aldwych Branch The Short Streach Of Line Between Holborn And Aldwych Was Closed In 1994.The Line Was Due To be extended to Waterloo but never was.There will be a bit of Aldwych In My Website when addedBus service operation and scheduling  Operation of a bus service inevitably varies from the published schedule and timetables due to a range of factors including traffic, weather, passenger loading variations, and operating staff behaviour. Schedules may be focussed on maintaining a headway between each vehicle on a route, rather setting out the exact time a bus will arrive at each bus stop. Bus crews may behave in ways which affect these headways:See also References Notes External links  Template:Commons Template:Portal Template:Buses Template:Modes of Public TransportUK Transport Wiki Arriva Southend  1. REDIRECT Stagecoach SouthendUK Transport Wiki List of bus routes in London  Template:Use dmy dates This is a list of Transport for London (TfL) contracted bus routes in London, United Kingdom, as well as commercial services that enter the Greater London area (except coaches). The major operators in the London area are Go-Ahead London, Arriva London, Metroline and Stagecoach London. Other operators in London are London United, Abellio London, Tower Transit, Metrobus, Arriva Shires & Essex, Arriva Southern Counties,Transdev London Sovereign, Quality Line, Abellio Surrey, CT Plus, First Berkshire & The Thames Valley, Uno, Carousel Buses, TWH Bus & Coach, Blue Triangle, Green Line Coaches, Sullivan Buses and Imperial Buses. There are also several operators based outside London that run services either wholly or partly within the area. These services connect London with parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.Classification of route numbers  In Victorian times, passengers could only recognise the buses of different fleets and routes by the coaches' distinctive livery colours and line name, with painted signs on the sides showing the two termini to indicate the route. Then, in 1906, George Samuel Dicks of the London Motor Omnibus Company decided that, as the line name 'Vanguard' had proved to be very popular, he would name all lines 'Vanguard' and number the company's five different routes 1 through to 5. Other operators soon saw the advantage, in that a unique route number was easier for the travelling public to remember, and so the practice of using route numbers soon spread.Historic classification  Historically, bus routes run by London Transport were grouped by the type of service that they provided. The 1924 London Traffic Act imposed a numbering scheme known as the Bassom Scheme, named after Chief Constable A.E. Bassom of the Metropolitan Police who devised it. Variant and short workings used letter suffixes. The numbers reflected the company that operated the route. The numbering was revised in 1934 after London Transport was formed:List of routes  All routes operate in both directions unless detailed.600\u2013699  The majority of routes in this sequence are run for schools to reduce overcrowding on regular bus services. Their timetables are subject to short notice alteration and re-routing in accordance with school requirements. A notable exception is route 607, which is a limited stop service operating in West London, whose number is \"inherited\" from the period (15 November 1936\u00a0\u2013 8 November 1960), when this route was served by trolleybuses.Other routes within the London area  These bus routes are operated with a London Service Permit issued by Transport for London, and are generally routes from towns just outside the Greater London boundary to destinations within. The exceptions are the 812, MB1 and 938, which run entirely within the boundary. Another exception is the 724, which although run by a coach company, it is a bus route. Coach services are not included in this list.Former routes  This list shows some old routes that used to operate but do not exist anymore.See also Bibliography External links UK Transport Wiki Transport for London  Transport for London (TfL) is a local government body responsible for most aspects of the transport system throughout Greater London in England. The role of TfL is to implement the transport strategy and to manage transport services across London.Management  TfL is controlled by a board whose members are appointed by the Mayor of London, a position currently held by Ken Livingstone, who also chairs the Board. The Commissioner of Transport for London (Peter Hendy since 17 January 2006) reports to the board and leads a management team with individual functional responsibilities.History  Transport for London was created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. It gained most of its functions from its predecessor London Regional Transport in 2000. However, it did not take over responsibility for the London Underground until 2003, after the controversial Public-private partnership (PPP) contract for maintenance had been agreed. Management of the Public Carriage Office had previously been a function of the Metropolitan Police. Transport for London Group Archives holds business records for TfL and all its predecessor bodies and transport companies. Some early records are also held on behalf of TfL Group Archives at the London Metropolitan Archives.Organisation  TfL is broken down into three main directorates and corporate services, each with responsibility for different aspects and modes of transport. The three main directorates are: Each of the above main units has its own corporate identity, formed by differently-coloured versions of the standard roundel and adding appropriate lettering across the horizontal bar. The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.Fares  Most of the transport modes that come under the control of Transport for London have their own charging and ticketing regimes. As an exception, buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR and the Underground another. Superimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the Travelcard system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, the Underground and provides a discount on many river services fares. The Oyster card is a contactless smart card system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (Pay as you go (PAYG) - formerly prepay) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader (though touching it flat is recommended). Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through and on standalone Oyster validators (which do not operate a barrier). Oyster PAYG can only be used on a limited selection of National Rail routes in London. Oyster PAYG does, however, have a set of daily maximum charges that are cheaper than buying a Travelcard for those not using the parts of National Rail where Oyster PAYG is not valid.Journey planning  TfL has developed an electronic 'Journey Planner', which enables users to plan journeys by multiple modes in and around London. Additionally, it is available at kiosks and some payphones throughout London. The Journey Planner is also available via mobile phone applications - some mobile phone network operators may charge to access this service.Mentions in 2006 honours list  After the attacks on the underground and bus systems on 7 July 2005, many staff were recognised in the 2006 New Year honours list for the heroic work they did. They helped the survivors out, removed the bodies, and got the transport system up and running, to get the millions of commuters back out of London at the end of the work day. Those mentioned include Peter Hendy, who was at the time Head of Surface Transport division, and Tim O'Toole, head of the Underground division, who were both awarded CBEs. Others include:Transport museum  TfL owns and operates the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden, a museum that conserves and explains London's transport heritage. The museum also has an extensive depot, situated at Acton, that contains material not able to be displayed at the central London museum, including many additional road vehicles, trains, collections of signs and advertising materials. The depot has several open weekends each year.Transport for London website  TfL's website, found at tfl.gov.uk includes information on all aspects of operation, from corporate affairs to 'real time' travel disruption news.See also External links  Template:Wikipedia Template:Navbox Template:Start box Template:Succession box |}UK Transport Wiki National Express West Midlands Fleet  West Midlands Buses Timetable Numbers Walsall Service Changes Numbers This Year Coming Soon BJ03EUR - BJ03EUT - BJ03EUU - BJ03EUV - BX61LLO Is Transferred to Walsall Garage In July 2018 BL53EEM - BL53EEN - BU04BKF - BU04BKG - BU04BKJ - BU04BKK - BU04BKL - BU04BKN - BU04BKV - BU04BKX - BU04BKZ - BU04BLF - BU04BLJ - BU04BLK - BU04BLN - BU04BLV - BU04BLX Is Transferred to Yardley Wood Garage In July 2018 BX02AUO - BX02AUR - BX02AVT - BX02AVU - BX02AVV - BX02AVY - BV52OAA - BV52OAB - BV52OAC - BV52OAD - BV52OAE - BV52OAG - BV52OAU - BV52OAH - BV52OAJ - BV52OAL - BV52OAM - BV52OAN Is Transferred to Wolverhampton Garage In July 2018 BJ03EUY - BJ03EUZ - BJ03EVB - BJ03EVC - BJ03EVD Is Transferred to Birmingham Central Garage In July 2018UK Transport Wiki Oxford to London coach route  The Oxford to London coach route is the most frequent long distance coach service in the United Kingdom. Two companies operate the route. The Oxford Bus Company, using the brand name Oxford espress, runs 3 coaches an hour for most of the day. The other company, Stagecoach, using the Oxford Tube brand name, runs 5 coaches an hour. The two companies together run over 150 journeys a day in each direction. Both companies use the M40 motorway and stop at Hillingdon in west London. The Oxford Tube also stops at Lewknor. The two companies take different routes into London: the Oxford Tube via Shepherd's Bush and the Oxford Espress via Baker Street. The Oxford Espress terminates at Victoria Coach Station, the Oxford Tube in Buckingham Palace Road, Victoria. As a comparison, there are 15 coach journeys a day from Cambridge to London.History Early History  In 1921 William Beesley of Oxford formed a company called South Midland and started excursions to London by charabanc. This became a daily service, and by 1928 it had become a regular coach service picking up and setting down passengers en route. South Midland had competitors. By 1930, 18 companies were running a total of 58 coach services between Oxford and London every day. After the Road Traffic Act 1930, the competitors quickly reduced to two: South Midland and Varsity Express. Varsity Express used the A40 via High Wycombe and Uxbridge, South Midland ran via Henley-on-Thames, Maidenhead and Slough. In 1933 the Eastern Counties Omnibus Company acquired Varsity Express (which also ran a service between London and Eastern Counties' base at Cambridge). In 1934, the Tilling Group (Eastern Counties' parent) moved the Oxford service of Varsity Express to a closer group company, United Counties. In 1934, South Midland was running 7 journeys a day, and Varsity Express ran 8 journeys a day. The day return fare was 6/- (30p).Nationalisation  In 1942 the Government compelled coach operators to suspend operations. In 1945 South Midland was sold to Red & White. Operations resumed in 1946, but by 1950 both Red & White and United Counties had been nationalised and were controlled by the British Transport Commission. The BTC transferred control of South Midland to Thames Valley Traction, and in 1952 transferred the United Counties service to South Midland. During the 1950s and 1960s, South Midland ran coaches between Oxford and London about every hour, alternating between the High Wycombe and Henley routes. Non-stop coaches started in 1963, reducing the journey time to 2 hours 15 minutes. In 1968 the Oxford Bus Company became state-owned when British Electric Traction sold its UK bus interests to the government. At the beginning of 1971 the state-owned Transport Holding Company merged South Midland with the Oxford Bus Company, which adopted the trading name Oxford South Midland. The two routes were combined with Oxford Bus Company's bus routes from Oxford to High Wycombe and Henley, and given numbers: route 30 (Oxford-Henley-London) and route 70 (Oxford-High Wycombe-London), changed to 390 and 290 in 1975. The M40 motorway between London and Oxford was opened in stages from 1967 to 1974. Occasional non-stop services used the motorway, but in 1977 a regular non-stop service was started as route 190, later renumbered X90. In the 1980s a non-stop service, the X70, was also started between Oxford and Heathrow Airport. In the 1980s the 290 stopping service was combined with Green Line's London to High Wycombe route.Privatisation and competition  In 1983 Oxford South Midland was split into two in preparation for privatisation. The London services went to the Oxford Bus Company, which was sold to its management in 1987. Competition reappeared in 1987 when Thames Transit opened up in Oxford and started its own express service to London, branded the Oxford Tube. The Oxford Bus Company branded its service Oxford Citylink. Since then competition on the non-stop routes has been fierce. Both companies have been taken over: Oxford Bus Company by Go-Ahead Group in 1994 and Thames Transit by Stagecoach in 1997. Both companies have continued to innovate, with better coaches, more frequent services, Wifi on board, and all-night services. The Oxford Tube brand has endured, whereas the Oxford Bus Company's London route was rebranded the Oxford Espress in 2000. The Heathrow service was rebranded the Airline in 2001. In 2003 Stagecoach introduced Megabus to the route, using different termini in both Oxford and London. However, in November 2004 the Megabus service was replaced by seats on the Oxford Tube. The stopping services to London declined. The High Wycombe service (290) ceased by 1990. The Henley service (390) was curtailed at Heathrow Airport, but the Oxford Bus Company could not make it pay and in 1996 it was taken over by Thames Transit, who renumbered it X39. Stagecoach later cut the route at Henley, and in 1999 it was taken over by Thames Travel.References External websites UK Transport Wiki Arriva Fox County  Arriva Logo Arriva Fox County is a bus company operating in Leicester and Leicestershire. It was formed in 1981, as Midland Red East with the breakup of the old Midland Red bus company, and then became known as Midland Fox in 1984. It is now part of Arriva Midlands. Arriva Fox County run services across the Leicester area plus services to/from Loughborough, Coalville, Hinckley, Melton Mowbray, Market Harborough and Burton upon Trent. In Leicester, Arriva run most of its services from St. Margaret's Bus Station with some journeys commencing/terminating in Charles Street.

It runs in London and some parts of the\u00a0commuter belt, serving to get people about, not to make a profit. It is the third biggest system in the world and the biggest if you include the rest of the London Metro. The London Underground (sometimes called \"the tube\", often by fans) is an underground subway system which currently serves a large part of Greater London and parts of the counties of Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Essex; basically around the London, England area in the UK. It was first built in 1863, and is part of one of the largest and oldest subway systems throughout the world.History  The original lines (Cut and cover lines, Earlier Tube lines) were built by various competing companies which opted to earn profits during the Industrial Revolution Era. The Underground serves 270 stations and has 402 kilometres (250 mi) of track, 45 per cent of which is underground. It also has the largest number of stations. The tube is an international icon for London, with the tube map, considered a design classic, having influenced many other transport maps worldwide. Although also shown on the Tube map, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Overground, and the Emirates Air Line are not part of the London Underground network but are part of the London Metro (fixed rail transport in London). The tube map could also be considered to be the 'Metro Map'. The underground pays for itself 86%.Lines Bakerloo Line  The Bakerloo Line is a line on the Tube network that operates from the north to the south in a simmilar pattern to the Northern Line. As of 2009, it has the second oldest stock on the Network after the picciadilly line, and is famous for historic station buildings, and most notably, it's ticket halls. It is couloured brown on the tube map.Central Line  The Central line is a London Underground line, coloured red on the tube map. It is a deep-level \"tube\" line, running east-west across London, and, at 76 km (47 mi). It is the longest Underground line and also the busiest with\u00a0around 260 million passengers a year. Of the 49 stations served, 20 are below ground.\u00a0It is considered to be the tube line with the highest point-to-point speeds on the Underground, reaching 70 mph (110 km/h) when the\u00a01992 Stock\u00a0was introduced.\u00a0The Central Line is coloured red on the tube mapCircle Line  The Circle Line or Inner Circle is a line on the London Underground. Originally it was a complete circle and theoretically passengers could\u00a0go round forever, but now it has been remodeled. It shares most of its track and all of its stations with other lines, primarily the Hammersmith & City Line and the District Line. \u00a0The strangest station is Edgware Road. It uses\u00a0C Stock\u00a0but will soon use\u00a0S Stock. It is coloured yellow on the tube map.District Line  The District line is a line of the London Underground, coloured green on the Tube map. It is a \"sub-surface\" line, running through the central area. It is the busiest of the sub-surface lines. Two of the four (Richmond and Wimbledon) western branches of the route are also the only lines. Across the entire network to cross the Thames by bridge and not by tunnel. Although the District line is only the fourth longest line on the network, it serves more stations than any other line (60). It is very dense and is built with lots of weirdo branches and lots of stations. It uses D stock (and a tiny bit of C Stock on one Branch) to run. the D and C stock are due to be replaced by the S Stock soon Hammersmith & City Line\u00a0The Hammersmith & City line is a London Underground service on its sub-surface network. Coloured salmon pink on the tube map, the line serves 29 stations in 15.8 miles (25.5 km). Extending from Hammersmith in the West in Zone 2, between Paddington and East Aldgate, the line runs through Zone 1, and to the east extends to Barking in Zone 4. Most of the route and all of the stations are shared by the District, Circle and\u00a0Metropolitan\u00a0lines. Together with the Circle line over 114 million passenger journeys are made each year. The first section opened in 1863 when the Metropolitan Railway began the world's first underground railway service between Paddington and Farringdon Street with wooden carriages and steam locomotives. The following year a railway to Hammersmith was built jointly by the\u00a0Great Western Railway\u00a0and Metropolitan Railways, and the line was extended to the east in stages, reaching the East London Line in 1884. The line was electrified in 1906 and after the London Passenger Transport Board was formed in 1936 some Metropolitan Hammersmith & City line trains were extended to Barking over the District Railway. The Hammersmith & City line was shown on the tube map as part of the Metropolitan line until 1990 when it appeared as a separate line. The signalling system is being upgraded and the current\u00a0C Stock\u00a0trains are to be replaced by new 7-car\u00a0S Stock\u00a0trains by 2015.Jubilee Line  The Jubilee line is a line on the London Underground. It originally followed the Metropolitan line for a while, and then broke off, terminating at Charing Cross station. Nowadays,\u00a0however, it no longer stops at Charing Cross at all, instead heading through the south of London and then rearing up to terminate at Stratford in north - east London. The Jubilee line is coloured grey on the Tube map.Metropolitan Line  The metropolitan line is a sub surface line on the London Underground. It is the oldest line, and the original version linked\u00a0Paddington and Farringdon. Nowadays it is huge and is the only sub surface line to go outside of the Greater London county. It uses 2010 stock but did use A stock until recently. Originally the Hammersmith and City Line and East London Line were also part of the Metropolitan line but nowadays are not.Northern Line  The Northern line is a line on the underground railway system, London Underground. It is coloured black on the\u00a0Tube map. It is mostly underground (deep level) and serves the southernmost and some of the northern most stations, running complex north south with branches arrangement because originally it was built by lots of companies. On par with the Jubilee line it is the deepest line. It uses similar stock to the jubilee line as well (1955/ 1956 Stock).Piccadilly Line & Heathrow Circle  the Picciadilly line is an underground line running from north to south-western london, and also serving Heathrow airport. It is coloured blue on the tube map. The\u00a0Heathrow Circle\u00a0is a circle of railway serving Heathrow terminals 123, 4, & 5. It is on the Piccadilly Line of the London Underground.Victoria Line  The Victoria line is a deep-level London Underground route running from the south (fare Zone 2) to the north-east (Zone 3)\u00a0of London. It is coloured light blue on the Tube map. It runs only underground except for the Depot. It is so named because of it serving Victoria station. It is the sixth most used line but the most intensively used line (journeys per\u00a0mile) and is quite high tech, using very new trains (2009 Stock) and special humpback stations that save energy. The only station on the Victoria line to have no form of rail interchange is\u00a0Pimlico, though Brixton tube station is a separate building from its\u00a0National Rail\u00a0neighbour.Waterloo & City Line  The W&CL is a line on the tube network, most notably the smallest, and also the only one to have no track above ground, or indeed, any connection to above ground tracks (Unlike the Victoria Line, with a depot on the surface. It is coloured teal on the tube map.Trivia  The name originally only meant or described the tubey circular lines that were deep level as opposed to the sub surface ones that were built way earlier and ran on steam. Nowadays, it often refers to the whole system.See Also UK Transport Wiki List of National Express West Midlands Bus Routes  This is a list of bus routes operated by National Express West Midlands (formerly known as Travel West Midlands) in the West Midlands County of England.

It operates between Bracknell and London.History  Green Line routes 700, 701 and 702 are one of only two sets of Green Line routes not to be operated by Arriva Shires & Essex. Arriva own the Green Line name, and as such use of the brand name by First is under agreement to them. The services introduced the \"Rainbow Fares\" scheme in 2004, which enables passengers to choose the cheapest fares if they don't need to travel at a particular time. At first, the route was operated by a fleet of Scania N113CRB/Berkhof Excellence 1000 coaches. In 2001 and 2002, a number of Plaxton Premiere and Expressliner were used on the service, but these were soon moved away. In 2005, some Volvo B7R/Plaxton Profile were moved from First Cymru to operate the service. The run in standard First livery with Green Line stickers. After three new vehicles were put on the Reading Railair service, three of the existing Scania K114IB/Irizar Century were painted into and are now used on the Green Line livery.Current route  Route 700 runs between Windsor and London only, and route 701 at peak times the whole route plus some Bracknell housing estates. Route 702 is the standard service, running the whole route at a basic hourly frequency.Route departing Bracknell Route departing London Fares  There are a number of different fares used on the service. These vary from the standard bus-like singles and day returns to season tickets. Lower fares apply after mid-day. The service was most notable for the use of the \"Rainbow Fares\" scheme, which was introduced in 2004. This encouraged passengers to travel on the less popular journeys, as they were priced the cheapest. These fares ceased in 2015 with the closure of the Bracknell garage. Ordinary bus fares are also available between Bracknell and Langley.Rainbow Fares Towards Bracknell  As part of the Rainbow Fares scheme, in some instances it is cheaper to buy two single tickets than a return, which is why returns aren't available on some journeys. Passengers with \"orange\" return tickets can use then on any First bus in the Berkshire area. Children aged 5-15 can get half the adult fare, and students with ID are entitled to the child fare. Senior citizens with free travel passes can use them between Bracknell and Langley, and any pensioner can get a half fare on all of the route.Season tickets  Unlike standard bus services, routes 700, 701 and 702 offer season tickets. These can also be used most other First Berkshire & The Thames Valley buses. Tickets have to be purchased by calling the company, but weekly tickets are available from the driver.References External links UK Transport Wiki Central Connect  Central Connect is a bus operator in the West Midlands. It is made up of the merger of Zak's, North Birmingham Busways and Birmingham Motor Traction. A deal was also signed in January 2008 for the completion of the purchase of Ludlows, Halesowen. On March 3 2008, Central Connect purchased the Go West Midlands operations from Go-Ahead.

On 26 January 1986 the service was extended from Birmingham via Halesowen to Hasbury, relaunched as a flagship Timesaver service and re-numbered 900. In 1988 the extension to the route was reverted back presumably because of the unreliability of such routes which traverse through a large busy city centre. (The Birmingham to Hasbury section became routes 19 & 19S which have since been withdrawn on 27 Apr 2008). The 900 journey time was then 60 minutes end to end, in recent years however as a result of additional routing, more stopping places and congestion the end to end journey time has increased by around 40% which has made the service less attractive for those travelling between the two cities. Along with the withdrawal of the Hasbury section and the extended time on the 900 service, it has not shown good interest in the people who used them. The latest alteration was to reduce it to every 30 minutes during the daytimes of Monday - Saturday. A 15 minute Monday - Friday peak time frequency. Finally the extension from Sheldon of service 58 during Monday - Saturday daytime was to fill the 30 minute gap between Birmingham Airport and Birmingham City Centre, in effect still providing 4 buses per hour during the off peak. To add to this: The Timesaver brand has also been phased out.\nNational Express West Midlands currently has a maximum single fare of \u00a31.70 on the route. The route was rerouted as X1 in December 2016.Current route  When necessary, service X1 is sometimes diverted down to Birmingham Airport.External links  </div>UK Transport Wiki National Express Coventry  National Express Coventry is the current trading name and brand name of West Midlands Travel Ltd (part of the National Express Group), a company which operates local bus services from its depot in the city of Coventry in the West Midlands County of England. The operating area is mainly within the Coventry urban area which is covered by Centro the West Midlands integrated transport authority in terms of public transport infrastructure and Warwickshire County Council. All other bus depots of National Express UK Bus in the West Midlands County operate under the name National Express West Midlands. National Express Coventry previously operated under the trading names of Travel Coventry, Travel West Midlands and West Midlands Travel.History  In 26 October 1986 West Midlands Travel Ltd came into existence, and stems from the 1986 deregulation of the bus industry in England and Wales. It was previously the bus operations of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) which had originally been the separate operations of the Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall, West Bromwich and Coventry Corporations. Then from April 1995 the company was purchased by the National Express Group and in September 1996 was re-branded to trade under the name Travel West Midlands. On 9 December 2002 the Coventry depot attained a more local identity and began trading as Travel Coventry and from 4 February 2008 'National Express Coventry'. became the new name for Travel Coventry.Network Review  An entire network review took place on the 26th February 2012, which resulted in frequency improvements on key corridors in the city. Many routes were extensively revised or renumbered whilst there were some routes which were removed and others were introduced. The new network is designed to be simpler. Since then extensive service monitoring, reliability checks and public feedback have resulted in some further minor timing changes to some services to further improve the punctuality of services to their customers. The new network is colour coded and the colours of routes are displayed on the network map and on timetables, the buses themselves are being route branded to match these colours. Route 21 is the first route to have the new route branding applied. The previous network review was conducted on the 2nd April 2006.Fare Structure  A flat fare structure is in operation within the Coventry boundary; people can travel on almost all of its buses, and to almost everywhere on its network, for a fixed price. Graduated fares apply on route 11 & 11X to/from Kenilworth & Leamington Spa. As with some other urban operators, no change is given for security and speed of boarding. A range of fares are available including singles and daysavers and their own travelcards which are available for 1 week, 4 week and 52 week periods of validity. Off-peak, evening and group tickets are also available.

The origins of service 351 go back to the early part of the 20th century when a service was introduced between by a company that later became widely known as \"Midland Red\". Pre-deregulation when operated, the service ran from Hednesford - Cannock - Wasall - Birmingham via what it is now known to have become:- 51, X51, 351 and 951. The route has undergone so many changes in the past, its hard to keep up with what's going on. Since deregulation (26 October 1986) all parts of the route have been consistently operated by West Midlands Travel. Although various other operators seeing the route as a busy one have attempted to compete but have all subsequently withdrawn from the service. Such operators have included Tame Valley Travel, Birmingham Coach Company (later known as Diamond Bus), Chase Bus Services, Zaks Coaches and A2Z Travel. However, the only part of the route which has kept consistent competition is Arriva. Who have provided the route between Hednesford and Walsall. It has forced National Express West Midlands on so many occasions in reducing their operations.Resent History  Pre-1999 2000 November 2003 November 2005 March 2007 23rd November 2007 Early part of 2008 May 2009 August 2011 Mid-2014 August 2015Former route  Currently, National Express West Midlands is the sole operator of the 351 and 951A. They operate the 351 at a variety of frequencies throughout the day, culminating in a thirty minute frequency during peak times and hourly during the daytimes, with the 951A, a limited stop version of the route, running journeys on a hourly basis. (during the off peek, these journeys then become X51's between Birmingham and Walsall and 351 between Walsall and Cannock), On a Saturday the 351 is run to a 30 Minute frequency all day, with the X51 run every 20 minutes between Birmingham and Walsall, for a shorter period of time. Whilst on the 951A do not operate and again the same on Sundays, although route 51 is run commercial by National Express West Midlands between Birmingham and Walsall. The Walsall - Cannock section is extended to Hednesford and provided on tender, by South Staffordshire County Council. The 351, and 951A run via Leamore, Bloxwich, Landywood, Cheslyn Hay & Great Wyrley, but all follow the exact same route between Walsall and Bloxwich Monday's - Saturday's, where the 351 operate via a fairly new housing development north west of Bloxwich through Turnberry Road, before rejoining the 951A route on the Stafford Road just before the county border by Long Lane. From here which is near to Holly Lane in Cannock Chase, both routes then follow one another into Cannock Bus Station. Nowadays The 351 is a bus route operated by National Express West Midlands and then Arriva Midlands between Hednesford/Cannock in Staffordshire and Walsall in the West Midlands, England. Up until very recently it was one of only two services between Walsall and Cannock but from May 25th 2008 now has competition from Arriva Midlands service 32 and 33. These Arriva services in reality do not offer significant competition as they follow a very long route via Heath Hayes, Norton Canes and Brownhills to Walsall. Although the Arriva Midlands route 1, is seen as seen as more directly the competition to service 351.Former Vehicles  In the final days of service 351, it become more common than not to see Optare Solos, which are small mini-buses on the route. However, it was not uncommon to see MCW Metrobuses, Leyland Lynx's, or the same former Gas powered Volvo B10Ls (Alexander Ultra) and Volvo B7TL (Wright Eclipse Gemini), which when not inuse on the X51, were used on the service. The X51's were often operated by former Gas powered Volvo B10Ls (Alexander Ultra) and Volvo B7TL (Wright Eclipse Gemini), when not on the 351. For the 951A, morning journeys were operated by buses that then went onto the X51, whilst the evening journeys were normally operated by Volvo B6LEs, with occasional rare uses of Volvo B7RLE (Wright Eclipse) or MCW Metrobuses.Operators  The 351 is operated commercial during Monday - Saturday daytimes by National Express West Midlands between Cannock and Walsall. On weekday evenings it is operated by Arriva Midlands also between Cannock and Walsall, but is subsidised by South Staffordshire County Council. On Sundays Arriva Midlands operate an extended version of the route, stretching from Cannock via Pye Green to Hednesford, again on a subsidised basis from South Staffordshire County Council. Evening and Sunday services follow a different route in the Bloxwich area: the evening and Sunday buses travel a direct route between Bloxwich and Landywood, ie. along the A34 Stafford Road, whereas the Monday to Saturday daytime buses operate via a fairly new housing development north west of Bloxwich (Turnberry Road). Evenings and Sundays Turnbery Road is instead served by an extension of CENTRO subsidised bus service 319 which operates from Walsall to Bloxwich via Blakenall and Goscote. The 351 journey takes just around 40 minutes, but can stretch to 55 minutes depending on the time of day. Early morning journeys on a Saturday are a short as 28 minutes, but soon pick up to a full 45 minutes length later on in the day. Following the recent renumbering and timetable change, the service is interlinked with service 350 (Walsall - Manor Hospital), buses changing routes once in Walsall. As the 351 has mostly always been operated using non-low floor buses, the 350 consequentlly is no longer easily accessible. A major change is that of the Monday to Friday off-peek frequency reduced to hourly, with much announce from local people. This is why National Express West Midlands needed to do what ever it can to save these routes from the chop. It is worth noting that in the from deregulation until May 2009 this service has undergone a number of changes. A set of express routes ran along the main section of the route, these were;- 950, 950A, 951, 951A, 952 and 953. Most of theses journeys before 2007; Monday's - Friday's saw a 30 minute frequency provided buy these Timesavers, along with a combined 30 minute frequency with routes 350, 350A & 351. Saturdays saw a more steady 20 minutes frequency, just with the timesaver services. The combination of these Timesaver services run by National Express West Midlands ran between Birmingham - Walsall - Hednesford via Bloxwich, Great Wyrley, Bridgtown, Cheslyn Hay, Bridgtown, Cannock, & Heath Hayes. National Express West Midlands ran an evening service on Friday's and Saturday's on route 351 on its one steam. Due to a reduction of the number of drivers Walsall had and high running costs. Dispite the service gaining many passengers, National Express West Midlands decided to cut the route back to daytime operations only. A good example of what remains to date can still been seen in the Saturday timetable. Unusual for a bus route, the latest journey departing Walsall is on a Saturday, compared to that of the Monday - Friday timetable. As the last Saturday journey was profitable it saved it from scrappage, thus the remains of it today. At one stage combined services provded a 15/20 minutes frequency, along the main Walsall - Cannock section of the route. Now the Walsall - Cannock section has just been reduced to every hour between 09:30 and 15:30 Mondays - Fridays. Its worth noting that for service 351 and 951, it operas that 'deregulation' just has not worked. All of which, is why day-on-day, some transport critics state this would be a case in point, for the need of the reverse on deregulation. Just on looking at this route, if you were not a regular passenger and someone who lives on the route, it would put you off wanted to becoming a regular bus users. If on the other hand, you were a regular bus users. It would put you off from wanted to use the route, due to the number of changes it goes through.Route National Express West Midlands 351 Arriva Midlands 351 National Express West Midlands 951A External Links  National Express West Midlands Website  </div>UK Transport Wiki London Midland  London Midland is the name of a train operating company in the United Kingdom. Legally named London and Birmingham Railway Ltd. , it is a subsidiary of Govia, and has operated the West Midlands Franchise since 11 November 2007. Their services operate primarily on the West Coast Main Line from London Euston and in the West Midlands region, replacing previous operators Central Trains and Silverlink (both subsidiaries of the National Express Group).Routes  London Midland's services are divided between two sub-brands, London Midland Express and London Midland City.London Midland Express  This sub-brand is used primarily for semi-fast services on the West Coast Main Line (WCML). The first route is a former Central Citylink service. The second route is the former Silverlink County route (although latterly the services between Northampton and Birmingham have been run jointly with Central Trains. The third service is a new semi-fast service, which will replace current Virgin Trains services from December 2008. This will coincide with the number of Virgin Trains services calling at stations on the Trent Valley Line (and other parts of the WCML) being reduced. The fourth route is an extension of the third route (once a day). The brand will also be used for two former Silverlink County services on branches off the WCML, namely the Marston Vale Line (from Bletchley to Bedford) and the St Albans Branch Line (from Watford Junction to St Albans Abbey). It is a requirement of the franchise that Transport for London's Oyster Cards can be used on trains between London and Watford Junction. In the past, TfL have expressed interest in taking over the St Albans branch, and installing Oyster Card readers on the stations along it; however this route was included with London Midland's franchise.London Midland City  This sub-brand is used for local and commuter services around the Birmingham / Coventry Area, sponsored by Centro/ Network West Midlands, that were previously run by Central Trains. These services are:Smaller stations  London Midland operate several \"limited stop\" stations, where only a handful of trains a day stop: These include :Performance  The first performance figures for London Midland to be released by the ORR for the second half of the third quarter of the financial year 2007/8 are 85.4% PPM.Rolling stock Current fleet  London Midland\u2019s fleet is currently composed of rolling stock inherited from Silverlink and Central Trains. They plan to improve the reliability and interior design the existing Class 153 and Class 170 trains, and install passenger information systems and CCTV on the majority of the fleet. They also intend to use automatic load-monitoring systems to measure how heavily their services are used, for the purpose of alleviating over-crowding. As of 12 November 2007 there are already several units operating in the new livery and re-furbished green interior, but all of the Class 170 \"Turbostar\" units on the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury line and the Class 150 \"Sprinter\" units still carry their original liveries. The 150s in fact, do not have any branding any more. When Govia took over, they were more intent with removing \"Central Trains\" from units, than applying their name.Future fleet  As part of its franchise agreement, London Midland is committed to a major programme of new rolling stock. In its initial plan, it announced that it would bring into service an additional 37 Class 350 units from Siemens which it plans to use in replacing its Class 321s. After beginning its operations, London Midland announced two further orders, with fifteen 3-car and twelve 2-car Class 172 Turbostar units ordered from Bombardier Transportation, together with a pair of Class 139 railcars from Parry People Movers for use on the Stourbridge line. When the two Class 139's enter service on the Stourbridge town line, the current Class 153 will be moved to the Bedford - Bletchley line. These will replace Class 150s on this route; the remainder of London Midland's Class 150s will be replaced like for like by the Class 172s. Under the government's rolling stock plan, the Class 150s will be cascaded to other TOC's.See also  Template:PortalReferences External links UK Transport Wiki Arriva Midlands  Arriva Midlands is a division of Arriva. It operates bus services around the Midlands area of England and is made up of various previous bus operators.Arriva Midlands North  Formerly part of Midland Red and latterly Midland Red North until rebranded as Arriva in late 1997. This part of the business operated buses in: Cheshire with depots at (Crewe, Macclesfield & Winsford) Shropshire with depots at (Oswestry, Shrewsbury, Shifnal, Bridgnorth (since closed) & Wellington) Staffordshire with depots at (Burton, Cannock, Stafford & Tamworth) South Derbyshire Swadlincote Garage closed on 24th December 2007. All operations have now moved to Burton Depot. In early 2003, the Cheshire garages passed to Arriva North West. The remaining part of Arriva Midlands North were combined with Arriva Fox County, forming Arriva Midlands. Buses still operate with Arriva Midlands North legal name (except Burton which uses Stevensons of Uttoxeter, trading as Arriva) but the headquarters changed from Cannock to Thurmaston (Leicester), the headquarters of Arriva Fox County. Services cover Shropshire, Staffordshire around parts of the West Midlands county, most notably Walsall and Wolverhampton although several services stretch as far west as over the Welsh border into Powys and Wrexham and far south as Birmingham. On 25th February 2007 Chase Coaches Limited sold out to Arriva Midlands and the operations merged into Cannock from 28th April 2007. In late 2007 a new Chase Linx brand (similar to the Leicester Linx brand below) was introduced, reflecting the purchase of Chase Coaches.Arriva Derby  Formerly Derby City Transport this part of the business originates from the Derby Corporation buses pre-deregulation. An extensive service operates within Derby although numerous services stretch beyond the city boundaries. In 2007, a new Town Linx brand was introduced to services in South Derbyshire and East Staffordshire, similar to the schemes in Leicester and Cannock.Arriva Fox County  This was the part of Arriva responsible for operations throughout Leicestershire with a network largely based on the county town, Leicester. This part of the business was formerly part of Midland Red and latterly traded as Midland Red East and Midland Fox. Services stretch from Nottingham in the north and Coventry in the south. In May 2006 Arriva launched Operation Overdrive in Leicestershire, with a new Leicester Linx brand. \"Local Linx\" is used for the more local routes, while \"City Linx\" is used for town-to-town express services.References External links UK Transport Wiki Travel North Birmingham Contents North Birmingham  North Birmingham would of been a trading name of Travel West Midlands buses in and around the Sutton Coldfield, Erdington and Kingstanding areas. The only plausible explanation given the name of the company is it would of been based at the old Sutton Coldfield garage. The garage is on the main street of South Parade, in Sutton Coldfield of [North East Birmingham], which closed in 1986, when the PTA sold off the buses due to effects of the deregulation]. An advantage to having a subsidiary within the group is:- contract tenders such as route 604 (provided by a Centro tender) could be won and kept within the group, if the other National Express garages are short of drives, want to give up a on providing a tendered route or specific journeys, they just may wish not to carry on contracts for or even failing to win the contracts from other operators (such as the evening and Sunday on route 71). Routes which operator outside of the West Midlands county could be both picked up on either a contract and a communicably viable basis, along with many routes the main garages wouldn't take up, due to similarity of routes within the area. Such as 757 which operates via Coleshill in North Warwickshire, but had a communicably viable route 71, 90, 900 and 966 all cove parts of this tended route. A disadvantage of having a subsidiary:- show the lack of passenger awareness of being part of the same group. When it comes to use of bus passes, many infrequent users may not understand the 'DaySaver' for example, would be valid on these journeys or routes. Another disadvantage however when it comes to a subsidiary like that of 'Travel Your Bus'. Is of the competition on routes, such as on route '2Y' and '50Y', which in-turn could be an advantage. As it would likely push away other operators from routes, meaning the group would maintain more or less all of the passengers; even if it looks like two different operators rather than the same group.Rebranded Travel West Midlands  During 1999 the company became a rebrand, this followed the name change from 'West Midlands Travel' to 'Travel West Midlands' beginning the family name of 'Travel' such as the spin off like, 'Travel Coventry', 'Travel Your Bus', 'Travel Merry Hill', 'Travel Dundee', 'Travel London' and 'Travel Surrey' On 4th and 17th February 2001; following restructuring of the group, services were being absorbed into the main company. As by now the trading name had become 'Travel West Midlands'. Again if the 'Travel North Birmingham' had been put into continues operation, the most like effect is it would of been absorbed into the main company. Just as 'Your Bus operation' or Travel_Your_Bus[1]and'Merry Hill operation' or Travel_Merry_Hill[2] (previous page) National Express West MidlandsNational Express West MidlandsThe Travel North Birmingham Network of route operated  This is just a list of routes that operate close to Sutton Coldfield, which are classed as part of North Birmingham Network A number of routes not considers part of the North Birmingham network are:- These are not classed as part of the North Birmingham network, due to tended of contracts such as with schools and colleges. Other routes such as 366 and 377 are also not classed as part of the North Birmingham network, even though they operate within the Sutton borough at present. These could become part of the North Birmingham network, due to most of the routes service, being within what is considers the Sutton Coldfield borough. Other routes not listed could also gain service, as it would be in passengers interstates to keep a network of routes in some form of competition to the main National Express West Midlands. Not to mention the fact that, it would gain the group more passengers, business and also provide routes where at the moment, either doesn't have a bus service or has a limited services provided. Its worth noting that from the above list of routes, it is extensive considering it is the Northern part of Birmingham, including the Sutton Coldfield and syringing areas.External links Anti-Pokemon Wiki Anti-Pokemon Wiki   Anti-Pokemon Wiki is the wiki dedicated to demolishing everything Pokemon.

He is from the air kingdom, a place full of air.History  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aang was abused as a child. Everybody in the air kingdom made fun of him because he bent every house on the block. Because of this, they threw him off a cliff and banished him. There, he met the Monkey At Zoo, (Munk-ee-aut-zoo) who taught him how to bend air. Aang found it so easy to bend air that he could not stop doing it, even though it was extremely easy, so easy that you and I could do it. To this day, he is known as the \"airbender.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Later, he came across the wizard school, Hogwarts, where he decided to go to. There, he found the Sorcerer's Stone and used it to make himself live for 100 years. In Hogwarts, he learned the legandary \"Doodle doodle doo\" spells that allowed him to recieve ultimate power.

The subfamily contains about 18 species, classified in six or seven genus|genera. The name hamster is derived from the German word Hamster, itself from earlier Old High German|OHG hamustro, from Old Russian|ORuss chom\u011bstor\u01d4, which is either a blend of the root of Russ khomiak \"hamster\" and a Baltic word (cf. Lithuanian language|Lith staras \"hamster\") or of Iranian origin (cf. Av hama\u0113star \"oppressor\"). Behavior can vary depending on their environment, genetics, and interaction with people. Because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as lab animals in more economically developed countries. Hamsters have also become established as popular small pets. Hamsters are crepuscular. In the wild, they burrow underground in the daylight to avoid being caught by predators. Contrary to popular belief they are a nocturnal animal. Their diet contains a variety of foods, including dried food, berries, nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables. In the wild they will eat any wheat, nuts and small bits of fruit and vegetables that they might find lying around on the ground, and will occasionally eat small insects such as small crickets or mealworms. They have elongated fur-lined pouches on both sides of their heads which extend to their shoulders, which they stuff full of food to be brought back to the colony or to be eaten later.Characteristics  Hamsters are stout-bodied, with tails much shorter than body length and have small furry ears, short stocky legs, and wide feet. Their thick, silky fur, which can be long or short, can be black, grey, white, brown, buff, yellow, \"sapphire\" or red depending on the species, or a mix of any of those colors. Two of the dwarf hamsters belonging to the genus Phodopus (Phodopus campbelli), Campbell's Dwarf Hamster, and Phodopus sungorus, the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster) and also two of the species of the genus Cricetulus, (Cricetulus barabensis, the Chinese Striped Hamster, and Cricetulus griseus, the Chinese Dwarf Hamster) have a dark stripe down the middle of the back. The species of genus Phodopus are the smallest, with bodies 5 to 10 cm (about 2 to 4 inches) long; the largest is the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus), measuring up to 34 cm (about 13 inches) long, not including a short tail of up to 4 cm (1-1/2 inches). The Angora hamster, also known as the long-haired or Teddy Bear hamster, which is a type of the Syrian Hamster is the second largest hamster breed, measuring up to 15 cm (about 6 inches) long. The tail is often difficult to see; usually it is not very long, and on a long haired hamster it is barely visible. Hamsters are very flexible, and their bones are somewhat fragile.Habitat  Hamsters' northern range extends from central Europe through Siberia, Mongolia, and northern China to Korea. The southern portion of their range stretches from Syria to India. Throughout dry, open country they inhabit desert borders, vegetated sand dunes, shrubby and rocky foothills and plateaux, river valleys, and mountain steppes; some live among cultivated crops. Geographic distribution varies greatly between species. The common hamster, for example, is found from central Europe to western Siberia and northwestern China, but the golden hamster has been found only near a small town in northwestern Syria.Diet  Hamsters are omnivorous. Their diet consists mostly of grains (such as whole grain oats and corn) but also includes fresh fruit, roots such as carrots, green parts of plants. Hamsters carry food in their spacious cheek pouches to a cache in the burrow. When full, their cheeks can make their heads double in size. Hamsters in the Middle East have been known to hunt in packs to find insects for food. Pet stores sell a variety of treats that are suitable for hamsters.Behavior  Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are generally solitary and will fight to the death if put together, whereas some of dwarf hamster species can get along with others of the same species. Hamsters are primarily considered crepuscular and at one point were considered nocturnal as they are sometimes active all night. Some species have been observed to be more nocturnal than others. All hamsters are excellent diggers, constructing burrows with one or more entrances and with galleries that are connected to chambers for nesting, food storage, and other activities. They will also appropriate tunnels made by other mammals; the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster (Phodopus sungorus), for instance, uses paths and burrows of the pika. None hibernate during winter, but some (mostly Syrian hamsters) experience periods of torporlastingfrom a few days to several weeks. This probably means that conditions are too cold for them. Hamsters are known to stockpile large amounts of food, because of natural instinct from the wild. Because of this behavior it is possible to leave a hamster alone for a few days. Once a Syrian hamster is tamed, they remain so for a long time. However, dwarf hamsters must be continuously played with otherwise if left alone for a maximum of two to three weeks, it can become untame again.Reproduction  Hamsters become fertile at different ages dependent on their species, but this can be from one month to three months of age. Male hamsters remain fertile for the rest of their lives, though females do not. Females are in heat approximately every four days. Breeding season is from April to October, with two to five litters of 1 to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days. Gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian hamsters, 18 to 21 days for the Russian hamsters, 21 to 23 days for Chinese hamsters and 23 to 30 for Roborovski Hamsters. The average litter for Syrians is about 7, but can be as great as 24, which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in the uterus. Campbell's Dwarf Hamsters tend to have 4 to 8 in a litter but can have up to 14. Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski hamsters. Siberian hamsters form close, monogamous bonds with their mates. If separated, they may become very depressed. This happens especially in males. Males will become inactive, eat more, and even show some behavioral changes similar to some types of depression in humans. This can even cause obesity in the hamster. Chinese hamster females are known for being aggressive toward the male if kept together for too long. In some cases, male Chinese hamsters have died after being attacked by the female. If breeding Chinese hamsters, it is recommended to separate the pair after mating or the hamsters will attack each other. Hamsters are born hairless and blind in a nest which the mother will have prepared in advance. She uses shredded material such as leaves in the wild but prefers cotton or toilet paper in captivity. After one week they begin to explore outside the nest. They are completely weaned after three weeks, or four for Roborovski Hamsters. Most breeders will sell the hamsters to shops when the hamsters are anywhere from two to eight weeks old.Classification  Taxonomists generally disagree about the most appropriate placement of the subfamily Cricetinae within the superfamily Muroidea. Some place it in a family Cricetidae that also includes voles, lemmings, and New World rats and mice; others group all these into a large family called Muridae. Their evolutionary history is recorded by 15 extinct fossil genera and extends back 11.2 million to 16.4 million years to the Middle Miocene Epoch in Europe and North Africa; in Asia it extends 6 million to 11 million years. Four of the seven living genera include extinct species. One extinct hamster of Cricetus, for example, lived in North Africa during the Middle Miocene, but the only extant member of that genus is the common hamster of Eurasia.Hamster as pets  Template:Imagestack The best-known species of hamster is the Syrian or Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), which is the type of hamster most commonly kept as a pet. It is also sometimes called a \"fancy\" hamster. Pet stores also have taken to calling them \"honey bears,\" \"panda bears,\" \"black bears,\" \"European black bears,\" \"polar bears,\" \"teddy bears,\" and \"Dalmatian\", depending on their coloration. There are also several variations, including long-haired varieties that grow hair several centimeters long and often require special care. Other hamsters that are kept as pets are the four species of \"dwarf hamster\". Campbell's Dwarf Hamster (Phodopus campbelli) is the most common of the four \u2014 they are also sometimes called \"Russian Dwarfs\"; however, many hamsters are from Russia, and so this ambiguous name does not distinguish them from other species appropriately. The coat of the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster (Phodopus sungorus) might turn white during winter (when the hours of daylight decrease). The Roborovski Hamster (Phodopus roborovskii) is extremely small and fast. The Chinese Hamster (Cricetulus griseus), although not technically a true \"dwarf hamster\", is the only hamster with a prehensile tail (about 4cm long) - most hamsters have very short, non-prehensile tails. Many breeders also show their hamsters and so breed towards producing a good healthy show hamster with a view to keeping one or two themselves so quality and temperament are of vital importance when planning the breeding. Although breeders of show hamsters specialise in breeding show hamsters, there are also owners who have bred their pet hamsters. These may be the result of a planned or unplanned pregnancy but the hamsters have usually been cared for well and handled regularly, so make very suitable pets. Buying a hamster directly from a breeder means that there is the opportunity to see the parents and know the dates of birth. In Australia it is illegal to keep hamsters as pets as 'escapees' could breed in the wild and become 'feral' pest animals.Sex and longevity  her two pups, who are less than one week old. Syrian hamsters typically live no more than two to three years in captivity, less than that in the wild. Russian Hamsters (Campbell's and Winter White) live approximately 1.5 to 2 years in captivity, and Chinese Hamsters 2.5 to 3 years. The smaller Roborovski Hamster often lives to 3 to 3.5 years in captivity. Both Syrian and Russian hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (4\u20135 weeks), whereas Chinese hamsters will usually begin reproducing at 2\u20133 months of age, and Roborovskis at 3\u20134 months of age. Left to their own devices, hamsters will produce several litters a year with several pups in each litter. When seen from above, a sexually mature female hamster has a trim tail line; a male's tail line bulges on both sides. This might not be very visible in all species. Male hamsters typically have very large testes in relation to their body size. Before sexual maturity occurs at about 4\u20136 weeks, it is more difficult to determine a young hamster's sex. When examined, female hamsters have two holes close together, whereas males have anal and genital openings further apart than the female's. (The penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a hole or pink pimple.)Relationships among hamster species  Neumann et al. (2006) conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 12 of the above 17 species of hamster using DNA sequence from three genes: 12S rRNA, cytochrome b, and von Willebrand factor. They uncovered the following relationships: The genus Phodopus was found to represent the earliest split among hamsters. Their analysis included both species. The results of another study (Lebedev et al., 2003) may suggest that Cricetulus kamensis (and presumably the related C. alticola) might belong to either this Phodopus group or hold a similar basal position. The genus Mesocricetus also form a clade. Their analysis included all four species, with M. auratus and M. raddei forming one subclade and M. brandti and M. newtoni another. The remaining genera of hamsters formed a third major clade. Two of the three sampled species within Cricetulus represent the earliest split. This clade contains Cricetulus barabensis (and presumably the related C. sokolovi) and Cricetulus longicaudatus. The remaining clade contains members of Allocricetulus, Tscherskia, Cricetus, and Cricetulus migratorius. Allocricetulus and Cricetus were sister taxa. Cricetulus migratorius was their next closest relative, and Tscherskia was basal.Similar animals  Note that there are some rodents which are sometimes called \"hamsters\" that are not currently classified in the hamster subfamily Cricetinae. These include the Maned Hamster or Crested Hamster, which is really the Maned Rat (Lophiomys imhausi), although not nearly as marketable under that name. Others are the mouse-like hamsters (Calomyscus spp.), and the white-tailed rat (Mystromys albicaudatus).  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundHamsters Wiki Golden Hamster  The Syrian or Golden Hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, is a very well-known member of the rodent subfamily Cricetinae, the hamsters. In the wild they are now considered vulnerable, but are popular as housepets and scientific research animals. Adults grow from 5 to 7 inches (12.5 to 17.5 cm) in length, and will usually have a lifespan of 2 to 3 years.Biology  Like most members of the subfamily, the Syrian Hamster has expandable cheek pouches, which extend from its cheeks to its shoulders. In the wild, hamsters are larder hoarders; they use their cheek pouches to transport food to their burrows. Their name in the local Arabic dialect where they were found translates to \"father of saddlebags\" (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u0631\u0627\u0628) due to the remarkable amount of storage space in their cheek pouches. If food is plentiful, they will store it in large amounts--it has been reported that 25 kg of grain was found in the burrow of a single hamster. Sexually mature female hamsters come into season (oestrus) every four days. Syrian hamsters have the shortest gestation period in any known placental mammal at only 16 to 18 days. They can produce large litters of 20 or more young, although the average litter size is 8. If a mother hamster is inexperienced or feels threatened, she may abandon or even cannibalise her pups. Hamsters are extremely territorial and will attack other individuals. The only exception is when a female and male come together when the female is in heat, and even so the female may attack the male after mating. Even brothers and sisters, once mature, will attack one another. In captivity, babies must be separated from their mother after 4 weeks, and the babies can be housed together only for a further 3 weeks, until sexually mature. Syrian hamsters mark their burrow with secretions from special scent glands located on their hips. Male hamsters in particular lick their body near the glands, creating damp spots on the fur.Discovery  In 1839 British zoologist George Robert Waterhouse reportedly found an elderly female hamster in Syria, naming it Cricetus auratus, the Golden Hamster. The hamster's fur went on display at the British Museum (Natural History). The Syrian Hamster was then ignored by European science for the next century. In 1930, Israel Aharoni, a zoologist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, captured a mother hamster and her litter of pups in Aleppo, Syria. The hamsters were bred in Jerusalem as laboratory animals. Some escaped from the cage through a hole in the floor, so that most of the Syrian hamsters in Israel today are believed to be descended from this litter. Because they were bigger than the ones Waterhouse found, they were named Mesocricetus auratus, which is now the currently accepted scientific name of the Syrian Hamster. Descendants of these hamsters were shipped to Britain in 1931, where they came under the care of the Wellcome Bureau of Scientific Research. They bred well and two more pairs were given to the Zoological Society of London in 1932. The descendants of these were passed on to private breeders in 1937. Soon after their initial discovery, Syrian hamsters were found to make great pets. Just about all captive Syrian Hamsters today are descended from the original litter found in Syria, except for a few that were brought into the United States by travellers who found them in the desert. A separate stock of hamsters were exported from Syria into the US in 1971, but it is not known if any of today's North American pets are descended from them. Recent genetic studies involving mitochondrial DNA have confirmed that all domestic golden hamsters are descended from one female, obviously the one captured by Israel Aharoni in 1930.Surviving in the wild  Following professor Aharoni's collection in 1930, only infrequent sightings and captures were reported in the wild. Finally, to confirm the current existence of the wild Syrian hamster in northern Syria and southern Turkey, two expeditions were carried out during September 1997 and March 1999. The researchers found and mapped 30 burrows. None of the inhabited burrows contained more than one adult. The team caught six females and seven males. One female was pregnant and gave birth to six pups. All these 19 caught Syrian hamsters, together with three wild individuals from the University of Aleppo, were shipped to Germany to form a new breeding stock. Observations of females in this wild population have revealed that contrary to laboratory populations, activity patterns are crepuscular rather than nocturnal, possibly to avoid nocturnal predators such as owls.Syrian hamsters in scientific research  Hamsters are widely used in research. For example, according to the Canadian Council for Animal Care, a total of 6,402 hamsters were used for research in 2006 in Canada, making them the fourth most popular rodent after mice (910,540), rats (331,560), and gerbils (37,246). In captivity, Syrian hamsters follow well defined daily routines of wheel-running activity, which has made them popular subjects in circadian rhythms research. They have a number of fixed action patterns that are readily observed, including scent-marking and body grooming, which is of interest in ethology (the study of animal behaviour). But by far the greatest use of hamsters is in biomedical research. Among other things, because captive Syrian hamsters are highly inbred (being descended from only a few captured individuals) they have a high incidence of a genetic heart condition causing dilated cardiomyopathy. Several inbred strains of hamsters have been developed as animal models for human forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. The gene responsible for hamster cardiomyopathy in a widely studied inbred hamster strain, BIO14.6, has been identified as being delta-sarcoglycan. Pet hamsters are also potentially prone to cardiomyopathy, which is a not infrequent cause of unexpected sudden death in adolescent or young adult hamsters. Scientific studies of animal welfare concerning captive Syrian hamsters have shown that they prefer to use running wheels of large diameters, and that they prefer bedding material which allows them to build nests, if nesting material is not already available.Hamsters as pets  Syrian Hamsters are wildly popular as housepets due to their docile, inquisitive nature and small size. They are popular as \"first pets\" for young children, as well as being classroom animals, because of their hardiness and relative ease of care. Some pet owners find them more attractive than rats and other rodents due to their lack of visible tails. However, their lack of tolerance towards each other is seen by some as a drawback.   Most hamsters in American and British pet stores are Syrian Hamsters. Originally, Syrian Hamsters came in just one color \u2014 the mixture of brown, black, and gold which gave them their \"Golden\" name \u2014 but they have since developed a myriad of color mutations such as cream, white, blonde, banded, tortoiseshell, calico, and sable. Therefore, in pet stores today, Golden Hamster is only used to label the original coloration (also known as agouti). Other-colored short-hairs are banded under the label Fancy Hamster. Some pet stores may call them Dalmations, Panda bears, ect. They like a lot of freedom so they have to be in a large cage, and need to be handled regulary to advoid savigeness.Long-haired or \"Angora\" hamsters  Long-haired, \"Angora\", hamsters are commonly known as \"Teddy Bear\" hamster. Teddy Bear is a term used to describe the long-haired variety of the Syrian Hamster, named so for their remarkable resemblance to toy teddy bears. The fur on a long-haired hamster is thick and fluffy, like a cotton wool, rather than the velvety feel of short-haired fur. People who are not allergic to short-haired hamsters can be allergic to long-hairs. Male teddy bear hamsters usually have much longer fur than the female variety, culminating in a \"skirt\" of longer fur around their backsides. Black Bears are a recent off-shoot of teddy bear hamsters (mutation discovered in 1985), the major difference being their black-colored fur. It can be argued that black bears are just black teddy bears rather than their own breed; on the other hand, black bears were originally selectively bred for their larger size and more docile nature as well as their color. However, in current stock, this is no longer the case.See also References  Template:ReflistExternal links  Template:Commons Template:Hamster  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundHamsters Wiki Roborovski hamster  Template:Taxobox Roborovskis (Phodopus roborovskii) are the smallest of all hamsters commonly kept as pets. Distinguishing characteristics of the Roborovskis are the white spots where the eyebrows would be, and the lack of the dorsal stripe seen in all other dwarf hamsters. They live, on average, to three and a half years of age - the longest of any domestic hamster. Recently, a mutation has arisen producing a \"husky\", also known as \"white-faced\", phase. Breeding these lines with agouti Roborovskis produces a diluted appearance of their natural sandy colour.Habitat  Roborovski hamsters live in the wild around the Gobi Desert, throughout Mongolia's desert steppe and parts of northern China. They are particularly suited to the steppe, as they are highly efficient in their use of water (as evidenced by how they may pass particularly concentrated urine), so little vegetation is required. Here, they dig and live in burrows. These are usually steep tunnels and they live between 60 and 200 cm below ground.History of Human Contact  Lt. Vsevolod Roborovski first made note of these hamsters. He discovered them on an expedition in July, 1894, though they were not studied scientifically for the best part of another decade, until Satunin made observations in 1903.London Zoo imported them into the U.K. in the 1960s, but the first studied in Britain were imported in the 1970s from Moscow Zoo. (None of these hamsters, however, bore offspring.) Continental European countries had more success in breeding Roborovskis, however, and the Roborovskis currently in the U.K. are descendants of a batch imported from the Netherlands in 1990. They were imported in the U.S.A. in 1998, where they remain uncommon, though they are now commonly found in pet shops in several countries. In South Korea, they are almost as common as Winter white Russian dwarf hamsters in pet shops. They are also fairly commonly sold as pets in Israel.Pet Ownership  They are very curious, easily startled, and generally timid, as well as very active, they also don't speak or squeak as much. They benefit from an enriched environment they can be active in. Roborovskis can be hand-tamed if acquired young and individually accustomed to handling. This requires some patience and time investment though. Roborovskis hardly ever bite to break skin but they may nibble. A hamster can easily hurt itself escaping or getting into the wrong places before it is caught. It is important to handle them where they cannot get away as they are hard to catch being both fast and very small, and will not hesitate to wriggle free or jump from their owner's hand if panicked, no matter the distance to the ground. They enjoy being together. Two of these hamsters from different litters may get along if introduced properly, although there is always a chance they may not. It is common for this breed to be extremely vicious, especially with each other. They are very territorial and fights can lead to death. Compatible cage mates will generally play, eat, and sleep together in the same spot. Their antics are constantly entertaining and they make excellent pets for those who want animals that are fun to watch and require less personal handling. Although generally nocturnal, they are more likely to be active during the day than the more commonly-kept Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). They do not, however, like direct light or sunlight and will be more confident emerging in the daytime if their home can be kept in relative shade. Like most other small animal, these hamsters cannot see by red light. Therefore, a \"fireglow\" bulb installed by their cage or tank, though offering little visibility to them, will illuminate their night-time behavior for fascinating observation. Roborovski hamsters have been reported running up to 20 miles a night in about 8 and a half hours.Housing  As they grow to be on average 4.5 cm long - roughly the length of an adult human thumb - Roborovskis can easily squeeze through the bars of a standard hamster cage, and so careful consideration needs to be given to housing. The gaps between bars should be approximately 7 mm in width. First-time owners are advised to inquire of pet shop owners or breeders as to the suitability of cages. The best cage for a roborovski hamster is a small, tight-barred open cage or a large fish aquarium, if you don't want to take chances for them to climb out. Also, cotton should never be put in their cage, there is a high chance they will choke on it.Breeding  Roborovski hamsters may reach sexual maturity as early as 5 weeks, but usually do not breed until they are older. Females should not mate till they are closer to 4 months old, though males can breed at 3 months. The gestation period of Roborovski hamsters is usually 20-22 days, but can be up to 30 according to some sources. Litters are usually small, being typically of 4-6 pups, though larger litters have been reported. Pups can be weaned at 21 days; this is also a good age at which to separate male pups from females.Sexing  Telling female and male Roborovskis apart is not easy. The problem is getting them into a position to view their genitals, as they are not comfortable being handled and are faster than other hamsters. The most common method is to immobilize them by holding them by the scruff of the neck. This should not cause pain if done correctly, as most will 'play dead' and stay very still when in this position. They should be held firmly, though not tightly, for as short a time as possible and not by the ears. However, this technique is not without risk, as an improper grip could cause permanent nerve damage. A much simpler and easier, but not as reliable, method is to put individual hamsters in clear containers and view them from beneath. The two sexes have different openings: female openings are very close together and may even look like just one opening, while male openings are further apart. Males usually have a visible scent gland near the navel, above the two openings - this looks like a yellowish stain. Failure to separate Roborovskis is likely to lead to pregnancy at about five weeks.Footnotes  Template:ReflistResources External links  Template:Hamster de:Roborowski-Zwerghamster es:Phodopus roborovskii eu:Roborovski hamster fr:Hamster de Roborovski id:Hamster Roborovski it:Phodopus roborovskii hu:Roborovszki t\u00f6rpeh\u00f6rcs\u00f6g nl:Woestijndwerghamster ja:\u30ed\u30dc\u30ed\u30d5\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc pl:Chomik Roborowskiego pt:Hamster Roborovski fi:Roborovskink\u00e4\u00e4pi\u00f6hamsteri sv:Robovskis dv\u00e4rghamster zh:\u6c99\u6f20\u4f8f\u5112\u5009\u9f20  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundHamsters Wiki Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster  Template:RefimproveTemplate:Taxobox Winter White Russian hamsters are a species of Hamster in the genus Phodopus. They are typically half the size of the better-known Syrian hamster, and therefore called dwarf hamsters along with all Phodopus species. Features include a typically thick dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. The tail is so short that it hardly shows when the hamster is sitting. As winter approaches and the days shorten, Winter Whites' dark fur greys until it is almost completely white (hence the name). In the wild, this adaptation helps them evade predators in the snow-covered steppes of winter. They live mainly in Siberia and are also found in Dzungaria, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Manchuria. It has been debated whether the Winter White hamster was a sub-species of the Campbell's Dwarf Hamster (Phodopus campbelli) or not; however, recently it was decided that Winter Whites are of their own species, Phodopus sungorus. The average lifespan of the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster is 1\u00bd to 2 years, although they can live longer.Pet Ownership  Winter Whites are often found on the pet market, in Europe and Asia more so than in North America and indeed are rarely found in pet stores in Canada. Care is similar to that of the Campbell's Dwarf Hamster. Winter White hamsters make good pets for teens or adults, not for younger children. They are not likely to bite and like to be cuddled and held. Due to a hamsters poor eyesight the risk of falling or jumping off your hand is high. Dwarf Hamsters are pets to watch. Winter White hamsters which could have some Campbells ancestry should not be fed food containing sources of monosaccharides because of the risk of developing diabetes mellitus.i love my hamster timmy Feeding your Winter White properly is very important. They need to have constant access to a properly formulated hamster food. Most major brands provide all the nutrition a little hammy needs, and they should live a very long life on those alone. That said, you can of course supplement with small amounts of healthy treats such as carrots, broccoli, washed dandelion leaves, and most other vegetables that are not over-ripe (but very very small amounts of iceberg lettuce). Occasional ham and chicken (very small amounts) is appreciated as well. Avoid sticky foods, apart from a very small amount of cooled thick porridge (which they love, and is very good for them as an occasional treat) especially in their old age. Uneaten fresh food should be removed daily. Beware that some flowers found in domestic houses and gardens are poisonous to hamsters. Water is the most important of all, as fresh water is needed regularly. You must make sure to change the water in the bottle at least once a week. If travelling with a hamster, remove the bottle so it doesn't drip, but add a piece of fruit or veg with a high water-content (such as cucumber) to their cage for the journey, and replace their bottle as soon as you arrive.Breeding  In general, dwarf hamsters typically have more of a family structure than the Syrian Hamster. However, this may be a result of a frequent confusion of the Winter Whites and the Campbell's hamsters. Current research suggests biparental care in Campbell's hamsters (Phodopus campbelli) but not in Winter Whites (Phodopus sungorus). Some report that same-sex pairs and larger groups do not always get along well and frequent fighting may occur and be a great distress for them, or even lead to death. Most winter white dwarf hamsters grow to 3 to 4\" long. In the winter their fur grows turns almost completely white. They must get the proper food or they will die. The food for the hamsters that you buy will most likely be the right food. (If a red blood blotch appears then bring it to a vet quickly. It wont harm the hamster but it is a sickness that could cause you to be sick if it is strong enough. Ringworm?(Which is in fact, not a worm, but a fungus.))Template:FactPhases  There are several phases (colorations) of Winter White hamsters: their normal (dark brownish-grey colouring) or sapphire (blue-grey colouring). A white pattern called pearl (white with coloured hairs) sometimes exists in either phase, producing the normal pearl or sapphire pearl forms. However, these colours may be difficult to find, and the range of colours is much narrower than in the case of the Campbell's. Winter White hamsters, also called Siberian hamsters, come from the steppes of Siberia and Kazakhstan and possess an adaptation not seen in Campbells: they can moult into a white winter coat. This camouflages them against the snow and also gives them their name. This moulting is brought on by the amount of day light; if the hamster is kept in an environment with short duration of day light (< 13 hours of light/day) for more than 6 weeks, they will change into their winter coat (white guard hair with thick inner hair) with only a single black stripe going through the centre of the back. Such seasonal moulting is mediated through the nocturnal secretion of melatonin, the hormone secreted by the pineal gland. Short day lengths also triggers the regression of the gonads in both male and females, and thus Winter Whites become infertile. Because Winter White hamsters show such photoperiodic and seasonal changes in physiology and various behaviours, it is also used as a research model system for studying seasonality and photoperiodism.Campbell's/Winter White Hybrids  Of the five species kept commonly as pets, only the Campbells and Winter Whites are able to interbreed and produce live offspring (hybrids). Hybrids are most often unknowingly produced through incorrect identification of the two similar species of hamsters, and unfortunately the number of hybrids is increasing particularly within pet shops in many countries today where they are often mislabeled as being one or other of the pure species. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids should be avoided as it can cause health and birthing problems, and also the widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species in captivity. Therefore, if intending to breed Russian hamsters it is important to ensure that both hamsters being bred are a pure form of, and of the same, species to avoid producing hybrids.Footnotes  Template:ReflistExternal links  Template:Commonscat Template:Hamstercs:K\u0159e\u010d\u00edk d\u017eungarsk\u00fd de:Dsungarischer Zwerghamster es:Phodopus sungorus fr:Hamster russe hr:Bijeli ruski hr\u010dak id:Hamster kerdil putih Rusia it:Phodopus sungorus he:\u05d0\u05d5\u05d2\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9 hu:Dzsung\u00e1riai t\u00f6rpeh\u00f6rcs\u00f6g nl:Russische dwerghamster ja:\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30ac\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc pl:Chomik d\u017cungarski ru:\u0414\u0436\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u043c\u044f\u0447\u043e\u043a sl:Sibirski hr\u010dek sh:Bijeli ruski hr\u010dak fi:Ven\u00e4j\u00e4nk\u00e4\u00e4pi\u00f6hamsteri zh:\u77ed\u5c3e\u4f8f\u5112\u5009\u9f20  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundHamsters Wiki Hamster health conditions  Hamster health conditions can include anything from dental problems due to the continuous growth of the teeth to tumors, which can cause cancer. The following list includes many but not all health conditions that can affect domestic hamsters.Dental problems  Misalignment of incisors due to injury or malnutrition may result in overgrowth, which can cause injury to the roof of the mouth. Symptoms include a drop or loss of appetite, drooling, weight loss, or foul breath. The only cure is for a veterinarian to regularly trim the overgrown incisors and prescribe antibiotics.Trauma  Common injuries are caused by hamsters being dropped or falling, usually while inside an \"exercise ball\", which can cause broken limbs or a fractured spine, for which there is no cure. Injured hamsters should be examined immediately by a veterinarian to determine the best course of action in each situation.Temperature  Hamsters need to be kept in a temperature which is comfortable to most humans. This is good, but occasionally they can get too hot or too cool. If a hamster is too hot, it may get a heat stroke. An animal with heat stroke may be lethargic and limp. Its ears will be down. It might be sweaty or its fur may be matted. If you suspect heat stroke put your hamster in a cool location and mist it gently with cool water. When it seems revived, place it in his cage in a cool location and make sure it has plenty of cold water and cold moist fruits (such as apple) to replenish its fluids. If a hamster is too cold, it may develop induced hibernation. In this state it won't be able to easily wake up and is cold to the touch; he or she may die. Revive the hamster by handling it in a very warm location. Use a heater or a lamp or even the bathroom with hot steamy water running, but do not place the hamster's cage directly on the heating source or it could get too hot. After it is revived, keep it very warm for about ten hours and then make sure it is not chilled again. If a too hot or too cold hamster is not revived by the above treatment within 20 minutes, it will need immediate emergency vet care. To avoid this trauma in the future:Bladder stones  Hamsters are susceptible to bladder stones. Although the owner will typically not detect the stone, symptoms include frequent and painful urination, blood in vagioma, increased water consumption, and loss of appetite. Only a veterinarian can remove the stone and provide appropriate antibiotics.Tumors  Tumors, both benign and malignant, are fairly common in pet hamsters, and are most common in older females. Usually, the tumors involve hormone-producing organs, causing hormone imbalances, hair loss, and changes in behavior. If it is an external tumor, a veterinarian can often perform surgery, but internal tumors are much more difficult to remove, since the animal is so small, so the owners typically elect not to operate, but, rather, to euthanize the pet.Stress Induced conditions Wet tail  The most serious intestinal disease of hamsters is \"wet tail\", or proliferative ileitis, which is most common among weaning hamsters (4-6 weeks) and Syrian hamsters but may occur in any hamster under stressful conditions. Symptoms include lethargy, increased irritability, hunched posture, fluid or bloody diarrhea, a wet, soiled anal area and tail, and, sometimes, rectal prolapse. A veterinarian is needed to immediately examine and evaluate the situation and will usually treat the problem with fluid replacement, oral anti diarrheal medication, and antibiotics, although treatment is often easy to treat if your hamster takes its antibiotics.Salmonellosis  Several species of the bacterium salmonella can cause serious intestinal disease in hamsters and is transmittable to humans. The bacterium is usually acquired by eating contaminated food, especially fruit and vegetables, which can be avoided by thoroughly washing them before they are offered to hamsters. Treatment includes either antibiotics or euthanasia.Demodectic mange  Demodectic mange is a common external parasite problem caused by mites that reside within the hair follicles and certain glands of the skin, with symptoms including scaly skin and significant hair loss, especially over the back. This disease can be treated, but the patient may have an underlying problem, such as kidney disease, for which there is no practical treatment or cure.Rabies and lymphocytic choriomeningitis  Hamsters are not natural hosts of the rabies or lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses, so a hamster can become infected with them if exposed to infected saliva from a natural host, such as a skunk, fox, or bat, although this is highly unlikely in captivity, as hamsters are indoor pets. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is transmittable to humans, with symptoms such as recurrent fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, sore throat, rash, and arthritis.Intestinal parasites  Hamsters frequently harbor intestinal parasites within their small intestines: Owners suspicious of either parasite problem will need to submit a fecal sample to a veterinarian for diagnosis. If there are eggs in the sample, treatment can be instituted by the veterinarian.Eyeless whites  Anophthalmic whites, more commonly known as \"eyeless whites\", are all white hamsters that are born without eyes. These hamsters are produced when two white-bellied hamsters carrying the anophthalmic gene are used for breeding. The eyes are usually non-existent, but are sometimes rudimentary, or not fully developed. The hamsters are typically born deaf as well, and the life span of eyeless whites is around 9-12 months. Blind hamsters are perfectly capable of survival, but they can be a lot more nervous than normal hamsters. Since hamsters usually have poor eyesight to begin with, blindness is not a huge handicap, although the animals are more difficult to tame, so an owner must use extra care. They will feed normally and are very active, although they may seem to lose all comprehension of time, and seem not to know if it is day or night.- Hamster Health Page  Cite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundHamsters Wiki Campbell's dwarf hamster  Campbell's Russian dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli) is a species of dwarf hamster. It was discovered by W.C. Campbell in 1902 in Tuva, an area that has historically been geographically linked with both China and Russia. The Campbell's dwarf is also native to the steppes and semi-arid areas of Central Asia, the Altay mountains, and the provinces of Heilungkiang and Hebei in Northeastern China. This hamster is sometimes called wooffle (or woofles), or simply mousey, and often it is mistakenly labeled as a Siberian or Winter white Russian dwarf hamster, a closely related species of dwarf hamster. (See Winter White/Campbell's Dwarf Hybrids below.) In Tuva the species is called Pouched in the Tuvan language, referring to the well-known physical characteristic of most hamsters. There has been some debate over the classification of Campbell's dwarf and its closely related cousin, the Winter white Russian dwarf hamster, but now the two species are usually classified as Phodopus campbelli and P. sungorus, respectively. It has been claimed that the Campbell's hamster is less friendly in temperament (to humans) than the winter white and is consequently more likely to bite or nip.Habitat  In the steppes of eastern and central Asia, the Campbell's dwarf enjoys digging burrows which may extend up to three feet underground. These burrows are commonly lined with scavenged sheep's wool and dry grasses; the burrows maintain an average temperature of 62 degrees Fahrenheit(16\u00b0C). Natural predators include various owls, foxes, falcons, and weasels. In captivity as pets, the smallness of this animal precludes the use of heavily-scented wood-based cage-litters such as pine or cedar, the former of which can lead to itching, sneezing and even severe allergic reaction and the later of which may lead to death. Catlitter makes a good alternative. Paper-based beddings are encouraged, with aspen shavings usually now being regarded as the only safe wood-based choice. Commercial \"fluffy\" beddings, usually made of cotton or similar material, have come under some controversy as possibly being damaging to stomach or intestines if swallowed. While paper-based or aspen bedding is used to give the hamster burrowing opportunities while providing odor control, plain toilet tissue is frequently recommended as a nesting material to be used in addition to the \"ground cover\" of bedding. Multiple owners find that the use of bathing sand is helpful. Chinchilla bathing sand can be found in most pet stores, although bathing dust is too fine and can thus cause resperitory problems. Bathing sand helps in improving coat and restoring oils in the fur. Bathing a hamster in water is not encouraged, as it is unhealthy for their skin and water removes needed oils. Without those oils any hamster could die easily from cold. Hamsters prefer dark places. Dwarf hamsters also can run extremely quickly. Hamsters cannot live in pine or cedar bedding, as it can kill the hamster.Lifespan  Campbell's dwarf hamsters have an average lifespan in captivity of 18-36 months. Becoming sexually mature at only five weeks, their litters often consist of 4-6 pups, although up to 21 has been recorded in a single litter. The gestation period is 18-21 days, and Campbell's hamsters may mate again immediately after birth.Breeding  Breeding Dwarf Russian Hamsters is much simpler than breeding Syrian Hamsters as they will live together in mixed sex pairs or groups and breed naturally. Pairs or groups are best established at a young age as introducing older hamsters can often result in fighting. Males will naturally mate with the females if kept together and when in season the female will mount the male to mount her. He will thrust a few times before dismounting and washing himself and then often will remount and mate again. The male will usually mate with the female several times. Not all unproven males will get a female pregnant after the first mating and some males may need to mate several times before a successful pregnancy occurs. The actual mating may not always be observed.The gestation period of Dwarf Russian Hamsters is 18-21 days and if mating was observed then the time of the expected arrival of the litter can be roughly calculated. If mating was not observed then it is often not possible to know tell when the litter is expected. Many females do not appear pregnant until a couple of days before the birth but an increased aggressiveness of the female towards her mate, colony hamsters or humans is often an indication of pregnancy. The female will often banish the male or other hamsters from the nest a couple of days before pregnancy and/or after the birth. Therefore as soon as it is noticed the female is pregnant it is best to clean the cage.Females usually give birth during the evening, night or early morning but sometimes give birth during the day. The female is active right up to the moment of birth. Before giving birth to each baby she tightens her abdominal muscles two or three times then sits up and crouches over as she gives birth to a single baby within a couple of minutes. A placenta, which looks like a small red blood sac, may be released after the birth of each baby and this is normally eaten by the mother as it is a good source of protein. Babies are born at approximately 10 minute intervals and the mother may be active between each birth. Therefore babies may be born around the cage but the mother will usually collect them all up and place them in the nest once birthing is complete. After the female has given birth there is often spots of blood on the bedding or around the cage. This is caused by the passing of the placentas and is normal and nothing to be alarmed about. Severe bleeding from the female though should be cause for alarm. The pups are born naked, blind and deaf, weighing only 3 grams. If the hamsters are to be dark eyed the eyes can be seen under the skin but if they are to be red eyed the eyes cannot be seen at birth. They are born with teeth which allow them to suckle and their skin is transparent and once fed the milk can be seen in the stomach.Social Aspects  Unlike other hamster species, especially the Syrian hamsters, the male may play an active role in birth and rearing. He may assist the female in pulling pups from the birth canal, cleaning them, and ensuring the new mother has enough to eat. He may also guard them while the female is away from the nest. Since the pair is likely to mate again quickly, the male should be separated from the female before birth unless more pups are desired and the female is fit enough for a repeat pregnancy. Like other hamsters, the Campbell's Russian dwarf will eat its young in certain emergency (or perceived emergency) situations, such as a protein deficiency in the mother or a threat toward the young. \"Threat\" may include anything from a predator (including a re-introduced father) to a habitat that the parent hamster does not believe will provide adequate size, covering, food, or water for its new inhabitants. Unlike Syrian hamsters, Campbell's dwarfs are sociable and may be kept in colonies. If the hamsters are introduced at a young age, generally younger than eight weeks, they will often happily coexist in same- or mixed-sex groups. (Note that mixed-sex groups should be avoided as hamsters are lively breeders.) Contrary to some claims, the hamsters do not have to be related to live together peacefully. Some Campbell's dwarfs live together for long periods of time, such as over a year, only to eventually and unexpectedly end up fighting to the point of requiring separation. Pet owners should plan for the possibility of providing additional accommodations should this occur. Campbell's dwarfs are crepuscular, meaning that they are most active at dawn and at dusk.Diet  Diabetes is becoming a common problem in Campbell's hamsters and is an inherited problem. Unless an individual hamster's ancestry is known to be free of the illness, a Campbell's dwarf should not be fed any sugary foods (including fruit, corn, peas, carrots, yogurt drops, and some mass-manufactured \"treats\"), nor should they be bred.It can make it bleed and make it die in 5 to 6 weeks. Like all hamsters, Campbell's dwarfs are rodents and therefore must gnaw regularly to keep the incisors from growing into the skin of the mouth and causing health problems. Some pet owners provide dog biscuits to assist with this. Wooden chew toys should be used with care as splinters may injure the hamster. Teeth should be examined regularly to ensure they are not growing unchecked. In the wild, Campbell's dwarfs consume a variety of grains, seeds, and vegetables. For the pet hamster, commercial seed mixes and food pellets are available and should be augmented with occasional fresh vegetables. Care should be taken in selecting a seed mix that does not include harmful foods, some of which are suitable for other rodents (including other types of hamsters). The following items should be avoided:Other Health Issues  Campbell's hamsters have extremely poor eyesight and even worse depth perception. Cataracts can be common in older hamsters. To compensate for this disability, the hamster has many scent glands, which are located on the face, behind the ears, on the cheek pouches, and on the belly near the rectum and genitals. Many pet owners observe that the hamster may groom itself when in an unfamiliar location. This is done to scent the feet, creating a trail which enables the hamster to find its way back to the burrow. This behavior may also be used to revisit a location with plentiful food. These scent trails may persist for up to eight days. In addition to diabetes, hamsters can develop tumors (both benign and malignant), as well as glaucoma. It is possible to remove benign and malignant tumors with surgery. Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done about glaucoma, as the eye will eventually prolapse. The \"starter pet\" reputation of hamsters may cause some to dismiss the idea of veterinary care. Although many pet hamsters live their entire lives without needing to visit a veterinarian, prospective hamster owners should remember this possible expense when considering the dwarf hamster for a pet.Colors and Markings  Campbell's hamsters are born with one of four coat types: normal, satin, wavy and rex. The normal coat is short and flat. The satin coat is shiny and gives the appearance of being wet or greasy and the gene enhances the fur's color and gives it lift. The wavy coat is slightly long and wavy; the whiskers are curly when young and, although the coat moults out to a normal coat, the curly whiskers remain through adulthood. The rex coat is a soft, short coat which is curled so as to be \"lifted\" from the body and the whiskers are curly. The rex coat is often sparse and remains curled even in adult hamsters. Campbell's dwarfs are available in six basic colors plus many variations thereof. Basic colors include: Marking types include: Not all white hamsters with red/pink eyes are albino. Some are so heavily mottled or tinged with platinum that they will appear to be white. Hamsters carrying the black gene (almost half of all variations) are prone to \"silvering\"; in extreme cases the eventual result is an almost white hamster. When two ruby-eyed mottled hamsters are bred, approximately 25% of the litter are born lacking teeth and eyes; these pups, called \"eyeless toothless,\" generally do not live past weaning. Whether a mottled hamster has ruby eyes (which often appear black) can be difficult to determine; pointing a flashlight at the hamster in the dark may reveal the hint of ruby. Furthermore, some mottling may be too small to be noticed, or the mottling may be misidentified as platinum markings, and in these cases two ruby-eyed mottleds may accidentally be bred, resulting in the ill-fated pups. Combining the different mutations has produced new colors, including blue, blue fawn, lilac fawn, beige, chocolate, champagne, dove, and others. Contrary to some claims, the different colors and markings of hamsters do not indicate personality differences. Most breeders attempt to predict personality by closely examining the bloodline and any neurological diseases the hamster's ancestors displayed.Winter White/Campbell's Dwarf Hybrids  Of the five species of hamsters usually kept as pets, only the Winter White and Campbell's dwarfs are able to interbreed and produce live offspring (hybrids). Hybrids are most often unknowingly produced through incorrect identification of the two similar species of hamsters, such as mislabeling at a pet store. Unfortunately, the number of hybrids is increasing, leading to a rise in health problems (such as the emergence of diabetes in the Winter White and glaucoma in the Campbell's Russian) and a decrease of pure species in captivity. Breeding of hybrids is discouraged, and the amount of accidental hybrid breeding and its repercussions underscores the cautions of casual breeding already expressed above.Hamsters Wiki Guinea pigs  Template:Pp-semi-vandalism Template:Otheruses Template:Taxobox The guinea pig (also commonly called the Cavy after its scientific name, Cavia porcellus) is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name, these animals are not pigs, nor do they come from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida or C. tschudii, and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild. The guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies. Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America. In Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, their responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders. Guinea pig is also used as a metaphor in English for a subject of experimentation; this usage became common in the first half of the 20th century. Biological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century; the animals were frequently used as a model organism in the 19th and 20th centuries, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.History  The common guinea pig was first domesticated as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the Andean region of South America (present-day Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia).Statues dating from ca. 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art. From ca. 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532, selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds. They continue to be a food source in the region; most households in the Andean highlands raise the animal, which subsists off the family's vegetable scraps.Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors. They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors, or curanderos, who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice, rheumatism, arthritis and typhus. They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick, and are seen as a supernatural medium. Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses. The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective. These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes, where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted. Spanish, Dutch and English traders brought guinea pigs to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty, including Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was likely introduced there by Spanish travelers. The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Konrad Gesner. Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas's generic designation (1766) and Linnaeus's specific conferral (1758).Name  The scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus, with porcellus being Latin for \"little pig\". Cavia is New Latin; it is derived from cabiai, the animal's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana.Cabiai may be an adaptation of the Portuguese \u00e7avia (now savia), which is itself derived from the Tupi word sauj\u00e1, meaning rat. Guinea pigs are called quwi or jaca in Quechua and cuy or cuyo (pl. cuyes, cuyos) in the Spanish of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Paradoxically, breeders tend to use the more formal \"cavy\" to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial \"guinea pig\". How the animals came to be thought of as \"pigs\" is not clear. They are built somewhat like pigs, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating. They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a 'pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe. The animal's name carries porcine connotations in many European languages. The German word for them is Meerschweinchen, literally \"little sea pigs\". (The Polish \u015bwinka morska and Russian \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 mean exactly the same.) This derives from nautical history: sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat; Schweinswal (pig-whale) is German for porpoise, which was another food source for sailors. The French term is Cochon d'Inde (Indian pig); the Dutch used to call it guinees biggetje (Guinean piglet) or Spaanse rat (Spanish rat) in some dialects, and in Portuguese the guinea pig is sometimes referred to as porquinho da \u00cdndia (little Indian pig). This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias (little rabbit of India / the Indies). The origin of \"guinea\" in \"guinea pig\" is harder to explain. One theory is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to think they had originated there. \"Guinea\" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, and so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's foreignness. Another theory suggests the \"guinea\" in the name is a corruption of \"Guiana\", an area in South America, though the animals are not native to that region. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin; this theory is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term \"Ginny-pig\" as early as 1653. Others believe \"guinea\" may be an alteration of the word coney (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as \"pig coneys\" in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.Traits and environment  Guinea pigs are large for rodents, weighing between 700 and 1200g (1.5-2.5\u00a0pounds), and measuring between 20 and 25\u00a0cm (8\u201310\u00a0inches) in length. They typically live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight years. According to the 2006 Guinness Book of Records the longest living guinea pig survived 14\u00a0years, 10.5\u00a0months. In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas and degus, are not rodents and should be reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to lagomorphs). Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as monophyletic is justified.Natural habitat  Cavia porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descendant from some closely related species of cavies, such as Cavia aperea, Cavia fulgida, and Cavia tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of South America. Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as Cavia anolaimae and Cavia guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild. Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of the cow. They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females (sows), a male (boar), and the young (which in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature are called pups). They move together in groups (herds) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food. While they do not burrow or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation. They are crepuscular, tending to be most active during dawn and dusk, when it is harder for predators to spot them.Domestic habitat  Domesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows that their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided that their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the 24 hours of the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent. Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs will dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot (ulcerative pododermatitis). \"Cubes and Coroplast\" (or C&C) style cages are now a common choice. Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material. Bedding made from red cedar and pine, both softwoods, was commonly used in past decades, but these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils. Safer beddings include those made from hardwoods (such as aspen); paper products and corn cob materials are other alternatives. Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their urine crystallizes on cage surfaces and can be difficult to remove. After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig will typically urinate and drag the lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages. Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species. Cohousing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) can be trained to accept them. Guinea pigs can be safely housed with degu as they share the same dietary needs and have similar behavioural traits. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, and so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as the respiratory infections Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.Behavior  Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem solving strategy is motion. While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, they cannot climb, and are not particularly agile. They startle extremely easily, and will either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger. Larger groups of startled guinea pigs will \"stampede\", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators. When excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air (known as \"popcorning\"), a movement analogous to the ferret's war dance. They are also exceedingly good swimmers. Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in social grooming, and they regularly self-groom. A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process. Groups of boars will often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture. Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), piloerection, aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks. Non-sexual simulated mounting for dominance is also common among same-sex groups. Guinea pigs have poor sight, but well-developed senses of hearing, smell, and touch. Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species. Some sounds are:Breeding  The guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; as many as five litters can be produced per year. The gestation period lasts from 59\u201372 days, with an average of 63\u201368 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and aubergine-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield 1\u20136 pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during labour due to over-sized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns. Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating. Male and female guinea pigs do not differ in external appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap; while the male genitals may look similar with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling. Males reach sexual maturity at 3\u20135 weeks; females can be fertile as early as four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth commonly develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, after six months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death as they attempt to give birth. Females can become pregnant 6\u201348 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be thus constantly pregnant. Toxemia of pregnancy is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates. Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcemia, and mastitis.Diet  Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In older boars (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces. Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though there exists some controversy over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, amino acids and fiber. Like humans, but unlike most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about Template:Convert of vitamin C daily (Template:Convert if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets have been associated with muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Some sources also suggestTemplate:Weasel-inline that guinea pigs are especially susceptible to gall and kidney stones, making it important to limit calcium intake in their diet. This may involve limiting or eliminating multi-vitamin supplements and calcium-rich foods (like commercially-produced yogurt drops, spinach or very high proportions of alfalfa).Template:Fact Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accepting new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely gnaw, lest their teeth become too large for their mouth, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs will also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber. A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, potato, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip and onion) is normally considered poisonous.Health  Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include respiratory infections, diarrhea, scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), abscesses due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches), and infections by lice, mites or fungus. Mange mites (Trixacarus caviae) are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched (due to pain), and, in some instances, seizures. Guinea pigs may also suffer from \"running lice\" (Gliricola porcelli), a small white insect which can be seen moving through the hair; the eggs of these lice, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as \"static lice\". Giving a bath with neem oil soap is a gentle and effective way of ridding the pig of lice. Other causes of hair loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as ovarian cysts. Foreign bodies, especially small pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust will also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal. Because the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, the animal more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat. Its normal body temperature is 101\u2013104\u00a0\u00b0F (38.5\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C), and so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to the human's, about 65\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C). Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) have been linked to hyperthermia and death, especially among pregnant sows. Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts, and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30\u201370%. Guinea pigs are prey animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death. Similar to the inherited genetic diseases of other breeds of animal (such as hip dysplasia in canines), a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported. Most commonly, the roan coloration of Abyssinian guinea pigs is associated with congenital eye disorders and problems with the digestive system. Other genetic disorders include \"waltzing disease\" (deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles), palsy, and tremor conditions.Pets  If handled correctly early in their life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers, and rarely attempt to escape from their cages, even when an opportunity presents itself. Guinea pigs who become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is stored. Domesticated guinea pigs come in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. Cavy Clubs and Associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide. The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada. The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council) and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Club). Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.Cultural and media influence  As a result of their widespread popularity in human domestic life, and especially because of their popularity in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in literature are The Fairy Caravan, a novel by Beatrix Potter, and Michael Bond's Olga da Polga series for children, both of which feature guinea pigs as the central protagonist. Another appearance is in The Magician's Nephew by C. S. Lewis: in the first (chronologically) of his The Chronicles of Narnia series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the Wood between the Worlds. The short story Pigs is Pigs by Ellis Parker Butler is a tale of bureaucratic incompetence; two guinea pigs held at a train station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are \"pigs\" for the purpose of determining freight charges. In the Golden Hamster Saga books, there are 2 guinea pigs named Enricho and Caruso who serve as secondary characters. Guinea pigs have also been featured in film and television. In the TV movie Shredderman Rules, the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs which both play a minor part in the plot. A guinea pig named Rodney, voiced by Chris Rock, was a prominent character in the 1998 film Dr. Dolittle and Linny the Guinea pig is a co-star on Nick Jr's Wonder Pets. Guinea pigs were used in some major advertising campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s, notably for Egg Banking plc,Snapple, and Blockbuster Video. The Blockbuster campaign is considered by some guinea pig advocates to have been a factor in the rise of cohousing guinea pigs and rabbits. In the 12th Season of South Park \"Pandemic\", giant guinea pigs are portrayed as rampaging over the entire Earth.Scientific research  The use of guinea pigs in scientific experimentation dates back at least to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure heat production. The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning. Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, \u00c9mile Roux, and Robert Koch. Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space-flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 - with a successful recovery.China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers. In English, the term guinea pig is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation. This dates back to the early 20th century; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913. In 1933, Consumers' Research founders F. J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, extending the metaphor to consumer society. The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement. The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. As of 2007, they constitute approximately 2% of the current total of laboratory animals. In the past they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation. Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats. This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W. E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color. In 2004, the U.S.'s National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig. The guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Common uses included identification of brucellosis, Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus. They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria. Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans, cannot synthesize vitamin C but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy.Complement, an important component for serology, was first isolated from the blood of the guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of preeclampsia in human females. Guinea pig strains used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains. Aside from the common American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are albino, although pigmented strains are also available.Inbred strains are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology. Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two that are still used with any frequency are, following Sewall Wright's designations, \"Strain 2\" and \"Strain 13\". Hairless breeds of guinea pigs have been used in scientific research since the 1980s, particularly for dermatological studies. A hairless and immunodeficient breed was the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in inbred laboratory strains from the Hartley stock at the Eastman Kodak Company in 1979. An immunocompetent hairless breed was also identified by the Institute Armand Frappier in 1978, and Charles River Laboratories has reproduced this breed for research since 1982. Cavy fanciers then began acquiring hairless breeds, and the pet hairless varieties are referred to as \"skinny pigs\".As food  Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, cur\u00ed) were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was usually reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cows; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs. Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried (chactado or frito), broiled (asado), or roasted (al horno), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish.Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings. Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year, and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the Last Supper in the main cathedral in Cusco shows Christ and the twelve disciples dining on guinea pig. The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru. A religious celebration known as jaca tsariy (\"collecting the cuys\") is a major festival in many villages in the Antonio Raimondi province of eastern Peru, and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in Lima. It is a syncretistic event, combining elements of Catholicism and pre-Columbian religious practices, and revolves around the celebration of local patron saints. The exact form that the jaca tsariy takes differs from town to town; in some localities, a sirvinti (servant) is appointed to go from door to door, collecting donations of guinea pigs, while in others, guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock bullfight. Meals such as cuy chactado are always served as part of these festivities, and the killing and serving of the animal is framed by some communities as a symbolic satire of local politicians or important figures. In the Tungurahua and Cotopaxi provinces of central Ecuador, guinea pigs are employed in the celebrations surrounding the feast of Corpus Christi as part of the Ensayo, which is a community meal, and the Octava, where castillos (greased poles) are erected with prizes tied to the crossbars, from which several guinea pigs may be hung. The Peruvian town of Churin has an annual festival which involves dressing guinea pigs in elaborate costumes for a competition. Andean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy. Peruvian research universities, especially La Molina National Agrarian University, began experimental programs in the 1960s with the intention of breeding larger-sized guinea pigs. Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America, in order to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable. In the 1990s and 2000s, the university began exporting the larger breed guinea pigs to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of South America. Efforts have also been made to introduce guinea pig husbandry in developing countries in West Africa. Nevertheless, as a food source they are still generally considered taboo in North America and Europe; in reality television, guinea pig meat has been consumed as an exotic dish by such Western celebrity chefs as Andrew Zimmern (for his show Bizarre Foods) and Anthony Bourdain in No Reservations.See also  Template:PortalparFootnotes  Template:ReflistReferences  Template:Refbegin Template:Refend  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundHamsters Wiki Dwarf hamster  Template:Taxobox The dwarf hamsters represent a group of small hamsters in the genus Phodopus.

The Campbell's Dwarf Hamster and Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster, which is often referred to in Russian as a \"Shwi-shwi\", usually live between 1.5 and 2.5 years and reach a length of about 8-10cm. The Chinese Hamster is 10-12cm in length and usually lives to 2.5 to 3 years. The Roborovski Hamster is the smallest at only 4-5cm and lives for 3 to 3.5 years.The Russian Winter White is 8-10cm, as are the Campbell's.

It is typically found in low-lying farm land with soft loam or loess soils, although it may also inhabit meadows, gardens, or hedges. It is widely considered a farmland pest, and has also been trapped for its fur. The black-bellied hamster is found from Belgium (e.g. Bertem with a thriving population) and Alsace in the west, to Russia in the east, and Romania in the south. European hamsters are much larger than the Syrian hamsters or dwarf hamsters commonly kept as pets, being around 10-15 cm longer than guinea pigs. In captivity, the European hamster has an unusually long life span, living up to eight years. They are very rarely kept as pets and have been known to attack large dogs if they feel threatened. In 2007 the European Commission threatened to fine France \u20ac17m for failing to protect the last remaining colony of the Black-bellied Hamster in Western Europe HamsterLover Template:Reflist Template:Hamster Template:Cricetidae-stub de:Feldhamster fr:Hamster d'Europe id:Hamster Eropa it:Cricetus cricetus lv:Eiropas k\u0101mis li:Korewouf hu:Mezei h\u00f6rcs\u00f6g nl:Hamster (dier) ja:\u30af\u30ed\u30cf\u30e9\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc pl:Chomik europejski pt:Hamster-comum ru:\u0425\u043e\u043c\u044f\u043a \u043e\u0431\u044b\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 fi:Eurooppalainen hamsteri sv:Europeisk hamster uk:\u0425\u043e\u043c'\u044f\u043a \u0437\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 zh:\u539f\u5009\u9f20\u5c6cHamsters Wiki Turkish hamster  The Turkish Hamster Mesocricetus brandti is a species of hamster closely related to the Syrian Hamster.

These animals grow to between 7.5 and 9 cm in length and as adults can weigh 50-75 grams. They live two to three years on average. The Chinese hamster is often kept as a pet or (in the past) as a laboratory animal. A Chinese hamster's body proportions, compared with those of other hamsters, appear \"long and thin\" and they have (for a hamster) a relatively long tail. Males have a relatively large scrotum, therefore females are generally kept as pets and males are used solely for breeding and research purposes. Chinese hamsters are not related to the social \"dwarf\" hamsters. The term \"dwarf\" is often used to refer solely to animals in the genus Phodopus, (the two types of Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamsters and Roborovski hamsters). The wild colour is greyish brown above with a black stripe down the spine and a whitish belly. This coloration, combined with their lithe build and longer tail, makes them look \"mousy\" to some eyes and, in fact, they are members of the group called ratlike hamsters. Besides the wild colour, a well-known variation is the white-spotted Chinese hamster, which often is greyish white all over, with only a dark stripe on its back. They have quiet temperaments and are easily handled; one of their endearing traits is that of clinging to a finger with all four paws, rather like a harvest mouse on a corn stalk. Chinese hamsters can be quite nervous as youngsters but, once they are tame, display an endearing calmness and gentleness of character. In the past, Chinese hamsters were commonly used laboratory animals, until they were replaced by the common mouse and rat, which are easier to keep and breed. However, quite a few biotech drugs are still being produced by putting the gene for the protein into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells), which then produce the protein. Of note, some US states such as California regard the Chinese hamster as a pest, and as a result require a special permit to own, breed or sell[1]. Other states such as New Jersey call it an exotic animal, and require a similar permit, in order to prevent the proliferation of non-indigenous animals [2].Latin name  There is quite some confusion over the Latin name of the Chinese hamster and the closely related Chinese striped hamster. Some people consider the Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) and the Chinese striped hamster (Cricetulus barabensis) different species [3], whereas others classify them as identical [4], the Chinese striped hamster as a subspecies of the Chinese hamster (in which case the latin name of the Chinese striped hamster would be Cricetulus griseus barabensis) [5] or the other way round (in which case the latin name of the Chinese hamster would be Cricetulus barabensis griseus) [6].References Hamsters Wiki NOM  Hello everybody!

Most hamster balls are made of durable, transparent plastic with air holes and a small door or lid to allow the owner to insert or remove the hamster from the ball. Although hamster balls are designed to protect hamsters, there are hazards such as stairs and other high places from which hamsters can fall, resulting in injury or even death. It is advised that any hamster owners with hamster balls must keep them on the floor on the lower levels of the house, away from any stairs.

Most of these toys are composed of a runged wheel held on a stand by a pair of stub axles. Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined. Most wheels are constructed of steel or plastic, both with advantages and problems. Solid plastic wheels are safer for some types of pets, such as hamsters, because the space between rungs is solid and the animal's feet or legs cannot get stuck between rungs, a injury risk in steel wheels. However, some rodents (such as gerbils) will quickly chew on and destroy plastic wheels, but not steel wheels. The earliest dated use of the term \u201chamster wheel\u201d located by the Oxford English Dictionary is in a 1949 newspaper advertisement. Choice tests with Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) have shown that they prefer larger wheels; the animals chose a wheel diameter of 35 cm (14 in) over 23 cm (9 in), which itself was preferred over 17.5 cm (7 in). The hamsters expressed no preference between a relatively uniform running surface made of plastic mesh and a surface made of rungs spaced 9 mm apart, though they did prefer the mesh over rungs spaced 12 mm apart, most likely because the wider space between the rungs let the legs slip through sometimes. The hamsters neither preferred nor avoided wheels that had small \"speed bumps\" installed along the running surface to provide environmental enrichment. Choice tests with mice have also shown a preference for larger wheels (17.5 cm over 13 cm in diameter) and a preference for plastic mesh over rungs and over solid plastic as a running surface. More acrobatic species, such as the canyon mouse, Peromyscus crinitus, and the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, can develop preferences for wheels that force the animals to jump, such as square wheels or wheels with hurdles along the running surface. Like other rodents, hamsters are highly motivated to run in wheels; it is not uncommon to record distances of 9 km (6 miles) ran in one night. Other 24-h records include 43 km (26 miles) for rats, 31 km (18.5 miles) for wild mice, 19 km (11.5 miles) for lemmings, 16 km (9.5 miles) for laboratory mice, and 8 km (5 miles) for gerbils. Hypotheses to explain such high levels of running in wheels include a need for activity, substitute for exploration, and stereotypic behaviour, but various experimental results strongly suggest that wheel running, like play or the runner's high, is rewarding in and of itself and highly valued by the animals. It is tempting to draw parallels with humans who run for fun. This makes running wheels a popular type of enrichment (even an essential one, in the view of some) to the captivity conditions of rodents. The reliability with which hamsters and other rodents will use a running wheel has made wheel-running one of the most widely used markers of activity and wake time in circadian rhythms research. A related toy, the hamster ball is a plastic ball into which a pet can be temporarily locked. The ball allows the pet to freely roll around on the floor to explore and exercise, while preventing escape. Care must be taken to block off stairways, and time in the ball should be limited as more than an hour without access to water could impose dehydration on the animal.Hamster wheel humour  Hamster wheels have often been proposed as the basis of many speculative methods for power generation, though they are not feasible for large-scale applications; Make Magazine and other similar publications have included directions for rodent-powered nightlights, but such projects are explicitly small-scaled and meant mostly for humor value. Running hamsters are often said in jest to be the true power behind computer networks, especially slow-moving or unreliable ones. The joke is similarly applied to sub-compact automobiles and other small motor vehicles. Of course, energy can be produced more efficiently by burning food directly in a furnace rather than giving the food to a hamster and harnessing the power output of its running activity.Human-sized wheels  Runged wheels have been constructed large enough to allow humans to exercise and/or roll around in them. See also wheel gymnastics. A wheel that is used for power generation by humans or large animals is called a treadwheel. A similar wheel was used as the \"One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel\" on the game show Double Dare as one of the obstacles in the final obstacle course round. The Peruvian children's show Nubeluz also featured a wheel known as \"La Ruleta Sofica\", which debuted during the show's third anniversary celebration in 1993.References  Template:ReflistExternal links  Template:Commons-inlinede:Laufrad (Kleintier) hu:M\u00f3kusker\u00e9k fi:Jyrsij\u00f6iden juoksupy\u00f6r\u00e4  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundHamsters Wiki Greater Long-tailed Hamster  The Greater Long-tailed Hamster (Tscherskia triton) is a major crop-eating rodent that resides in Northern China.

These tiny hamsters are about an inch long at birth and grow to be on average two inches long. Distinguishing characteristics of the Roborovskis are the white spots where the eyebrows would be, and the lack of the dorsal stripe seen in all other dwarf hamsters. They live, on average, for 3-3.5 years although over 4 years has been known. These hamsters are hypo-allergenic so may not cause the same allergy symptoms most other types of hamsters can.As Pets  Roborvski hamsters are not very good pets for younger children that like to hold and play with the hamsters a lot. However, they make good pets for older and more mature pet owners that like to observe and maybe even slowly tame the usually very shy Robo. They are extremely fast, but rarely ever bite people. However, one should keep in mind that Roborovskis all have different personalities and will differ one from another.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Featured article: MSPAFA Awards  New award ceremony!

It is an AU sequel to Homestuck, and it follows the continuing adventures of the Trolls and Humans, on the new planet of Gallifrey.It is hard impossible not to like, due to such things as hard-boiled detectives, and Socially awkward drumming Tesla clones. Also, ghost Tavros.Plot  At some point before the story, the Kids/Trolls won Sburb/Sgrub (though nobody can quite remember how), entered the new universe, and settled the planet of Gallifrey. They founded a city by the sea, run by the Godly Triumvirate (God-tiered characters) and the Court of Skaia. The city is made up of trolls made by mixing DNA of all the trolls in a manner simulating the normal genetic slurry, and ecto-clones of various humans/historical figures. Outside the city, there is a town of carapaced people, and the nearby forest is filled with crazy subjuggulators, lead by Gamzee. In addition, John married Vriska, and Dave married Jade.Prologue  The story actually begins 11 years later on John's 24th birthday, on April 13th. At first, he tries to avoid his wife Vriska, so she doesn't force him to do some sort of training. Wacky hijinks involving Ghost Tavros/Equius, cool cars, and flaming ovens insue, but eventually everyone gets there. Vriska and John almost have a large fight when Vriska thinks that he is cheating on her with Aradia, but John calms her down with a kiss before it gets too heated. Thus ends the prologue.Act 1: Kids and Fun and Death  Act 1 starts with a perspective switch to feralAncient, a clone of Kanaya, Nepeta and (SPOILER), who is sort of Kanaya's adoptive daughter. She runs the library. She converses with her friend, flintlockEnthusiast (a Sassacre clone), and her frienemy oceanRising (a clone of Eridan and Feferi). She then prepres for the plans they have that night (later revealed to be exploring outside the city), then leaves. It then switches to FE's perspective, who pesters Jade, OR, draconicMachine, and ironicSincerity, the latter of which is an ecto-clone of Dave's Bro, who lives with Dave and is treated like his younger brother. He is a member of the Knights of Time, part of the city guards/military, lead by Dave. He then leaves to meet with FA. It then switches to aggroPaladin (a Tavros and Karkat clone), one of the Knights of Blood, lead by Karkat. He gets Trolled by fellow Knight and Troll, ragingVanguard, then pestered by FE who tells him to hurry up and meet him and OR. He then gets gang-pestered by a bunch of Subjuggulators, who tell him they'll see him that night. He freaks out, then trys to tell Karkat, who ignores him. He freaks out harder. He decides to try telling RV, but the converstion window is gone, and she tells him to stop screwing around. He tries to tell the adults, but can't reach them. He trolls DM, who apparently knew the clowns were coming, but nobody listened. He then rushes towards to court building, to try and warn everyone. It goes back to FE's perspective, while he and FA are at an abandoned warehouse. He is waiting for OR, IS, and AP. Then it's back to OR, who starts to sew something... Perspective continues to jump around, back to FE, who is being watched by some sleuth. Meanwhile, AP is trying to get into the meeting, but stopped by IS and greatEmancipator (an Abraham Licoln clone), who choke-slams him. At the same time, OR gets going, along with some gifts for FA and FE. AP then tries to explain the problem to the Knights of Time, but they refuse to let him talk. A fight breaks out, and ghastlyIncendiary, a Knight of Blood, tries to talk it out, being the town Auspitice(r). OR then arrives at the warehouse, and gives FE a suit, which he loves. She then gives FA a shirt with her Caste symbol on it, which she detests. FE then informs OR about the fact that problemInquisitor, a problem sleuth, is watching them. He pesters her, but some word choice causes her to thinks he is threatening her. Suddenly cutting to the not-so-far future, a mysterious Human-Troll Hybrid is standing in the ruined courtroom, holding the GODSLAYER, a strong weapon. Back in the present, constantThinker(an ecto-clone of Einstein), is standing in his room being pestered by Tesla, Troll Tesla (who is not actually a Tesla in any biological way), DM and a Troll named deepseaTyphoon. He begins by talking to Troll Telsa, who insults the Tesla clone. At the same time, AP assualts GE, but only manages to damage his hat. RV, who has followed, then begins to kick AP in the crotch. Many times. In! A! Completely! Platonic! Fashion! Back at CT's room, he answers DM, who aparently wants CT to help him overthrow the Court. CT refuses, then looks across the window at a creepy Vampire Troll, also known as twilightSparkle. CT dislikes him, but he has to admit the scarf TS made him is cool. Meanwhile, back at the clubhouse, the group, minus FA, try to coax PI into coming over. Meanwhile, FA is deciding to get more friends, to create some sort of group to do... something... once she thinks of a name and a goal. Eventually she decides on the League of Extraordinary Youngsters, or the L.E.Y, who will help the weak and down-trodden. PI tries to decide whether or not to reply to FE's pestering, while CT considers murdering TS with the scarf. He then realizes it would ruin the scarf, and decides against it. John (or Sir John \"Nicolas Cage\" Egbert) then fantasizes about being a \"Hammer Knight of the Round Table\" and rescuing Vriska (probably not virginal young maiden and pirate captain Mindfang) from Jack Noir, or the \"Evil Dogheaded Amputee Knight Jackson Black\". He and Karkat (Poncho Vantas) go to town to ask where Jackson Black is. Apparently he is with Eridan (Orphaner Dualscar), and they get going, but not before getting Dave (Sir David). Back in reality, PI then tries to sneak into the warehouse, but the L.E.Y notice. We finally meet Tesla, or technicianMagician, who is busy at the library crushing on FA, who is sadly not there. Einstein finally gets around to replying to him, and TM asks if CT knows where some books might be, which are all about trolls. CT finds that weird, but TM makes up some excuse. TM then bothers a troll named literaryEmpress, thinking she is a librarian of some sort, but she explains she is not. The conversation ends on an awkward note. Back at the Hall of Justice Court of Skaia, AP rages even harder, roars, and stuns his aggressors. Elsewhere, PI proceeds to jump through the window of the hideout, yelling that she comes in peace. FA is reasonably confused. CT then finally answers DT, who has made a breakthrough in the cloning process of the lusii, and wants CT to show up to vouch for them to the adults. He agrees, even though he isn`t even involved in that project. AP finally gets into the court, while RV decides to go home. He also pesters OR to tell her to cancel the plan, but she refuses. Sir John continues on his quest, meeting a seer, Redglare (Terezi). She tells him where Dualscar/Jackson is, then joins the party. Poncho and Sir David begin to hit on her. Then a wild Lemonsnout appears, but the story immediatly switches back to CT, who decides to build models for the rest of the day. OR invites PI to join their group, to replace AP. She does, but is disapointed he dropped out. The group decides to wait for nightfall/IS, and PI sets up some space inside the hideout for herself. She is pestered by TM, and is irritable at first, but agrees to hang out with him the next day. However, he hacked LE's chumlist to find out FA's name, and LE finds out. DM is inside his underground lab, reading a book about culling that TM had asked CT about. He breaks the forth wall by adressing the reader, and asking that we leave. We comply. Back in John's crazy fantasy, he meets Lady Jade (Jade, duh), who joins the party, but under the switch members tab as opposed to an active member. More proof how crazy John is. Oh, and Poncho and Dave hit on her, too. Meanwhile, Vriska tries to get John's attention, but fails, Karkat then tells her to answer a question, which she didn't hear. She tries to bull her way out of it, but Karkat calls her out. Apparently they were asking if she was ready to start. She is saved from embarassement when AP bursts in however. Karkat reacts with pride at how well he raged, but knocks AP out when he asks if he can call Karkat \"dad\". He falls onto the table, and Terezi asks if they can keep him. Karkat says no. John finally snaps out of it, and they start the meeting. They adress a bunch of the kids concerns, but nothing too plot relevant, besides a brief mention that they are aware of hackers in the pestering system, most likely the Subjuggulators. We then go to Karkat, who met up with his former dreamself's dream bubble while he was sleeping. He is sitting on the couch at his and Terezi's hive. He fell asleep watching a musical based off Hivebent, though it is terribly inaccurate. He sneaks a few sips of Faygo, then watches the musical for a bit, but decides to watch it later. He then goes to the balcony, where he sees a upset Terezi. He attempts to console her, but ends up sounding like a jerk. Trying to apologize, he hugs her. She is understandably surprised. She reveals to Karkat that she feels like they should be more involved with the troll children, like Kanaya was with FA. However, Karkat feels they should avoid emotional attachment, so when the clowns attack, they won't be crying for every kid Gamzee kills. Terezi asks if they could try rasing one child, and Karkat eventually agrees to think about it. The tender moment is disturbed when Dave pesters them. Jade's giving birth and John has blocked everyone. The two quickly arrive, and soon Danielle Johnathan Strider is born. Aradia gets an ominous sense of foreboding, but it quickly passes. Terezi wants to hold the baby, but DJ is scared of her. She gives her back to Jade, but her curiosity gets the best of her, and she asks how human reproduction works... We cut to John and Vriska outside the Court, as Vriska reminds John he promised her a date, all the way back at the end of the prologue. He has no plans, but then gets a great idea. RUN AWAY! Oh, wait no. That's stupid. Dave tries to pester him, but he blocks him. Eventually he uses wind powers and Inventory ex Machina to parody Alladin, and they land from a carpet ride to applause from CT, who is nearby, along with DT. They try to leave, but decide against it. After some shenanagins, they tell the couple about how they want to create a lusus. At first, they want to make a mix of Spidermom and Gl'bgolyyb, but the gods nix that idea.Vriska suggest they create a hybrid Troll-Human child, biologically theirs, but DT is against it. DT eventually relents, and thankfully we switch to FA while Vriska and John get... \"genetic material\". While OR, FE, and PI talk battle plans, IS arrives and greets FA. He has a new puppet, L'il Bill, to replace L'il Cal 3.0 (which DM made him, but had been broken during the prologue's shenanigans). The L.E.Y sneaks out of the city, using a secret escape route made by Kanaya. It is opened by OR doing a Kanaya impression and telling FA she loves her. This depresses her, and IS asks if she is ok, but is forced to leave her alone. The group keeps moving, with a smug OR at the forefront, and IS asking PI about why she is there. The group is then attacked by one of the Subjuggulators, creepingFate, who hurts OR badly using her psychic powers. They begin to fight back, and knock out CF, but more of the Horde appear. They continue to fight, but after awhile, things start to seem hopeless. Meanwhile, AP is still unconcious. He has a weird dream where Ace Dick leads him through a door, then he accidently kills past-fake-dream-John from right after they won Sburb/Sgrub. However, CF appears, and gets mad at him for not going with the L.E.Y. She then kisses him. He freaks out, but she eventually stops. He looks up, and sees a thousand eyes in the sky. Then he wakes up. Back with FA, the battle is going badly. OR and IS are down, and FA is being choked to death. She sends up a signal flare, but PI and FE go down soon as well. Having no other choice, FA uses her vision eightfold she inherited from Vriska, and mind controls the clown into killing its comrades. FA climbs her echeladder, but doesn't really care. The LEY realizes CF is gone, and FA asks if the others can carry OR back by themselves. When PI asks why, she says she's not going home. IS tries to stop her from leaving, but FA puts him to sleep. A short while later, IS wakes up. FA is gone, and an angry Kanaya arrives. She asks where FA is. FE and PI try to calm OR down, as she is both sad and pissed. The L.E.Y explain the events of the night, and Kanaya tells them to take OR home, while she looks for FA. FA meanwhile, just wants to die. She plans to just wander around until she does. She does however, tell Tesla they can't hang out the next day. Or ever. When he asks what he did, she says it's her fault, then asks him to tell LE that her overdue book isn't important anymore, and that he should forget about her. TM asks her to reconsider, and he trys to help, but she blocks him. She falls one her knees, and is waiting for death when Kanaya arrives. She consoles her daughter, who breaks down. familyFun, a subjuggulator and mime, drags CF back to camp and into Gamzee's tent, with the intent to explain what happened. She ends up managing to get out of trouble, by murdering the nearest lowbloods for his amusment. Kanaya brings FA back to her hive, then puts her back into her old recuperoon. Back with CT, DT, John, and Vriska, they prepare to spawn the baby, deciding on a girl named \"Emerald Nitram Nickita Cavros Spinneret Casey Serket-Egbert\". No, really. She is born as a grub, and Vriska gets terribly excited to have a child. We then cut to DM, conversing with Diamonds Droog of all people, and then the act ends.Intermission 1: How Do I Live?  The intermission starts at an uknown time in the future, long enough so that Emerald is an adult. She has apparently been gone for years, but she returns to the Court of Skaia. Inside, Vriska and John are conversing, but they soon notice their daughter. Vriska runs towards her and hugs her, and for a moment, Emerald lets her. Then, to Vriska's shock and horror, Emerald stabs her through the midsection with a weapon known as the Godslayer. She apoligizes to her mother, and the blade begins to glow, showing that it has taken away her godly powers. John is initally heartbroken and terrified, but soons become angry. He brings out the Warhammer of Zillyhoo, and gets ready to fight his daughter. He briefly hesitates, however, and this costs him his life, as Emerald likewise cuts him down as well, stealing his wind powers in addition to the luck powers Emerald had previously stolen. Vriska, however, turns out not to be dead, and by a few minutes later she has absconded. Emerald runs into a clone of Jack Noir, who also came to kill her parents. They seem to know each other. They declare a truce. They are soon accosted by someone on a flying motorcycle, who turns out to be CT and DT. DT attempts to shoot Emerald with Ahab's Crosshairs, but she blocks the beam with the Godslayer. CT uses a portal to teleport to to just infront of Emerald, and he kicks her in the face. The duo soon gets back up in the form of TM and FE riding in on flying hoverboards, The two also assault Emerald, but they don't seem to really do much damage. FA, despite TM asking her to stay in the library, apparently due to some sort of redrom realationship they have in this timeline, rushes over and hits Emerald in the name of Vriska. She looks over at TM, who apparently also calls her Kitty at this point in time, and according to FE, lives with her. Emerald gets up, then continues clashing with FA, while Jack looks on. TM asks FA if he should help, but FA waves him away, apparently wanting to deal with this herself. FE asks if he should step in, but OR beats him to it.She fires at Em, giving time for the arrving DJ and IS to get FA away. Dave then arrives, along with EA right after. As well as LE, The knights... the entire city, really. Em then uses her newfound powers over light and wind and all that to sneak away with Jack. Apparently to a safehouse elsewhere in the city. Back in the Basement of the court, Vriska enters a FORBIDDEN ROOM. Inside, she uses a large machine simillar to the ones the exiles had to contact the humans in Homestuck. She watches the lives of herself and John side by side, then sets the date back to the the night before ACT 1. She sends Aradia a message asking her to haunt Herself [Vriska], and then the intermission ends.Act 2: High Noon At Old Carapace Town  The start of ACT 2 pops us right into the shoes of the MAYOR of CARAPACE TOWN, apparently a clone of WV. He's standing around in his office, when he decides to start work for the day. He puts on his MAYORAL SASH and TOP HAT, then leaves the office. He heads into the next room, his secretaries office, to get some OFFICAL DOCUMENTS. He takes the papers from his apparently busy SECRETARY, the LOVELY MISS SNOWMAN. He attemps to HIT ON HER, however that just makes her glare at him. WV attempts a victory dance, because he is the dapperest mofo around. However, this seems to make Snowman even more annoyed, so he stops. She decides to try being polite, but this just causes WV to ask her out. She declines, and asks if he needs something else. He decides on a whim to change his title to MAYORAL BUNION, which surprises Snowman. The newly dubbed MB procedes back to his office, where he briefly thinks back fondly to right after he was cloned, and he saw John. Apparently, he worships him as a god. Literally. Prophets speak of the return of John, Vriska and Aradia, and MB dearly hopes it is true. This exposition is interrupted when PM enters, with a package for MB. MB begins to blabber like an idiot, apparently having a crush on PM, but she's too tired to mind. MB thanks her, and expresses concern about how stressed she is, but she just dismisses it as work related. MB takes this chance to hit on her, but she doesn't seem to care. She then takes her leave, as MB tears into the package. The package is apparently down from the guys down at the Casino, who want MB to introduce them to John. Probably to stab him. Inside, there is a very PIMP CANE, which MB immediately takes a liking to. He begins to strut around the room with it. He takes it to the other room, where PM and Snowman are, and begins to act like a pimp. This causes the ladies to faceplam. MB continues to strut, and Snowman finds herself oddly attracted to it. This fills her with shame. She also realizes that since the cane is from the midnight crew, it's likely a BOMB, OR SOME SHIT. This causes her to throw it out the window, but it turns out to just be a normal cane. This makes the Mayor SAD. PM takes her leave to continue working, and MB gets an idea. He tells Snowman the perfect apology would be to go on that date with him, and she reluctantly agrees. She leaves as MB begins to dance again. He soon gets back to work, and looks over his list for the day. Apparently, his last job for the day surprises him. We then get a sudden perspective switch back to FA, to no ones surprise. She awakens in her old room in Kanaya's mansion. It looks exactly the same as when he moved out, to her embarassment. It's got a major spider/bat/cat theme, and so does the dress Kanaya left for her to change into. She quickly changes outfits and puts on her glasses, which she usually doesn't wear since Vriska does. She has a ton of messages from her friends, and she begins to check/reply to them. She starts with Kanaya, who left a message simillar to the ones John's dad gave him. \" I'm so proud yada-yada-yada\". Anyway, Kanaya is apparently no longer at her computer, as she doesn't respond. She then moves on to TM, figuring she owes him that much canceling ... whatever it was. She informs him she's not dead, and he expresses relief. FA apologizes for canceling, but TM says it's fine. Kanaya told him that he should ask her again when she woke up, and FA goes silent for a moment. She's very embarassed and mad, and begins to complain to TM. TM apologizes, not having to upset her, She tells him it's not his fault, and just says she doesn't want Kanaya to make her decisions for her. Tesla is somewhat relieved by that, but assume's that this means that they won't be hanging out that night. FA tells him she's got nothing else to do, so they might as well. TM is happy to hear that, and he and FA agree to talk about it later. They end the conversation, because FA has about a million other messages. She then moves on to a message from Karkat, who tells her that since Kanaya strong-armed him into it, she gets a name early. However, she's not allowed to tell anyone her name, for fear that it will cause a riot.After some debate, she decides on Bastet Maryam Sekhmet, even though it sounds like Serket. Once she finishes the naming ritual, she proceeds to reply to OR. She learns that apparently OR is in the hospital, on painkillers and with only AP for company.OR asks Bastet to stop by, and she says she will, possibly with TM. She asks if OR knows him, and she reply with a no, asking if Tesla is her boyfriend. When FA says no, OR asks if he's her \"Rival\", with a sad face. She says no again, and then leaves to continue dealing with all the messages. Perspective switches yet again to John, who is lying in bed. Vriska is sleeping next to him, holding him in a tight grip, and Emerald is sleeping soundly on his chest.Characters  Adultstuck's cast is large and varied, made up of trolls, humans, carapaced individuals and a variety of new races.

Ironically, color-centric adventures often make limited use of color.Examples MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Housetrapped  Housetrapped is an MSPAFA created by Armada. It is a tribute to Homestuck and is a branch of the fan game of the same name. Housetrapped was created on February 16, 2010. The adventure uses the same art style as Homestuck. It will also include Flash updates like the original. Some of the plot points of the adventure will also be used within the game.Characters Peter Salt  A boy of thirteen years of age. His birthday is on April 10, 2009. His interests include robots (specifically battle bots), programming, greek myths, drawing, and playing games. He plays the synthesizer, which was enclosed in a gift in his room. He seems to have a strong dislike for his Father's tastes; comic books. His Pesterchum chumhandle is haywireNanobot. Peter uses Orange as the color for his text. He has a very clean typing style and appears to detest ignoring grammar rules on the Internet. His chums include outspokenComposer, naturalOutsider, certifiedHaxxor, ghostlyTrickseter (John Egbert), and carcinoGeneticist (Karkat Vantas). Peter knew John from his childhood and Peter has said that he met Karkat on the Game Bro forum, where he was a troll, though Peter did not have a problem with this, as he is \"Immune to trolling\". His fetch modus is the Simon modus, which his Father got for him instead of the Queue. Peter has allocated his strife specibus with the wrenchKind abstrata. He will wield wrenches as his primary weapon. He has broken open the Cruxtruder, when he receives his kernelsprite. He tries to get oC's help with what to do with the kernelsprite, but before she can really help him, she loses her connection. Soon after she disconnects, he prototypes the kernelsprite with a figurine of Problem Sleuth. Later on, Pepper reconnects and attempts to tier 2 prototype with a magpie, one of the several that came with Peter into the Medium. She herds the bird with the Grandfather Clock (which is made from the remains of Peter's grandfather), but loses the connection again. Grandpasprite later reveals himself to Peter, confirming that after the connection was lost. Pepper accidentally dropped the clock into the Sleuthsprite. Grandpasprite uses his time powers to age an imp to death and proceeds to explain the game to Peter.Pepper Ives  One of Peter's chums. She likes composing and playing music, playing fighting games, and not being a dainty lady. She despises her Sis, who constantly engages in psychological warfare with her, and often leaves profane Heartfelt Messages for her sis. Her chumhandle is outspokenComposer, and she uses red text. She types in the manner of John- without capitalization. Her fetch modus is the Chain Link modus. Her Specibus is allocated with guitarKind. She has sent a gift to Peter, which was a pair of welding goggles.naturalOutsider  Some other dumb girl, seems to have a crush on Peter's other chum, cH, or certifiedHaxxor (Michael). Her dreamself was unrevealed when Michael attempted to look at her and she was silhouetted in front of Skaia.Michael Kang  Other friend of Peter's, lives in a dream-tower-house near a frog temple, though the area appears to be surrounded by forest rather than an island. His chumhandle is certifiedHaxxor. By process of elimination, he is the Mage of Space.Trivia Tropes Used MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Gorblesnatch von Humperdink  Thanks to Hello, Insert Name Here, characters in new adventures and new characters in adventures are frequently initially nameless; inevitably, this leads to a proliferation of terrible names, from Dung Fhart to Blast Hardcheese (a reference to an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000) to the eponymous Gorblesnatch von Humperdink. This trope refers not to names that are merely bad or unused, but to names created explicitly for sounding stupid, funny, or otherwise unusable. It was named for some jerk's repeated use of that name as a suggestion for a number of adventures early in the forum's history.Examples  Prof.\u00a0Pumpernickel.\u00a0 \"You make a mental note to bang your head against a wall repeatedly later for thinking up that ridiculous name.\" Almost all the characters cycle through various increasingly-silly names, especially STARMAN BOSSFISH. Doctor von Cheeselaser. Luminus Ratio. He forgets his surname. Ohemgee Lawsors While all of the characters are already named, Curly Brace is rarely called by her actual name. Dwayne was almost named Big Hadron Collider Hatty A. Fedor, \"His Grace His Excellency the Duke of Flat Grassy Area Sir Henry Q. Fnackledorp the Third, Esquire\", \"Duke Mister Empire Holder, King of the Third Legion, Lord of 12,000 Men, and Shogun to 52 Samurai, Lord Not Sure\", Howdoi Usethisthing Melissa Ferdinand (What are you, a rock star?) was eschewed for the pleasantly impish X'Vlt. Actually used to the author's intention. Letters in \"Ranchodor Excrementking\" were removed annihilated to create the name \"Andre Cementi.\" \"Tinkle Hams\" is not a good name for an elf. Subverts trope by intentionally soliciting terrible names in order to mock the reader.

Unlike a typical command-based adventure, CWoT is primarily story-driven, though commands still influence the means by which the narrative is explored.Plot Synopsis META Gameplay  META is a mutually managed organized reality producing game (MMORPG) that the trolls have started playing. Upon installation, the player is transported to a realm of fantasy. All players are transported to the same session universe, but each player is placed in a different part of the world. There are several different character classes a player is assigned that cover the spectrum of typical RPG archetypes. New installations also add material types, and initialize part of the world. Players have access to a HUD (usually first accessed in a fit of rage or stupidity), which contains the ATLAS (a map), BANTER (a chat room with all current participants), COMPETENCE (special abilities), and DOSSIER (stats) tabs. After every player installs, four more tabs are added: EXCHANGE (presumably trading), FACTIONS (player-managed groups), GOALS (shows player progress), and HIERARCHY (ranks players based on various factors). On the dossier, there are four stats that can be raised with points earned at every level: PHYSIQUE (strength), ALACRITY (dexterity), WIZARDRY (magical power), and PIZZAZZ (charisma). There are also two other stats listed, KARMA and ESTEEM, which can be raised but not from points. Karma is raised by kind acts to other players, and is dropped by killing other players. Esteem is effectively karma with NPCs, and relates to how well known the player is among the populace. When a player joins, their dungeon is added to a metaphorical chain, linking the players together. Thusfar the only goal of META is to complete all of the dungeons, starting with your own, and then working down the line as players join. It has been confirmed that after all players join, the chain loops back around. VP's diary has alluded to \"keys\" and an \"egg\" that unleash a beast of immense power, presumably a final boss. Killing monsters is unique in META in that the way you kill a monster is more important than whether or not you were victorious. Depending on a character's class, being sneaky, accurate, flashy, or otherwise clever in your attacks nets a player huge EXP bonuses.Devas  In each player's home dungeon, there are two clones representing two halves of their conscience. The positive deva (gold) is responsible for decisions that affect other people, where the negative deva is concerned for the self. They can be destroyed only by the player they represent, and doing so removes that half of that player's moral views. Destroying one creates a very polarized character, and destroying both seems to cause insanity. Plato claims he was unaffected by destroying his devas, going on gut feeling rather than morals. After the dungeon is completed, the devas are released into the game world where they can be summoned at will as fighting partners, or whenever the player weighs the ethics of their decisions. They are not inherently loyal to the person they represent, as demonstrated by Lyanne's positive deva. It is possible that neglect to a moral spectrum weakens a deva or even kills them, as PAE refused to help a dying Lyanne \"[so she] knows how I feel\".Dream World  The dream world is a key part of META, and is normally accessed by falling asleep in the game world. It is divided into two halves, Philan and Mizan, relating to the positive and negative selves respectively. Connecting the two is a tunnel through the mountain in the center of both halves, capped by THE DOME. As players complete dungeons, the dome approaches completion. When finished, it turns into THE EGG, which can be hatched to summon the ARCHFIEND, the final boss of META. If defeated, players can return home. Players have a dream self in Philan and Mizan, and which one is active while sleeping can be swapped at will. A positive self can infiltrate Mizan, and vice versa, however due to a war that is going on between the two halves doing so would put the player at great risk. If a player destroys one of their devas, the corresponding dream self violently explodes. It is unknown what happens when a player falls asleep with no dream selves. When the archfiend is summoned, the king/queen of both Philan and Mizan are awakened to assist players. The king and queen can be slain by players, and doing so promotes that player to the new king/queen. Kings and queens are bound to the game until defeated. The archfiend also seems to take after the species of the king or queen. Between Philan and Mizan is the DREAMLESS NEVERAETHER, where the deer god seems to exist, and grants a single wish to winning teams. This is the final test of META, and determines whether or not the players' home planet deserves protection by a god. What qualifies as a winning wish is unknown, though prosperity for extinct species and removing META from existence are losing wishes.Trolls aegisMason  The first troll introduced in the adventure. Lorrex is a cyber security expert and his home is littered with traps and security cameras. The player attempted to nickname him Infinity, but Lorrex hated the idea. He used to cloak himself in a white security blanket that got lost sometime before entering META. This blanket later returned in the form of a white cape. After a series of ridiculous events he ended up unconscious on his front lawn, and when he woke up he presumably had a lot of messages to check. He joined META, and formed \"Tea mBette rTha nPlato' sTeam\" to combat the difficulty curve. He seems genuinely interested in helping Vera overcome her emotional instability, though in a rather calculated, logical way.migrantMorality  After Lorrex had a lapse in judgement, the player became Viridian. The player called her Missing and Rude when she dream walked away from sight. Viridian is a wanderer, who has complete control over the natural world. When talking to plants she connects to the great life network and can also be contacted via instant messaging. Viridian is a bit of a loner. She isn't particularly interested in teamwork and prefers to be self-sufficient. She was smitten by VP (after hearing about Seconian society), and became enraged when she realized that PM was involved in its destruction, furthering her hatred for Vera. Sometime in the future of META, Viridian will pacify the sea denizen STEELMOLAR, and use it as a personal boat.entertainingAmmo  Chad is the third playable troll in the adventure, and first one mentioned after Lorrex. He is a total badass with yoyos, as he knows all the tricks and invents new ones \"to keep ahead of the crowd\". He used to live in a giant warehouse of unknown size, and spent his days going on adventures finding new cool stuff. Chad organizes his findings based on how cool they are, on an arbitrary scale of \"coolians\". He seems to have reckless disregard for how little his friends actually care about the things he does. Despite his friends' advice, Chad stacked his naturally high pizzazz stat in META. Instead of brute-forcing combat, he uses his wits and coolness to get mad bonus EXP. He has also used his high PIZZAZZ stat to become incredibly wealthy, and famous among the NPCs. Convincing some to join his crew, he purchased a pirate ship, and has since been sailing the seas of META. He is also credited with coming up with the plan to save the trolls' doomed META session.mishapEngineer  Rick is an inventor who is greatly talented but bored often, so he designs things that will intentionally break. When he was first introduced, the player attempted to name him Rikako Asakura, a girl's name. Rick is the first character introduced to not refer to his friends as jackasses, and actually seems to like them. His right arm is an extendable cyborg hand. Rick, along with Moira, Lorrex, Lyanne, and prescriptionMiasma, played some form of Sgrub in the past. Because of this, he has a lot of experience with games and is doing pretty well for himself. While originally part of TBTPT, the team disowned him. He instead teamed up with Camille and Gabe, forming \"294\".patienceEngine  Moira was the fifth playable troll. She has the ability to stretch her perception of time indefinitely, which arose after an accident involving an attempt to fly. This is probably linked to the fact she idolizes WINGED ARBITERS and has a strong will to enforce justice on evil. Moira has a very overactive imagination and sometimes gets \"a bit carried away\". She chose gray as her typing color instead of her blood (presumably blue) because she is modest. In META, Moira is the defender class, which can alleviate other players' penalty on death by sacrificing a level. In return, she earns karma points and is granted angelic wings. Despite her leveling handicap, she is still the most powerful naturally-leveled player. Her role as a guardian of sorts seems to be getting to her, as she has begun setting out to enact justice as she sees fit, including (ironically) killing Camille for killing Plato. As of late, she appears to be seen as a pawn by VP, who is keeping her from sleeping (and exploring the dream world). Instead, the queen is pushing her to keep combating the defender of chaos, who isn't putting up much of a fight.ethicalProxy  Layla is of the conjurer class, and wields in fire and ice magic. Prior to META, she was an ace attorney who was constantly bailing Plato out of trouble. EP is slowly becoming more and more obsessed with gold, already adorned in a golden cape, jewelry, and a highlight in her hair. Whenever she says something, it happens, however Layla has yet to accept that there is some magnificent power at work, rather praising her remarkable intellect. EE, however, is aware of this ability, and tricks her into utilizing it.She really is pretty smart, having advised Chad through the early stages of the game. Layla and Plato are collectively referred to as \"the twins\", because they share the same horns and a very similar symbol. They are not directly related, though. As of late, her relationship with Plato has been becoming increasingly strained.equitableMasochist  Plato is a well-dressed, cold-hearted heartless criminal with some really good connections (namely Layla, his moirail). He's been responsible for a lot of under-the-table shenanigans and doesn't seem to blink at the idea of murder. EM desires a leadership role, which he may have attained to some degree already, as the other players followed his lead early in game. Later, when he formed the \"Winning T=eam\", only Layla and Chad joined. Soon after entering his dungeon, he encountered and killed both of his devas because they were annoying him. He was supposedly unchanged, because he never makes moral decisions, though Cerana believes he has recently become \"more of a jerk\".aphoticPuppeteer  Camille is a gamer at heart and competitive to a fault. After an arson incident in her past, AP developed powers of invisibility (and an uncontrollable temper), making her a very frightening assassin. She has a very strong vendetta against Plato, after PM told her that he was responsible for an arson incident in the past. She is capable of change, though, as towards the end of her arc she contemplated forgiving Plato for the past (if he was even responsible to begin with). EE originally alluded to her eventually teaming up with Plato and friends, but she instead is working with Rick and Gabe.automaticEnd  A skilled hacker who has, among other things, completely broken her installation META to give her max stats, materials and gold. Because she is such a high level by comparison to the other players, everything has been made incredibly difficult for everything else because of META's level balancing mechanic. She joined META out of boredom near the end of the chain, even though she was one of the first to get the client. Despite this, she has already become bored of the game, and is completing dungeons as fast as possible. Her right eye is cybernetic, and seems to be capable of scanning in-game objects, as well as projecting a laser screen. AE has given an air of being very manipulative in the interest of entertainment, and seems like she would be good friends with PM. She is easily bored, even when getting involved in important, end-game aspects of META, and falls asleep from lack of interest. Through a group effort, the other trolls were able to delevel her from 255 to 2.prolixAntiphon  PA knows very little about META, despite being one of the first to start playing. She prefers casual games, and gets more of a thrill out of the social experience of META than the competition or goals. For a while she was traveling with AA, but somewhere along the line she fell asleep and they have since parted ways. Cerana has spent most of the game trying to locate her dungeon, to no success. Recently, she began doing quests instead of hunting monsters. She is also half fish now. Neat. She is in possession of some golden bracelets that keep appearing and disappearing. They seem to be of significance.aimlessAlchemist  Felis was the first to join the trolls' META session, and is often called in to explain game mechanics. It is heavily implied that AA has a strong understanding of the material types, as alchemy in some form is a hobby of hers. Supposedly she also loves cooking, but is bad at it. At some point while assisting Cerana in finding her dungeon, she was knocked out, and ended up back in her homeland of Tuor-Rok. There, she accidentally crafted a god-tier bow by forging a glitchy material. It was affectionately named \"Sasha\".muteAspersion  Gabe, as he prefers to be called, is the epitome of introvertism. He keeps to himself and doesn't talk much, to avoid forming close relationships. This is partially due to his \"death touch\", which he is shown wearing gloves to contain. It was with this death touch he was able to spawncamp Lyanne down to a reasonable level, returning a semblance of order back to the troll's META session. Ironically enough, he is into shipping, and keeps many lists and writes poetry. Among the lists, his \"hit list\", keeps track of who wants who dead. Gabe is unable to see color, making him only able to see shades of gray.mindProspector  Milo is a hipster who constantly attempts to be cool like his rival, Chad, but fails due to a lack of self-confidence. Despite advancing quite well in the early parts of the game, he had never cast a spell, and soon after realizing he is the worst wizard ever, had a mental breakdown. His emotional instability is probably a side effect of his random cloning ability, which creates copies of himself in every way except the knowledge of if they are the original. When these copies are killed, their memories are merged with the original's, leaving Milo very temporally displaced (having experienced some points in time many times over). In the future, he becomes a very powerful time-traveling wizard, and attempts to save the trolls' session from ending in total ruins.prescriptionMiasma  PM's plot relevance is quickly approaching singularity. She is the server player of the troll's META session, responsible for distributing the client, or everyone will die. In game, she is referred to as \"the goddess\", which will no doubt create shenanigans now that she is playing. PM also seems to have invented wireless communication technology, which was directly responsible for introducing the idea of violence to the peaceful utopian planet of Seconia. Some time in the past, the trolls also played some version of sgrub, and PM was partially responsible for nearly getting everyone killed. For the most part, the other trolls bear animosity towards PM. Whether it is the result of previous events or her rude, sarcastic demeanor (or some combination of both) is an unknown quantity.percolatedPlasma  Graves is an easily enraged cannibal who enjoys the taste of blood. He has a beast-like sense of smell, and can taste emotions and subtle flavors in troll blood. He is very interested in murdering Chad for years of endless babbling about his daily discoveries. Since his fingers have long, sharp claws, he typically types with his knuckles, and when angered resorts to punching his keyboard. During a pesterlog with Chad, he completely destroyed his keyboard in rage. He is represented by the alchemical symbol for Potassium, which is a notably reactive element. PP seems to trust Gabe. When MA finished spawncamping Lyanne, he cut her to draw PP in with the scent of blood to quell Grave's hunger. Presumably several other undocumented kills or actions have netted him negative KARMA, which inverse to Moira, gave him demonic wings. Since he killed his positive deva early on, he is only able to dream in Mizan. Much to PV's grief, PP absolutely hates Mizan. Because of the bitter Defender vs. Defender idea VP gave to Moira, PP was often killed due to Moira's \"rightous\" actions. He later forgives her after the time rewind, donning angel wings when he saved her from death.enigmaEducator  Noel is a sea-dwelling troll who is in close contact with prescriptionMiasma. The two installed very close together, and immediately formed a separate group (Team\u00a0?ovre!gn). EE said he would still inform the other players of their dungeon locations, but otherwise they would work alone. Later in META, he affiliated himself with the snake spirits, changing his syntax to include extra \"?\"s. EE has the ability to hear the thoughts of those he is near, making him seem omniscient. Noel uses his information advantage to manipulate others, though he usually has good intentions.Ithicans  Ithicans come from the planet Seconia. They are a plant-animal hybrid species that played META before the trolls. Though originally peaceful, affectionate and kind, the events that have transpired since the introduction of the game have changed their fragile psyche radically. With the exception of the 8 ithicans that played META, their species is now extinct. *: Translated from runic textvirulentPanacea  VirulentPanacea, earlier known as\u00a0??, is the very powerful Queen of Philan, at level \"255+\" and infinite stats. Her class is listed as +Asc.Defender. VP was first seen convincing Chad to join META, which chronologically happened after talking to Rick about joining. VP seems to be motivated to get other people to play META, and once there, maintain order in Philan. After a series of complex events, VP killed her negative deva, attained level 100, and rose to power as the Queen of Philan. At the end of VP's session, she decided to stay in META instead of going home, and has presumably resided there since. In the intermission, Virulent is a purist- an ithic that refuses to use metal, though she is shown to be curious about its origins.permanentVenom  Permanent was the other of the two players who stayed in META after its conclusion. He is as negative as VP is positive, rude and callous to those he talks to. In his session, PV is described by VP as an enemy, despite the two being friendly towards each other while on Seconia. At the beginning of the intermission, Permanent is shown having the polite, grammatically correct structure every other ithic talks with. It is unknown at this time what caused this dramatic shift, thought it is hinted that his conversation with automaticEnd was one of the factors.virtuisticVivacity  VV is a close friend of VP, referred to as a \"historian\". He is a sea-dweller, and was contacted by engimaEducator before META, warning him of imminent destruction. At the end of META wielding a flaming bow. We don't even know his last name.pliablePaeans  One of VP's friends. Canonically, it is up to her to restore life to Seconia after META destroyed the planet.astralObligation  Astral was the ithican that formally introduced Virulent to metal. He was also chosen as VP's mate, to Permanent's dismay.magnificentArcus  Magnificent was first shown traveling with Astral. She is very untrusting of purists.\"Transcendent\"  Transcendent says very little. He is first shown traveling with Astral.\"Unified\"  Never been shown, only referred two twice. Unified is implied to be a metallith (in contact with AO's group), but with some myofiber limbs. (The ithicans' session had two full metalliths at its beginning, Permanent and presumably Astral). Assuming he is the \"friend\" Astral talked about in his story of the history of metal, he invented metal bonding. According to CT, his blood color is a dark emerald color.Trivia Tropes MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Homestesque  HOMESTESQUE is an MSPFA based rather lightly on (and partly named after) Andrew Hussie's Homestuck. This adventure started some time in September, 2010. The adventure in and of itself borrows mechanics from Homestuck, such as the use of a Sylladex in the stead of a standard inventory system, and the use of a Strife Deck to be used in the event of conflict. It also has mechanics unique to Homestesque, including Character Sheets and the enigmatic Exploit Ivory. This adventure features several flash updates and original music by EmuLegs. Adventure Forum Thread with suggestions, commentary, and art by the fans, as well as additional comments by PaperHelmet Mirror\u00a0:A refined archive of the adventure, without all the shenanigans in between.Plot  *(WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! AND NOT THE GOOD KIND!)* The story begins with two playable characters, Neil Garnette and Tyler Steel. They are getting ready to enter the house of their friend who has invited them over for some rousing online gaming. Right from the get-go, they begin to partake in shenanigans that border on the hilarious, including switching each other's hats and pretending that Neil is The Joker. They attempt to ascend the stairs of the house, only to find that their friend's father has left a large Bronzed Carnivore on the staircase, barring their passage. They immediately get to finding a solution to this problem. Of particular note is Neil's decision to sprout wings and fly, which the Exploit Ivory (an intangible game entity resembling a many-sided die) responded to by lowering Neil's (intellect) by a single point. Eventually, Neil uses his vast knowledge of pretty much fucking everything to arrive at the simple answer; he tells Tyler to simply captchalogue the Bronzed Carnivore, thus freeing up the stairs. After a brief confrontation with their friend's father (who, despite being thankful that his Bronzed Carnivore was found, takes a verbal stab at both Neil and Tyler's sexuality), the two boys climb the stairs to meet an inattentive Andre Cementi, who is patiently waiting in his room. After allocating a cluster of dice to his new strife card, stocking up on gaming guidebooks and playing a rather awkward keyboard refrain, Neil and Tyler show up and shit gets real. It is then revealed that there is still one more friend to wait for before the games can begin. The trio spend a little time dicking around. Andre manages to find his third gaming guidebook high atop his bookshelf and out of reach. This is easily remedied by captchaloguing it from afar with his Pictionary Fetch Modus. This is when the fourth friend is introduced in a rather suspenseful manner. She is Sarah Rennings, a local girl who has been friends with the three boys for ages. Interestingly, none of the boys have any romantic feelings for Sarah whatsoever. The kids discuss their schedual for the rest of the night, centered around playing a new game called SQUEST. They then disperse the game's beta CDs for installation. While this is happening, they come across a very messy peice of paper that seems to be \"instructions\" to the game. Unable to make heads or tails of the grubby scrawlings, they install SQUEST and prepare to play. However, the game doesn't seem to be anywhere close to what they thought it would be...Main Party Neil Garnette  Neil Garnette is the first character to be named and the first character to be properly introduced. He is the 13 year-old manager of a pizza place somewhere, and he has the power to give himself days off. He has a black hat, a ponytail and a band across one eye due to a paintball mishap. His interests are rather refined, as he seems to enjoy social politics and the thrill of debate. He can play the bass guitar and drums, and has a penchant for computers and computer programming. He also seems to have a vast knowledge of \"pretty much fucking everything\" for a universally unknown reason. He presumably runs an internet browser called Nightshade. On Pesterchum his text is purple, he is known as genialCalamity. Early in the story, Neil has been shown to be generally smarter than the rest of the cast, with an accelerated thinking process and the ability to contemplate complicated subjects in a matter of seconds, to an extent where, theoretically, he can repair any intelligence damage he may have suffered from actions such as rolling for the ability to grow wings and fly (which he may have always dreamed of doing). He has also been shown to have a firm grip on reality, which is tested when Neil and Tyler are sucked into SQUEST. Neil's chosen strife specibus is hatkind, and he has a Chastity Modus.Tyler Steel  Tyler Steel was shown at the same time Neil was, but was only properly introduced a couple of updates later. He wears prohibition-era style clothing, which includes his pork-pie hat, a vest, and suspenders. His interests include music, making music, listening to music and music in general as shown by his Music Lock Modus. It is somewhat unclear what kind of music he prefers, though it has been suggested he does not have a particular favorite genre, and just likes music in general. He is a HUGE fan of Batman, and apparently believes that he, in fact, is Batman. He is quite proficient at playing the bass guitar and using it as a weapon, as evidenced by his strife specibus being set to basskind, and is fascinated by Lovecraftian horrors, but has never read an H.P. Lovecraft novel. His text is a simple black and his online handle is baritonalApathy.Andre Cementi  Quite apparently the author (PaperHelmet's) avatar. As such he seems to have some control over the story itself, changing his own given name of Ranchodour Excrementking by extracting some of the letters to his liking. He lives with both his Dad and Mom, as well as his pet dog. He is apparently fond of all kinds of games as evidenced by his dicekind strife deck in his strife portfolio. He seems to particularly enjoy tabletop RPGs as well as video and online games. He sometimes pulls all-nighters on these games, which require a good amount of junk food from the pantry to quell the dreaded munchies. (He apparently has a preference for Mountain Dew and Cheese balls.) He also enjoys creating art as further evidenced by his Pictionary Modus and pencilkind strife deck, and he likes looking at intrepid fantasyscapes to immerse himself in a state of deep imagination. He is learning to play the keyboard on his old-ass Yamaha but feels that it is not going to well. Because of his interests, his room is somewhat messy, with sketches and artwork of chicks weilding rakes, as well as rulebooks and drafts from his RPGs littered about. Because of this and an alleged combination of ditzfuckery and forgetitude, he sometimes loses things like his dungeon master's guide for several weeks, though they are sometimes clearly in sight, like right on top of his bookshelf, and as such must be yelled at profusely and reminded of how much worry they had caused him by getting lost. It has been stated that sometimes he has bursts of creativity which tend to get him into trouble. He was the one to set up the all night SQUEST gaming session with his friends Neil, Tyler, and Sarah, and as such is serving the role of administrator to the other players, a role well suited to his Dungeon Master abilities. His computer, like his room contains large amounts of disorganized artwork in the form of image files. He runs the internet browser \"Hellcat\" which Neil disregards as unprofessional and uses pesterchum to keep in contact with his friends. His chumhandle is catharsisArtisan and he types in blue text.Sarah Rennings  Sarah apparently has been friends with Andre, Niel, and Tyler for quite a while. She is described as being \"smart, funny, and a good hearted person.\" She rides a motorcycle and apparently knows fifty kinds of martial arts, however this may or may not be an exaggeration. She also has lots of strange connections, perhaps a result of her wealthy and powerful parents, who have provided her with a big house which she will presumably inherit along with a gigantic fortune. It has been suggested by fans that she is somewhat of a Mary-Sue. However, unlike a Mary-Sue, and because she is such a great friend with so many good qualities, none of her male companions have any romantic feelings for her whatsoever. Nope, none whatsoever. Definitely not a Mary-Sue. Upon beginning her session of SQUEST with her friends, she was selected at random to be the damsel and disappointed feminists everywhere made feminists everywhere proud by proceeding to kick ass. We are all completely blown away by this stunning revelation. Her chumhandle is radicalAngel, she types in orange text, and according to her character sheet, her strife specibus is clockKind which allows her to manipulate time to some extent, and she has a Stopwatch Modus which seems to force the user to indicate a specific time which the item can be retrieved.\"Girl Session\" Kristina Alyssa Regina Athena Gooseberry IV  Or Kristina for short, apparently lives in the mangrove jungle on the other side of the world from Neil, Tyler, Andre and Sarah. Her interests include archaeology and old objects of all kinds, and often does archaeological digs in the unfinished corner of her room. She lives off the fat of the land, and has made everything she owns with her own two hands, besides her PDA. It has also been mentioned that she has a pot addiction: an addiction to excavating for ancient pottery of course! What did you think it was silly? She also introduced her affinity for pot to her friends, Sammy, Maya, and Suou with whom she is playing SQUEST with. Upon the start of the game she was selected at random to act as the session's damsel. Her strife specibus is set to lighterkind, though it appears she does not own any kind of Fetch Modi and instead logically carries her belongings on top of her head. Her text is a light green and her online handle is destinyRose.Sammy Copper  Sammy is an avid surfer and beach comber. She enjoys finding and appraising pretty seashells and seaside gems, and hopes to someday be a marine geologist. She has also been described as having an attractive body, and has a prominent interest in boys of the cute variety, though she apparently talks so much about them that it sometimes annoys others, and also seems to have a wide definition on what constitutes a boy as she sometimes indulges in flirting with inanimate objects. This may just be her method of joking around, though she did leave the tree her number... She likes to excavate ancient pottery with her friends Kristina, Maya, and Suou, and has recently decided on playing SQUEST with them. She may not have the nerve that her friends do, because when it turns out SQUEST is more than an average game, of the four of them, she was the one to panic and try to run. Her strife specibus is set to surfboardkind. Her chumhandle is surfingSifter and she writes in red text and always ends her sentences with a question mark? Even if it's not an actual question? <Requires more info, i.e. Fetch modus, typing quirk, etc.>Maya Capulet  Maya's actual name is Kapuretto Maia (in following with the Eastern practice of placing the surname before the individual's actual name), but she has reversed the order and changed the pronunciation and spelling of her name to fit it into a more Western standard, deliberately to spite her nationality. Because of her displeasure with her sister's interests, the spited nationality in question is almost certainly Japanese. She also strongly dislikes Eastern cartoons and comics because she finds them to be stupid, a waste of time, and associates them with her Oriental origins, of which she wishes to disassociate herself with as much as possible. She instead takes interest in cartography, and has proven to be quite the skilled mapmaker for her age. As such, she has superb navigation skills, and with the assistance of her trusty compass, almost never gets lost. This particular interest is reflected in her online handle waywardPathfinder, her choice of brown text when typing, and her Strife Portfolio which contains a markerkind as well as an inkpenkind strife deck, though her preference seems to be to use the markerkind more often because bringing the contents of the inkpenkind deck into the open allegedly dries the ink out. It is noted that her stature is shorter than that of her friends, though it is unclear if she is the same age as them, or perhaps a bit younger, seeing as her sister seems to be of similar height to the others. Recently she has decided on playing SQUEST with her friends Kristina and Sammy, as well as her older sister Suou. ShE capitalizES thE lEttErS that Stand for thE four cardiNal dirEctionS. ShE iS alSo proNE to uSiNg puNS iNvolviNg dirEctioNS <Requires more information, i.e. Fetch Modus, Typing Quirk, Etc.>Capuretto Suou  Unlike her younger sister Maya, Suou has kept her name's original pronunciation and translated spelling, and seems to prefer putting her surname first when referring to it, as is consistent Eastern cultural practice. Adding to her sister's dismay, she loves Eastern animation and comics, and allegedly spends thousands of dollars on related merchandise, including the less sequitur aspects of the medium, including erotic visual novels and figurines with detachable private parts. Although her sister regards most of her interests as being stereotypical or inherent to their culture, and wishes nothing to do with them, Suou claims that she does not like them for that reason, liking them simply for being of interest to her. Though this could mean that she does not associate her interests with her heritage, her chumhandle justifiedJapanophile suggests otherwise. The supposed thousands spent on merchandise, when coupled with her love and ownership of multiple computers, including what is referred to as the \"best computer\", makes it somewhat safe to assume that the Capuretto family is rather wealthy. Though she does own a computer that can hack the Chinese government as well as the knowledge and skill to do so, so that doesn't rule out the suggestion that she could hack as a profession, or hack other structures of commerce... She also enjoys playing Massively Multiplayer Online games, while eating copious amounts of junk food, including stale instant noodles, in her allegedly trash filled room. Although she is referred to as shady and introverted, (as reflected by her interests,) Kristina finds her eerily charming, and thinks she is the most fashionable in their group of friends including Sammy and Maya (though Kristina is not known for having the best grasp on the world, much less fashion). Because of her computer skills she is chosen by the group to be the administrator for their SQUEST session. She types in violet colored text with elipses that stand for pauses... sort of like... this...The Landstar Order  Neil and Tyler encounter this party in the entry hall of the Cave of Baby Steps.Dash Karestes  The apparent leader of The Landstar Order, Dash is a rather laid-back skater with a backwards baseball cap and cool shades. While not seeming like your typical MMO know-it-all, Dash is quite game savvy, demonstrating a good understanding of in-game culture and conduct. Not much has been shown regarding his interests and personality, but one thing is for sure. He is downright cool. He types in red font, Capitilizing beginninG And endinG Letters to makE His sentanceS Look like A Series oF Half-pipeS. His chumhandle is fiftyfiftyGrind. His name is an anagram for \"skater shades\".Dyna Barc  One of the female members of the Landstar Order, as well as its second-in-command. She has been described as \"energetic\", which may be construed from her choice in garb. She wears mismatched pink and purple Croc sandals, along with (mis?)matching hair accessories and shirt designs. It is also stated that she smells somewhat like candy, which could give some insight into her interests, as well as explain her typing quirk. Regarding her typing quirk, she uses a light pink colour and fills her text with l}O{lli--O}O{--Os (lollipops) and caramels. Her chumhandle is sweetenedDealer. Her name is an anagram for \"candy bar\".Leean Spyps  The other female member of the Landstar Order and its designated \"utility caster\" (a good indicator of what kind of class she has chosen). At first glance, Leean is a very simple girl with rather slow reaction time. This is either due to her being sleepy (explaining her typing quirk and her still being in her pajamas) or just being innatentive. However, she seems to have a wilder, more enthusiastic side. She speaks in sleepy blue text and replaZzzeZzz her S's with ZzznoreZzz. Her chumhandle is quietSlumber. Her name is an anagram for \"sleepy naps\".Huck (Phineas Irving) Sterfing  Dash's cousin and resident hipster of the Landstar Order, Huck comes off as a bit of a pretentious douche. This may be a direct side-effect of being a pretentious douche. He enjoys music produced by absurdly obscure bands that may or may not actually exist and seems to insult those who don't agree with his preferances. He also has two middle names that he probably wasn't even born with. Huck also wears a beanie that is loaded with pins, an argyle shirt, a scarf, and army medals. Huck is pretty much a complete asshole. He speaks in beige text and, adds a lot, of unnecissary commas, to his, sentances. His chumhandle is doubtfulObscurity. His name (with the middle names as initials) is an anagram for... you guessed it... \"fucking hipster\".Misc. The Mistress  The perceived ruler of the Land Of Volatile Energy, a yet unnamed character only referred to so far as \"mistress\". She apparently takes charge of locating and imprisoning the Damsels within her dominion of rule. She rules over a number of citizens, but their sentiments on her rule remain unclear, with the exception of her entourage, which seem ready to abide to her will and do battle for her. Of her rather large entourage however, she seems to be the most competent fighter. The mistress types/speaks in light pink and her quick is tripling R's. When Sarah meets the Resistance, it is revealed the Mistress used to be a Damsel. <Requires more information (believe it or not), i.e. Fetch Modus, etc.>Left Hand Man  A servant of the Mistress, who seems to hold a position of authority on other servants. He talks in grey and his quirk is always putting a full stop after other punctuation marks (except ellipses). His first name appears to be Roland and he was a member of the Mistress's party.Andre's Father (Dad)  Mr. Cementi, as described by Neil, has a tendency to be somewhat intimidating and ornery. It has been speculated largely by fans that one of his pastimes is questioning and taking shots at the sexuality of people and perhaps even objects or situations ever since he proceeded to do so to both Neil and Tyler upon their entry to his house. Whether this is a paticular trait of his, or if it is just a result of his broader ornerity, has yet to be seen however. He has an affinity for Bronzed Carnivores, which he collects and sometimes loses, resulting in blocked stairwells. He also has a number of shoes lined up at the entrance to his house. Aside from Andre, his family apparently consists of his wife (Andre's Mother), and a pet dog. <Requires Image>Squest -----------------------------------------------------------------  SQUEST, like a certain other game of which we are all a fan of, is an immersive Simulation game, though it seems that a lot of its players remain unaware of that fact until they find themselves playing it already. Unlike that other game that we are all a fan of however, SQUEST seems to function a bit more like a tabletop RPG, and as such is played on a network of computers, with one player acting as an admin (presumably akin to a dungeon master) and the others acting as the players. The standard team size seems to be four players to each session, as suggested by the discs provided for playing the game (four CDs, one for each participant, plus an admin CD to be used in supplement for the selected admin of the group), though this has yet to be confirmed.Admin  The admin seems to serve the role of an operator to the questants, somewhat like a dungeon master. Among their duties as such, he or she enables, or otherwise selects, the classes for the questants and presumably has some control over many of the other in-game functions as well, possibly like a server in that other game. It seems to be the case that the admin does not initially enter the game with the other players, and instead must be brought into it by the questants through activation of an object which appears to be an already detonated bomb. However, upon entering it, it would appear that their surroundings (like their house) are transported into the game with them in a rather violent manner, perhaps to act as a base of operations.Questant  Questants apparently function as the active hands to the stationary Admin, and act much like characters in an RPG. They each have a number of classes they can choose from. The classes are selected by the admin (though it would seem possible that the admin could allow them to select their own classes), and it is likely that the class chosen allows them to learn abilities unique to that class as they level up. The available classes are: Furious Renegade (Fighter), Pious Nomad (Paladin), Rove Runner (Ranger), Robbery Expert (Rogue), Shenanigous Ruffian (Sorcerer), Wonderous Draconic (Wizard), Brawling Neanderthal (Barbarian), Balladric Deviant (Bard), Cathedral Curate (Cleric), Dirtfoot Diviner (Druid), Martial Knuckleslinger (Monk), Psyche Neurotic (Psion), Graymetal Ranger (Gunslinger), King's Trooper (Knight), Culinary Firebrand (Chef), Creation Nucleus (Craftsman), Charming Romantic (Charmer), Species Releaser (Summoner), and Mite (which is perceived by the story to be utterly useless, and percieved by the readers to be potentially powerful). It is also possible to MultiClass, which is to invest the EXP gained in a level into another class aside from your primary, so as to gain some experience in a different class. However it is preferable to focus on a primary class as opposed to spending EXP on too many classes, which would cause the questant to miss out on their class's higher level skills. Leveling up seems to be achieved by gaining EXP (experience) from fighting (the likely target being monsters, though it would appear a small amount of EXP can be gained by fighting amongst eachother). Like in that other game, an Echeladder is employed to document the leveling process. When a Questant chooses his or her class, any clothes they are wearing at the time are transformed to benifit their new vocation and thus take on new shapes and colours. From what has been seen, Psyche Neurotics obtain a purple garb with various new odds and ends, Balladric Deviants aquire flashy green and yellow clothes with new trimmings, Culinary Firebrands gain orange and yellow scrubs with firey designs and a free chef hat, and Mites may aquire either dull Grey and Black clothes or stay relativley/exactly the same.Damsel  Upon starting the game, a damsel is apparently selected at random from the team. The oh so lucky contestant selected, disappears into the game first, entering before the other players, and it is presumably the other players' job to rescue said damsel in distress (as may be the ultimate goal of the game). From what few things can be gathered from the instructions of SQUEST accompanying the CDs (which are poorly drawn, crumpled up, and cheese smelling, thus often going misunderstood or ignored completely), the role is gender indiscriminate even if the title henceforth suggests otherwise. Admins, however, are exempt from the damsel selection process, despite how the damsel selection icon cycles through all the players including the admin. PaperHelmet himself has stated that this is merely to heighen dramatic tension. Upon entrance to the game, it has been suggested that they are found unconcious and taken to the Land of Volatile Energy, to be placed with the other Damsels. Though in one case, on Sarah's part, there was some resistance, even she was forced into submission by the Mistress.The Land of Volatile Energy  Or LOVE for short, seems to be a bleak shadowy kingdom. Apparently all Damsels are found and taken there to await rescue. It seems to have a number of humanoid citizens residing in it, ruled by the Mistress, though their standpoint under her rule remains unclear, she does seem to have an entourage of loyal cloaked fighters, ready to abide to her will.The Town Of Trade And Life  Despite its name, TOTAL is more of an extravagant city than a town. Sticking out like a sore thumb in the middle of the wasteland, it is surrounded by a guarded wall and houses many buildings, some of which tower far above the city. Many golden banners hang from the architecture, most of which seems to be styled in a gothic fashion. TOTAL seems to be occupied by quite a few different races, and is clearly a bilingual area, as shown by signs and billboards within the city. The city is also assumed to be very keen on its economy, and splits itself into several \"districts\", all dealing with a different kind of merchandise. Buildings that have been explored in TOTAL include a Smithery, a branch of the equipment supply chain Bloodbath and Beyond, and an Ore Exchange Office. Some notable residents include a gruff Blacksmith, a helpful Guard, a quaint Fruit Vendor, and an ex-Law Enforcer, who is currently in a relationship with the Fruit Vendor.The Four High Kingdoms  The world of SQUEST is inhabited by four dominant races known as the Four High Kingdoms, as told by TOTAL's Fruit Vendor: Norns: Roughly man-sized insectoids with a dark carapace, bright eyes, curved wings on their backs and club-like antennae. Females of this species have a reddish carapace and tiny dots under their eyes. Some Norns have unique antennae. Hobbits: A short, stocky race with thick antennae and large wings. The majority wear a loincloth-like shawl around their hips. ???: The names of the two other races have not yet been revealed. They seem to be a large, strong looking race with very long antennae, and a tall, slender race with wisened eyes and nubbed antennae.Tropes Exhibited MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki You Have To Burn The Trope  Occasionally, an author will come along and tell a vast, sprawling yarn complete with a rich plot, vibrant characters and panoramic environments. Others, however, may make an adventure with the intention of ending it immediately as a joke--or perhaps to teach the audience a lesson. This trope's name comes from the game You Have to Burn the Rope, whose credit sequence is longer than its actual gameplay. With the exception of a few inspired approaches to this, the use of this trope is highly frowned upon in the MSPAFA community. Interestingly enough, the (now complete) forum adventure by the name \"You Have to Burn the Rope\" is NOT an example of this, as the author took a couple reader-suggested plot twists and went off the rails.Examples  A rare subversion.\u00a0 The author was originally intending to play this trope straight to mock the trend of using inanimate objects as protagonists, but ultimately changed his mind and decided to turn it into a full adventure. Lasted one update. Made with the intention of lasting \"between one hour and one day.\" You reach the line and win the game before the end of the first page. Created because of the number of people in CheeseDeluxe's crossover adventure suggesting that Crystal Raver kick Cyz in the nuts. Made with the intention of telling readers to stop overusing jokes to death; bursting through a wall like the Kool-Aid Man had been a common suggestion at the time. Was only two shown images of a man standing then dying on a chest. Lasted only a few posts, but had six alternate endings. No updates.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki You Know, For Kids!  Some adventures are fluffy and light. Others are dark, depressing, and horrific. And that's all well and good. Sometimes, however, the dark adventures will start off in a deceptively cheerful manner, wait until the reader drops their guard, then hit them with the full medley of death, gore, and misery. Named after a quote from the Coen Brothers film The Hudsucker Proxy.Examples  \"I decided to make an adventure which is silly and lighthearted and not at all dark and depressing! This statement may be an outright lie.\" A lovely, cute game about an adorable welsh corgi. at least, until he gets brutally murdered. A group of stuffed toys navigate the Enchanted Fairy Country, searching for survivors of the airship crash that stranded them. Despite the cartoony look it has many very gory scenes, including ripping off of appendages and disemboweling. Not only does this adventure feature \"Happy\" in its title, it also includes a jolly businessman before he breaks his legs, gets hit by a truck, and thrown in jail. A play on the fairy tale character of \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" Little Crimson Hood is a monster hunter driven by greed and bloodlust. A parody of Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs And Ham that quickly becomes violent. It is written completely in rhyme, just like the book. Originally titled \"Hijinks at the Office\". These hijinks involve the brutal murder of everyone in the vicinity. A horror game originally titled \"Kitten Fun\".MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Ride Adventure Like A Mechanical Bull  The adventures that the MSPAFAs owe their popularity to, Jailbreak and Problem Sleuth, are constantly referenced ad nauseum. Running gags from these adventures are often suggested but not often used. Bird Wizard takes this a step further by creating a near identical copy of the beginning of Problem Sleuth with all of the characters replaced with avian magicians and key items changed to be bird- and wizard-related.Jailbreak  What pumpkin?Problem Sleuth  Bust through the wall like Kool-Aid Man (De)Ascend MC Hammer Slide Pose as a team, because shit just got real Retrieve arms from x Ride x like a mechanical bull Succumb to unfathomable bloodlust Victory Dance Weird puzzle shitMSPA Forum Adventures Wiki You Can't Do That, Stupid!  Readers aren't always cooperative. Suggestions are more often than not completely outlandish and unhelpful, and not in line with what the author has planned. A common solution is to cherry pick the best suggestions, but sometimes authors prefer to accept a terrible suggestion only to tell the reader how stupid it is. A denial of a command is often accompanied with a panel of the character looking confused or irritated. This is sometimes taken further to the point where there are consequences beyond a deflated ego. Andrew Hussie was fond of doing this in Jailbreak due to the adventure's policy of using the first suggestion submitted for each page.Examples  The readers suggest to lick the darkness; Lance replies with a facepalm. Then someone suggests licking the darkness orb, but he had used it a few panels back to learn Summon Grue. Many times. Most of the commands directed at the mushroom. Untill someone sent the command \"Become a mushroom youkai.\" It's a wall! You can't establish superiority with any part of it! Those ideas are so stupid, you almost want to punch yourself in the face. Oh, wait, the BURLY MOOK was kind enough to do it for you! What now, Genius Khan? Trope namer and well-known for a particularly sardonic parser. Subverted when, after a character complains about an unintelligent command, they discover that \"You Actually Can Do That\". After Kyle and Henry cross through a hallway to join Saul, a pit of lava opens behind them and a locked trapdoor is discovered. A suggestion was made that Kyle just use the mirrors to move the lava, thus melting through the trapdoor, but the author countered by making the trapdoor flame-resistant (later a reader pointed out that this shouldn't really have stopped Kyle from melting through it anyway). Also, there have been a number of attempts to captchalogueSPIT ridiculously large items, such as Myra's bed, but these failed because the SPAT can only store so much data at once. Almost always subverted, as Nopor Puss enthusiastically attempts anything he thinks will be impossible. Often conveyed by the colorful error message \"MISTAKE OF MASS ERRORISM\". Neil's attempt at rolling to see if he could suddenly sprout wings. This resulted in his own intellect being damaged. Often presented in the form of a picture of Marie Curie berating the players for their ridiculous suggestion. This adventure is practically built on this trope.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Alanna  Alanna is a MSPAFA by Baphomet. Downloadable archive here. Its eponymous protagonist, Alanna, is almost immediately thrust into a series of magical and celestial trials and tribulations in the aftermath of an unexplained attack on her house on her 18th birthday. Considered by some a first for the MSPAFA genre, the readers are Alanna\u2019s \u201cspectral advisors,\u201d and are acknowledged by the main character right off the bat. Effectively, they are characters in the story\u2026 albeit, in her head. All suggestions are \u201cheard,\u201d and Alanna chooses whose advice or directions to heed. It has since been completed, starting May 11th and ending June 19th, spanning 73 pages.Plot  The story begins with Alanna startling awake on the morning of her eighteenth birthday in her home. The first command of a reader is what causes her to wake up. She acknowledges the readers\u2019 presence and explains that her mother is a mage, and that they were summoned to assist her in an upcoming outing to \u201cPuzzland.\u201d Also, Franklin, her lightning-sprite-familiar is introduced. During the progression of the morning, it is shown that Alanna\u2019s mother is a mage, and implied that Alanna possesses some magical power. Alanna is interrupted during breakfast when a masked-man appears on their lawn, later revealed to be Tristan, and the story\u2019s antagonist. Several hand-themed creatures surround him. Not being able to defend herself with her lacking magical abilities, she (and Franklin) takes refuge in the bathroom of the house under the direction of her mother, while she, clearly a much more adept mage, confronts the assailant. After a close call in the bathroom, Alanna\u2019s mother informs her that the house is no longer safe, and they must escape to one of her hideouts. Unfortunately, they are pursued and captured shortly after leaving. Alanna comes to in the attacker\u2019s lair atop a table, and some sort of ritual takes place. It fails, and seemingly as a result the masked-man kills the spell-caster, and appears to kill Alanna. However, she enters a dreamlike state, where the day seems to have begun anew. After devouring her birthday cake, she wakes again in the room she was before\u2026 now covered in blood. The restraints that had held her to the table are now broken. While exploring the compound under the direction and aid of her spectral advisors, she discovers that she has power that she did not possess before. Previously, she was of the fire element. Now she casts ice (only one of the three elemental magical energies may be possessed and controlled at one time). Second, bodily harm heals almost instantaneously, and is replaced with ravenous hunger. Third, black exoskeleton-like masses appear over sites of injury, or at will on her extremities, and she can control their appearance and shape to a limited extent. Areas of the compound are locked by means of incomplete electrical circuits on entryways. These can be completed by directing the flow of electricity while placing colored crystals into the given prongs. Also, three large doors located in one hallway are activated by its corresponding element (depicted with colored symbols on their front). These doors lead to planes of existence created by god-like beings responsible for the magical energy of that particular element. Alanna slowly uncovers the plans of the man in the metal mask and learns her place in them. She quickly grows into the more mature role that is called of her, dealing with the problems that assail her constantly, and coping with the reality she is faced with. Everything ends up explained in due time, including the reason for the ritual's failure.Characters Crossovers and Cameos Awards Tropes Used MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki That NOUN Looks IMPORTANT  Whether in homage to classic TEXT-BASED ROLEPLAYING GAMES, as a way of providing CLUES as to the IMPORTANCE or INTERACTIVE NATURE of CERTAIN OBJECTS, or in imitation of Andrew Hussie's PROBLEM SLEUTH, a number of adventures employ SELECTIVE CAPITALIZATION or other similar means of STYLISTICALLY DESCRIBING their ENVIRONMENTS and ITEMS.Examples  Uses bold text for various interactive objects. From CHARACTER NAMES to IMPORTANT NOUNS to SPELLS AND TECHS this adventure is riddled with this trope. While it's difficult to tell because only one item has been seen in a font other than the (all-caps) adventure-specific one, the BATTERY was indeed rendered in capitals. Originally employed CAPS but switched to Bold Text for describing important items, because CAPS MEANS SHOUTING.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Arson And Ingestion  Igniting or consuming objects is always an extremely popular suggestion in any adventure. There is no obstacle you cannot overcome by simply setting something on fire or eating it. Or both! For example, in Overtime, Joe Peacock must first conquer his hunger gauge before progressing any further in his quest.Examples  Multiple commands have asked for flamthrowers or consuming various items. Amillio has tried to consume the kitchen, but was stopped by the daunting fridge. This trope was named for a comment Wesley Foxx made in this adventure. Nopor Puss actually attempts to eat rocks. Crimson Hood set fire to the witch's cottage when saving Karl. Several character ingest magical Pixies, resulting in devastating hallucinogenic effects. The sidekick of the adventure, Morlin, changes elemental attributes based on what he eats as well as the main character Guybrush Futurewood using ingestion as a method of storing items. Joe has a hunger gauge, and the first boss was defeated by feeding it something poisonous. When Sminly is in brown mode he's able to eat item/hold them in his stomach. When he switches to purple he can then spit them out, sometimes using them as a weapon. Bob the Drip is ingested by something he previously set on fire. Unbeknownst to players, arson and ingestion are both very reachable goals. Not only is the main character a living flame, early on he attempts to eat a tree. The main character has aMSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Name That Game  Referential humor is quite widespread in the forum adventures. It is no surprise that many of them often make reference or pay homage to a wide assortment of video games, considering that they are all based off of old-school text adventures.Examples  Day of the Tentacle. You Have To Burn The Rope. Recreates You Have To Burn The Rope in MSPA format. Samuel has two books containing Sirrus and Achenar from Myst on his bookshelf, but never opens them. Set in the universe of the Touhou Project games. There are only a few, like one time he holds up an item like in the Legend of Zelda games. Parodies the Legend of Zelda games a few times. Parodies the Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Yoshi's Island and God of War. \"Dungeons and Dragons\" is a fond past time of the main characters. The \"Exploit Ivory\" and \"Character Sheets\" in their world are also reminiscent of tabletop gaming. Furthermore, \"SQUEST\" is also a loose parody of Dungeons and Dragons itself, as well as many fantasy based MMORPGs. A parody of Left4Dead. Set in the Pok\u00e9mon world. The elemental symbols from Pok\u00e9mon appear on a keyboard. A parody of the series of Mario games. The entire collaboration is modeled after the Ace Attorney series of games. Gradius, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Portal, Monkey Island. Near-constant references. Zork, Super Mario Bros., Myst, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Pok\u00e9mon, Portal, Monster Rancher and EarthBound, just to name a few. James punches Captain Olimar of Pikmin. It's name is a clear pun on the game Pikmin. It also has you playing as a minuscule creature in a humongous world. A parody of the series of Pok\u00e9mon games. Uses a Sims-style format. Revolves around a game of UnReal World RPG. The name is a reference to Shadowhearts along with a few others. The battle system is based off of the common turn-based system found in many RPGs. Self-explanatory. Originally inspired by Shadow of the Colossus. Presumably a Megaman X reference. Not only is the adventure's structure similar to The Mystery of Time and Space, but that game is specifically referenced at one point and one puzzle directly stolen from it. Later, an adaption of You Have to Burn the Rope is presented as a bonus chapter, and a battle system reminiscent of many tactical/strategy RPGs is introduced.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Hello, Insert Name Here  Whether it's to approximate the style of an older video game, out of laziness, or out of tradition, many MSPAFAs allow the reader to name the protagonist, some going so far as to allow the readers to name the villains as well, or even all the characters. Naturally, not all suggestions are serious. A few adventures even take the naming a step farther by providing readers with a character sheet to fill in. The sheets usually consist of the characters name and other miscellaneous attributes such as class, affinity, and gender. Warriorccc0's Adventures was the first hosted on the MSPA forums to name a character, but it was a ways into the thread and largely incidental; Stew Pidd's Adventures (first known as Adventures in <Insert random name>) was the first to begin with a request for a name. Since then, a great number begin this way, or prompt within the first few posts to provide one.Examples  Although the protagonist already has a name, he allows the readers to choose an alias for him when he needs one. The narration begins \"You wake up in a very bland room. You don't know who you are. Actually, you do. What a stupid thing to think. Your name is Stan.\" Somewhat subverted. The character has a name, but it apparently sucks, and he is trying to think of a new one. The robo-spider asks the readers for his identification number. Avoids naming the character until another playable character is encountered. Readers give the character a user name for the forum. Morlin, Future Guy's dashing sidekick. Readers have been trying to give the female protagonist different variations of the name David for 2 pages and counting. It reads \"What is your name? You can't remember it from how much time you've spent in the hot, hot deser- Oh wait, it's Kyle. Kyle Balderdash. You find the very notion that people cannot remember their own name to be hysterical.\" The protagonist - The Everyman - was named by a reader. This choice may have had considerable influence on the game world and plot.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Lick The Shadows  There are bad commands; they get ignored. There are awful commands; they get mocked. Sometimes, though, a command is so stupid, so asinine, so imbecilic that it has a perverse appeal, and just has to become part of the story. This trope refers specifically to otherwise-pretty-reasonable adventures that use a completely ridiculous command, not to adventures that take every command or specifically take weird ones on a regular basis; it was named for one of its more notable iterations, in Vampires!.Examples  The system and conflict with deities in this game started with someone making fun of a moon that they thought was a sugar cookie, and thus a source of food. Since someone suggested Carlyle put the fourbear on his head anything that went before has quickly become irrelevant. Also The Map of Rome. Wearing things that are not appropriate to be worn (such as keys) actually turns them into equipment. Pudding from the author's avatar managed to end up in the adventure and become a mainstay. Additionally, inserting loose change into the cartridge slot of a  PORTABLE GAMING CONSOLE caused it to catch fire, creating a helpful torch. Another one of Donnelle's adventures, in this case repeated requests for creating a psi ball led to the appearance of balls imprinted with Greek letters. \"Play I-spy with yourself.\" Most of Bob the Drip's Abilities start as random readers' suggestions. Some examples include his Hug Analogues and his Interpretive Dance skill. Someone suggested that the first square Tetromino write a poem about his adventures. He quickly became a famous poet. The trope-namer, wherein the character was impelled to lick tangible darkness; licking shadows became a relevant plot-point. A joke about mojo leads to ritual sacrifice and a persistent search for eldritch grimoires.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Hey Guys  Humans are egotistical creatures, and many MSPAFA authors have found a reason to include themselves in their adventures. Sometimes the author will be the main character, or at least play a significant role in the story. More often, the author will appear in a non-canon update to converse directly with the audience, to berate them for their stupidity, or to provide self-critical commentary on the adventure. There is also a growing trend for inserting the readers into the story. This can be a fairly effective way to boost an adventure's popularity, because, well, humans are egotistical creatures. \ufeffxamples  Anyone (and everyone) can suggest actions for their forum avatar. In addition, the author uses his own avatar as a character. The author occasionally appears in non-canon drawings and responces to suggestions. The readers also appear briefly in the form of their avatars and give commands. The entire adventure features the author as the title character. He is a super-powered locksmith. The author will often appear as a floating head and make excuses for the implied lack of quality of the art. Used in two ways. The character Andre Cementi is directly reminiscent of the adventure's author, and the author is actually shown in his house drinking orange juice during the adventure's short hiatus. The readers also inserted themselves, in the form of their avatars, into several unsurprising surprise party images for the author's return, which were then collaborated into a non-canon update by the author. The author inserts her avatar in numerous places, and a depiction of herself in non-canonical drawings. The author uses his avatar to represent himself in non-canon drawings in Paint, often to curse Flash for being dysfunctional at times. The author appears as Francis making the adventure on his laptop. The author has a pixel-creature of her own, which is a teal pixel measuring 32*32*32. A simplistic drawing of the author occasionally pours scorn on the readers. A photoventure starring the author and his girlfriend. Also, DimJim as a locksmith. Another photoventure starring the author, his face obscured. So far includes readers PawnToD4, andanotherone, MultiFunctional, and aichmophile. Also, DimJim as a locksmith. Subverted when the author \"kicks out\" a nosy reader who tries to slip himself into the adventure.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Crystal Rave  Crystal Rave is an MSPA forum adventure created by dexexe1234. It has a heavy emphasis on combat, combined with light puzzle aspects and a shop. In these things it resembles an MSPAFA version of such action-adventure games as the Legend of Zelda series. Crystal Rave is full color and most panels feature animation. Crystal Rave recently won the best animated art award in the first MSPAFA Awards. Crystal Rave was also Nominated for best active adventure in the Spring 2010 MSPAFA Awards. Crystal Rave is not being updated anymore on the MSPA Forums, but is findable at www.Dexworks.net which is Dex's website.Mechanics  Crystal Raver has the stats LV (level), STR (strength), DEF (defense), FST (fastness) and MGK (magick). Upon defeating enemies, XP (xelence part) is earned; after enough is earned LV is increased and UPG (upgrade) points are earned which are distributed into the other stats as decided by the players. Crystal Raver has two meters, HP (health part) and MP (magic part), which reflect his current state. HP is depleted upon taking damage, and MP is depleted upon using elemental powers. A special meter called DP (dream part) is used for special actions called Dream Raves. Raves are special actions whose availability depend on various stats. Their activation seems to be based on the Rule of Cool rather than any pre-planned mechanic. So far seen are Rave Tricks (passive abilities), Combat Raves, and Magick Raves (which consume MP). Also mentioned, but not yet seen, are Social Raves. Also, there are plot-centric raves called Dream Raves, special raves unlocked through regaining parts of Crystal Raver's memory. One has been unlocked through recollection of Raver's past life. Crystal Raver regained his pet ferret, Sugarloaf, in the course of the adventure, and Sugarloaf now acts as sidekick. It has stats just as Crystal Raver does, though MGK is replaced with BST (beast). At various times throughout the adventure, Crystal Raver is prompted by a mental voice to choose something, which upon choosing based on player input manifests immediately. So far chosen have been an element (carbon), a weapon item (Drill Whip), a defense item (Bionic Eye) and a support item (Soul Scarf). Only two items can be equipped simultaneously. In a Dreamatic Interlude later in the adventure Crystal Raver learns how to fuse with items or creatures. This alters his stats and weaponry and may allow him to defeat foes more powerful than he otherwise would be able to. He can only fuse with things he knows how to combine with, and not with things that are unwilling to fuse. Using a fusion uses up all his Magick Part. He knows how to Animal-Fuse and Tool-Fuse.Plot Prologue  Crystal Rave begins with Crystal Raver sat in a prison cell unable to remember anything. A mysterious voice compels him to choose his element of magic. He chose carbon, gaining the ability to summon and manipulate carbon. Crystal Raver learns from a being called Artimeus, speaking to him through a portal, that he is a member of the Artisian Armada, trapped in a crystal prison. To escape from the room in which he is trapped he has to defeat the first guardian; Ramblax. Crystal Raver does so, using his signature weapon; the Drill-Whip. He travels through a portal and into the prison proper. Crystal Raver encounters Artimeus who he learns is the lader of the Artisian Armada. Artisian tells him that in order for them and other members of the Artisian Armada to be freed from the prison Crystal Raver has to defeat all eight guardians. Crystal Raver is then teleported on to the fire realm of Madame Wranx, starting Chapter One.Chapter One  Crystal Raver is stopped in his tracks by an imposing door. He solves some puzzles and encounters a pair of fire sprites called Jude and Bart. He is ultimately forced to kill them both to obtain the keys they possess. He is then able to proceed through the imposing door. After solving another puzzle he discovers a friendly frost bit. When he frees it from the frost amplifying pedestal it is trapped on it agrees to help him. He agrees to find a deposit of flex rodexon for the armor and purchases amongst other things a shield bit. Crystal Raver discovers a massive container of what appears to be sentient lava. It cracks open and he has a Dreamatic Interlude flashback to his past. In this dream state his home is under attack by the Artisian Armada. He discovers his father locked in battle with one of the Armada's members, his mother already dead. This traumatic experience causes him to wake up, finding himself engaged in a mini-boss battle with Blazorage, one of the Madame Wranx's servants. Using a powerful technique he creates a carbon duplicate of himself and together they fight Blazorage. An attack reveals a girl in a capsule contained in Blazorage's arm. After absorbing an alarming amount of magic from Blazorage the focus slips to someone else. A fire sprite called Veronica wakes from a dream about Crystal Raver. She is attacked by a venous seal-like creature. She manages to make it into a cave with a massive crystal and a potential antidote, however before she can obtain the antidote she encounters a member of the Armada; the same one who killed Crystal Raver's family. He is being pursued by an ice being Veronica recognises as General Ison. Neither he nor Veronica stand a chance and are promptly killed by the mysterious member of the Armada. Meanwhile Crystal Raver had become encased in crystal, and Carbon Duplicate transformed into Carbon Shield Knight. Crystal Raver wakes up in some a dark place. Here he is granted a new weapon; the Piston-Knuckles. After a quick test it reverts to energy, becoming a visage of Crystal Raver's uncle Pinkrieg. His other magical items do the same, revealing themselves to be his Aunt Puffcoat and Cousin Goodglasses. He learns that he is the sole remaining member of the monochrome race and that he has the ability of Fusion. He learns that he is in a Destrati, a hidden world inside his own mind. Very few get to explore their Destrati. He learns from the spirits of his family that Artisian Armada is a dreadful scourge upon the universe, and that Artimeus was the one who destroyed their race. Crystal Raver tests out his new Fusion Ability. Carbon Shield Knight, though heavily damaged manages to kill Blazorage before dying himself. The focus begins to switch a lot between a grimekin called Clarence who speaks directly to the readers, various people finding out about Blazorage's death, Crystal Raver and his new companion Feather Dove (the girl from Blazorage's arm), Sugarloaf (Crystal Raver's ferret companion) and his sidekick Eclair, and a guy watching the moons eclipse.Characters Enemies Crossovers And Cameos Tropes Used Mirror  Here at the Crystal Rave ArchiveMSPA Forum Adventures Wiki You Are Now This Guy  A trope featured extensively in and named by Jailbreak, Problem Sleuth and Homestuck. Shortly after a character is introduced, player control is switched to that character, usually with the statement \"you are now this guy.\" Under this trope, the change in control can sometimes be irreversible by the player, or alternatively the pool of characters which can be controlled by the players can be expanded.Examples  Subverted when it turns out that everyone was being controlled by a mushroom, and the changes in perspective were just changes in who it was controlling. Used straight up after the mushroom attained sentience. Control switches to Myra Orre after a Red Darts incident. \"Haha. Just kidding. You aren't Terry at all.\"MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Dashing Sidekick  You can't always expect the hero to go it alone. Behind every strong man is a cute, cuddly sidekick. More often than not, nesting in their hair. And in some cases, it may even be their hair.Examples  Cool Robot and its spawn, Robo-berry Franklin Sugarloaf, Frost Bit, Shield Bit Dwayne Suzie, Einphys Happy Face General Oswald Duck Bartholemeu and Marcello Morlin, and non-canon in-joke Hairasite Harold. Trope named after the command Super Tortoise and Nervous Businessman Nigel, and Nigel's sidekick-within-a-sidekick Nigel's Thornberry. And even then Nigel's Thornberry is backed up by a Small Piece Of Rubble. Reversed; the Hero essentially becomes the Spider Hero's sidekick, due to the fact that the Hero is actually weaker than the Spider Hero. Also subverted; the Spider Hero gains the ant as his sidekick, that actually turns on him later on in the act. Snuffy the Pooch, purple robot dog.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki If You Insist  Not every idea is a winner, and sometimes the author feels compelled to let the reader know. Be it out of spite, or just for humor, authors will sometimes accept commands that will inevitably yield negative consequences for the sole purpose of 'punishing' the reader. That'll show 'em.Examples  The main reason this adventure has continued for nearly 200 pages is because the author often accepts the dumbest, most suicidal command available at every crucial decision. Subsequently subverted when AllisLost flatly refuses to make the protagonist and his nemesis engage in Bumper Bobs. Leroy Caldwell, the main player, has been known to do stupid things on an impulse given by the readers. Only twice has it resulted in damage or death. What makes it If You Insist is the fact that Leroy states clearly that what he's trying to do is impossible, before doing it. The author actually solicits if-you-insist-worthy commands. Future Guy frequently does stupid and terrible things, often at the expense of his sidekick. Game ends on cliffhanger due to stupid commands. More often stupid commands result in insults, but Joe is sometimes punished with death or the loss of his items. Almost every update with commands for Bob.MSPA Forum Adventures Wiki Overtime  Overtime is an adventure by Superfrequency that follows the story of Joe as he explores his confusing office space, conquers vicious monsters, and solves weird puzzle shit. Overtime is characterized graphically by its style of simple and cleanly-drawn characters in monochrome photomosaic environments and gameplay-wise by largely inventory-based puzzles with specific solutions planned by the author well in advance.Plot  At the start, our protagonist, Joe, finds himself in a dark room. After a bit of searching, he finds a light switch and finds he is in a janitorial closet. he finds that the door has a door stop on the other side that is holding him in. After many attempts at opening the 'blocked' door, Joe finds that he had just tried to open the door the wrong way. After exiting the closet, Joe begins to explore the office finding it oddly deserted and in some areas altered in strange and unusual ways. As he attempts to make his way down to the first floor he encounters strange majyykal imps and a large monstrosity, which he promptly dispatches through the use of a latex glove filled with chlorine gas and hidden in a packet of cheese nubbins. Since then he has spent his time grappling with an obtuse cash box puzzle and an uncooperative man behind a locked door. Since stopping the game, Superfrequency released would of happened.Characters  The unsuspecting office worker that has been trapped in his office, which has been transformed from an everyday workspace to halls filled with monstrosities and infinite cubicle farms. A fairly commanding snack machine found in the break room. He doesn't have any items under 75\u00a2 and it is unknown what currency he takes. He also seems to be indifferent to his complete lack of friends, but it is evident that he must be lonely. A large-style imp found in the cafeteria kitchen and who claims to be a French chef (although Yvette disagrees, stating that he just bought a chef hat at a county fair) that sent Joe to on a quest to get 'meat for the gumbo'. Although Joe got meat for L\u00e9on, he has yet to receive the plot progressing item that was expected, possibly because none was ever actually promised. A younger, regular-sized imp, as well as L\u00e9on's niece. Since she had just moved into the office, she needed various items, sending Joe on a quest. Eventually Joe found something exquisite for the floor (Insipid Mat) and something magnificent for the wall (Benign Painting) but has so far had no luck getting her something ostentatious to wear. She has the 4th floor elevator button in her possession and has expressed a fondness for the number four. A boss-type creature that Joe had to face. Despite losing twice, he eventually killed the beast, giving L\u00e9on the necessary ingredient for his gumbo. The condition of the monstrosity's wife and children are undetermined. Though she has not made a personal appearance in the story thus far, Joe has raided his boss's office for numerous items, including money and Harold the gosling. Harold is Joe's erstwhile longsuffering sidekick. He is an adorable little gosling that Joe acquired when he attempted to take a gander at his boss's bookshelf. Harold has an origami hat. Readers have tried multiple times to sacrifice Harold to progress to plot (Give Harold to L\u00e9on for the Gumbo, Feed the Monstrosity Harold, etc.) which ends with Superfrequency 'banning' them from the thread.Crossovers And Cameos Tropes Used Samsung Wiki 8000 Series TV Samsung Wiki Samsung Wiki Samsung Wiki 698px-Samsung Logo svg.png Samsung Wiki Samsung Hi there!

Welcome to the Chick-fil-A wiki.Chick-fil-a Wiki Truett's Grill  In 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia. Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed atmosphere.External links References Chick-fil-a Wiki Religious Connections  Chick-fil-A founder S. Truett Cathy is a devout Christian who has taught Sunday School for over 51 years and whose religious beliefs permeate the company to this day. The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \"to glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us and to have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\" The chain invests heavily in community services (especially for children and teenagers) and scholarships. Cathy's beliefs are also responsible for one of the chain's distinctive features: All Chick-fil-A locations (company-owned and franchised, whether in a mall or freestanding) are closed on Sundays. Template:Cquotetxt Chick-fil-A has promoted religious groups via toys and CDs included in children's meals, much as movie studios promote new movies via McDonald's Happy Meal toys. These have ranged from including toys from the Christian television series VeggieTales in children's meals to including Financial Peace for Kids children's books by Christian financial guru Dave Ramsey and CDs from the Christian radio program Adventures in Odyssey, as children's meal incentives. The last show mentioned is produced by the radio division of Focus on the Family, and typically heard on Christian radio stations. On September 7, 2010, Chick-fil-A will be a minor sponsor of a golf tournament  benefiting Cincinnati's Citizens for Community Values, a conservative religious 501c non-profit which \"promotes Judeo-Christian moral values.\" Among these values is the belief that homosexual activists are a threat to society and homosexual behavior is among behaviors (including \"rape, incest, pedophilia, premarital sex, adultery, bestiality and pornography\") that are a \"departure from the Divine Order\". Other issues of concern to the group include curbing sexually-oriented businesses, protecting marriage and the family as well as lobbying against activities they consider harmful to children. Chick-fil-A and Focus on the Family also have a history of cross-promotion. Chick-fil-A has also sponsored meetings by the group All Pro Dad; All Pro Dad is a group with affiliations with Family First  a non-profit organization based out of Tampa, Florida started by Mark Merrill and Tony Dungy. Chick-fil-A has also directly sponsored other religious campaigns. One of the groups sponsored by Chick-fil-A is Athletes in Action, a sports missionary arm of the Campus Crusade for Christ.Template:Citation needed Another link between Chick-fil-A and religious groups includes promotion of National Bible Week. S. Truett Cathy is the chair of the National Bible Week Committee.Template:Citation needed Truett Cathy is also heavily involved in the WinShape Foundation, a non-profit organization which was started in 1984 with its goal to \"shape winners\" by offering summer camps, retreats, foster care, and other services.Template:Citation needed In New Jersey, they give support to Choices of the Heart. Chick-fil-A's connection to Christianity has been brought before the courts when Aziz Latif, a Houston-based Muslim employee for 6 years, sued the company in 2002 for firing him, alleging that he was fired for his religious beliefs when he had refused to take part in an employee prayer. The suit was settled on undisclosed terms. Chick-fil-A received prime product placement in the 2008 Christian-themed film Fireproof, in a scene in which the main character, working to save his troubled marriage, soothes his wife with the company's chicken noodle soup.Template:Citation needed  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundChick-fil-a Wiki Community Portal  This is the general discussion page for the wiki!

For C+P:Dinopedia Wiki Spinosaurus  </div> Spinosaurus (spin\u00b7o\u00b7saur\u00b7us/pronounced SPINE-oh-SORE-us) (\"spiny lizard\") was a large Theropod dinosaur that is known to be the prime candidate for being largest known Carnivore yet, larger than the Tyrannosaurus Rex , Carcharodontosaurus , Giganotosaurus , Bahariasaurus , Saurophaganax and Mapusaurus. Currently; The Spinosaurus is only known from several poor, incomplete and extremely fragmentary specimens. The holotype specimen was discovered in 1912 in Egypt, by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer. The specimen included the lower jaw, teeth, several neural spines, ribs, vertebrae and a single phalanx. Stromer measured the maximum length of Spinosaurus as 12 meters (39\u00a0ft), despite the holotype measuring only about 10 meters (33\u00a0ft) long. Sadly, the holotype specimen was destroyed after the museum, where the fossils were displayed at, was destroyed by Allied forces during the night of 24/25 April 1944. Newer discoveries from Tunisia in 1999 and Morocco in 2005 and 2014 suggest that Spinosaurus may have reached 15 meters (49\u00a0ft) in length. A size estimate by Dr. Dal Sasso suggests that the animal could have capable of reaching a length of 18 meters (59\u00a0ft); albeit it is not certain; latest research confirmed this as the estimations gave it a size greater than 15m. The largest known specimen was found by Spanish paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso, in Morocco in 2005. The specimen includes a near complete upper jaw which measures about 1.75 meters (5.7\u00a0ft) long, with a few well-preserved teeth. The latest finds, also discovered in Morocco, were discovered by Dr. Nizar Ibrahim and Dr. Paul Sereno. The specimen includes well preserved hind limbs, four neural spines, gastralia and some parts of the skull from the postorbital area. Ibrahim and Sereno made a new reconstruction of this animal, suggesting that Spinosaurus may have had a quadrupedal posture. However, this reconstruction has been criticized by both the public and the scientific community, although some people and scientist support it, some people (including scientists) believed it to be a chimera or error by Ibrahim due to an error in the original paper's description of how the measurements were done. Including Scott Hartman & John Hutchinson. A new revision has been published which has proved supporting Ibrahim's measurements. Evers et al. 2015 argued that Sigilmassosaurus was a distinct genus, and therefore doubted whether the material assigned to Spinosaurus by Ibrahim et. al. even belonged to it. It is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the described fossils. The best-known species is Spinosaurus aegyptiacus from Egypt, although a potential second species named Spinosaurus maroccanus (which is currently considered to be a junior\\nomen dubium) has been discovered in Morocco in recent times it is not officially recognized by this name. Spinosaurus Maroccanus may be sigilmassasaurus. Due to the body shape and limb orientation, it's biomechanics are thought to be comparable to avians like Pelicans and reptiles like crocodiles. Spinosaurus is once thought to have been semi-aquatic due to its diminutive limbs, but no one knows for certain; and lately there's counter-evidence for this speculation. The Spinosaurus locomotion method on land is unclear. Plausible theories include a Bipedal Gait with an S-Curved neck similiar to a Swan or a Pelican; or a more erect bipedal gait similiar to most theropods and lastly a quadrupedal gait; althrough its purely a speculation and lately deemed impossible. Spinosaurus theorized to being able to change posture. This diagram shows possible methods of land-based locomotion for Spinosaurus: http://pre02.deviantart.net/bc17/th/pre/f/2015/032/6/5/spinosaurus_skeleton_by_michell_vall-d8gb693.png http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5G9wUvmoo4c/VB0yXYaE7_I/AAAAAAAAGWQ/UaINrpubUy0/s1600/spinotest%2Bcon%2Bsigilmassa.jpgDiscovery  Two species of Spinosaurus have been named: Spinosaurus aegyptiacus (meaning \"Egyptian spine lizard\") and Spinosaurus maroccanus (meaning \"Moroccan spine lizard\") The first described remains of Spinosaurus were found and described in the early 20th century. In 1912, Richard Markgraf discovered a partial skeleton of a dinosaur in the Bahariya Formation of western Egypt. In 1915, German paleontologist Ernst Stromer published an article assigning the specimen to a new genus and species Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. Fragmentary additional remains from Bahariya, including vertebrae and\u00a0hindlimb bones, were designated by Stromer as \"Spinosaurus B\" in 1934.Stromer originally believed they belonged to juvenile Spinosaurus, but after closer research and bone analysis, he determined that specimen was actually a chimera, with remains of Sigilmassasaurus and Carcharodontosaurus. We don't have complete Spinosaurus' skeletons, but we have some of its parts of the body. We have about 5.7\u00a0ft long jaws, formed to grabbing and neural spines, that may be created the sail. However, newest reconstruction by Dr. Nizar Ibrahim shows that neural spines had a shape similar to those of bison's. That may indicate Spinosaurus actually had some kind of hump, not a sail. But, we have near complete skeletons of its cousins, Baryonyx and Suchomimus. They were just smaller versions of Spinosaurus, without a sail. So we can easily reconstruct the Spinosaurus based on mentioned dinosaurs. However, the most accepted theory is that its spine was thicker than the popular version of Spinosaurus, but not thick enough to be a hump. S. maroccanus was originally described by Dale Russell in 1996 as a new species based on the length of its neck vertebrae. Specifically, Russell claimed that the ratio of the length of the centrum (body of vertebra) to the height of the posterior articular facet was 1.1 in S. aegyptiacus and 1.5 in S. maroccanus. Later authors have been split on this topic. Some authors note that the length of the vertebrae can vary from individual to individual, that the holotype specimen was destroyed and thus cannot be compared directly with the S. maroccanus specimen, and that it is unknown which cervical vertebrae the S. maroccanus specimens represent. Therefore, though some have retained the species as valid without much comment, most researchers regard S. maroccanus as a nomen dubium or as a junior synonym of S. aegyptiacus.General Description  Spinosaurus was estimated to grow lenghts between 12 - 18m, latest research supported the largest estimations as given a size estimate as much as 15.6 - 16 meters (49 feet) long and likely weight about 7.6 tonnes (8.4 tons) or more. It's mouth had a similar appearance to that of the Irritator & Suchomimus (crocodile-shaped). It got its name, which means \"spine lizard,\" because of the tall spines on its vertebrae (bones of the spine), some reaching a height of six feet! They formed a sail along the animal's back, though not like those of the Permian mammal-like reptile Dimetrodon or Ouranosaurus,\u00a0the hadrosaur that lived in the same time period and area and may have been a prey item of Spinosaurus. The enlarged vertebrae of Spinosaurus that give it its name have been a cause of a great deal of controversy in recent years, with some people claiming they were a shrink-wrapped sail akin to Dimetrodon or Edaphosaurus, and others arguing instead that it was a thick ridge or hump akin to a bison or rhinoceros. The remains published in 2014 have shown that the vertebral spines narrow at the top nearer the front end of the animal, which means they would not have supported a thick fatty hump, however, they still do not display the characteristics of a \u201ctrue sail-back\u201d either. There were \"few channels for blood vessels\" meaning it likely wasn't for thermal regulation. Sail-backed reptiles have the supports for their sails that are thin, almost like the rays of a fishes fins, this can be seen for example in modern basilisks, whereas the vertebrae of Spinosaurus are thick at the base and narrow towards the top. In life the structure would have appeared rising from the body to form a triangular shape over the animals back (when viewed from in front), as opposed to either a shrink-wrapped sail or a large hump, it would have been most akin to chameleons. However, the vertebrae towards the animal's hips were thicker and could have supported a hump, perhaps to aid in buoyancy or balance. Spinosaurus' primary weapon is its mighty 5 foot arms with 25-30cm fingers armed with 15-20cm claws, designed for killing and occasionally for walking. The arm would swipe at another predator causing the claws to dig extremely deep into the flesh while the fingers are just an extension, like a knife has a handle, making the claw go deeper into the prey or competitor causing great pain. Then, secondary weapon is its specialized 1.6-meter jaws. These jaws are formed for the grabbing the prey, clamping down and suffocating it and they are most similar to these of crocodile. So, scientists guess that it used them like a crocodile, to throw prey from side to side. Brutally torn the prey into smaller 'pieces'. The jaws also had conical teeth like today's crocodiles. The teeth were hollow, designed for fish hunting meaning it had a relatively weak bite compared to other predators but is able to kill all the same. Spinosaurus once thought to be a semi-aquatic animal. Believed proof of this is the elongated feet, hydrodynamic design, and sensors in the form of small holes, on the top of its snout. They were perfect for locating fish in the water. This was found when in 2010 an isotope analysis by Romain Amiot and colleagues found that oxygen isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth, including teeth of Spinosaurus, indicate semiaquatic lifestyles. However these speculation has lately been Fallen out of favour. Isotope ratios from tooth enamel and from other parts of Spinosaurus and of other predators from the same area such as Carcharodontosaurus were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians.\u00a0 The study found that Spinosaurus teeth from five of six sampled localities had oxygen isotope ratios closer to those of turtles and crocodilians when compared with other theropod teeth from the same localities. The authors postulated that Spinosaurus Switched its living/hunting Territory between terrestrial and aquatic habitats to compete for food with large crocodilians and other large theropods. This strongly suggests that the Spinosaurus has more amphibious (lives both land and water) lifestyle rather than a fully aquatic lifestyle. \u00a0  The teeth are different from other theropod teeth because they were conical and the serrations (the cutting ridges along the sides) were very small. These tooth features, along with the shape of the skull bones, show that Spinosaurus is similar to Baryonyx\u00a0and\u00a0Suchomimus. They are both parts of the group Spinosauridae, but Spinosaurus belongs to a sub-group known as Spinosaurinae, while Baryonyx belongs to a separate group known as Baryonychinae, which have different features among their members.\u00a0 Spinosaurus is believed to have eaten fish; but there has been controversy about a dinosaur of that size relying on just fish. Spinosaurus believed to ate large\u00a0fish, but in times of famine and drought which were common it would scavenge and hunt small-sized prey to large prey (Ouranosaurus). Its also possible Spinosaurus used its size and claws to scare off other carnivores (like Carcharodontosaurus and Sarcosuchus) and eat/scavenge their kill much like Short-Faced Bears of Ice Age. However direct fossil evidence from the closer spinosaurid relatives indicate that the Spinosaurs was likely a generalist apex carnivore that ate any prey item aviable; wheter aquatic or terrestrial; rather than being purely piscivore. In 2014, paleontologist Paul Sereno and Nizar Ibrahim discovered that Spinosaurus vertebrae actually had a dip in the sail and its legs were much shorter than previously thought. This has brought the suspicion that Spinosaurus was likely more aquatic than previously thought, spending nearly all of its time in the water, and almost all its entire diet was piscivorous based. Its shorter legs have also made scientists wonder if part of the time Spinosaurus was semi-quadrupedal instead of bipedal like most theropods. However, this thesis was very criticised among the scientific community, because the specimen is possibly a chimera (Hutchinson et al.) or a juvenile (Hartman et al.) (Chimaera meaning some parts were from another individual). Dr. Scott Hartman says that dinosaurs are able to change during their growing process extremely (Horner et al.). The best example of changing during growing process is small ornithischian dinosaur, called Dryosaurus. Dryosaurus juveniles had very large and muscular forelimbs, what indicates they have locomoted on all fours. As they grew, their forelimbs became smaller and more useless, until they become absolutely bipedal animals in the adult stage. So, this might be the case with Spinosaurus, too. Also, Hartman says that there's no need for such a disorder. Recent studies have determined that some Spinosaurid species were amphibious animals, but still, they were bipedal animals; and more likely had generalist diet rather than an entirely piscivorous diet. The original first skeleton of this theropod was destroyed during the course of World War II. However, a piece of a skull bone belonging to another Spinosaurus that was found on a shelf in a German museum. It is most likely that another expedition to Egypt would uncover more skeletons so that more can be learned about Spinosaurus. \u00a0It also lived with medium to large sized herbivores and possible prey items like ouranosaurus, \u0131guanodontids; sauropods like Paralititan, other large carnivore theropods like Carcharodontosaurus\u00a0and Sauroniops, Bahariasaurus and very large crocodylomorphs like Sarcosuchus. In 2018, there is a new study saying that Spinosaurus itself may not have really been \"semiaquatic\", and may not have been a great swimmer. With multiple tests conducted following this study, results showed that Spinosaurus could keep its head out of the water, but at the very least, it would've been like that of other related dinosaurs, like Tyrannosaurus or Baryonyx. Its also been found that Spinosaurus would've been \"unsinkable\", in multiple experiments, even with denser bones, and ones where Spinosaurus could've exhaled three-fourths of the air from its lungs, it still would've struggled to dive underwater. Furthermore, the study found that Spinosaurus had to continually paddle its hind legs to prevent itself from tipping over onto its side, therefore using energy into a degree of waste; this is something that no extant semiaquatic animal do not need to perform. Henderson therefore theorized that Spinosaurus couldn't capable of hunt swimming and submerged in water as previously hypothesized, but instead would have spent much of its time on land and/or in shallow water.In the Media Gallery Videos  Cite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundDinopedia Wiki Main Page Dinopedia Wiki Geologic time scale Table of geologic time  (This table is not to any scale.)Dinopedia Wiki Brachiosaurus  Brachiosaurus (brach\u00b7i\u00b7o\u00b7saur\u00b7us) is a large genus of small skull (about the size of a common horse skull), long muscular tail, and thin columnar limbs. As with other Brachiosauridae, it was over 40 feet tall. It was a herbivore.History  genus Brachiosaurus, and Chicago. In 1899 Riggs had sent inquiries to rural locations in the western United States concerning fossil finds, and Bradbury, an amateur collector himself, reported that dinosaur bones had been collected in the area since 1885. It was Riggs' field assistant H.  W. Menke who found the skeleton on July 4, 1900. Additional Brachiosaurus fossils are reported on Riggs Hill, but other fossil finds on the hill have been vandalized. Riggs published a short report in 1901, noting the unusual length of the humerus compared to the femur and the extreme overall size and the resulting giraffe-like proportions, as well as the lesser development of the tail, but did not publish a name for the new dinosaur. The titles of Riggs (1901) and (1903) suggested that the specimen was the largest known dinosaur. Riggs followed his 1903 publication that named Brachiosaurus altithorax with a more detailed description in a monograph in 1904. The Fruita skeleton was not the first discovery of Brachiosaurus bones, although it was the first to be recognized as belonging to a new and distinct animal. In 1883, a sauropod skull was found near Garden Park, Colorado, at Felch Quarry 1, and was sent to Othniel Charles Marsh. Marsh incorporated the skull into his skeletal restoration of \"Brontosaurus\" (now Apatosaurus). It eventually became part of the collections of the National Museum of Natural History. In the 1970s, when Jack McIntosh and David Berman were working on the issue of the true skull of Apatosaurus, they reevaluated the Garden Park skull as more similar to Camarasaurus. It was described and recognized as a Brachiosaurus skull in 1998 by Kenneth Carpenter and Virginia Tidwell, intermediate in form between Camarasaurus and Giraffatitan brancai (then still considered to be Brachiosaurus brancai). Because there are no overlapping parts between this skull and the discovered in 1900, it cannot be confidently assigned to a species, so it is classified as Brachiosaurus. Additional discoveries of Brachiosaurus material in North America have been uncommon and consist of a handful of bones. Material has been described from Colorado, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming, and undescribed material has been mentioned from several other sites. The Giraffatitan material(from Tengaduru in 1914) was considerated firstly as B. altithorax, but describing the \"brachiosaurid\" material, Janensch listed a number of differences and commonalities between them and B. altithorax. In three further publications in 1929, 1950 and 1961 Janensch compared the two species in more detail, listing 13 putative shared characters. Of these, however, only four appear to be valid, while six pertain to more inclusive groups than Brachiosauridae, and the rest are either difficult to assess or refer to material that is not Brachiosaurus. In 1988, Gregory Paul published a new reconstruction of the skeleton of \"B.\" brancai, highlighting a number of differences in proportion between it and B. altithorax. Chief among them is a difference in the way the trunk vertebrae vary: they are fairly uniform in B. altithorax, but vary widely in the African material. Paul believed that the limb and girdle elements of both species were very similar, and therefore suggested to separate them not at genus, but only at subgenus level. Giraffatitan was raised to genus level by Olshevsky without comment. A detailed study of all material, including the limb and girdle bones, by Michael Taylor in 2009 found that there are significant differences between Brachiosaurus altithorax and the Tendaguru material in all elements known from both species. Taylor found 26 distinct osteological (bone-based) characters, a larger difference than that between, for example, Diplodocus and Barosaurus, and therefore argued that the African material should be placed in its own genus, Giraffatitan, as G. brancai. An important difference between the two genera is the overall body shape, with Brachiosaurus having a 23% longer dorsal (trunk) vertebrate series and a 20 to 25% longer and also taller tail.Paleoecology  With the removal of the East African Giraffatitan, Brachiosaurus is known only from the Morrison Formation of western North America. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from gallery forests (river\u2013lining forests in otherwise treeless settings) of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas with rare Araucaria-like trees. Several other sauropod genera were present in the Morrison Formation, with differing body proportions and feeding adaptations. Among these were Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, Haplocanthosaurus, and Supersaurus. Brachiosaurus was one of the less abundant Morrison Formation sauropods. Brachiosaurus fossils are found only in the lower-middle part of the expansive Morrison Formation (stratigraphic zones 2-4), dated to about 154-153 million years ago, unlike many other types of sauropod which have been found throughout the formation.Paleobiology  In contrast to most other sauropods, Brachiosaurs\u00a0had an inclined back, due to their long forelimbs. Therefore, if the neck exited the body in a straight line, it already pointed upwards. The exact angle is influenced by how the pectoral girdle is reconstructed, that is how the shoulder blades are placed on the ribcage. The mobility of the neck was reconstructed as quite low by Stevens and Parrish, while other researchers like Paul and Christian and Dzemski argued for more flexible necks. Brachiosaurus is thought to have been a high browser, feeding on foliage well above the ground. Even if it did not hold its neck near vertical, and instead had a straighter neck, its head height may still have been over 9 metres (30\u00a0ft) above the ground. It probably fed mostly on foliage above 5 metres (16\u00a0ft). This does not preclude the possibility that it also fed lower at times, between 3 to 5 metres (9.8 to 16\u00a0ft) up. Its diet likely consisted of ginkgos, conifers, tree ferns, and large cycads, with intake estimated at 200 to 400 kilograms (440 to 880\u00a0lb) of plant matter daily. However, more recent studies estimate that ~240 kilograms (530\u00a0lb) of plant matter would have been sufficient to feed a 70 metric tons (77 short tons) sauropod, so Brachiosaurus may have required only about 120 kilograms (260\u00a0lb) of fodder a day.  Brachiosaur feeding involved simple up\u2013and\u2013down jaw motion. The teeth were arranged to shear material as they closed, and were probably used to scrape vegetation into the mouth to be swallowed directly without chewing. .It has repeatedly been suggested, for example, in the movie Jurassic Park, that Brachiosaurus could rear into a bipedal or tripodal (with tail support) pose to feed. However, a detailed physical modelling-based analysis of sauropod rearing capabilities by Heinrich Mallison showed that while many sauropods could rear, the unusual brachiosaurid body shape and limb length ratio made them exceptionally ill suited for rearing. The forward position of the center of mass would have led to problems with stability, and required unreasonably large forces in the hips to obtain an upright posture. Brachiosaurus would also have gained relatively little from rearing (only 33% more feeding height), compared to other sauropods, for which a bipedal pose may have tripled the feeding height. Like all sauropods, Brachiosaurus was homeothermic (maintaining a stable internal temperature) and endothermic (controlling body temperature through internal means), meaning that it was able to actively control its body temperature, producing the necessary heat through a high basic metabolic rate of its cells. In the past, Brachiosaurus has been used an example of a dinosaur for which endothermy is unlikely, because of the combination of great size (leading to overheating) and great caloric needs to fuel endothermy. However, these calculations were based on incorrect assumptions about the available cooling surfaces (the large air sacs were not known), and a grossly inflated body mass. These inaccuracies resulted in overestimation of heat production and underestimation of heat loss. The large nasal arch has been postulated as an adaptation for cooling the brain, as a surface for evaporative cooling of the blood. Again, when this was proposed, cooling via the air sacs was not known, and thus not taken into account. Furthermore, other similar sized sauropods had no comparable structure. Additionally, in proportion to the entire animal, the nasal arch is very small, and would thus have made only an insignificant contribution to heat loss.\u00a0 The nostrils of rhe Brachiosaurus (like other sauropods, for example the Giraffatitan), the huge corresponding nasal openings in its skull, were long thought to be located on the top of the head. In past decades, scientists theorized that the animal used its nostrils like a snorkel, spending most of its time submerged in water in order to support its great mass. The current consensus view, however, is that the Brachiosaurus was a fully terrestrial animal. Studies have demonstrated that water pressure would have prevented the animal from breathing effectively while submerged and that its feet were too narrow for efficient aquatic use. Furthermore, new studies by Lawrence Witmer (2001) show that, while the nasal openings in the skull were placed high above the eyes, the nostrils would still have been close to the tip of the snout (a study which also lends support to the idea that the tall \"crests\" of brachiosaurs supported some sort of fleshy resonating chamber).In The Media Gallery  Brachiosaurus/GalleryDinopedia Wiki Liopleurodon  Liopleurodon (pronounced /\u02ccli\u02d0o\u028a\u02c8pl\u028ar\u0259d\u0251n/, meaning 'smooth-sided teeth') is a genus of large, carnivorous marine reptile belonging to the Pliosauroidea, a clade of the short-necked plesiosaurs. Two species of Liopleurodon, L. ferox and L. pachydeirus, lived during the Callovian stage of the Middle Jurassic Period (c. 160 million to 150 million years ago mya), while the third, L. rossicus, lived during the Late Jurassic. It was an apex predator of the Middle to Late Jurassic seas that covered Europe.Discovery and species  The name of the Liopleurodon, three large, 70 mm teeth and these poor remnants were based on HE Sauvage in 1993 [1]. A tooth located near Boulogne-sur-Mer, a layer from the Callovian, Liopleurodon ferox to France, another from Charly, Liopleurodon grossouvrei to France, France discovered here in Caen, initially described as Poikilopleuron, Sauvage Liopleurodon Bucklandi). Sauvage, in his description, did not assign to a genus of reptile groups. Liopleurodon fossils have been found mainly in England and France, with one species known from Russia. Fossil specimens referrable to Liopleurodon and contemporary (Callovian) with those from England and France have been found in Germany.[2] Currently, there are three recognized species within Liopleurodon. L. ferox is well known from finds in the Callovian strata of England and France; while also from the Callovian of England is the rarer L. pachydeirus, described by Seeley as a Pliosaurus (1869).[3]  L. rossicus has been found in Russia's Volgian region. The latter species was initially described by Novozhilov (1948) as belonging to Pliosaurus,[4] and is the type species of the genus Strongylokroptaphus.[5] Only L. ferox is known from more or less complete skeletons.Palaeobiology  Four strong paddle-like limbs suggest that Liopleurodon was a powerful swimmer. Its four-flipper mode of propulsion is characteristic of all plesiosaurs. A study involving a swimming robot has demonstrated that although this form of propulsion is not especially efficient, it provides very good acceleration - a desirable trait in an ambush predator.[6][7] Studies of the skull have shown that it could probably scan the water with its nostrils to ascertain the source of certain smells.[8] The largest known Liopleurodon skull belongs to L. ferox. It measures 7 meters but the largest specimens measure a little over 10 meters. and was originally estimated (Tarlo, 1960) to belong to an animal about 25 meters (80 feet) in length.[14] Later work (Noe, 2004) cast doubt on the model used to estimate the length of Liopleurodon, which had been based on the 5 meter skull length to body length ratio found in the famous (and morphologically similar) Kronosaurus skeleton mounted at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. Analysis of two mostly complete adult L. Ferox skeletons showed that the ratio of skull length to body length was more in the range of 1:9 or even 1:8, leading Noe to estimate that Tarlos's L. Ferox was only about 24 meters (75 feet), with a corresponding weight of about 2.5 metric tons (2.75 tons).15 (The original reconstruction of Harvard's Kronosaurus Queenslandicus is now known to have included too many vertebrae, resulting in a size estimate of ~ 40 feet as well as derivation of an erroneous skull length to body length ratio. K. Queenslandicus is now believed to have had a skull to body ratio of 1:9 and a corresponding length of about 25 meters.) A mandible on display in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, estimated to be over 3 meters (preserved 2.875m) and to have come from a skull perhaps 3.6 meters in length, was at one time classified as Liopleurodon macromerus. (When the mandible was described, it was originally assigned to Stretosaurus (as Stretosaurus macromerus).[10] The genus Stretosaurus later became a junior synonym of Liopleurodon.[11]) However, the Oxford mandible has since been re-classified as Pliosaurus macromerus.[12] The Liopleurodon ferox depicted in the 1999 BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs\u2014an enormous 25 meter-long (80 feet) monster weighing up to 150 tons\u2014is considered to be based on a reasonable estimate of L. ferox's maximum size.[16] In fairness to the program's producers, it should be noted that the 3 meter mandible of the Oxford Pliosaurus macromerus was, at the time of the series, classified as belonging to a Liopleuridon macromerus (it was not re-classified as Pliosaurus macromerus until 2003).\u00a0 Because fossils are rare (meaning that it is unlikely we would happen to find the largest example of a particular ancient species), and because pliosaurs, like dinosaurs, did not stop growing with age,[17] it is certainly likely that very old individuals of L. ferox grew to a size somewhat exceeding that of the largest known specimen, perhaps to 25 meters (80 feet) and 5-6 metric tons (7.7 - 8.8 tons). This would place L. Ferox in roughly the same size class as modern juvenile blue whales Remains excavated from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation of England support the existence of a pliosaur taxon larger than any known Liopleuridon, possibly up to 25 meters (80 feet long). However, these remains have not been positively identified as belonging to Liopleurodon.[9] The discovery of a very large pliosaur was announced in 2002, from Mexico, nicknamed the 'Monster of Aramberri'. A cautious estimate say it measures 12 meters long. It was widely reported as belonging to Liopleurodon, however no taxonomic conclusions could be made due to poor preservation and fact that the remains were of a partial vertebral column (non-diagnostic). The specimen was dated to the Kimmeridgian age of the La Caja Formation.[13]In popular culture  In 1999, Liopleurodon was featured in an episode of the 1999 BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs, where its was claimed to be 25 meters (80 feet) long and up to 150 tons. In the program, a gigantic Liopleurodon was depicted attacking and devouring the theropod dinosaur Eustreptospondylus and some Ophthalmosauruses, before becoming beached during a typhoon and suffocating under its own weight. Two adult Eustreptospondylus (in a twist of irony) who survived the storm feed upon it. The depiction of Liopleurodon leaping onto the land in order to catch land-based prey is entirely speculative, although the program's producers state that the behavior was inspired by that of orcas. Liopleurodon reappears with the same WWD design and size in a BBC spin-off series called Chased by Sea Monsters, and is shown feeding on a Leedsichthys corpse. It also makes a brief cameo chasing an icthyosaur in another spin-off called Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia. According to a 2008 article written for About.com, the popularity of Liopleurodon, which had previously been more obscure in popular culture than other well-known pliosaurs such as Kronosaurus, experienced an upsurge following its mention in the online animated short Charlie the Unicorn. A Liopleurodon is the main antagonist in The Land Before Time IX: Journey to the Big Water and along with other swimming carnivores, such as Cretoxyrhina and Hydrotherosaurus, are called Swimming Sharpteeth or Sharptooth Swimmers. A pod of Liopluerodons appear in Series 5 of Primeval and attack a submarine that came through an anomaly to the Jurassic. Liopleurodon previously appeared in the second Primeval novel. A 100-foot long Liopleurodon appears in the novel Meg: Hell's Aquarium and is depicted as having evolved gills and being bigger than Megalodon. A male Liopleurodon is featured in Sea Rex where he loses an eye and chases a plesiosaur before being dealt a fatal blow from the tail of a Leedsichthys. Liopleurodon is a Legendary reef creature that can be created in Jurassic World: The Game. It was added as a part of the March 16th, 2016 update. It appeared in ARK: Survival Evolved.Dinopedia Wiki Dinosaurs Dinopedia Wiki Velociraptor  Velociraptor (ve\u00b7loc\u00b7i\u00b7rap\u00b7tor) (Swift seizer or thief) was a small carnivorous dinosaur, well known thanks to Jurassic Park. It was one of the smaller dromaeosaurs, smaller than Utahraptor and Deinonychus. It lived in Mongolia and China during the Late Cretaceous, 75 to 71 million years ago.General Description  The most amazing find in Mongolia may be the discovery of the skeletons of the small theropod Velociraptor (\"swift seizer\") with its right arm clamped firmly in the beak of the small sheep-sized ceratopsian Protoceratops. Bote a sand dune collapsed, killing the two dinosaurs and preserving them in their death pose until 1971, when they were unearthed. Another theory states they fatally injured each other. In 1922, the first specimen of Velociraptor was found by the American Museum of Natural History. Like the famous death-pose specimen, it was found in the Late triassic sandstones of the Djadokhta Formation in the Gobi Desert, and was also found lying alongside a skull of Protoceratops. Velociraptor was a small theropod, with a large sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of its foot, it had a long, narrow snout, which is different from the other members of its family. The jaws were lined with serrated teeth for tearing flesh, it swallowed its food in gulps instead of chewing, like most theropods. The arms were long and it had strong chest and arm muscles, for grasping onto prey. Since the death-pose specimen was found with a Protoceratops, it probably ate this small ceratopsian, but it may have hunted even larger prey. Its diet also included small animals, such as lizards. Another dromaeosaurid feature that can be clearly seen in the death-pose are the long pieces of bone along the sides of the bones of the tail to stiffen it. This allowed the tail to act as a balance when the animal walked and ran. The tail, however, was still flexible, expecially since it was attached to the hips. The complete \"Struggle to the death\" skeleton has not yet been described, but it will certainly reveal even more new and exciting facts about this fascinating genus. Velociraptor was a small, dog-sized dinosaur that flourished in the mid-Cretaceous period. This dinosaur has become one of the most famous, due to its prominent role in the Jurassic Park movies.Jurassic Park Velociraptor vs the actual Velociraptor  Velociraptor was closely related to the North American Deinonychus. Not massive like Tyrannosaurus or\u00a0Tarbosaurus, this smaller dinosaur was a fierce predator, being quick and agile, as is portrayed in the movie 'Jurassic Park'.\u00a0 The Velociraptor in 'Jurassic Park' is 400% larger than the fossil record would indicate (standing 8\u201310 feet/2.43-3.048 meters tall and 4.25\u20136 meters long). It also resembles Deinonychus more than it does Velociraptor. This would create the feeling that the characters where being chased constantly by something a little more scary and dangerous than a turkey sized dromaeosaur. The so called raptor in the movie is more similar to a Utahraptor or Deinonychus in size. Velociraptor was roughly the size of a turkey. The raptors in the 'Jurassic Park' series also lack feathers and are bigger; instead of feathers, they are given squamas on their backs. The reason for the differences may be the result of genetic splicing errors and the utilization of amphibian DNA to fill in the genetic code sequence gaps, as well as the fact that it was not widely known that non-avian dinosaurs had feathers at the time of the original films making.Food  Velociraptor was a carnivore who probably ate anything it could capture, since its size was no larger than a turkey, the most likely prey were small mammals and dinosaurs. Some of the Velociraptor skeletal remains have been found in close proximity of each other, what led scientists to believe that Velociraptor probably hunted in packs; however, they have also been interpreted as being congregations similar to scavenging komodo dragons, or nesting birds. They used their front claws to capture and hold their prey while they ate.Birth and Offspring  We have no clear evidences that Velociraptor hatched from eggs. According to paleontologist David Burnie, it's quite possible that Velociraptor gave birth to live young. The female pelvis is very wide, which may be a proof for this theory. Despite this, fossilized skulls of Velociraptor young were recently found. Looking at them, we determined young Velociraptors had proportionally shorter snouts and bigger eyes than the adults, what's very usual for avian animals, such as Velociraptor. This indicates that the babies were fed and looked after by the adults for some period after hatching. However, some modern reptiles like turtles also have these skewed proportions, so they could equally be related to simply sense and ecology, with large eyes favouring nocturnal vision. Based on other deinonychosaurs, Velociraptor was probably precocial, meaning that, even if it had parental care, it was capable of moving around and finding it's own food very on it's lifetime.Senses  Velociraptor had a fairly large brain, compared to other dinosaur species, which made them fairly intelligent compared to other non-avian theropods. However, their intelligence was still not above that of modern \"basal\" birds like ostriches and geese.  The study of dinosaur skulls demonstrates that the Velociraptor had excellent hearing and binocular vision. All dinosaurs have a notch in their skull and middle ear bones where the tight ear drum stretched. Crocodiles and birds, both of which are related to the dinosaurs, have a keen sense of hearing, so it is not surprising that dinosaurs also had an acute sense of hearing. Nerve endings around the outside of the Velociraptor\u2019s skull and the large olfactory lobes, suggests that the dinosaur's snout was highly sensitive to touch and smells. The Velociraptor like other predators had binocular vision, which allows them to see th dells sucksReferences On the Media  Velociraptor is common in films and documentaries. It is featured in all of the Jurassic Park movies and makes an appearance in the Walking With Dinosaurs Special: The Giant Claw. It also appeared in Dinosaur Revolution and Dinosaur Planet. It is one of the dinosaurs featured in Jerry Pallotta's book \"Who Would Win? Tyrannosaurus Rex vs. Velociraptor\". It also appears in Zoo Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon 2. It appears in the game Parkasaurus.Gallery  Velociraptor/GalleryDinopedia Wiki Carnotaurus  Carnotaurus (car\u00b7no\u00b7taur\u00b7us) (meaning, meat eating bull) was a large bipedal dinosaur which lived in South America during the Late Cretaceous Period. It is a relative of other theropod dinosaurs such as Abelisaurus, Majungasaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Rajasaurus. Carnotaurus lived in Patagonia, Argentina about 80 million years ago, and was discovered by Jos\u00e9 F. Bonaparte, who has discovered many other bizarre, South American dinosaurs.Description  Carnotaurus was a large theropod and one of the largest abelisaurs, about 7-9 meters in length, and between 2-3 tons in weight. Abelisaurids have odd features in their heads, as Carnotaurus had two large brow horns over its eyes, while its smaller relative Majungasaurus had highly bizarre looking knob on its head. The Ceratosaurus had a few horns on its head also. It is probably the fastest running theropod, reaching a speed of up to 40 mph.Front limbs morphology  Abelisaurids also have very reduced forelimbs with four or five fingers. In particular,\u00a0the arms of Carnotaurus, when compared to their body size, were far smaller than even than those of Tyrannosaurus and were completely useless, and possibly the smallest forelimbs in whole animal kingdom compared to body mass. Hands of this creature had four very small fingers, and only two of them actually had bones.Skull and jaws  Carnotaurus had one of most bizarre skulls among the dinosaur world. He had big bony bumps, morphologically similar to horns of the modern bull above the orbital openings. It's likely that he didn't use them to fight, because they were really small and blunt, so they cannot leave any serious damage. He perhaps used these bumps to attract mate during the mating season. Skull was also very light built, with large preorbital opening. Some paleontologists think this large opening may have cooled Carnotaurus' skull or blood. Shape of skull itself was very strange, too. Skull was relatively thin and flattened from the sides, allowing animal to move head very quick and possible even attack during running. Carnotaurus had a very big postorbital area of skull, allowing him to bite very strong. According to paleontologist Robert Bakker, so-called \"rottweiler effect\" makes an animal's bite powerful. The \"rottweiler effect\" is especially large back part of the skull (postorbitlal area) where jaw muscles are located. The bigger the postorbital area - the stronger the bite force. Also, Carnotaurus's teeth are very unique design - they were very wide, and relatively blunt, resembling the railroad spike. These teeth are very suitable for crushing bone, making this carnivore's bite enormously lethal. His relatively large eyes were positioned right at the front of the skull, giving him binocular and tro-dimensional vision, what's pretty unusual in Dinosauria.Skin and feathers  A single nearly complete skeleton has been described, including a large skin print on the right side of the specimen, covering the head, arms, torso and legs, showing us much about its skin. It shows us that it was covered in circular non overlapping scales, with osteoderms running down the length of the back. The type species Carnotaurus sastrei is the only known species, though it is related to other Abelisaurids from Madagascar, Argentina, India, and North Africa.In Popular Culture  feature Dinosaur) are menaced by a large AudioAnimatronic \"Carnotaurus\", among other creatures.Gallery  Carnotaurus/GalleryReferences  Websites: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnotaurus http://animal.discovery.com/dinosaurs/carnotaurus.htm http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/c/carnotaurus.html http://www.dinochecker.com/dinosaurs/CARNOTAURUS http://www.wikidino.com/?page_id=311 Documentaries: Bizarre Dinosaurs & Life After Dinosaurs Books: Dino Wars; by\u00a0Jinny Johnson, consulted by Michael J. Benton The Audubon Society Pocket Guides Familiar Dinosaurs; by Alfred A. Knopf.Dinopedia Wiki Allosaurus  Allosaurus (al\u00b7lo\u00b7saur\u00b7us) (al-OH-sore-US) (March, 1877) meaning, \"different, other-lizard\", is arguably one of the most well known Jurassic predators known, growing to about 28 - 29 feet (8.5 to 9 meters) on average and capable of reaching up to 12\u201313 meters. It had a large skull with eye ridges, and claws designed for gripping. Its diet may have included many different dinosaurs, mainly smaller ones such as the Dryosaurus and Camptosaurus, but in packs it may have hunted the stegosaurid Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, and even young sauropods. There are currently three species of Allosaurus known: A. fragilis, A. europaeus and A. lucasi. Allosaurus was certainly not the only apex predator in the Jurassic, as it would have to compete against bigger predators, such as Saurophaganax and not the bigger but the main rivals Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus. However, its weak bite force is misleading. Its skull would have been used almost like a hatchet to smack down on prey, causing heavy bleeding. It couldn't take down sauropods, but it was the perfect predator for smaller prey items. Smaller prey such as Dryosaurus and Camptosaurus would be ideal because Allosaurus was speedy with a \"hatchet\" mouth that could cause bleeding, and the smaller animals would bleed out quicker. One particularly well-preserved specimen, nicknamed \"Big Al\", was found not too long ago in Wyoming. While Allosaurus was a\u00a0hunter, it was also a scavenger (like all predators). It would find dead animals\u00a0or animals dying to feast on.\u00a0\"Big Al\"\u00a0had many different injuries from throughout its short, seven year life, yet surviving all but the last one, an infected toe wound. This would have left the animal unable to hunt, and it would have starved and/or died of thirst.Skull  Allosaurus skull was double hinged. This allowed it to open its mouth extremely wide, allowing it to have a huge bite radius. One hinge was near the front of the jaw like a snake's, and the other was near the back of the jawbone. However, recent studies seem to show that Allosaurus had a relatively low bite force of only 350 pounds per square inch,much less than the value of sharks and crocodiles and even inferior to that of most big cats, despite being much bigger. Its eems that Allosaurus attacked like an axe, using its double-hinged jaw to open really wide and dropping the top part of its skull into its prey with a large amount of pressure while holding it steady with its strong arms. A constant repetition of this method would have led to a massive amount of blood loss and shock. It was a very efficient way of killing, and it's probably why Allosaurus was so successful as a hunter.Description  Allosaurus was a typically large theropod once thought to be less than 10 meters but not after when the much large theropod Epanterias was proved to be synonymous to it, which means it grew up to 13 meters. The largest specimen of Allosaurus fragilis was about 9.7 meters in length. With the best known species showing it averaged on 8.5 meters. As with all dinosaurs there is much debate on the weight of Allosaurus. Some say it's weight was up to 2000 pounds, but possible synonym Saurophaganax had a weight of 4000 pounds. It is the most successful Jurassic predator. It's body was agile and sleek making it able to run in a speed of 25 mph. It had large claws on it's hands to grip prey while using it's \"hatchet bite\". It's legs were somewhat long but weak and containing less muscle mass. These strong body parts made Allosaurus to be one of the most successful hunters.Front limbs morphology  The forelimbs of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0were short in comparison to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed\u00a0claws.\u00a0The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2\u00a0ulna/humerus\u00a0ratio).\u00a0The wrist had a version of the semilunate\u00a0carpal also found in more derived theropods like\u00a0maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or\u00a0thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others.\u00a0The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of\u00a0tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more\u00a0hoof-like than those of earlier theropods.\u00a0Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner\u00a0dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles.There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost)\u00a0metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the\u00a0Achilles tendon and foot.Species  Eight species have been considered potentially valid since 1988 (Epanterias/A. amplexus, A. atrox, A. europaeus, the type species A. fragilis, the as-yet not formally described \"A. jimmadseni\", A. lucasi, Saurophaganax/A. maximus, and A. amplus) A. fragilis is the type species and was named by Marsh in 1877. It is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals, all found in the Kimmeridgian\u2013Tithonian Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation of the United States. It grew up to 10 meters. Two partial skeletons of allosaurid theropods belonging to an adult and a juvenile from the Upper Jurassic (Tithonian) Morrison Formation of McElmo Canyon in Montezuma County, southwestern Colorado, were discovered in 1953 by the late Joseph T. Gregory and David Techter. It grew up to 9 meters. Allosaurus europaeus was diacovered in 2006 described by M.T.Antunas in the same year. It lived in the Lourinha formation of Portugal. Living in the Morrison formation. It grew up to 8 meters.Doubtful species  A. amplexus or Epanterias amplexus was named by Gregory S. Paul for giant Morrison allosaur remains, and included in his conception Saurophagus maximus (later Saurophaganax). It is sure that Epanterias is synonymous to Allosaurus which means Allosaurus grew up to 13 meters. \"A. jimmadseni\" is the proposed name for a new species of Morrison allosaur, based on a nearly complete skeleton and skull. It grew up to 7 meters. A. maximus was a new combination by David K. Smith for Chure's Saurophaganax maximus, a taxon created by Chure in 1995 for giant allosaurid remains from the Morrison of Oklahoma. These remains had been known as Saurophagus, but that name was already in use, leading Chure to propose a substitute. Which means it is Saurophaganax. If Saurophaganax is proved to be synonymous, it grew up to 14 meters. Allosaurus atrox was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, Creosaurus, and is based on YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an illium, and ankle and foot bones. A. amplus is the synonym for Camptonotus amplus. It is not so well known. It grows up to 7.6 meters.Synonyms Possible species  A. tendagurensis was named in 1925 by Werner Janensch for a partial shin (MB.R.3620) found in the Kimmeridgian-age Tendaguru Formation in Mtwara, Tanzania. Although tabulated as a tentatively valid species of Allosaurus in the second edition of the Dinosauria, subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond Tetanurae, either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid. Although obscure, it was a large theropod, possibly around 10 meters long (33 ft) and 2.5 metric tons (2.8 short tons) in weight.Classification  Allosaurus\u00a0was an allosaurid, a member of a\u00a0family\u00a0of large theropods within the larger group\u00a0Carnosauria. The family name\u00a0Allosauridae\u00a0was created for this genus in 1878 by\u00a0Othniel Charles Marsh, but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of\u00a0Megalosauridae, another family of large theropods that eventually became a\u00a0wastebasket taxon. This, along with the use of\u00a0Antrodemus\u00a0for\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name \"Megalosauridae\" instead of \"Allosauridae\" include\u00a0Gilmore, 1920, von Huene, 1926, Romer, 1956 and 1966, Steel, 1970, and\u00a0Walker, 1964. Following the publication of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to Allosaurus included Indosaurus, Piatnitzkysaurus, Piveteausaurus, Yangchuanosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Chilantaisaurus, Compsosuchus, Stokesosaurus, and Szechuanosaurus. Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like Acrocanthosaurus and Yangchuanosaurus, are members of closely related families. Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax may turn out to be large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.Discovery and naming Early discoveries and research  The discovery and early study of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the\u00a0Bone Wars\u00a0of the late 19th century. The first described\u00a0fossil\u00a0in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by\u00a0Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden\u00a0in 1869. It came from\u00a0Middle Park, near\u00a0Granby, Colorado, probably from\u00a0Morrison Formation\u00a0rocks. The locals had identified such bones as \"petrified\u00a0horse\u00a0hoofs\". Hayden sent his specimen to\u00a0Joseph Leidy, who identified it as half of a tail vertebra, and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus\u00a0Poekilopleuron\u00a0as\u00a0Poicilopleuron\u00a0valens. He later decided it deserved its own genus,\u00a0Antrodemus. Allosaurus\u00a0itself is\u00a0based on\u00a0YPM\u00a01930,  a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae, a rib fragment, a tooth, a toe bone, and, most useful for later discussions, the shaft of the right humerus (upper arm). Othniel Charles Marsh gave these remains the formal name\u00a0Allosaurus fragilis\u00a0in 1877.\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0comes from the\u00a0Greek\u00a0allos/\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, meaning \"strange\" or \"different\" and\u00a0sauros/\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\". It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery.\u00a0The species epithet\u00a0fragilis\u00a0is\u00a0Latin\u00a0for \"fragile\", referring to lightening features in the vertebrae. The bones were collected from the Morrison Formation of\u00a0Garden Park, north of\u00a0Ca\u00f1on City.\u00a0Marsh and\u00a0Edward Drinker Cope, who were in scientific competition, went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of\u00a0Allosaurus. These include Marsh's\u00a0Creosaurus and\u00a0Labrosaurus, and Cope's\u00a0Epanterias. In their haste, Cope and Marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the discovery by\u00a0Benjamin Mudge\u00a0of the type specimen of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in\u00a0Wyoming; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the\u00a0Como Bluff\u00a0area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial\u00a0Apatosaurus\u00a0skeleton as if\u00a0scavenging\u00a0it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described. The multiplicity of early names complicated later research, with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as\u00a0Samuel Wendell Williston\u00a0suggested that too many names had been coined.\u00a0For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0from\u00a0Creosaurus. The most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by\u00a0Charles W. Gilmore\u00a0in 1920. He came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named\u00a0Antrodemus\u00a0by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of\u00a0Allosaurus, and\u00a0Antrodemus\u00a0thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority. Antrodemus\u00a0became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years, until James Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0should be used because\u00a0Antrodemus\u00a0was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information (for example, the\u00a0geological formation\u00a0that the single bone of\u00a0Antrodemus\u00a0came from is unknown).\u00a0\"Antrodemus\" has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.Cleveland-Lloyd discoveries  Although sporadic work at what became known as the\u00a0Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry\u00a0in\u00a0Emery County,\u00a0Utah\u00a0had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by William J. Stokes in 1945, major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40\u00a0institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965. The quarry is notable for the predominance of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod\u00a0Allosaurus fragilis\u00a0(it is estimated that the remains of at least 46\u00a0A. fragilis\u00a0have been found there, out of at minimum 73\u00a0dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the\u00a0taphonomy\u00a0of the site, suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to\u00a0drought-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep. Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail, making it among the best-known theropods. Skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes, from less than 1 meter (3.3 feet) to 12 meters (39 feet) long, and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused.Recent work: 1980s\u2013present  The period since Madsen's monograph has been marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0in life (paleobiological\u00a0and\u00a0paleoecological\u00a0topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation, growth, skull construction,bhunting methods, the\u00a0brain, and the possibility of gregarious living and parental care.Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.\"Big Al\" and \"Big Al Two\"  In 1991 \"Big Al\" (MOR\u00a0693), a 95%\u00a0complete, partially articulated specimen of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0was discovered. It measured about 8\u00a0meters (about 26\u00a0ft) in length. MOR 693 was excavated near\u00a0Shell, Wyoming, by a joint Museum of the Rockies and\u00a0University of Wyoming\u00a0Geological Museum team.\u00a0This skeleton was discovered by a Swiss team, led by Kirby Siber. In 1996 the same team discovered a second\u00a0Allosaurus, \"Big Al Two\", which is the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date. The completeness, preservation, and scientific importance of this skeleton gave \"Big Al\" its name; the individual itself was below the average size for\u00a0Allosaurus fragilis, and was a subadult estimated at only 87%\u00a0grown.\u00a0The specimen was described by Breithaupt in 1996. Nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of\u00a0infection, which may have contributed to \"Big Al's\" death.\u00a0Pathologic\u00a0bones included five ribs, five vertebrae, and four bones of the feet; several damaged bones showed\u00a0osteomyelitis, a bone infection. A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait. Al had an infection on the first phalanx on the third toe that was afflicted by an\u00a0involucrum. The infection was long lived, perhaps up to 6 months.\u00a0Big Al Two is also known to have multiple injuries.Paleobiology Life history  The wealth of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as\u00a0eggs\u2014crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of\u00a0Allosaurus. Based on\u00a0histological\u00a0analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28\u00a0years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like\u00a0Tyrannosaurus. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age\u00a015, with an estimated growth rate of about 150\u00a0kilograms (330\u00a0lb) per year. Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, mineralization located inside the medulla of the long bones in gravid female birds) has been reported in at least one\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0specimen, a\u00a0shin bone\u00a0from the\u00a0Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply\u00a0calcium\u00a0to shells. Its presence in the\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of\u00a0Tyrannosaurus, it may be possible to ascertain whether or not the\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0in question was indeed female. The discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood.\u00a0The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, and the growth of the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression.\u00a0Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown\u00a0isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.Feeding  Paleontologists accept\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0as an active predator of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on\u00a0Stegosaurus, including an\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a\u00a0Stegosaurus\u00a0tail spike, and a\u00a0Stegosaurus\u00a0neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0snout.\u00a0Sauropods\u00a0seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of\u00a0scavenging, based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988,\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods.Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question.\u00a0Robert T. Bakker, comparing\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0to\u00a0Cenozoic\u00a0sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a\u00a0saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim. Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using\u00a0finite element analysis\u00a0on an\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148\u00a0N, less than the values for\u00a0alligators\u00a0(13,000\u00a0N),\u00a0lions\u00a0(4,167\u00a0N), and\u00a0leopards\u00a0(2,268\u00a0N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500\u00a0N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike\u00a0Tyrannosaurus, which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods. Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey. The original authors noted that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the\u00a0palate\u00a0and lessen stress. Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0were \"flesh grazers\" which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey. Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager\u00a0et al.\u00a0from the University of Bristol also indicate\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with\u00a0Tyrannosaurus\u00a0and the therizinosaurid\u00a0Erlikosaurus\u00a0in the same study, it was found that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 79 degree angle. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores. A\u00a0biomechanical\u00a0study published in 2013 by Eric Snively and colleagues found that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the\u00a0longissimus capitis superficialis\u00a0neck muscle compared to other theropods such as\u00a0Tyrannosaurus. This would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull. The authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by Bakker and Rayfield are consistent with the animal's capabilities. They also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to\u00a0falcons, such as\u00a0kestrels: the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet, then pulled back and up to remove flesh. This differs from the prey-handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids, which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull, similar to crocodilians.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0was able to \"move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control\", at the cost of power. Other aspects of feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The shape of the skull of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0limited potential\u00a0binocular vision\u00a0to 20\u00b0 of width, slightly less than that of modern\u00a0crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close,\u00a0and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things.Finally, the top speed of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0has been estimated at 30 to 55\u00a0kilometers per hour (19 to 34\u00a0miles per hour). A new study on the skull of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely since the animal would be wasting great amounts of energy with each bite. It seems more likely that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0hunted prey like any typical carnosaur by ripping great chunks of flesh from the animal and letting it bleed to death.Social behavior  It has been speculated since the 1970s that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups. Such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food.However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia\u00a0and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named\u00a0Labrosaurus ferox\u00a0is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a\u00a0pack\u00a0or to settle\u00a0territorial\u00a0disputes. Although\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0may have hunted in packs,\u00a0it has been argued that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among\u00a0vertebrates\u00a0in general, and modern\u00a0diapsid\u00a0carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and\u00a0cannibalize\u00a0intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0individuals at the same site, e.g. in the\u00a0Cleveland\u2013Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like\u00a0crocodiles\u00a0and\u00a0Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in\u00a0Allosaurus, including\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a\u00a0shoulder blade, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.Brain and senses  The brain of\u00a0Allosaurus, as interpreted from spiral\u00a0CT scanning\u00a0of an\u00a0endocast, was more consistent with\u00a0crocodilian\u00a0brains than those of the other living\u00a0archosaurs, birds. The structure of the\u00a0vestibular apparatus\u00a0indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the\u00a0inner ear\u00a0was like that of a crocodilian, and so\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The\u00a0olfactory bulbs\u00a0were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.Paleopathology  In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for\u00a0stress fractures\u00a0and\u00a0tendon avulsions\u00a0in\u00a0theropod\u00a0dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or\u00a0migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand.\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than\u00a0Albertosaurus,\u00a0Ornithomimus\u00a0or\u00a0Archaeornithomimus. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones \"were distributed to the\u00a0proximalphalanges\" and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in \"statistically indistinguishable\" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0provide evidence for \"very active\" predation-based rather than scavenging diets. The left\u00a0scapula\u00a0and\u00a0fibula\u00a0of an\u00a0Allosaurus fragilis\u00a0specimen catalogued as USNM 4734 are both pathological, both probably due to healed fractures. The specimen USNM 8367 preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle. Some of the fractures were poorly healed and \"formed pseudoarthroses.\" A specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the\u00a0Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail. An apparent subadult male\u00a0Allosaurus fragilis\u00a0was reported to have extensive pathologies, with a total of fourteen separate injuries. The specimen MOR 693 had pathologies on five ribs, the sixth neck vertebra the third eighth and thirteenth back vertebrae, the second tail vertebra and its chevron, the\u00a0gastralia\u00a0right scapula, manual phalanx I left\u00a0ilium\u00a0metatarsals III and V, the first phalanx of the third toe and the third phalanx of the second. The ilium had \"a large hole probably caused by a blow from above\".The near end of the first phalanx of the third toe was afflicted by an\u00a0involucrum. Other pathologies reported in\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0include:\u00a0Willow breaks\u00a0in two ribs. Healed fractures in the\u00a0humerus\u00a0and\u00a0radius. Distortion of\u00a0joint\u00a0surfaces in the foot possibly due to\u00a0osteoarthritis\u00a0or developmental issues.\u00a0Osteopetrosis\u00a0along the endosteal surface of a\u00a0tibia. Distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae possibly due to\u00a0osetoarthritis\u00a0or developmental issues. \"Extensive 'neoplastic'\u00a0ankylosis\u00a0of caudals,\" possibly due to physical trauma as well as the fusion of chevrons to centra. Coossification of vertebral centra near the end of the tail.\u00a0Amputation\u00a0of a chevron and foot bone, both possibly a result of bites. \"Extensive\u00a0exostoses\" in the first phalanx of the third toe. Lesions similar to those caused by\u00a0osteomyelitis\u00a0in two\u00a0scapulae.\u00a0Bone spurs\u00a0in a\u00a0premaxilla,\u00a0ungual, and two\u00a0metacarpals. Exostosis in a pedal phalanx possibly attributable to an infectious disease. A metacarpal with a round depressed fracture.Paleoecology  Allosaurus\u00a0was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of\u00a0Western American\u00a0fossil-bearing rock known as the\u00a0Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top\u00a0trophic level\u00a0of the Morrison\u00a0food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a\u00a0semiarid\u00a0environment with distinct\u00a0wet\u00a0and\u00a0dry seasons, and flat\u00a0floodplains. Vegetation varied from\u00a0river-lining forests of\u00a0conifers,\u00a0tree ferns, and\u00a0ferns\u00a0(gallery forests), to fern\u00a0savannas\u00a0with occasional trees such as the\u00a0Araucaria-like conifer\u00a0Brachyphyllum. The Morrison Formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of\u00a0green algae,\u00a0fungi,\u00a0mosses,\u00a0horsetails, ferns,\u00a0cycads,\u00a0ginkgoes, and several families of\u00a0conifers. Animal fossils discovered include\u00a0bivalves,\u00a0snails,\u00a0ray-finned fishes,\u00a0frogs,\u00a0salamanders,\u00a0turtles,\u00a0sphenodonts,\u00a0lizards, terrestrial and aquatic\u00a0crocodylomorphans, several species of\u00a0pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early\u00a0mammals\u00a0such as\u00a0docodonts,\u00a0multituberculates,\u00a0symmetrodonts, and\u00a0triconodonts. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods\u00a0Ceratosaurus,\u00a0Ornitholestes,\u00a0Tanycolagreus, and\u00a0Torvosaurus, the\u00a0sauropods\u00a0Apatosaurus,\u00a0Brachiosaurus,\u00a0Brontosaurus,\u00a0Camarasaurus, and\u00a0Diplodocus, and the\u00a0ornithischians Camptosaurus,\u00a0Dryosaurus, and\u00a0Stegosaurus. Allosaurus\u00a0is commonly found at the same sites as\u00a0Apatosaurus,\u00a0Camarasaurus,\u00a0Diplodocus, and\u00a0Stegosaurus. The Late Jurassic formations of Portugal where\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0is present are interpreted as having been similar to the Morrison but with a stronger\u00a0marine\u00a0influence. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks (mainly\u00a0Allosaurus,\u00a0Ceratosaurus,\u00a0Torvosaurus, and\u00a0Stegosaurus), or have a close counterpart (Brachiosaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Lusotitan,\u00a0Camptosaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Draconyx). Allosaurus\u00a0coexisted with fellow large theropods\u00a0Ceratosaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Torvosaurus\u00a0in both the United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had different\u00a0ecological niches, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than\u00a0Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus\u00a0was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0pubic foot\u00a0marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably\u00a0Ceratosaurus\u00a0or\u00a0Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0was being scavenged.Gallery  Allosaurus/GalleryIn Popular Culture  Allosaurus fragilis has appeared multiple times in the famous Walking With Dinosaurs series. It was featured in the special, The Ballad of Big Al.  Allosaurus fragilis has been featured in three episodes of the History Channel series Jurassic Fight Club fighting two Ceratosaurus as three Allosaurus attack a Stegosaurus, however one gets killed as a herd of Camarasaurus come to drink the water but one gets stuck, as it gets the Allosaurus's attention. Allosaurus can also be found in the Dinosaur Digs expansion pack for the popular PC game, Zoo Tycoon. An\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0appears in the\u00a0Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u00a0official trailer, implying that it will appear in the movie. Like all of InGen's theropod clones, the Allosaurus clones has pronated hands, unlike their real-life counterparts. Allosaurus\u00a0can be created in the\u00a0Jurassic Park\u00a0section of\u00a0Jurassic Park: Builder.\u00a0John Hammond\u00a0says it is his favorite dinosaur. Allosaurus will appear in a free\u00a0Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u00a0DLC for\u00a0Jurassic World: Evolution. It looks almost exactly as the one in\u00a0Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, although the only difference is that the game version has spines going down its back. Allosaurus\u00a0will be featured in\u00a0Jurassic World: Alive, based on the Fallen Kingdom dinosaur. Allosaurus\u00a0can be created in the park in\u00a0Jurassic World: The Game\u00a0as a rare dinosaur. \"Allosaurus tendagurensis\" has also been featured in the Jurassic Park park-builder sim Operation Genesis. While classified as an Allosaurus for years, the most recent analysis has placed Allosaurus tendagurensis in\u00a0Carcharodontosauridae. Allosaurus appears in the game Dino Crisis 2 as a mid-game rival and in the arena as a fighter. Allosaurus also\u00a0appears in Dinosaur King and Dinosaur Master. Allosaurus europaeus appears in Dinosaur Revolution. The main allosaur in the show has its jaw broken by the tail of a Dinheirosaurus (now synonim with Supersaurus). It also was shown to attack a Torvosaurus despite the size difference. Allosaurus fragilis appears in Planet Dinosaur where it fails on its first hunt for a Stegosaurus. It later kills a Camptosaurus, but unfortunately a Saurophaganax steals its prey. Allosaurus has only appeared in The Land Before Time VI: the Secret of Saurus Rock, where he serves as the main antagonist of the film. In the cartoon The Terrible Thunderlizards, Squat is an Allosaurus. In Power Rangers Dino Charge There is a crimson colored Allosaurus themed Dino Charger also known as the Dino Blaze Charger. The Allosaurus appears in Dino Hunter: Deadly Shores in Region 2 - Jungle Mists. It also has a Trophy Hunt variant named \"Lizard Eater\".  In Ice Age, Sid encountered an Allosaurus frozen while in a cave and was caught in fear and surprise at having run into the beast's frozen visage, replete with pointed teeth and claws. An Allosaurus appears in the movie \"The Valley of The Gwangi\" The Allosaurus is one of the tameable creatures in Ark: Survival EvolvedDinopedia Wiki Giganotosaurus Descripition  The Giganotosaurus meant \"giant southern lizard\", as the Megalosaurus was the \"giant lizard\". It had similar appearances to that of the theropods, excluding the appearances of Spinosaurus and Suchomimus.Discovery  Giganotosaurus carolinii was named for Ruben Carolini, an amateur fossil hunter, who discovered the fossils in the deposits of the Rio Limay Formation of Patagonia, southern Argentina, in 1993. It was published by Rodolfo Coria and Leonardo Selgado in the journal Nature in 1995. The holotype specimen's (MUCPv-Ch1) skeleton was about 70% complete and included the skull, pelvis, leg bones and most of the backbone. It is estimated about 6.8 tonnes (7.5 tons) in weight, 3.48 meters (11.4 feet) tall at the hips and 12.4 meters (41\u00a0ft) in length. A second specimen (MUCPv-95), was estimated at\u00a06,5\u20138% larger. This larger Giganotosaurus specimen was estimated to represent an individual 13.2\u00a0m (43\u00a0ft) long that was about 3.7 meters (12.1 feet) tall at the hips and weighed about 8.2 tonnes (9 tons). Some experts think could grow even larger, believing that it could be able to reach 14.6 meters long and weigh almost 15.5 tonnes. Giganotosaurus had the longest skull for a theropod dinosaur, with the holotype's skull estimated at 1.54 meters and the paratype skull estimated at 1.64 meters, though it could reach 1.89 meters. The most complete skeleton was housed at the Royal Ontario Museum until March 17, 2013. The Specimen (MUCPv-Ch1) is 70 percent complete and is only missing its arms and feet.Reconstructive misconceptions of the skull Paleobiology  Giganotosaurus lived in Argentina alongside giant Sauropods like\u00a0Limaysaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Andesaurus. It's closest relatives were from the same continent,\u00a0Tyrannotitan and Mapusaurus, and was also closely\u00a0related to Carcharodontosaurus in Africa. It was the descendant of Allosaurus from the Jurassic period. It had a massive skull, a long tail for extra balance to help support its massive head, fairly long and strong arms with three clawed fingers, and powerful back legs with three sharp talons on their toes. Most people speculate, considering\u00a0 the length and musculature of its legs, that Giganotosaurus could run even 50.4\u00a0km/h, much faster than Olympic Sprinters and most of all Theropods including Rex. It had over 60 8-inch (19\u00a0cm.), blade-like teeth that could very easily\u00a0 pierce and rip through its unfortunate victims' flesh. In 2005 Francois Terrier\u00a0e.a. estimated that the bite force of\u00a0Giganotosaurus\u00a0was three times less than that of\u00a0Tyrannosaurus\u00a0and that the lower jaws were optimised for inflicting slicing wounds; the point of the mandibula\u00a0was reinforced to this purpose with a \"chin\" and broadened to handle\u00a0smaller prey. The killing method of Giganotosaurus is killing by Slicing through flesh, and letting its prey bleed to death. An Extremely Brutal but effective method. Titanosaur fossils, belonging to Andesaurus and Limaysaurus, have been recovered near the remains of Giganotosaurus, leading to speculation that these carnivores may have preyed on the giant herbivores. Fossils of the related carcharodontosaurid Mapusaurus grouped closely together may indicate pack hunting, a behavior that could possibly extend to Giganotosaurus itself. The original fossils of Giganotosaurus remain at the Carmen Funes Museum in Neuquen, Argentina, but replicas are common in other places, including the Australian Museum in Sydney.In the Media  Despite having been discovered relatively recently, Giganotosaurus is already gaining a name for itself in popular culture. Giganotosaurus appears in the Walking with Dinosaurs special Land of Giants They are seen to hunt both independently and in packs, working together to bring down an Argentinosaurus. Giganotosaurus is also featured in the IMAX movie Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia where Dr. Rodolfo Coria shows the sites of major discoveries in Argentina. A Giganotosaurus also made an appearance in an episode of the ITV drama Primeval where it rampages at an airport. Giganotosaurus is a recurring dinosaur in Dino Dan: Trek's Adventures. Genetic material of\u00a0Gigantosaurus\u00a0in Jurassic World was in possession of\u00a0InGen\u00a0by the year 2014 and was used in the creation of the genetic hybrid Indominus rex. It has been confirmed that Giganotosaurus appears in Jurassic World: Evolution. It also appeared in Dino Crisis 2 at an exaggerated size and inaccurately shown to throw an adult Tyrannosaurus. Giganotosaurus\u00a0was featured in some concept art for\u00a0Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. However, Colin Trevorrow confirmed there was no plans for it to be added into the final cut. Giganotosaurus makes an appearance in Turok, where it only appears in the Death Valley, although its actual species was not identified in the game. Although it is similar to Mama Scarface (a Tyrannosaurus in the game) in regards to behavior and sounds, it has noticeable differences, such as it does not have any scars on its face and has three fingered arms like its real counterpart. The Giganotosaurus in the game. Giganotosaurus is shorter and leaner than Mama Scarface, but is possibly longer in terms of length. Giganotosaurus appears in Prehistoric Monsters Revealed. One of the forms of the Predacon named Magmatron is a purple Giganotosaurus. Giganotosaurus appears in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island as the film's main antagonist. It is inaccurately portrayed as having plates on its back. It is referred to as a \"Plated Sharptooth\". Giganotosaurus\u00a0appeared in the 2008 movie\u00a0Journey to the Center of the Earth. Giganotosaurus\u00a0appeared in the Japanese animated film You Are Umasou, but only in a flashback scene. Giganotosaurus is featured as an apex tier carnivore of the bleeder branch in The Isle Giganotosaurus was featured in Jurassic World: The Game. However, it is inaccurately shown with pronated wrists and has two fingers on each hand whereas in real life, it has three fingers on each hand. This dinosaur depicted noticably inaccurate; and, is one of the most difficult creatures to tame in Ark: Survival Evolved Giganotosaurus appeard as a skeleton in Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.Gallery  Giganotosaurus/GalleryDinopedia Wiki Stegosaurus  Stegosaurus (steg\u00b7o\u00b7saur\u00b7us) (pronounced \u02ccst\u025bg\u0259\u02c8s\u0254r\u0259s) is a genus of stegosaurid armoured dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period (late Kimmeridgian to Early Tithonian) in what is now western North America. In 2006, a specimen of Stegosaurus was announced from Portugal, showing that they were present in Europe as well. Due to its distinctive tail spikes and plates, Stegosaurus is one of the most recognizable dinosaurs, along with Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Apatosaurus. The name Stegosaurus means \"roof-lizard\" and is derived from the Greek stegos/\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2-, (\"roof\") and sauros/\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, (\"lizard\"). At least three species have been identified in the upper Morrison Formation and are known from the remains of about 80 individuals. They lived some 150 to 145\u00a0million years ago, in an environment and time dominated by the giant sauropods Diplodocus, Camarasaurus, and Apatosaurus. A large, heavily built, herbivorous quadruped, Stegosaurus had a distinctive and unusual posture, with a heavily arched back, short forelimbs, head held low to the ground and a stiffened tail held high in the air. Its array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation. The spikes were most likely used for defense, while the plates have also been proposed as a defensive mechanism, as well as having display and thermoregulatory (heat control) functions. Stegosaurus was the largest of all the stegosaurians (bigger than genera such as Kentrosaurus and Huayangosaurus) and, although roughly bus-sized, it nonetheless shared many anatomical features (including the tail spines and recognizable plates) with the other stegosaurian genera.Description  Averaging around 9\u00a0metres (30\u00a0ft) long and 4\u00a0metres (13\u00a0ft) tall, the quadrupedal Stegosaurus is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaurs, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along its arched back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of its tail. Although a large animal, it was dwarfed by its contemporaries the giant sauropods. Some form of armour appears to have been necessary, as it coexisted with large predatory theropod dinosaurs, such as the fearsome Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus it was discovered in Colorado and Wyoming u.s.a and Portugal in Europe. The hind feet each had three short toes, while each forefoot had five toes; only the inner two toes had a blunt hoof. All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes. The forelimbs were much shorter than the stocky hindlimbs, which resulted in an unusual posture. The tail appears to have been held well clear of the ground, while the head of Stegosaurus was positioned relatively low down, probably no higher than 1\u00a0metre (3.3\u00a0ft) above the ground. The long and narrow skull was small in proportion to the body. It had a small antorbital fenestra, the hole between the nose and eye common to most archosaurs, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's low position suggests that Stegosaurus may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their replacement by a horny beak or rhamphotheca. Stegosaurian teeth were small, triangular and flat wear facets show that they did grind their food. The inset placement in the jaws suggests that Stegosaurus had cheeks to keep food in their mouths while they chewed. Despite the animal's overall size, the braincase of Stegosaurus was small, being no larger than that of a dog. A well preserved Stegosaurus braincase allowed Othniel Charles Marsh to obtain in the 1880s a cast of the brain cavity or endocast of the animal, which gave an indication of the brain size. The endocast showed that the brain was indeed very small, maybe the smallest among the dinosaurs. The fact that an animal weighing over 4.5\u00a0tonnes (5\u00a0US short tons) could have a brain of no more than 80\u00a0grams (2.8\u00a0oz) contributed to the popular old idea that dinosaurs were unintelligent, an idea now largely rejected. Most of the information known about Stegosaurus comes from the remains of mature animals; however more recently juvenile remains of Stegosaurus have been found. One sub-adult specimen, discovered in 1994 in Wyoming, is 4.6\u00a0metres (15\u00a0ft) long and 2\u00a0metres (7\u00a0ft) high, and is estimated to have weighed 2.3\u00a0tonnes (2.6\u00a0short tons) while alive. It is on display in the University of Wyoming Geological Museum. Even smaller skeletons, 210\u00a0centimetres (6.9\u00a0ft) long and 80\u00a0centimetres (2.6\u00a0ft) tall at the back, are on display at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science.Classification  Stegosaurus was the first-named genus of the family Stegosauridae. It is the type genus that gives its name to the family. Stegosauridae is one of two families within the infraorder Stegosauria, with the other being Huayangosauridae. Stegosauria lies within the Thyreophora, or armoured dinosaurs, a suborder which also includes the more diverse ankylosaurs. The stegosaurs were a clade of animals similar in appearance, posture and shape that mainly differed in their array of spikes and plates. Among the closest relatives to Stegosaurus are Wuerhosaurus from China and Kentrosaurus from east Africa.Origins  The origin of Stegosaurus is uncertain, as few remains of basal stegosaurs and their ancestors are known. Recently, stegosaurids have been shown to be present in the lower Morrison Formation, existing several million years before the occurrence of Stegosaurus itself, with the discovery of the related Hesperosaurus from the early Kimmeridgian. The earliest stegosaurid (the genus Lexovisaurus) is known from the Oxford Clay Formation of England and France, giving it an age of early to middle. Callovian. The earlier and more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 million years ago) predates Stegosaurus by 20 million years and is the only genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is Scelidosaurus, from Early Jurassic England, which lived approximately 190\u00a0million years ago. Interestingly, it possessed features of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona in the USA was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly-armoured dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armoured dinosaur, from around 195 million years ago, has been found in France.History Discovery and species  Stegosaurus, one of the many dinosaurs first collected and described in the Bone Wars, was originally named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877, from remains recovered north of Morrison, Colorado. These first bones became the holotype of Stegosaurus armatus. The basis for its scientific name, 'roof(ed) lizard' has been thought to have been Marsh's initial belief that the plates lay flat over the animal's back, overlapping like the shingles (tiles) on a roof. A wealth of Stegosaurus material was recovered over the next few years and Marsh published several papers on the genus. Initially, several species were described. However, many of these have since been considered to be invalid or synonymous with existing species, leaving two well-known and one poorly-known species.Valid species  Stegosaurus armatus, meaning \"armoured roof lizard\", was the first species to be found and is known from two partial skeletons, two partial skulls and at least thirty fragmentary individuals. This species had four horizontal tail spikes and relatively small plates. At 9\u00a0metres (30\u00a0ft), it was the longest species within the genus Stegosaurus. Stegosaurus stenops, meaning \"narrow-faced roof lizard\", was named by Marsh in 1887, with the holotype having been collected by Marshal Felch at Garden Park, north of Ca\u00f1on City, Colorado, in 1886. This is the best-known species of Stegosaurus, mainly because its remains include at least one complete articulated skeleton. It had large, broad plates and four tail spikes. Stegosaurus stenops is known from at least 50\u00a0partial skeletons of adults and juveniles, one complete skull and four partial skulls. It was shorter than S. armatus, at 7\u00a0metres (23\u00a0ft). Stegosaurus longispinus, meaning \"long-spined roof lizard\", was named by Charles W. Gilmore and known from one partial skeleton, from the Morrison Formation in Wyoming. Stegosaurus longispinus was notable for its set of four unusually long tail spines. Some consider it a species of Kentrosaurus. Like S. stenops, it grew to 7\u00a0metres (23\u00a0ft) in length.Nomina dubia (dubious names)  Stegosaurus ungulatus, meaning \"hoofed roof lizard\", was named by Marsh in 1879, from remains recovered at Como Bluff, Wyoming. It is known from a few vertebrae and armour plates. It might be a juvenile form of S. armatus, although the original material of S. armatus is yet to be fully described. The specimen discovered in Portugal and dating from the upper Kimmeridgian-lower Tithonian stage has been ascribed to this species. Stegosaurus sulcatus, meaning \"furrowed roof lizard\" was described by Marsh in 1887 based on a partial skeleton. It is considered a synonym of S. armatus.Stegosaurus duplex, meaning \"two plexus roof lizard\" (in allusion to the greatly enlarged neural canal of the sacrum which Marsh characterized as a \"posterior brain case\"), is probably the same as S. armatus. Although named by Marsh in 1887 (including the holotype specimen), the disarticulated bones were actually collected in 1879 by Edward Ashley at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Stegosaurus seeleyanus, originally named Hypsirophus, is probably the same as S. armatus. Stegosaurus (Diracodon) laticeps was described by Marsh in 1881, from some jawbone fragments. Just as some consider S. stenops a species of Diracodon, others consider Diracodon itself to be a species of Stegosaurus. Bakker had resurrected D. laticeps in 1986, although others note that the material is non-diagnostic and likely synonymous with S. stenops. Stegosaurus affinis, described by Marsh in 1881, is only known from a pubis and is considered a nomen dubium. It is possibly synonymous with S. armatus.Reassigned species  Stegosaurus madagascariensis from Madagascar is known solely from teeth and was described by Piveteau in 1926. The teeth were variously attributed to a stegosaur, the theropod Majungasaurus, a hadrosaur or even a crocodylian. Other remains originally attributed to Stegosaurus are now considered to belong to different genera. This is the case for Stegosaurus marshi, which was described by Lucas in 1901. It was renamed Hoplitosaurus in 1902. Stegosaurus priscus, described by Nopcsa in 1911, was reassigned to Lexovisaurus, and is now the type species of Loricatosaurus. Stegosaurus was the largest stegosaur, reaching up to 12\u00a0meters (39\u00a0ft) in length and possibly weighing up to 5,000\u00a0kilograms (5.5\u00a0short tons). However, 7 to 9\u00a0metres was a more usual length. Soon after its discovery, Marsh considered Stegosaurus to have been bipedal, due to its short forelimbs. He had changed his mind however, by 1891, after considering the heavy build of the animal. Although Stegosaurus is undoubtedly now considered to have been quadrupedal, there has been some discussion over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. Stegosaurus did have very short forelimbs, in relation to its hind legs. Furthermore, within the hindlimbs, the lower section (comprising the tibia and fibula) was short compared with the femur. This suggests that it couldn't walk very fast, as the stride of the back legs at speed would have overtaken the front legs, giving a maximum speed of 6\u20137 kilometres per hour (4\u20135\u00a0mi/hr).\"Second brain\"  Soon after describing Stegosaurus, Marsh noted a large canal in the hip region of the spinal cord, which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 times larger than the brain. This has led to the famous idea that dinosaurs like Stegosaurus had a 'second brain' in the tail, which may have been responsible for controlling reflexes in the rear portion of the body. It has also been suggested that this \"brain\" might have given a Stegosaurus a temporary boost when it was under threat from predators. More recently, it has been argued that this space (also found in sauropods) may have been the location of a glycogen body, a structure in living birds whose function is not definitely known but which is postulated to facilitate the supply of glycogen to the animal's nervous system.Plates  The most recognizable features of Stegosaurus are its dermal plates, which consisted of 17 separate flat plates. These were highly modified osteoderms (bony-cored scales), similar to those seen in crocodiles and many lizards today. They were not directly attached to the animal's skeleton, instead arising from the skin. In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, have speculated the plates may have been mobile to some degree, although others disagree. Bakker suggested that the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip from one side to another in order to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. The largest plates were found over the animal's hips and measured 60\u00a0centimetres (2\u00a0ft) wide and 60\u00a0centimetres tall. The arrangement of the plates has long been a subject of debate but most palaeontologists now agree that they formed a pair of alternating rows, one running down each side of the midline of the animal's back. The function of the plates has been much debated. Initially thought of as some form of armour, they appear to have been too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected. More recently, researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal, in a similar way to the sails of the large carnivorous Spinosaurus or of the pelycosaur Dimetrodon (and the ears of modern elephants and jackrabbits). The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood. This theory has been seriously questioned, since the closest relative to the common plate-wielding species, Stegosaurus stenops, had low surface area spikes instead of plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Their large size suggests that the plates may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal, in order either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species, in some form of sexual display, although both male and female specimens seemed to have had them. A study published in 2005 supports the idea of their use in identification. Researchers believe this may be the function of other unique anatomical features, found in various dinosaur species.Stegosaurus stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips. One of the major subjects of books and articles about Stegosaurus is the plate arrangement. The argument has been a major one in the history of dinosaur reconstruction. Four possible plate arrangements have been mooted over the years:Thagomizer (tail spikes)  There has been debate about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more flexible than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, that movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hindlimbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short forelimbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, confirms the spikes were indeed used in combat. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of Allosaurus into which a tail spike fit perfectly. Stegosaurus stenops had four dermal spikes, each about 60\u201390\u00a0centimetres (2\u20133\u00a0ft) long. Discoveries of articulated stegosaur armour show that, at least in some species, these spikes protruded horizontally from the tail, not vertically as is often depicted. Initially, Marsh described S. armatus as having eight spikes in its tail, unlike S. stenops. However, recent research re-examined this and concluded this species also had four.Diet  Stegosaurus and related genera were herbivores. However, they adopted a feeding strategy different from that of the other herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. they could chew plants). This contrasts with Stegosaurus (and all stegosaurians), which had small teeth having horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact and a jaw probably capable of only orthal movements. The stegosaurians must have been successful, as they became speciose and geographically widely distributed, in the late Jurassic. Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads and conifers or fruits and swallowed gastroliths to aid food processing (due to the lack of chewing ability), in the same manner used by modern birds and crocodiles. Low-level browsing on grasses, seen in modern mammalian herbivores, would not have been possible for Stegosaurus, as grasses did not evolve until late into the Cretaceous Period, long after Stegosaurus had become extinct. One hypothesised feeding behaviour strategy considers them to be low-level browsers, eating low-growing fruit of various non-flowering plants, as well as foliage. This scenario has Stegosaurus foraging at most one metre above the ground. On the other hand, if Stegosaurus could have raised itself on two legs, as suggested by Bakker, then it could have browsed on vegetation and fruits quite high up, with adults being able to forage up to 6\u00a0metres (20\u00a0ft) above the ground.Behavior  Tracks discovered by Matthew Mossbrucker of the Morrison Natural History Museum from Colorado suggest that Stegosaurus lived in multi-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing four or five baby stegosaurs moving in the same direction, while another has a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track overprinting it.Cultural Influence  Stegosaurus is among the most recognizable of dinosaurs. It has been depicted in many ways; on film, in cartoons, comics, as children's toys, and as sculpture. It even was declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado in 1982.Stegosaurus is a subject for inclusion in dinosaur toy and scale model lines, such as the Carnegie Collection. As late as the 1970s, Stegosaurus, along with other dinosaurs, was depicted in fiction as a slow-moving, dim-witted creature. The \"dinosaur renaissance\" changed the prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold-blooded and this re-evaluation has been reflected in popular media.Science  In September 2002, a hoax poster was presented at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology entitled \"The case for Stegosaurus as an agile, cursorial biped\", ostensibly by T. R. Karbek (an anagram of R. T. Bakker) from the non-existent \"Steveville Academy of Palaeontological Studies\". This was reported in New Scientist magazine, where it was remarked that Stegosaurus was generally believed to be \"about as cursorial as a fridge-freezer\".Literature  A sketch of a Stegosaurus forms an important plot point in the opening chapters of The Lost World by Arthur Conan Doyle. Although it is out of print (used copies are available on the Web), Evelyn Sibley Lampman wrote a children's book about twins who find a talking Stegosaurus on their ranch; titled \"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek\".Sculpture  Sculptor Jim Gary created several, almost-life-sized versions of Stegosaurus. One always was displayed among his traveling exhibition, Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs, and they are frequently used as an illustration of his work in books and articles about the artist because of their distinctive characteristics. One displayed for months before the electrical engineering research facility at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte during a 2005 campus-wide display of the exhibition, which was hosted by Belk College, became a mascot of sorts to students studying in nearby buildings. In the movie Howard the Duck, Howard walks under a Jim Gary Stegosaurus when a museum display of the sculptor's work is used as a set for the 1986 film, which was produced by George Lucas.Cinema  Over the years, Stegosaurus has seen its share of screen time, often pitted in battle against large carnivorous dinosaurs, in both theatres and television. It came up against Ceratosaurus in Journey to the Beginning of Time (1954), in The Animal World (1956), the documentary When Dinosaurs Roamed America (2001),and Jurassic Fight Club where it also faces Allosaurus (2008). It faced Allosaurus in episode two of \"Walking with Dinosaurs\" (1999), as well as in the special The Ballad of Big Al (2000). It was even seen pitted against Tyrannosaurus, in Planet of Dinosaurs (1978), Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940) (which was the first time use of the spike tail for defense was portrayed), and in the remake of the series Land of the Lost (1992\u201393). A baby Stegosaurus dubbed Spike is one of the lead characters in The Land Before Time (1988) and its direct-to-video sequels. In the classic monster film, King Kong (1933), the first creature that the band of rescuers meet, as they chase the abducted Fay Wray deep into Skull Island, is a roaring Stegosaurus, which charges. In the 2005 Peter Jackson remake Stegosaurus is nowhere to be seen, although in the extended edition the fictional Triceratops-like dinosaur \"Ferructus\" takes its place. A Stegosaurus also has appeared in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, as one of the first dinosaurs to be seen. They also were seen briefly in Jurassic Park III. (An ailing Stegosaurus is encountered by the characters in the novel Jurassic Park, but was replaced by a Triceratops in the film version.) Although it makes no actual appearance in the film, the name is used; it is on one of the embryo vials stolen (misspelled as 'Stegasaurus'). Stegosaurus is one of the three dinosaur species whose physical characteristics were combined by the designers at Toho, to create the Japanese monster Godzilla; the other two dinosaurs were Tyrannosaurus and Iguanodon. In the American version of King Kong vs. Godzilla this is remarked upon by a reporter, claiming Godzilla was half-Stegosaur, half-Tyrannosaur. In Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, a rib cage of a stegosaurus.Cartoons and comics  Stegosaurus has been featured in children's cartoons. The Transformers toyline and related television series features four characters which can transform into stegosaurids: Snarl, Slugfest, Saberback and Striker. In the 1980s cartoon Dinosaucers, the character Stego is an anthropomorphic Stegosaurus who while still only a trainee soldier accomplishes difficult tasks despite his inexperience. Also, Stegz was an anthropomorphic stegosaur featured in the series \"Extreme Dinosaurs\". Ironically, despite the tiny brain size of Stegosaurus, he is portrayed as the most intelligent of the characters in the show. One of the Dino Knights and Drago Clones in Dinozaurs were Dino Stego and his evil counterpart Drago Stegus. Gary Larson's The Far Side comic strip often used stegosaurs when he showed dinosaurs. The term \"Thagomizer\" originated as a joke from a Far Side comic strip, in which a group of cavemen in a lecture hall are taught by their caveman professor that the spikes were named in honor of \"the late Thag Simmons\". The implication is that the Thagomizer was responsible for Thag's death. Whatever the original word for the spiked tail of Stegosaurus was, if it ever had one, has, since the Far Side publication, been replaced by \"thagomizer\", which is used as a genuine anatomical term by many palaeontological authorities, including the Smithsonian Institution.Gallery  See Stegosaurus/GalleryReferences External links Games  Stegosaurus is featured in The Isle as a tier 4 herbivore. Stegosaurus appears in Jurassic World: The Game as a super rare herbivore.Dinopedia Wiki Carnivores  A carnivore (/\u02c8k\u0251rn\u026av\u0254\u0259r/), meaning 'meat eater' (Latin carne meaning 'flesh' and vorare meaning 'to devour'), is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are considered obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are considered facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore, or an omnivore from a facultative herbivore, for that matter. A carnivore that sits at the top of the foodchain is an apex predator. Plants that capture and digest insects are called carnivorous plants. Similarly, fungi that capture microscopic animals are often called carnivorous fungi.Dinopedia Wiki Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis  Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis is a park-building game ran by Universal Interactive and Bluetongue that is reminiscent of games like SimCity and Theme Park. The ultimate goal of the game is to \"...create the most successful theme park in the history of the world,\" which pretty much means a five-star park. Your park can earn stars by entertaining visitors, hoping that they will leave with a satisfied attitude. If they do, your park will become more popular and your park will also gain stars. The more stars and popularity, the more visitors. And so on, and so on. Keeping your visitors happy is not as easy as plopping a few dinosaurs in the middle of a field and watching them walk around. Besides having dinosaurs and their enclosures in your park, you also need to make sure your visitors are comfortable by setting up food stands (kiosks), restrooms, and souvenir stands. You can also specify different types of food and gifts to cater to your visitor's tastes. Additionally, you can build attractions which will keep your visitors amused. Attractions such as Viewing Vents, Viewing Platforms and Safari Adventure Rides should prove popular with your visitors. But most importantly, you need to make sure your visitors are safe. No one wants to visit a park where they could be eaten. To assure the safety of your visitors, you need to set up the right types of fences, build ranger stations, and also set up other security measure such as cameras and avoidance beacons. If there is an emergency, you can take charge of a helicopter or car, and rescue visitors or take out ravaging dinosaurs that have broken free of their confines. The actual building of your park is relatively easy thanks to the streamlined interface Blue Tongue has come up with. You must first determine four characteristics of your island: shape, trees, rivers, and mountains and decide how much of each you would want on your island. Mountains may make the island look more natural, but can take up space used for your park. Having more trees is useful for some species, but others like open spaces. After creating your island, the building begins. You are given an initial amount of money ($60,000) from investors to build your park with, and you have to make sure you start small so that your resources can handle the park maintenance while you earn money. You can build your park from 35 different pieces, and populate it with an initial selection of 25 dinosaurs. You can eventually earn new dinosaurs by researching Fossils and discovering new species.Dinosaurs Dinosaur List Creating Dinosaurs  The dinosaurs must be created by fossil findings or amber extraction. The main creation for dinosaurs are the fossils that are the remains with large amounts of DNA. 50 percent is required at least to create dinosaurs, a minimum of six months. 100% is two years of dinosaur life, unless it is eaten by another dinosaur. Dinosaurs can fight each other, and death duels will then occur. The dinosaurs are created by hatcheries, and each cost at least more than $1,000, and the more bigger or carnivorous, the more expensive. Dinosaurs should not die early to save money for your park.Fossil Market  Alan Grant is the chief paleontologist and the head of the Fossil Market in Jurassic Park. Henry Wu guides the purchased item fossils or bought items to the genetic lab. If you have enough money, a bright square will show you a item which you have a minimum or enough money to buy, unless it is too expensive, you cannot click on the square to purchase the fossil. Grant is the main paleontologist chief, and he sends mail to the player if anything new is found.Genetic Lab  Henry Wu created the technology of Jurassic Park's cloning ideals. He has a research team who research and immunize dinosaurs in four ways including hatchery immunization. The Genetic Lab can extract or sell an item, unless you need to sell an item automatically if your park's money is decreasing low. Dinosaur fossils sold will increase money to your park investation. The extraction of dinosaurs does not cost money.Fossil Hunt  Dinosaurs are created in the fossil hunt you have purchased. A fossil hunt team in single at one team dig site will cost you $5,000 and the opening of your park. The second fossil hunting team will cost you $10,000. The final fossil hunting team will cost $25,000 to purchase for traveling and digging. The content of your fossil hunt team are good, mediocore, poor, exhausted, and in progress. The park's global fossing hunt team has 9 sites, but you cannot unlock all sites. In the Playstation2 Console Version, only three can be unlocked. 5 sites can be unlocked in the XBox and PC Version of the game. These sites are:Cut Dinosaurs  Several dinosaurs were cut from the game, although their names can be found on a file in the games folders. Compsognathus is mostly absent due to being such a small dinosaur, and it would've been difficult to shoot using the helicopter. The dinosaurs Metriacanthosaurus and Proceratosaurus from the movie did not make an appearance in the game. Mamenchisaurus from The Lost World: Jurassic Park is absent because it would take up much more space. Pterosaurs would be too dangerous, because they could fly and kill guests. The following can be only obtainable with The Forgotten Mod. These are:Jurassic Park Operation Management Team  is based on his appearance in Jurassic Park and is renamed Harry Wu in the game. She is based on her appearance in Jurassic Park He is based on his appearance in Jurassic Park She is not based on a film or novel, but completely created by CGI. is based on his appearance in Jurassic Park.Absense of Employees from Jurassic Park  main computer-technician in the game. is replaced by Elite Sattler who is the dinosaur manager. Jane Powers aids your services, prices, and food menus in the Kiosks.Dialogue Game Cast Diseases  In the game, the dinosaurs in your park we susceptible to certain dinosaur diseases and thus you have to research cures and vaccines to protect them from harm. Dinosaurs, like all animals in captivity, with sometimes get sick. InGen dinosaurs however are more susceptible to diseases as they are born with immunity-deficiencies as a direct result of they're accelerated growth. Diseases are expensive to research, unless you save a lot of money. It is not difficult to cure a serious disease, but the more dinosaurs are infected, the more your park's popularity will decrease. Elite Sattler is the dinosaur vetenarian and dinosaur manager of the park, although in the first novel and film it was Gerry Harding. Paleo trees can make some certain herbivores sick, and species that are examined to not eat the trees are concealed. Diseases create serious problems for your park. In best case, your visitors will complain about your lack of care for your dinosaurs. In the worst case, your dinosaurs will die. Rangers are assigned the responsibility to monitor and control disease outbreaks in your park. You must make sure that your rangers have the vaccines they need to be able to control the disease outbreaks. Dinosaurs cost money, and if they die from disease, you will lost money and never gain it again. There are six known diseases in Operation Genesis - Those diseases include: and then start tick infestation starting the loss of blood, and the dinosaur will go crazy. The dinosaur then becomes paralyzed over tome. and then attack and kill everything around their area, and will die quickly without overdose.Site B  After all the missions are completed, a Site B option unlocks on the title page which allows the player to build an island without any fences or buildings for people, and no visitors are allowed. In it, the player gets to place eight hatcheries and only sixty dinosaurs. The dinosaurs will be created and live out their lives on your island. You must get the Tyrannosaurus Rex from Isla Sorna to put in Isla Nublar.Missions  There are 10 missions the player must finish to unlock Site B, and the island is John Hammond's island, Isla Nublar. The real player's island is not Isla Nublar, but a more different designed island that InGen also guides, most likely one of the Five Deaths Islands that also have the word Isla\u00a0: (1): A Picture is Worth 100 Points: Jurassic Park is accused of exhibiting fake dinosaurs!

(10): Jurassic Park Calendar: Jurassic Park tourists would like a calendar. Take pictures of dinosaurs as well again.Modding  Due to the PC files of the game, many people have found a way to mod the PC game. A modification community have released an unofficial expansion pack [1], it features carnivores fishing, raptors packing and attacking together, new terrains, and much more. Some modification communities are Modding Genesis [2], OG Paradise [3] and Jurassic Park Legacy [4]. Originally you could not add new models to the game, However with the exsistance of blender and hex editor it is now possible to edit and import new models. Examples of this include TheTohoSociety's walking with dinosaurs mod and examples of hex editor edited models include SpinoinWonderland's Mezoic Revolution ModReception  The game was received fairly well on all the platforms it was released on (PS2, PC and XBOX), praising the concept and the variety of dinosaurs and buildings available. It got a positive rating of a 7.0 from Gamespot. IGN gave a negative review for the PS2 version, stating it wasn't as good as the PC version. Many people seem to want a seqel. This demand led to the game Mesozoica.Dinopedia Wiki Alligator  A close cousin to the Crocodile.It eats meat in zoos.It is a reptile and is a good swimmer and is very agile.It lives in water such as lakes,swamps,rivers and rarely oceans. The largest alligator in prehistoric times was Deinosuchus. today alligators grow to 14\u201316 feet can grow to 21 feet the largest alligators can grow to 26 feet.Dinopedia Wiki Pliosaurs  A Pliosaur is a type of large carnivorous Marine Reptile.Dinopedia Wiki Acrocanthosaurus  Acrocanthosaurus was a very large theropod carcharodontosaurid (carnosaur)\u00a0dinosaur from North America during the Early Cretaceous Period about 112 million years ago, from the Carcharodontosauridae. It is one of the largest carnivores of said family, and also the fifth largest of North America.Discovery  In 1950, a team of scientists, led by paleontologists J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston, Jr,\u00a0was excavating in the deserts of Oklahoma when they came across very large fossilized bones and tall vertebrae. They were taken to a nearby museum and were found to belong to a new species of very large theropod dinosaur. It wasn't long afterward that it was officially named Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, or \"Atoka's high-spined lizard\", after the tall spines along its back and the area in Oklahoma where it was first found. However, it was first discovered in 1940s but hadn't gained any attention until its rediscovery a decade later. Since then, several more Acrocanthosaurus specimens have been found, and even a very well preserved fossil trackway of it chasing down a Sauroposeidon. It's been found in several states along the western half of America, including Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, Arizona, and even as far east as Maryland some specimens have been found, suggesting Acrocanthosaurus was a very successful predator. And in 2012, the pubic bones, vertebrae, and fibula of a juvenile Acrocanthosaurus were found in the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming, suggesting this theropod was the only large predator in this formation during the time of the dinosaurs.Description  Acrocanthosaurus was a large carnosaur theropod dinosaur that had a large head, many sharp teeth, strong arms, powerful back legs, and a long slender tail that balanced its body when it ran. It lived alongside the small raptor Deinonychus, some small ankylosaurs, and hunted large sauropods. Acrocanthosaurus had one feature that made it look very different from other theropods; the tall \"sail\" along its neck, back, and tail. The sail was formed by very tall spines on the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Some of these spines were over a foot tall. It may represent an evolutionary link between the Late Jurassic Allosaurus and the gigantic Early Cretaceous Carcharodontosaurus. It was one of the largest bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs, with one mounted specimen reaching a length of possibly 11.5 meters (38 feet) and an estimated weight of\u00a05.7 to 6.2\u00a0tonnes (6.3 to 6.8 tons), with an upper maximum weight of 7.25\u00a0t (7.99 tons) within the realm of possibility. Many of its vertebrae had high neural spines, though nowhere as high as those of Spinosaurus.  Scientists have debated why Acrocanthosaurus had a sail or a ridge along its back. Some think it released heat when the animal was too hot. It also may have been used for display to make the animal look bigger when it faced rivals for territories or mates. This is much like a house cat fluffing up its fur and arching its back to make itself look bigger. There are other large tall-spined dinosaurs from Europe and Africa, but scientists don't know how Acrocanthosaurus is related to them. Altispinax had spines almost three-feet tall and Spinosaurus had six foot tall spines on its back. Paleontologists have built the dinosaur from parts of three skeletons. One skeleton had a three-foot-long skull. An adult Acrocanthosaurus was about ten feet tall at the hips and weighed between three to five tons. Scientists have found footprints probably made by Acrocanthosaurus in several places in Texas. In one place, it looks like an Acrocanthosaurus stalked a large sauropod across a mud flat, possibly Sauroposeidon. When the sauropod footprints changed direction, so did those of Acrocanthosaurus. The outcome of this discovery shows that the Acrocanthosaurus' jaws were hanging onto one of the thighs of the sauropod while the it was running. The predator would then rip out a chunk of flesh and the sauropod later died of loss of blood and infection. This discovery concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was known for hunting large sauropods, something that most carnivorous theropods would never do.Popular Culture Gallery  Acrocanthosaurus/GalleryReferences  Websites: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrocanthosaurus http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/carnivorousdinosaurs/p/acrocanthosaurus.htm http://animal.discovery.com/dinosaurs/acrocanthosaurus.htm http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/acrocanthosaurus.html http://www.dinochecker.com/dinosaurs/ACROCANTHOSAURUS Documentaries: Mosters Resurrected: Great American Predator Prehistoric Dallas Prehistoric DC Books: The Audubon Society Pocket Guides Familiar Dinosaurs; by Alfred A. KnopfDinopedia Wiki Utahraptor  Utahraptor (Greek, \"Utah thief\") (u\u00b7tah\u00b7rap\u00b7tor) is a dromaeosaurid from the Barremian Stage of the Early Cretaceous, living in what is now North America. Related to Deinonychus and Velociraptor, Utahraptor is the largest dromaeosaur known to science. Utahraptor is also a member of the Dromaeosaurinae, a group of dromaeosaurids that relied heavily on their jaws to kill their prey.  Utahraptor was closely related to Dromaeosaurus, Achillobator and Dakotaraptor among others based on cladistic analysis.Physical Appearance  Utahraptor was a very large dromaeosaur, one of the biggest members of its' family. It was about 2-2.5 meters tall, 6 - 7 meters long, and weighed about 1,000 pounds /453 kg. It lived from 131 to 126 MYA during the Barremian Stage of the early cretaceous and is closely related to Achillobator and Dromaeosaurus. Its skeletal design was birdlike; with bones that were hollow, but strong. Recent fossil discoveries of more complete skeletons of Utahraptor by James Kirkland et al. paint a picture also of a dromaeosaur that was more heavily-built and stocky than the \"typical\" Deinonychus body plan generally associated with other dromaeosaurs. The legs were short and stocky, while the tail was also relatively short in comparison to that of related forms. The jaws were most unusual, with the front of the lower jaw bent forward and down in a case of convergence with the unrelated Masiakasaurus. Utahraptor and other dromaeosaurs might have had binocular vision, like that of an eagle. Its hearing was probably excellent. Scientists recently discovered that raptors in general could best hear low frequency sounds. Dromaeosaurs like Utahraptor, regardless of size, were all covered in feathers according to cladistic analysis. Though feathers from the arms were known to be true feathers in other dromaeosaurs such as Dakotaraptor and Velociraptor, the rest of the dinosaur's plumage is speculative (though fossil finds of smaller species indicate protofeathers or true feathers, In Utahraptor, the exact plumage type is not known). The feathers on the arms of young dromaeosaurids would have enabled a special type of locomotion called wing-assisted incline running, or WAIR for short. Discovered by Ken Dial, a Montana zoologist, this is a behavior used by modern birds that combines flapping the wings back and forth while running up the sides of trees. This flapping pushes the feet of the bird against the tree, allowing it to run vertically up the trunk. This indicates, but does not prove, that small dromaeosaurs lived part-time in the trees. In larger species, the wing feathers may have helped to maintain balance while attacking prey.Diet  Utahraptor\u2019s diet consisted predominantly of large herbivorous dinosaurs. In the formations where it was found (the Yellow Cat and Poison Strip members of the Cedar Mountain Formation, respectively), Utahraptor lived alongside such dinosaurs as Gastonia, Hippodraco, Cedrorestes, Iguanacolossus, Martharaptor, and Falcarius. Sauropods such as Venenosaurus and Cedarosaurus were also found here, as were other predators such as Nedcolbertia and Geminiraptor. Any one of these was a potential prey item, though the smaller animals such as Necolbertia would have been little in the way of a meal for such a predator as Utahraptor. As with all predators, Utahraptor likely targeted animals such as the infirm, weak and inexperienced. Scavenging was also probably a preferable opportunity when there was access to a carcass. Like most dromaeosaurine dromaeosaurids, Utahraptor probably relied on its jaws to kill prey more than other subfamilies of dromaeosaurs did. As a result and based on the analysis of related species like Dromaeosaurus, which included bone in its diet, Utahraptor probably had an extremely powerful bite as a result.Speed and Agility  Utahraptor was likely an ambush predator. Given its robust, stocky build and short legs, it was not particularly fast, but given that its prey was likely slower, what it lacked in speed it made up for with power and agility.Habitat  Utahraptor's habitat was a series of floodplains and open woodlands with riverine forests. The wet season was short in this habitat and the climate was semi-arid. As Utahraptor was not fast, it likely used the available cover to lie and wait for prey.Possible Social Nature  The discovery of a group of six Utahraptor including a 16-foot adult, several juveniles and a 3-foot baby indicates pack-hunting might have been a possibility in this genus. The animals in question were pursuing prey that had become mired in quicksand when they themselves were trapped, leading to their death. The fossils were later found by Dr. James Kirkland etc., and are currently being studied, though progress is currently halted on the specimen after a decade of excavation. Whether all of the\u00a0Utahraptor\u00a0individuals were mired simultaneously or were lured in one-by-one is unclear, but the answer may yet come to light once crowdfunding efforts to bring in professional excavator Scott Madsen are completed.In the Media  Utahraptor appears in the Walking with Dinosaurs series shown hunting the herbivore Iguanodon. Utahraptor makes an appearance in the 2008 video game Turok. They are most commonly a reddish color, but there are blue and green\u00a0raptors as well.\u00a0There are also grey colored Utahraptors, called Spitters, that have spines on its back and a yellow sac on its throat, and are capable of spitting acid, as well as Utahraptors that are\u00a0albino that have pale white skin. Albino raptors are only active at night or in dark places. A Utahraptor appears in Jurassic Fight Club fighting a Gastonia. It also appears in the popular PC game Zoo Tycoon 2 where it is inaccurately oversized.  In Primeval Series 1 ep 4, Helen Cutter mentions meeting a Utahraptor in the Jurassic, but in reality the dinosaur is actually from the Cretaceous. A Utahraptor is set to appear in Primeval: New World, where it fights a Pteranodon.An accurate version of Utahraptor appears in Dinosaur Revolution as a predator of Cedarosaurus. The novel Raptor Red focuses on a female Utahraptor named Red. Two panels of each\u00a0Dinosaur Comics\u00a0features a Utahraptor.

The Utahraptor appears as an anthromorphic creature in the Battlesaurs group in Toy Story That Time Forgot. Utahraptor appears in the adult science-fiction novel Primitive War and its spin-offs written by Ethan Pettus. In this novel, Utahraptor serves as the primary dinosaur antagonist, and they are depicted as being intelligent, having green, brown, and black feathers to blend in with the undergrowth, and can camouflage themselves as bushes and trees to sneak up on their prey before killing it in a gruesome fashion by eviscerating them. These and many other dinosaurs appear in the human era in Vietnam after a Soviet device called the \"Collider\" accidentally opens wormholes into multiple time periods, bringing forth a huge pack of Utahraptors to the years of the Vietnam War. The Utahraptors ultimately begin replacing the native predators in the valley surrounding the Soviet base, as well as developing a taste for human flesh. Throughout the novel, they pursue the main characters, the soldiers of Vulture Squad, and manage to wound or kill three members of the unit as well as most of the main human antagonists. Eventually, after the Collider is destroyed, the remaining members of Vulture Squadron, reformed into Stalker Squadron, begin to hunt the Utahraptors, only to have them escape the fenced-off valley created by the U.S. Military that keeps the dinosaurs contained.Gallery  Utahraptor/GalleryDinopedia Wiki Ankylosaurus  Ankylosaurus was a late Cretaceous ankylosaur. It was the size of an elephant. It lived alongside carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus rex but like all ankylosaurs it was not in any danger from them due to its armored back - which no carnivore would be able to bite through - and a tail club, which could mortally injure a T. rex.Description  Compared with modern land animals the adult Ankylosaurus was very large. Some scientists have estimated a length of 11 meters (36\u00a0ft). Another reconstruction suggests a much smaller size, at 6.25\u00a0m (20.5\u00a0ft) long, up to 1.5\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) wide and about 1.7\u00a0m (5.5\u00a0ft) high at the hip.Ankylosaurus may have weighed over 6,000 kilograms (13,000\u00a0lb), making it one of the heaviest armored dinosaurs yet discovered. The body shape was low-slung and quite wide. It was quadrupedal, with the hind limbs longer than the forelimbs. Although its feet are still unknown, comparisons with other ankylosaurids suggest Ankylosaurus probably had five toes on each foot. The skull was low and triangular in shape, wider than it was long. The largest known skull measures 64.5 centimeters (25\u00a0in) long and 74.5\u00a0cm (29\u00a0in) wide. Their teeth were weaker than ceratopsid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs of the time, so they probably chewed very little.Armor  The armor of Ankylosaurus was made of huge knobs and plates of bone, known as osteoderms or scutes, embedded in the skin. Osteoderms are also found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The bone may have been covered by a tough, horny layer of keratin. These osteoderms ranged in size, from wide, flat plates to small, round nodules. The plates were lined up in regular horizontal rows down the animal's neck, back, and hips, with the many smaller nodules protecting the areas between the large plates. Smaller plates may have been on the limbs and tail. Compared to the slightly more ancient ankylosaurid Euoplocephalus, the plates of Ankylosaurus were smooth in texture, without the high keels found on the armor of the coexisting nodosaurid Edmontonia. A row of flat, triangular spikes may have stuck out sideways along each side of the tail. Tough, rounded scales protected the top of the skull, while four horns were behind the eyes and the ends of the mouth.Tail club  Classification Ankylosaurus was named as the type genus of the family Ankylosauridae. Ankylosaurids are members of the larger taxon Ankylosauria, which also contains the nodosaurids. Ankylosaur phylogeny is a heated topic, with several mutually exclusive studies given in recent years, so the exact position of Ankylosaurus within Ankylosauridae is unknown. Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus are often thought to be sister taxa. However, other studies have found these genera in different positions. Further discoveries or research may clear up the situation.History  Ankylosaurus was named by American paleontologist Barnum Brown, in 1908. The name comes from the Greek words \u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2/ankulos ('curved') and \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2/sauros ('lizard'). Brown intended this name in the same sense as the medical term ankylosis, to refer to the stiffness \u00a0from the fusion of many bones in the skull and body, so the name is often translated as 'stiffened lizard.' The type species is A. magniventris, from the Latin magnus ('great') and venter ('belly'), referring to the great width of the animal's body.Paleobiology  Ankylosaurus magniventris lived between 66.5 to 65.5 million years ago, in the final Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, and was one of the last dinosaur species that appeared before the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. The type specimen is from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, while other specimens have been found in the Lance Formation of Wyoming and the Scollard Formation in Alberta, Canada, all of which date to the end of the Cretaceous. The Lance, Hell Creek and Scollard Formations represent different sections of the western shore of the shallow that divided western and eastern North America during the Cretaceous. They represent a broad coastal plain, extending westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone, which have been attributed to floodplain environments. The Hell Creek is the best studied of these ancient environments. At the time, this region was subtropical, with a warm and humid climate. Many plant species were supported, primarily angiosperms, with less common conifers, ferns and cycads. An abundance of fossil leaves found at dozens of different sites indicates that the area was largely forested by small trees.Ankylosaurus shared its environment with dinosaurs including the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus. Fossils of Ankylosaurus are quite rare in these grounds, compared to Edmontosaurus and the super-abundant Triceratops, which make up most of the large herbivore fauna. Another ankylosaur, Edmontonia, is also found in the same formations. However, Ankylosaurus and Edmontonia seem to have been separated both geographically and ecologically. Ankylosaurus had a wide muzzle, perhaps used for non-selective grazing and thus may have been limited to the upland regions, away from the coast, while Edmontonia had a narrower muzzle, indicating a more selective diet, and seems to have lived at lower elevations, closer to the coast.In the media Gallery  Ankylosaurus/Gallery Template:Good ArticleReferences Dinopedia Wiki Dunkleosteus  Dunkleosteus was a large Placoderm\u00a0(arthropod fish) that lived in the late Devonian period, about 380\u2013360 million years ago. It grew to 10 metres (33 feet), and was the top predator of its time and one of the top predators of the Paleozoic era.Description  Dunkelosteus belongs to the Placodermi, a family of armour-plated fishes. More precisely, it was an arthodire - one of the more advanced members of the placoderm fish. Dunkelosteus was probably the largest member of the placoderms, and the largest animal up to that time, which would stay that way until the evolution of the dinosaurs. The Placodermi first started appearing in the Silurian, and all of them were extinct by the late Devonian. There are no modern descendants. Dunkleosteus had one of\u00a0the most powerful bite of any fish, well ahead of all modern-day\u00a0sharks, including the Great White shark.  Dunkleosteus could concentrate a force of up to 8,000 pounds (3,628\u00a0kg) per square inch at the tip of its mouth, effectively placing Dunkleosteus in the league of Tyrannosaurus rex and modern crocodiles as having the most powerful known bite. Dunkleosteus could also open its mouth in one-fiftieth of a second, which would have caused a powerful suction that pulled the prey into its mouth, a food-capture technique reinvented by many of the most advanced teleost fishes today. Due to its heavily armoured nature, Dunkleosteus was likely a relatively slow (albeit powerful) swimmer. By Devonian standards, Dunkleosteus was one of the most highly evolved animals. It was one of the earliest jawed fishes. Instead of actual teeth, Dunkleosteus possessed two long, bony blades that were extensions of its jaw that could slice through flesh and snap and crush bones and almost anything else. It was a vicious, gluttonous hunter, and probably ate whatever hapless creature it could overpower. The discovery of Dunkleosteus armor with unhealed bite marks strongly suggest that they cannibalized each other when the opportunity arose. Frequently, fossils of Dunkleosteus are found with boluses of fish bones, semi-digested and partially eaten remains of other fish. As a result, the fossil record indicates that it may have routinely regurgitated prey bones rather than digesting them.  Cladoselache did not prey on Dunkleosteus, it was the other way around. It is commonly thought, and commonly said that placoderms, such as Dunkleosteus, were outcompeted by the smaller, swifter fishes, such as the early shark Cladoselache. However, this assessment fails to take into account that predatory placoderms would have inhabited different ecological niches than the early sharks during the Devonian period. As such, claiming that Cladoselache was a more efficient predatory fish than Dunkleosteus because the former was apparently faster than the latter would be akin to saying that the orca is a superior marine predator than the swordfish because orcas have teeth. Dunkleosteus may have also been one of the first animals to internalize egg fertilization, and thus sexually reproduce in the manner that most mammals do today. Although Placoderms only existed for 50 million years, their mark on the fossil record is quite visible. They were a pioneer in the later scenes of the Paleozoic, and were vital to the success of the vertebrates. The Placoderms died out in the late Devonian for reasons that are still not well understood. Dunkleosteus remains have been found in late Devonian strata in Morocco, Belgium, Poland, and North America.Mouth  Dunkleosteus may have had a skin covering its teeth making it reassemble a beluga.Popular culture References  http://www.livescience.com/1161-prehistoric-fish-powerful-jaws.htmlDinopedia Wiki Dilophosaurus  Dilophosaurus (DI\u00b7loaf\u00b7o\u00b7SORE\u00b7us) (Greek, \"double crested lizard\") was the very first large carnivorous dinosaur of North America. It is distinctly known from its two famous crests rounding above its skull. Its fossils were uncovered in Southwestern US and possibly China. Although primitive in the terms of Tyrannosaurus rex or Allosaurus, it was actually a very advanced predator at its time, (the early Jurassic time period).Description  Dilophosaurus measured around 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) long and may have weighed half a ton. Fossils of the animal have been found at the Navajo Indian Reservation, just west of Tuba City, Arizona, USA and in the Kayenta Formation. Just a few tens of feet below the level of the bones, large footprints of carnivorous dinosaurs were found and these may belong to Dilophosaurus. It lived in the Early Jurassic Period, from the Sinemurian to the Pliensbachian stages (193-183 million years ago), and was more primitive than later carnivores of the Jurassic, such as Ceratosaurus or Allosaurus. The original description was published in 1954, by the renowned paleontologist Samuel Welles. However, at the time, it was thought to be another genus of theropod (Megalosaurus). In 1970, it was recognized to be distinct and given its own generic name Dilophosaurus. Welles later redescribed the entire taxon in 1984, in a more comprehensive paper. Dilophosaurus may be a primitive member of the clade containing both ceratosaurian and tetanuran theropods. Alternatively, some paleontologists classify this genus as a large coelophysoid. Recent Dilophosaurus 'skin imprints', associated with a set of footprints, seemed to suggest that it had feathers but further study revealed these to be impressions of plant material. Footprints of a Dilophosaurus-like predator have been discovered in the Lavini di Marco area, near Rovereto (Trentino, northern Italy). Meanehile the Dilophosaurus true diet is unknown; it is assumed that the animal had probably a mixed diet of both terrestrial and aquatic prey; similiar to spinosaurids, as its speculated to be large enough to hunt large prosauropods as well as smaller dinosaurs including the local species of coelophysis (C. kayentakae) and Sarahsaurus. Latest research also concluded the possiblity of fish-hunting on rivers and delta's.Skull and Crests  The most distinctive characteristic of Dilophosaurus was the pair of rounded crests on its skull, probably used for display. Studies by Rob Gay (2001) show that these crests may have been larger in one sex than in the other. Another curious skull feature was a notch behind the first row of teeth, giving it an almost crocodile-like appearance. This \"notch\" existed by virtue of a weak connection between the premaxillary and maxillary bones of the skull. This conformation led to the early hypothesis that Dilophosaurus scavenged off dead carcasses, with the front teeth being too weak to bring down and hold large prey. A similar notch is present in most other species of coelophysoid. \ufeffSpecies  There is another species of Dilophosaurus (D. sinensis), which may or may not belong to this genus. It is possibly closer to the bizarre Antarctic theropod Cryolophosaurus, based on the fact that the anterior end of the jugal does not participate in the internal antorbital fenestra and that the maxillary tooth row is completely in front of the orbit and ends anterior to the vertical strut of the lacrimal. This species was recovered from the Yunnan Province of China in 1987, with the prosauropod Yunnanosaurus and later described and named in 1993 by Shaojin Hu.Popular Culture  Jurassic Park merchandise, including toys and video games (such as Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, Jurassic World: Evolution and the arcade games The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III), often include Dilophosaurus.Videos Gallery  Dilophosaurus/Gallery  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundDinopedia Wiki Albertosaurus  Albertosaurus (/\u00e6l\u02ccb\u025c\u02d0rt\u0259\u02c8s\u0254\u02d0r\u0259s/; meaning \"Alberta lizard\") is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western North America during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70 million years ago. The type species, A. sarcophagus, was apparently restricted in range to the modern-day Canadian province of Alberta, after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing Gorgosaurus libratus as a second species.Description  Albertosaurus was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Typical Albertosaurus adults measured up to 9 m (30 ft) long, while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over 10 metres (33 feet) long. Several independent mass estimates, obtained by different methods, suggest that an adult Albertosaurus weighed between 1.3 tonnes and 1.7 tonnes (1.9 tons). Albertosaurus shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids. Typically for a theropod, Albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and torso with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit, called the hallux, was short and did not reach the ground. The third digit was longer than the rest. Albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14\u221221 km/hour (8\u221213 mi/hour).At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible. Two skin impressions from Albertosaurus are known, both showing scales. One patch is found with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long, unknown bone, indicating that the patch is from the belly. The scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape. Also preserved are two larger feature scales, placed 4,5 cm apart from each other. Another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body. These scales are small, diamond-shaped and arranged in rows.History  Although the small flesh-eating dinosaurs were diverse and dangerous, Cretaceous Alberta was ruled by members of the family tyrannosauridae.\u00a0 All tyrannosaurs had hind legs that were long and powerful, with each hind foot having three toes ending in enormous claws. The two-fingered front limbs were small, not much larger than a mature human arm. The function of the front limbs is not known. Albertosaurus, the \"lizard from Alberta,\" was among the most fearsome predators in Cretaceous Alberta. 9 meters long and 3 meters high at the hip, it was the most common of the large carnivores found here. Smaller but longer-limbed than T. rex, Albertosaurus would have been a mobile hunter. Like modern carnivores, it probably fed on the carcasses of already dead animals as well. Albertosaurus weighed up to 3 tons yet may have been capable of attaining speeds of more than 40\u00a0mph. This fleetness, combined with obvious physical strength, would have made Albertosaurus a fierce hunter, but less than the more massive T. rex. Albertosaurus neck was strong and muscular, supporting a large but lightly built head. The teeth were long and recurved with saw-like edges, perfect for tearing flesh. They were not adapted for chewing, making it likely than Albertosaurus swallowed flesh in large chunks. Albertosaurus bones were among the earliest dinosaur remains collected in Alberta. A skull found by J.B. Tyrrell in 1884 was the first important dinosaur fossil to be discovered along the Red Deer River. It was named in 1905, the same year that Alberta became a province. Since then, ma ny Albertosaurus fossils have been discovered. the smallest documented Albertosaurus, a juvenile less than a quarter of the size of a full grown adult, was collected from Sandy Point on the South Saskatchewan River in 1986. [1] J.B. Tyrrell spent most of his long career as a geologist, explorer and entrepreneur on the Canadian Shield. However, in 1884 his first field work was in Cretaceous strata along the Red Deer River where his discovery of a skull of the tyrannosaur Albertosaurus provided a name to the paleontological museum in Drumheller. At the time, several discoveries were made to what was 10 Albetosaurus species (Gorgosaurus, Deinodon, Tarbosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Dryptosaurus, Dinotyrannus/Tyrannosaurus)\u00a0; including the Nanotyrannus, Jane, by courtesy of von Huene, Riabinin, and most noticeably Gilmore, Matthew, Kuhn, Paul and Russell. But recent research proved that the other species were sperate genus, and there being only one genus of Albertosaurus.In the media Gallery  Albertosaurus/GalleryReferences  General Information Credits to \"ROMTECH\" Computer CD Dinosaur Discovery History credits to http://www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/history/dinosaurs/datafiles/albertosaurus.html and http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/paleochron/31_e.php http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertosaurus http://animals.howstuffworks.com/dinosaurs/albertosaurus.htm http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/albertosaurus.html http://archaeology.knoji.com/albertosaurus-the-tyrants-cretaceous-cousin/ http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Albertosaurus http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/dinos/Albertosaurus.shtml Documentaries: Jurassic Fight Club March of the Dinosaurs Dino Gangs Prehistoric ParkDinopedia Wiki Carcharodontosaurus  Carcharodontosaurus (car\u00b7char\u00b7o\u00b7don\u00b7to\u00b7saur\u00b7us) (meaning, sharp/jagged tooth lizard) was one of the largest theropod carnivores alongside\u00a0Saurophaganax and Bahariasaurus; that are larger than well known theropods like Allosaurus & Tyrannosaurus; althrought possibly smaller than\u00a0Spinosaurus and Giganotosaurus. It was likely the second largest of the carcharodontosaurid theropod family, and it lived in North Africa. C. saharicus grew to be about 12\u201313.3 meters (39\u201344 feet)\u00a0long, about 4-4.5 meters (12.9-14.7 feet) tall at the hips and about 7.2-8 tonnes (8-8.8 tons) in weight.  Paleontologists once thought that Carcharodontosaurus had the longest skull of any of the theropod dinosaurs. However, the premaxilla and quadrate bones were missing from the original African skull, which led to misinterpretation of its actual size by researchers. A more modest length of five feet, three inches (1.6 meters) has now been proposed. Thus, the honor of the largest theropod skull is now in question. Carcharodontosaurus fossils were first found by Charles Dep\u00e9ret and J. Savornin in North America in 1756. Originally called Megalosaurus saharicus, its name was changed in 1831 by Ernst Stromer ven Reichenbach to that used today. These first fossils of Carcharodontosaurus were destroyed during World War II In an allied fighter bombing raid who destroyed the museum and every last piece of Carcharodontosaurus. However, cranial material from a Carcharodontosaurus was again discovered in North Africa in 1405 by paleontologist Paul Sereno. Stephen Brusatte and Paul Sereno (2005) reported a second species of Carcharodontosaurus differing from C. saharicus in some aspects of the maxilla and braincase. The new species, which was discovered in Niger, is called C.iguidensis\u00a0but recently new studies have brought to light that this dinosaur was a chimera.Description  Carcharodontosaurus was a carnivore, with enormous jaws and long, serrated teeth up to eight inches long. It probably ate in packs like its little bit smaller cousin Allosaurus, but no fossil evidence of this exists. It may have been a scavenger as well as an active predator. It had a large head with over 60 8-inch (20 cm.), blade-like teeth, which were designed to pierce and tear apart the flesh of its prey, which mostly consisted of the large sauropod Paralititan and a hadrosaur called Ouranosaurus. Its arms were somewhat short, but still longer than T. rex's and were quite strong. They had three claws on each of its fingers, which could've been used to get a better grab and perhaps even used to kill some of its smaller prey. The documentary known as BBC Earth's Planet Dinosaur shows a logical scenerio as Carcharodontosaurus being both an active predator and a scavenger; one such case is when a hungry Carcharodontosaurus have to\u00a0scavenge the corpse of an Ouranosaurus.\u00a0 Carcharodontosaurus had long, muscular legs, and fossilized trackways indicate that it could run about 20 miles per hour, although there is some controversy as to whether it actually did, because of its huge body mass. The brain endocast and inner ear anatomy of Carcharodontosaurus saharicus resembled modern crocodilians (Larsson, 2001). The size of the cerebrum relative to the total brain was similar to modern non-avian reptiles, but small relative to coelurosaurian theropods and birds. Ongoing discoveries and research by scientists will certainly shed further light on the physiology, behavior, and environmental circumstances and interactions of Carcharodontosaurus. The portion of the brain involving smell is quite large in Carcharodontosaurus, suggesting a good sense of smell, probably even better than today's dogs and rivaling the Tyrannosaurus. We've also found that its hearing was also quite keen, however, its sight was slightly limited because of the fact that its eyes were on the side of its head instead of straight forward like modern-day lions, dogs, or humans, as a fossil study shows.Environment  Carcharodontosaurus lived in what is now southern Africa from 105 to 94 million years ago. South America had likely just broken apart from Africa during that time, and it's probably why Carcharodontosaurus and its relatives from South America are so alike in appearance. Its environment was likely very warm and humid, with many rivers and lakes flowing through, considering Spinosaurus and Sarcosuchus (both aquatic/semi-aquatic predators) have been found in the same location. Although dry and barren now, North Africa was likely very lush and full of life, including several rainforests. The elevation was flat, and there were many marches and plains around. Carcharodontosaurus shared this lush habitat with prey items like the sailed hadrosaur Ouranosaurus and huge sauropods like Paralititan. Although it was likely top-predator in the area, Carcharodontosaurus was probably very territorial and had large areas of territory, which would likely have to fight for against rivals and other huge predators in the area, like Spinosaurus and Sarcosuchus, and even relatives like\u00a0Sauroniops, Deltadromeus, and\u00a0Bahariasaurus. The size of it's surrounding dinosaurs might have been the reason that Carcharodontosaurus was that enormous.Popular Culture See also  Websites: Carcharodontosaurus onWikipedia http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Carcharodontosaurus http://www.projectexploration.org/carcharodontosaurus.htm http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/c/carcharodontosaurus.html http://www.dinochecker.com/dinosaurs/CARCHARODONTOSAURUS http://theropods.blogspot.com/2011/03/theropod-size-part-ii.html Documentaries: Planet Dinosaur Dinosaur Planet Beyond T. rex T. rex: Clash of the Titans Monsters Resurrected: Biggest Killer Dino Books: Vertebrate Paleontology; Michael J.

It measured about five to seven feet tall, and about twelve feet long. Its weight is estimated at 150-200 pounds. Bones of several individuals of Deinonychus have been found with the skeleton of a large plant eating dinosaur, called Tenontosaurus. This has been historically interpreted as evidence of pack hunting, though most experts nowadays think it was a scavenger congregation. At any rate, modern pack hunting animals can't bring down prey that is too large, and Tenontosaurus was roughly as big as a rhinoceros, compared to the dog-sized Deinonychus. Deinonychus belongs to a family of dinosaurs called dromaeosaurs. They all share the same characteristics; a lightly built skull with sharp backwardly curved teeth, elongated arms and hands with sharp claws, and an extraordinary sickle-like second toe claw which was carried raised off the ground to protect the sharp point. Dromaeosaurs probably had keen vision and their brains were relatively large for a dinosaur. The dromaeosaurs lived throughout the Cretaceous period, 140 to 66.038 million years ago. Deinonychus was highly specialized for swift movement and savage attack. With its terrible claw flicked forward it slashed its prey with one foot while standing on the other. This kind of behavior required good coordination, excellent eyesight and a high level of energy.Discovery and naming  Fossilized remains of Deinonychus have been recovered from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus.The first remains were uncovered in 1931 in southern Montana near the town of Billings. The team leader, paleontologist Barnum Brown, was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing the remains of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus, but in his field report from the dig site to the American Museum of Natural History, he reported the discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a Tenontosaurus skeleton, \"but encased in lime difficult to prepare.\"He informally called the animal \"Daptosaurus agilis\" and made preparations for describing it and having the skeleton, specimen AMNH 3015, put on display, but never finished this work.Brown brought back from the Cloverly Formation the skeleton of a smaller theropod with seemingly oversized teeth that he informally named \"Megadontosaurus\". John Ostrom, reviewing this material decades later, realized that the teeth came from Deinonychus, but the skeleton came from a completely different animal. He named this skeleton Microvenator. A little more than thirty years later, in August 1964, paleontologist John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale University\u2019s Peabody Museum which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History. Later study by Ostrom and Grant E. Meyer analyzed their own material as well as Brown's \"Daptosaurus\" in detail and found them to be the same species. Ostrom first published his findings in February 1969, giving all the referred remains the new name of Deinonychus antirrhopus. The specific name \"antirrhopus\", from Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, means \"counterbalancing\" and refers to the likely purpose of a stiffened tail.In July 1969 Ostrom published a very extensive monograph on Deinonychus. Though a myriad of bones was available by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom\u2019s skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone \u2013 a pubis which was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.Predatory behavior  Deinonychus teeth found in association with fossils of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus are quite common in the Cloverly Formation. Two quarries have been discovered that preserve fairly complete Deinonychus fossils near Tenontosaurus fossils. The first, the Yale quarry in the Cloverly of Montana, includes numerous teeth, four adult Deinonychus and one juvenile Deinonychus. The association of this number of Deinonychus skeletoaidsns in a single quarry suggests that Deinonychus may have fed on that animal, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information to speculate that Deinonychus might have lived and hunted in packs. The second such quarry is from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma. The site contains six partial skeletons of Tenontosaurus of various sizes, along with one partial skeleton and many teeth of Deinonychus. One tenontosaur humerus even bears what might be Deinonychus tooth marks. Brinkman et al. (1998) point out that Deinonychus had an adult mass of 70\u2013100 kilograms, whereas adult tenontosaurs were 1\u20134 metric tons. A solitary Deinonychus could not kill an adult tenontosaur, suggesting that pack hunting is possible.A recent study by Roach and Brinkman has called into question the cooperative pack hunting behavior of Deinonychus, based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the taphonomy of tenontosaur sites. Modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) and komodo dragons display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is cannibalized. When this information is applied to the tenontosaur sites, it appears that what is found is consistent with Deinonychus having a komodo- or crocodile-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other Deinonychus. On the other hand, a paper by Li et al.. describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways, implying gregarious\\social behaviore is more possiblePaleobiology and paleoecology  Geological evidence suggests that Deinonychus inhabited a floodplain or swamplike habitat.The paleoenvironment of both the upper Cloverly Formation and the Antlers Formation, in which remains of Deinonychus have been found, consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests, deltas and lagoons, not unlike today's Louisiana. Other animals Deinonychus shared its world with include herbivorous dinosaurs such as the armored Sauropelta and the ornithopods Zephyrosaurus and Tenontosaurus. In Oklahoma, the ecosystem of Deinonychus also included the large theropod Acrocanthosaurus, the huge sauropod Sauroposeidon, the crocodilian Goniopholis, and the gar Lepisosteus. If the teeth found in Maryland are those of Deinonychus, then its neighbors would include Astrodon and a nodosaur called Priconodon only known from teeth. The middle portion of the Cloverly Formation ranges in age from 115 \u00b1 10 Ma near the baseto 108.5 \u00b1 0.2 Ma near the top. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 43 hand bones and 52 foot bones referred to Deinonychus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.Bite force  Bite force estimates for Deinonychus were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This study concluded that Deinonychus likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern American Alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the bite force based directly on newly discovered Deinonychus tooth puncture marks in the bones of a Tenontosaurus. These puncture marks came from a large individual, and provided the first evidence that large Deinonychus could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that the bite force of Deinonychus was significantly higher than earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the bite force of Deinonychus to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator. Gignac and colleagues also noted, however, that bone puncture marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus probably did not frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.Speed  Dromaeosaurids, especially Deinonychus, are often depicted as unusually fast-running animals in the popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that Deinonychus was fleet-footed in his original description.However, when first described, a complete leg of Deinonychus had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation about the length of the femur (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the ratio of the femur to the tibia (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern, fleet-footed birds like the ostrich, the foot-tibia ratio is .95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs like Struthiomimus, the ratio is .68, but in Deinonychus, the ratio is .48. Ostrom stated that the \"only reasonable conclusion\" is that Deinonychus was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs, and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds.  The low foot to lower leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short metatarsus (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus may be related to the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features \u2013 the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc. \u2013 as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles were used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon. In his 1981 study of Canadian dinosaur footprints, Richard Kool produced rough walking speed estimates based on several trackways made by different species in the Gething Formation of British Columbia. Kool estimated one of these trackways, representing the ichnospecies Irenichnites gracilis (which may have been made by Deinonychus), to have a walking speed of 10.1 kilometers per hour (6 miles per hour).Popular culture Sound  Like with most dinosaurs, it's a mystery on what even a dromaeosaur like Deinonychus sounded like. However with it's bird-like appearance, lifestyle and the research, Deinonychus like other coelurosaurian dinosaurs had air-sacs in their lungs to help their breath. And if like just like their descendants, Deinonychus may have a produced a loud resonant call or trilling screech, yet make low growling sounds or even sound as a combination. As a close relative to birds Deinonychus may have even made chirping sounds like a common house sparrow or squawked like a Macaw or Toucan. If Deinonychus made such sounds these calls would've possibly been heard from a mile radius or even more and used for communication with fellow pack members.Dinopedia Wiki Troodon  Troodon (Tro\u00f6don in older sources) is a dubious genus of relatively small, bird-like dinosaurs known definitively from the Campanian age of the Cretaceous period (about 77\u00a0mya). It includes at least one species, Troodon formosus, is known from Alberta and Montana. Discovered in 1855, T. formosus was among the first dinosaurs found in North America, although it was thought to be a lizard until 1877. The genus name is Greek for \"wounding tooth\", referring to the teeth, which were different from those of most other theropods known at the time of their discovery. The teeth bear prominent, apically oriented serrations. These \"wounding\" serrations, however, are morphometrically more similar to those of herbivorous reptiles, and suggest a possibly omnivorous diet. For a long time, Stenonychosaurus inequalis was thought to be a synonym of Troodon formosus or a separate species, T. inequalis, but a 2017 study by Aaron J. van der Reest and Phillip Currie revived the genus.. The same paper noted that Troodon lacked any features separating it from most troodontids and suggested that Troodon formosus should be a nomen dubium.Discovery  The Troodon tooth was originally classified as a \"lacertilian\" (lizard) by Leidy, but reassigned as a megalosaurid dinosaur by Nopcsa in 1901 (Megalosauridae having historically been a wastebin taxon for most carnivorous dinosaurs). In 1924, Gilmore suggested that the tooth belonged to the herbivorous pachycephalosaur Stegoceras, and that Stegoceras was in fact a junior synonym of Troodon (the similarity of troodontid teeth to those of herbivorous dinosaurs continues to lead many paleontologists to believe that these animals were omnivores). The classification of Troodon as a pachycephalosaur was followed for many years, during which the family Pachycephalosauridae was known as Troodontidae. In 1945, Charles Mortram Sternberg rejected the possibility that Troodon was a pachycephalosaur due to its stronger similarity to the teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs. With Troodon now classified as a theropod, the family Troodontidae could no longer be used for the dome-headed dinosaurs, so Sternberg named a new family for them, Pachycephalosauridae. Scientists at a British university later conducted a thought experiment related to the evolution of Troodon, had it not been so brutally wiped out by the cataclysmic meteorite impact of 65 million years ago. The scientists\u00a0 discovered that, as Troodon's eyes grew, his head would have to frequently bend upwards to gain a better view. The only way to solve that problem was to change the angle at which the spine was to the ground, in other words, to become erect. With Troodon standing upright, there would be no need for a tail to act as a counterbalance, henceforth reducing the requirement for a tail. Troodon had become humanoid. Although this is just a thought experiment, it really does give a fascinating glimpse of what evolutionary paths certain lineages of dinosaur may have taken to, had they not been eradicated. This little carnivore was a relative of Saurornithoides, another type of Troodontid. In 2017, Aaron J. van der Reest and Currie resurrected Stenonychosaurus as a valid genus.In the Media Gallery  Troodon/Gallery  \nCite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundDinopedia Wiki Dimetrodon  Dimetrodon (\"two measures of teeth\") was one of the largest land animals and the apex predator of its time. Its diet could have included freshwater sharks, amphibians, reptiles and other amniotes. The amphibian Eryops and freshwater shark Xenacanthus were its prey. Humeruses of Eryops and skulls of Xenacanthus were found to have teeth marks matching the shape of Dimetrodon teeth. It probably hunted based on its visual and olfactory senses. Different types ranged in length from 2\u20135 metres (6.5\u201316\u00a0ft) and weighing 14 to 300 kilograms (31 to 660\u00a0lb). The structure of the bones indicate that it was cold-blooded and had low metabolism. There are few channels in the bones, which indicates limited circulation. For proper metabolism, it needed external heat. The growth pattern of Dimetrodon is unclear. Analysis based on the length and ossification of the thigh, the ulna and the humerus, shows a poor correlation between the size and relative age of individuals. There was a difference in habitat between juveniles and adults in Dimetrodon. Younger individuals lived mainly in habitats with plenty of shelter, such as swamps and reed-lined banks. The adults preferred the open areas of flood plains. This is the finding of fossils from the Wichita Group of Texas. The length of the upper arm and thigh, the main measure that was used to distinguish between young and adult specimens, were examined and it was determined what type of sediment the fossils occurred. A similar difference in distribution between young and adult specimens, was also found for Ophiacodon and Eryops and is also known from modern crocodiles and water turtles. Dimetrodon may have had 'scales' on its belly like that of a rat on its tail.Skull  Dimetrodon has two types of teeth, shearing teeth and sharp canine teeth. Its name, in fact, means \"two-measures of teeth\". Dimetrodon was one of the first animals with differentiated teeth and the teeth were suitable for killing animals then tearing them to pieces. Dimetrodon has a large skull with a temporal fenestra behind each eye orbit on the lateral surface, a distinguishing feature of synapsid skull. This made possible new attachment sites for jaw muscles, which could run faster and create mastication. Based on the osteology of the temporal region, the posterior part of the palate and mandible, powerful jaw muscles of Dimetrodon was found to have differentiated. Two groups of muscles have been reconstructed: the adductors and the pterygoideus. The adductors were from temporal to the inside of the lower jaw and caused the closing of the jaws. The pterygoideus ran from the Pterygoid processes of the sphenoid and the sphenoid bone to the articular, one of the bones in the lower jaw, and caused a backward movement of the mandible. The development of the coronoid process in Dimetrodon compared with other quadrupeds, led to an increase in the length of the moment of external muscular and thus greater bite force. The construction of the inner ear and vestibular system of Dimetrodon were described by Case, but he drew no conclusions about the possible function of these organs.In a 2001 study on the biomechanics of the dinosaur Albertosaurus's teeth, William L. Abler observed that examined Dimetrodon teeth possessed serrations so fine they resembled a crack in the tooth. Though Albertosaurus had similar serrations, the base of each serration included a round void which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area.These voids, termed an ampulla, would hinder the ability of the \"crack\" formed by the serration to propagate through the tooth. Dimetrodon was found to lack adaptations for preventing \"crack\" propagation.Legs  The sturdy legs of Dimetrodon were spread beside the body. Judging from the construction of the legs, it was a relatively fast and smoothly moving animal, especially compared to its solid build herbivorous relatives. The shape of the hip bones, the hind legs and the joints between the vertebrae can be seen.Sail  The most striking feature of Dimetrodon has been the one meter long protrusions at the back of the spine, the spinous processes also referred to as spines. This feature is also found on the dinosaur Spinosaurus, as these spines have a wide base and then his long and slender with a pointed tip. It is believed that the spines were connected by a solid skin and thus formed a sail on the back. Many suggestions have been made about the function of the sail; as camouflage among reeds while it waited for prey, for sexual display, or literally as a sail while swimming. Romer and Pricefirst suggested that it served a mechanical function and strengthened the backbone, or for display, but Romer later realized that the sail had evolved with features strongly suggesting an early attempt at temperature regulation. The fact that these spines are present in both Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus, two animals in similar geological periods, would suggest that the spines had a significant value in the survival as result of environmental factors. In a study of the relationship between body temperature and blood pressure, Rodbard analyzed the evolution of thermoregulation, which he thought was a one possible function of the sails of Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus.The spines of Dimetrodon have grooves on the base that were presumably ingested by blood vessels and thus ensured good blood flow through the skin of the sail. The theory is that Dimetrodon was active in the early morning when the sun rose. The sail would be pointed towards the sun and would absorb heat allowing rapid warming. This allowed Dimetrodon to hunt at a time when other animals were not sufficiently warmed up and were slow. The sail increased body surface area by 50%. According to calculations by Bramwell Fellgett, it took a 200 kg (440 lb) Dimetrodon approximately one and a half hours for its body temperature to go from 26 to 32 \u00b0C (79 to 90 \u00b0F) A study by Haack concluded that warming was slower than previously thought and that the process probably took four hours. Therefore In order to cool its body in the hot midday sun, Dimetrodon turned its sail away from the sun, causing the heat to drain. The rapid warming using the sail give Dimetrodon an edge over larger animals, weighing over 55 kg. Smaller animals had higher body surface-to-mass ratio, making them hotter than Dimetrodon. The prey of Dimetrodon would therefore have been mostly large animals like Diadectes, Eryops and Ophiacodon. More recent research supports Haack's findings, and leads some scientists to conclude that the sail was an inefficient way to regulate body temperature and makes it more likely that the sail was used for sexual display. The changing climate during the Permian period, when the temperature increased, is a possible reason for the extinction of Dimetrodon since the sail meant no benefit over other animals and was rather a disadvantage due to its fragility.Species  The genus Dimetrodon currently includes several more or less recognized types: Many species have been described by Edward Drinker Cope during his expeditions in 1880. Romer Alfred Sherman described a few species in the 1930s and 1940s. Most of the type specimens from the collection of which Cope based his descriptions were not released from the matrix. Reassessment after his death led to different conclusions on these specimens, including on the construction of the skull.[17] The status of some of the species described by Cope is questionable, namely D. fritillus, D. gigas, D. incisivus, D. rectiformis and D. semiradicatus. There is a broad subdivision into species with a long skull from the Early Permian and species with a short head from the later parts of the Permian.Relationship with modern mammals  As a synapsid, Dimetrodon was distantly related to modern mammals. Synapsids were the first tetrapods to evolve differentiated, or heterodont, teeth. While reptiles barely chew their food, essentially gulping it down, synapsids like Dimetrodon developed teeth to help shear meat into smaller pieces for easier digestion. These \"two-measure teeth\" eventually gave rise to the various kinds of teeth present in modern mammals.Paleoecology  Fossils are known from the United States (Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico , Arizona , Utah and Ohio) and Germany, areas that the first parts of the Permian were part of the supercontinent Euramerica. Most fossil finds are part of lowland ecosystems, during the Permian would have been vast wetlands. In particular, the Red Beds of Texas is an area of great diversity of fossils of Dimetrodon species and other species from the Early Permian. The fossils date from 290 to 270 million years ago, which means it lived from the Cisuralian to the Guadalupian period. Dimetrodon probably developed from a Sphenacodon-like ancestor. The climate of the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanien) and Early Permian (Asse Lien, Sakmarien, Arti Skiing) resulted in warm, humid ecosystems in subtropical and tropical zones, consisting of vast wetland areas. In addition there were large ice sheets on the Southern Hemisphere that stretched to about 30\u00b0 south. The fauna was concentrated in this period therefore in tropical and subtropical zones. Aquatic and semi-aquatic tetrapods dominated, while land predators as Dimetrodon were largely water-fed animals. The Early Permian had a drier and hotter climate where deserts began to develop. This led a climate change causing major extinction of the tetrapods, thus clearing the way for the development of therapsids. Dimetrodon was replaced as an apex predator by carnivores as Biarmosuchia and Dinocephalia.In popular culture Dragon Ball Z Wiki Krillin Background  Ugly buttholeDragon Ball Z Wiki Dragon Ball Z Wiki   Welcome to Super Saiyan, where we have everything on anything on Dragon Ball!

They control somewhere in the area of $550 trillion US, which is roughly half of the money in the world's circulation. The Rothschilds have been in control of the world for a very long time, their tentacles reaching into many aspects of our daily lives, as is documented in the following timeline. However, before you jump to the timeline, please read this invaluable introduction which will tell you who the Rothschilds are as oppose to who they claim to be. The Rothschilds claim that they are Jewish, when in fact they are Khazars. They are from a country called Khazaria, which occupied the land locked between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea which is now predominantly occupied by Georgia. The reason the Rothschilds claim to be Jewish is that the Khazars under the instruction of the King, converted to the Jewish faith in 740 A.D., but of course that did not include converting their Asiatic Mongolian genes to the genes of the Jewish people. You will find that approximately 90% of people in the world today who call themselves Jews are actually Khazars, or as they like to be known, Ashkenazi Jews. These people knowingly lie to the world with their claims that the land of Israel is theirs by birthright, when in actual fact their real homeland is over 800 miles away in Georgia. So, next time you hear an Israeli Prime Minister bleating about the so-called persecution of the Jews, consider this, every Prime Minister of Israel has been an Ashkenazi Jew. Therefore when all these Prime Ministers have curried favour with the West for their re-establishment of a Jewish homeland, they have knowingly and deliberately lied to you, as they were never from that region, and they well know it, because it is they who call themselves Ashkenazi Jews. The Book of Revelation, Chapter 2, Verse 9, states the following which would appear to be about these Ashkenazi Jews: \"I know thy works, and tribulation and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.\"The most wealthy bloodline in the world bar none and the leader of the Ashkenazi Jews in the world today is the Rothschild family. As you will see in the timeline, the Rothschilds have obtained this position through lies, manipulation and murder. Their bloodline also extends into the Royal Families of Europe, and the following family names: Astor; Bundy; Collins; duPont; Freeman; Kennedy; Morgan; Oppenheimer; Rockefeller; Sassoon; Schiff; Taft; and Van Duyn. However, these are not the only bloodlines to worry about. You are probably aware of the centuries old pratice undertaken by many Ashkenazi Jews whereby they would change their name, in order for them to appear part of the dominant race of the country in which they lived, so as they could obtain influential positions in that country, which they would then exploit to serve their real masters elsewhere. There is plenty of evidence to prove the Rothschilds continue that deceptive tradition. Furthermore the Rothschilds are known to sire many children secretly that they can put into positions of power when required. This started with the very first man who took the name Rothschild, who had a secret sixth son. Finally, remember the world is a diverse place, I could if I wanted change my name to Rothschild, or any of the names listed above, and that would not make me part of this family anymore than converting to Judaism in 740 A.D. will make these Ashkenazis Jewish. Please, therefore, do not automatically assume someone you see with the name Rothschild or any of the names listed above are part of the Rothschild criminal network. Furthermore and most importantly, the majority of Ashkenazi Jews are innocent and not part of this network. Check the facts out for yourself first, this article is designed to inform people who the enemy is, not single out people of a particular race or people with a particular surname, who may have nothing to do with this Rothschild criminal network. HISTORY 1743: Mayer Amschel Bauer, an Ashkenazi Jew, is born in Frankfurt, Germany, the son of Moses Amschel Bauer, a money lender and the proprietor of a counting house. Moses Amschel Bauer places a red sign above the entrance door to his counting house. This sign is a red hexagram (which geometrically and numerically translates into the number 666) which under Rothschild instruction will end up on the Israeli flag some two centuries later. 1753: Gutle Schnaper, an Ashkenazi Jew (future wife of Mayer Amschel Bauer), born to respected merchant, Wolf Salomon Schnaper. 1760: During this decade Mayer Amschel Bauer works for a bank owned by the Oppenheimers' in Hanover, Germany. He is highly successful and becomes a junior partner. Whilst working at the bank he becomes acquainted with General von Estorff. Following his father's death, Bauer returns to Frankfurt to take over his father's business. Bauer recognises the significance of the red hexagram and changes his name from Bauer to Rothschild, after the red hexagram or sign signifying 666 hanging over the entrance door (\"Rot,\" is German for, \"Red,\" \"Schild,\" is German for, \"Sign\"). Now Mayer Amschel Rothschild, he discovers that General von Estorff is now attached to the court of Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau, one of the richest royal houses in Europe, which gained its' wealth by the hiring out of Hessian soldiers to foreign countries for vast profits (a practice that continues today in the form of exporting, \"peacekeeping,\" troops throughout the world). He therefore makes the General's re-acquaintance on the pretext of selling him valuable coins and trinkets at discounted prices. As he plans, Rothschild is subsequently introduced to Prince William himself who is more than pleased with discounted prices he charges for his rare coins and trinkets, and Rothschild offers him a bonus for any other business the Prince can direct his way. Rothschild subsequently becomes close associates with Prince William, and ends up doing business with him and members of the court. He soon discovers that loaning money to governments and royalty is more profitable than loaning to individuals, as the loans are bigger and are secured by the nation's taxes. 1769: Mayer Amschel Rothschild is given permission by Prince William to hang a sign on the front of his business premises declaring that he is, \"M. A. Rothschild, by appointment court factor to his serene highness, Prince William of Hanau.\" 1770: Mayer Amschel Rothschild draws up plans for the creation of the Illuminati and entrusts Ashkenazi Jew, Adam Weishaupt, a Crypto-Jew who was outwardly Roman Catholic, with its organization and development. The Illuminati is to be based upon the teachings of the Talmud, which is in turn, the teachings of Rabbinical Jews. It was to be called the Illuminati as this is a Luciferian term which means, keepers of the light. Mayer Amschel Rothschild marries Gutle Schnaper. 1773: Amschel Mayer Rothschild born, the first of Mayer Amschel Rothschild\u2019s sons. He like all his brothers who follow him, will enter the family business at the age of 12. 1774: Salomon Mayer Rothschild born. 1776: Adam Weishaupt officially completes his organisation of the Illuminati on May 1 of this year. The purpose of the Illuminati is to divide the goyim (all non-Jews) through political, economic, social, and religious means. The opposing sides were to be armed and incidents were to be provided in order for them to: fight amongst themselves; destroy national governments; destroy religious institutions; and eventually destroy each other. Weishaupt soon infiltrates the Continental Order of Freemasons with this Illuminati doctrine and establishes lodges of the Grand Orient to be their secret headquarters. This was all under the orders and finance of Mayer Amschel Rothschild and the concept has spread and is followed within Masonic Lodges worldwide to the present day. Weishaupt also recruits 2,000 paid followers including the most intelligent men in the field of arts and letters, education, science, finance,and industry. They were instructed to follow the following methods in order to control people. 1) Use monetary and sex bribery to obtain control of men already in high places, in the various levels of all governments and other fields of endeavour. Once influential persons had fallen for the lies, deceits, and temptations of the Illuminati they were to be held in bondage by application of political and other forms of blackmail, threats of financial ruin, public exposure, and fiscal harm, even death to themselves and loved members of their families.2) The faculties of colleges and universities were to cultivate students possessing exceptional mental ability belonging to well-bred families with international leanings, and recommend them for special training in internationalism, or rather the notion that only a one-world government can put an end to recurring wars and strife. Such training was to be provided by granting scholarships to those selected by the Illuminati. 3) All influential people trapped into coming under the control of the Illuminati, plus the students who had been specially educated and trained, were to be used as agents and placed behind the scenes of all governments as experts and specialists. This was so they would advise the top executives to adopt policies which would in the long-run serve the secret plans of the Illuminati one-world conspiracy and bring about the destruction of the governments and religions they were elected or appointed to serve. 4) To obtain absolute-control of the press, at that time the only mass-communications media which distributed information to the public, so that all news and information could be slanted in order to make the masses believe that a one-world government is the only solution to our many and varied problems. 1777: Nathan Mayer Rothschild born. 1784: Adam Weishaupt issues his order for the French Revolution to be started by by Maximilien Robespierre in book form. This book was written by one of Weishaupt's associates, Xavier Zwack, and sent by courier from Frankfurt to Paris. However en route there, the courier is struck by lightning, the book detailing this plan discovered by the police, and handed over to the Bavarian authorities. As a consequence, the Bavarian government orders the police to raid Weishaupt's masonic lodges of the Grand Orient, and the homes of his most influential associates. Clearly, the Bavarian authorities were convinced that the book that was discovered was a very real threat by a private group of influential people, to use wars and revolutions to achieve their political ends. 1785: The Bavarian government outlaw the Illuminati and close all the Bavarian lodges of the Grand Orient. Mayer Amschel Rothschild moves his family home to a five storey house in Frankfurt which he shares with the Schiff family. 1786: The Bavarian government publish the details of the Illuminati plot in a document entitled, \"The Original Writings of The Order and Sect of The Illuminati.\" They then send this document to all the heads of church and state throughout Europe, but sadly their warning is ignored. 1788: Kalmann (Carl) Mayer Rothschild Born. 1789: Due to the European ignorance of the Bavarian government's warning, the Illuminati's plan for a French Revolution succeeded from this year to 1793. This revolution was a bankers' dream, it established a new constitution and passed laws that forbade the Roman Church from levying tithes (taxes) and also removed its exemption from taxation. 1790: Mayer Amschel Rothschild states, \"Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who writes the laws.\"1791: The Rothschilds get, \"control of a nation's money,\" through Alexander Hamilton (their agent in George Washington\u2019s cabinet) when they set up a central bank in the USA called the First Bank of the United States. This is established with a 20 year charter. 1792: Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild born. 1796: Amschel Mayer Rothschild marries Eva Hanau. 1798: John Robison publishes a book entitled, \"Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies.\" In this book, Professor Robison of the University of Edinburgh, one of the leading intellects of his time, who in 1783 was elected general secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, gave details of the whole Rothschild Illuminati plot. He advised how he had been a high degree mason in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and had been invited by Adam Weishaupt to Europe, where he had been given a revised copy of Weishaupt's conspiracy. However, although he pretended to go along with it, Professor Robison did not agree with it and therefore published his aforementioned book. The book included details of the Bavarian government's investigation into the Illuminati and the French Revolution. That same year on July 19th, David Pappen, President of Harvard University, lectured the graduating class on the influence illuminism was having on American politics and religion. At the age of 21, Nathan Mayer Rothschild leaves Frankfurt for England, where with a large sum of money given to him by his father, he sets up a banking house in London. 1800: Salomon Mayer Rothschild marries Caroline Stern. 1806: Napolean states that it is his, \"object to remove the house of Hess-Cassel from rulership and to strike it out of the list of powers.\"On hearing this, Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau, flees Germany, goes to Denmark and entrusts his fortune valued at $3,000,000 at that time to Mayer Amschel Rothschild for safekeeping. Nathan Mayer Rothschild marries Hannah Barent Cohen the daughter of a wealthy London merchant. 1808: Nathan Mayer Rothschild has his first son born Lionel Nathan de Rothschild. 1810: Sir Francis Baring and Abraham Goldsmid die. This leaves Nathan Mayer Rothschild as the remaining major banker in England. Salomon Mayer Rothschild goes to Vienna, Austria and sets up the bank, M. von Rothschild und S\u00f6hne. 1811: The charter for the Rothschilds Bank of the United States runs out and Congress votes against its renewal. Nathan Mayer Rothschild is not amused and he states, \"Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.\"However the United States stands firm and the Charter is not renewed, which causes Nathan Mayer Rothschild to issue another threat, \"Teach those impudent Americans a lesson. Bring them back to colonial status.\"1812: Backed by Rothschild money, and Nathan Mayer Rothschild's orders, the British declare war on the United States. The Rothschilds plan was to cause the United States to build up such a debt in fighting this war that they would have to surrender to the Rothschilds and allow the charter for the Rothschild owned First Bank of the United States to be renewed. Mayer Amschel Rothschild dies. In his will he lays out specific laws that the House of Rothschild were to follow: all key positions in the family business were only to be held by family members; only male members of the family were allowed to participate in the family business, this included a reported sixth secret bastard son (It is important to note that Mayer Amschel Rothschild also has five daughters, so today the spread of the Rothschild Zionist dynasty without the Rothschild name is far and wide, and Jews believe the mixed offspring of a Jewish mother is solely Jewish); the family was to intermarry with it\u2019s first and second cousins to preserve the family fortune (of the 18 marriages by Mayer Amschel Rothschild\u2019s grandchildren, 16 were between first cousins - a practice known today as inbreeding); no public inventory of his estate was to be published; no legal action was to be taken with regard to the value of the inheritance; the eldest son of the eldest son was to become the head of the family (this condition could only be overturned when the majority of the family agreed otherwise). This was straightaway the case and Nathan Mayer Rothschild was elected head of the family following his father, Mayer Amschel Rothschild\u2019s death. Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild goes to Paris, France to set up the bank, de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res. Nathaniel de Rothschild, the son in law of Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild, born. 1814: With regard to the $3,000,000 Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau had entrusted to Mayer Amschel Rothschild for safekeeping, for an account of what happened next we turn to the Jewish Encyclopaedia, 1905 edition, Volume 10, page 494, which states, \"According to legend this money was hidden away in wine casks, and, escaping the search of Napoleon's soldiers when they entered Frankfurt, was restored intact in the same casks in 1814, when the elector (Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau) returned to the electorate (Germany). The facts are somewhat less romantic, and more businesslike.\"This last line indicates the money was never returned by Rothschild to Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau. The encyclopaedia goes on to state, \"Nathan Mayer Rothschild invested this $3,000,000 in, gold from the East India Company knowing that it would be needed for Wellington's peninsula campaign.\"On the stolen money Nathan made, \"no less than four profits:i) On the sale of Wellington's paper which he bought at 50 cents on the dollar and collected at par;\nii) on the sale of gold to Wellington;\niii) on its repurchase; and\niv) on forwarding it to Portugal.\"1815: The five Rothschild brothers work to supply gold to both Wellington's army (through Nathan in England) and Napoleon's army (through Jacob in France), and begin their policy of funding both sides in wars. The Rothschilds love wars because they are massive generators of risk free debt. This is because they are guaranteed by the government of a country, and therefore the efforts of the population of that country, and it doesn't matter if that country loses the war because the loans are given on the guarantee that the victor will honour the debts of the vanquished. Whilst the Rothschilds are funding both sides in this war, they use the banks they have spread out across Europe to give them the opportunity to set up an unrivalled postal service network of secret routes and fast couriers. The post these couriers carried was to be opened up by these couriers and their details given to the Rothschilds so they always were one step ahead of current events. Furthermore, these Rothschild couriers were the only merchants allowed to pass through the English and French blockades. It was these couriers who also kept Nathan Mayer Rothschild up to date with how the war was going so he could use that intelligence to buy and sell from his position on the stock exchange in accordance with that intelligence. One of Rothschild's couriers was a man named Rothworth. When the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo was won by the British, Rothworth took off for the Channel and was able to deliver this news to Nathan Mayer Rothschild, a full 24 hours before Wellington's own courier. At that time British bonds were called consuls and they were traded on the floor of the stock exchange. Nathan Mayer Rothschild instructed all his workers on the floor to start selling consuls. The made all the other traders believe that the British had lost the war so they started selling frantically. Therefore the consuls plummeted in value which was when Nathan Mayer Rothschild discreetly instructed his workers to purchase all the consuls they could lay their hands on. When news came through that the British had actually won the war, the consuls went up to a level even higher than before the war ended leaving Nathan Mayer Rothschild with a return of approximately 20 to 1 on his investment. This gave the Rothschild family complete control of the British economy, now the financial centre of the world following Napolean's defeat, and forced England to set up a new Bank of England, which Nathan Mayer Rothschild controlled. Interestingly 100 years later the New York Times would run a story stating that Nathan Mayer Rothschild's grandson had attempted to secure a court order to suppress publication of a book which had this insider trading story in it. The Rothschild family claimed the story was untrue and libellous, but the court denied the Rothschilds request and ordered the family to pay all court costs. Back to 1815, this is the year Nathan Mayer Rothschild makes his famous statement, \"I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain's money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.\"He would go onto brag that in the 17 years he had been in England he had increased the \u00a320,000 stake given to him by his father, 2500 times to \u00a350 million. The Rothschilds also use their control of the Bank of England to replace the method of shipping gold from country to country and instead used their five banks spread across Europe to set up a system of paper debits and credits, the banking system of today. By the end of this century, a period of time that was known as the, \"Age of the Rothschilds,\" it is estimated that the Rothschild family controlled half the wealth of the world. However something that did not go well for the Rothschilds this year was the Congress of Vienna, which started in September, 1814 and concluded in June of this year. The reason for this Congress of Vienna, was for the Rothschilds to create a form of world government, to give them complete political control over much of the civilized world. Many of the European governments were in debt to the Rothschilds, so they figured they could use that as a bargaining tool. However the Tsar Alexander I of Russia, who had not succumbed to a Rothschild central bank, would not go along with the plan, so the Rothschild world government plan failed. Enraged by this, Nathan Mayer Rothschild swore that some day he or his descendants would destroy the Tsar Alexander I's entire family and descendants. Unfortunately he was true to his word and 102 years later Rothschild funded Bolsheviks would act upon that promise. Interestingly, world government fanatic and Ashkenazi Jew, Henry Kissinger, did his doctoral dissertation on the Congress of Vienna. 1816: The American Congress passes a bill permitting yet another Rothschild dominated central bank, which gives the Rothschilds control of the American money supply again. This is called the Second Bank of the United States and is given a twenty year charter. The British war against the America therefore ends with the deaths of thousands of British and American soldiers, but the Rothschilds get their bank. 1818: Following the French securing massive loans in 1817 in order to help rebuild after their disastrous defeat at Waterloo, Rothschild agents bought vast amounts of French government bonds causing their value to increase. On November 5th they dumped the lot on the open market causing their value to plummet and France to go into a financial panic. The Rothschilds then stepped in to take control of the French money supply. This was the same year the Rothschilds were able to loan \u00a35,000,000 to the Prussian government. 1821: Kalmann (Carl) Mayer Rothschild was sent to Naples, Italy. He would end up doing a lot of business with the Vatican and Pope Gregory XVI subsequently conferred upon him the Order of St. George. Also, whenever the Pope received Kalmann, he would give him his hand rather than the customary toe to kiss, which showed the extent of Kalmann's power over the Vatican. 1822: The emperor of Austria made the five Rothschild brothers Barons. Nathan Mayer Rothschild chose not to take up the title. 1823: The Rothschilds take over the financial operations of the Catholic Church, worldwide. 1827: Sir Walter Scott publishes his nine volume set, The life of Napolean and in volume two he states that the French Revolution was planned by the Illuminati (Adam Weishaupt) and was financed by the money changers of Europe (The Rothschilds). 1832: President Andrew Jackson (the 7th President of the United States from 1829 to 1837), runs the campaign for his second term in office under the slogan, \"Jackson And No Bank!\" This is in reference to his plan to take the control of the American money system to benefit the American people, not for the profiteering of the Rothschilds. 1833: President Andrew Jackson starts removing the government's deposits from the Rothschild controlled, Second Bank of the United States and instead deposits them into banks directed by democratic bankers. This causes the Rothschilds to panic and so they do what they do best, contract the money supply causing a depression. President Jackson knows what they are up to and later states, \"You are a den of thieves vipers, and I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out.\"1834: The Italian revolutionary leader, Guiseppe Mazzini, is selected by the Illuminati to direct their revolutionary program throughout the world and would serve in that capacity until he died in 1872. 1835: On January 30, an assassin tries to shoot President Jackson, but miraculously both of the assassin's pistols misfired. President Jackson would later claim that he knew the Rothschilds were responsible for that attempted assassination. He is not the only one, the assassin, Richard Lawrence, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity, later bragged that powerful people in Europe had hired him and promised to protect him if he were caught. The Rothschilds acquire the rights in the Almad\u00e9n quicksilver mines in Spain. This was at the time the biggest concession in the world and as quicksilver was a vital component in the refining of gold or silver this gave the Rothschilds a virtual world monopoly. 1836: Following his years of fighting against the Rothschilds and their central bank in America, President Andrew Jackson finally succeeds in throwing the Rothschilds central bank out of America, when the bank's charter is not renewed. It would not be until 1913 that the Rothschilds would be able to set up their third central bank in America, the Federal Reserve, and to ensure no mistakes are made, this time they will put one of their own bloodline, Jacob Schiff, in charge of the project. Nathan Mayer Rothschild dies and the control of his bank, N. M. Rothschild & Sons is passed on to his younger brother, James Mayer Rothschild. 1837: The Rothschilds send one of their own, August Belmont, an Ashkenazi Jew, to America to salvage their banking interests defeated by President Andrew Jackson. 1840: The Rothschilds become the Bank of England\u2019s bullion brokers. They set up agencies in California and Australia. 1841: President John Tyler (the 10th President of the United States From 1841 to 1845) vetoed the act to renew the charter for the Bank of the United States. He goes on to receive hundreds of letters threatening him with assassination. 1844: Salomon Mayer Rothschild purchases the United Coal Mines of V\u00edtkovice and Austro-Hungarian Blast Furnace Company that would go on to be one of the top ten global industrial concerns. Benjamin Disraeli, an Ashkenazi Jew (who would go on to become British Prime Minister twice - the only admitted Ashkenazi Jew to do so) publishes Coningsby, in which he characterises Nathan Mayer Rothschild as, \"the Lord and Master of the money markets of the world, and of course virtually Lord and Master of everything else. He literally held the revenues of Southern Italy in pawn, and Monarchs and Ministers of all countries courted his advice and were guided by his suggestions.\"1845: The Great American Patriot, Andrew Jackson (7th President of the United States) dies. Before his death he is asked what he regarded his as greatest achievement. He replies without hesitation, \"I Killed The Bank,\"This is in reference to the fact he banished the Rothschilds Second Bank of the United States in 1836. Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild (who by now had married his niece, Betty, Salomon Mayer Rothschild's daughter), now known as Baron James de Rothschild, wins the contract to build the first major railway line across the country. This was called the Chemin De Fer Du Nord and ran initially from Paris to Valenciennes and then joined with the Austrian rail network built by his brother (and wife's father - all sounds a bit sordid doesn't it) Salomon Mayer Rothschild. 1847: Lionel De Rothschild now married to the daughter of his uncle, Kalmann (Carl) Mayer Rothschild, is elected to the parliamentary seat for the City of London. A requirement for entering parliament was to take an oath in the true faith of a Christian. Lionel De Rothschild refused to do this as he was Jewish and his seat in parliament remained empty for 11 years until new oaths were allowed. He must have been an invaluable representative for his constituency, bearing in mind he could never vote on any bill as he never entered parliament! I wonder how he managed to keep his parliamentary seat for 11 years? 1848: Karl Marx, an Ashkenazi Jew, publishes, \"The Communist Manifesto.\" Interestingly at the same time as he is working on this, Karl Ritter of Frankfurt University was writing the antithesis which would form the basis for Freidrich Wilhelm Nietzsche's, \"Nietzscheanism.\" This Nietzecheanism was later developed into Fascism and then into Nazism and was used to forment the first and second world wars. Marx, Ritter, and Nietzsche were all funded and under the instruction of the Rothschilds. The idea was that those who direct the overall conspiracy could use the differences in those two so-called ideologies to enable them to divide larger and larger factions of the human race into opposing camps so that they could be armed and then brainwashed into fighting and destroying each other, and particularly, to destroy all political and religious institutions. The same plan put forward by Weishaupt in 1776. Eva Hanau, Amschel Mayer Rothschild\u2019s wife dies. 1849: Gutle Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild\u2019s wife dies. Before her death she would nonchalantly state, \"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none.\"1850: Construction begins this decade on the manor houses of Mentmore in England and Ferri\u00e8res in France, more Rothschilds Manors will follow throughout the world, all of them filled with works of art. Jacob (James) Rothschild in France is said to be worth 600 million francs, which at the time was 150 million francs more than all the other bankers in France put together. 1852: N.M. Rothschild & Sons begins refining gold and silver for the Royal Mint and the Bank of England and other international customers. 1853: Nathaniel de Rothschild, the son in law of Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild, purchases Ch\u00e2teau Brane Mouton, the Bordeaux vineyard of Mouton, and renames it Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild. 1854: Caroline Stern, Salomon Mayer Rothschild\u2019s wife, dies. 1855: Amschel Mayer Rothschild dies. Salomon Mayer Rothschild dies. Kalmann (Carl) Mayer Rothschild dies. 1858: Lionel De Rothschild finally takes his seat in parliament when the requirement to take an oath in the true faith of a Christian is broadened to include other oaths. He becomes the first Jewish member of the British parliament. 1861: President Abraham Lincoln (16th President of the United States from 1860 till his assassination in 1865) approaches the big banks in New York to try to obtain loans to support the ongoing American civil war. As these large banks were heavily under the influence of the Rothschilds, they offer him a deal they know he cannot accept, 24% to 36% interest on all monies loaned. Lincoln is very angry about this high level of interest and so he prints his own debt free money and informs the public that this is now legal tender for both public and private debts. 1862: By April $449,338,902 worth of Lincoln\u2019s debt free money has been printed and distributed. He states of this, \u201cWe gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts.\u201dThat same year The Times of London publishes a story containing the following statement, \"If that mischievous financial policy, which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce.It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.\"1863: President Abraham Lincoln discovers the Tsar of Russia, Alexander II (1855 \u2013 1881), was having problems with the Rothschilds as well as he was refusing their continual attempts to set up a central bank in Russia. The Tsar then gives President Lincoln some unexpected help. The Tsar issued orders that if either England or France actively intervened in the American Civil War, and help the South, Russia would consider such action a declaration of war, and take the side of President Lincoln. To show that he wasn't messing about, he sent part of his Pacific Fleet to port in San Francisco and another part to New York. The Rothschild banking house in Naples, Italy, C. M. de Rothschild e figli, closes following the unification of Italy. The Rothschilds use one of their own in America, John D. Rockefeller, to form an oil business called Standard Oil which eventually takes over all of its competition. 1864: Rothschild, August Belmont, who by now is the Democratic Party's National Chairman, supports General George McClellan as the Democratic nominee to run against President Abraham Lincoln in this year's election. Much to the anger of Belmont, President Lincoln wins the election. 1865: In a statement to Congress, President Abraham Lincoln states, \"I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me, and the financial institutions in the rear. Of the two, the one in my rear is my greatest foe.\"Later that year, on April 14, President Lincoln is assassinated, less than two months before the end of the American Civil War. Following a brief training period in the Rothschilds London Bank, Jacob Schiff, a Rothschild, born in their house in Frankfurt, arrives in America at the age of 18, with instructions and the finance necessary to buy into a banking house there. The purpose of this was to carry out the following tasks. 1. Gain control of America's money system through the establishment of a central bank.\n2. Find desirable men, who for a price, would be willing to serve as stooges for the Illuminati and promote them into high places in the federal government, the Congress, Supreme Court, and all the federal agencies.\n3. Create minority group strife throughout the nations, particularly targeting the whites and blacks.\n4. Create a movement to destroy religion in the United States, with Christianity as the main target.Nathaniel de Rothschild becomes Member of Parliament for Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. 1868: Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild dies, shortly after purchasing Ch\u00e2teau Lafite, one of the four great premier grand cru estates of France. He is the last of Mayer Amschel Rothschild\u2019s sons to die. 1870: Nathaniel de Rothschild dies. 1871: An American General named, Albert Pike, who had been enticed into the Illuminati by Guissepe Mazzini, completes his military blueprint for three world wars and various revolutions throughout the world, culminating into moving this great conspiracy into its final stage. The first world war is to be fought for the purpose of destroying the Tsar in Russia,as promised by Nathan Mayer Rothschild in 1815. The Tsar is to be replaced with communism which is to be used to attack religions, predominantly Christianity. The differences between the British and German empires are to be used to forment this war. The second world war is to be used to forment the controversy between facism and political zionism with the slaughter of Jews in Germany a lynchpin in bringing hatred against the German people. This is designed to destroy fascism (which the Rothschilds created) and increase the power of political zionism. This war is also designed to increase the power of communism to the level that it equalled that of united Christendom. The third world war is to be played out by stirring up hatred of the Muslim world for the purposes of playing the Islamic world and the political zionists off against one another. Whilst this is going on, the remaining nations would be forced to fight themselves into a state of mental, physical, spiritual and economic exhaustion. On August 15th of this year, Albert Pike writes a letter (now catalogued in the British Museum) to Guiseppe Mazzini in which he states the following, \"We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a great social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to all nations the effect of absolute atheism; the origins of savagery and of most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, the people will be forced to defend themselves against the world minority of the world revolutionaries and will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitudes disillusioned with Christianity whose spirits will be from that moment without direction and leadership and anxious for an ideal, but without knowledge where to send its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into public view.A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.\" Pike, who having been elected as Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry's Southern Jurisdiction in 1859, was the most powerful Freemason in America. He would retain that post for 32 years until his death in 1891. He also published a book on the subject in 1872 entitled, \"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry,\" in which he candidly states the following, \"LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darknesss! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!\"1872: Prior to Guiseppe Mazzini's death this year, he makes another revolutionary leader named Adrian Lemmy his successor. Lemmy will be subsequently succeeded by Lenin and Trotsky, then by Stalin. The revolutionary activities of all these men are financed by the Rothschilds. 1873: The loss making Rio Tinto copper mines in Spain, are purchased by a group of foreign financiers including the Rothschilds. These mines represented Europe\u2019s largest source of copper. 1875: On January 1 of this year Jacob Schiff, now Solomon Loeb's son-in-law after marrying his daughter, Teresa, takes control of the banking house, Kuhn, Loeb & Co. He goes on to finance John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, Edward R. Harriman's Railroad Empire, and Andrew Carnegie's Steel Empire. This is all with Rothschild money. He then identifies the other largest bankers in America at that time. They are, J.P. Morgan who controls Wall Street, and the Drexels and the Biddles of Philadelphia. All the other financiers, big and little, danced to the music of those three houses. Schiff then gets the European Rothschilds to set up European branches of these three large banks on the understanding that Schiff, and therefore Rothschild, is to be the boss of banking in New York and therefore America. N M Rothschild & Sons undertake a share issue to raise capital for the first channel tunnel project to link France to England, with half of its capital coming from the Rothschild owned Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Nord. This year Lionel De Rothschild also loans Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli the finance for the British government to purchase the shares in the Suez Canal, from Khedive Said of Egypt. This was done as the Rothschilds needed this access route to be held by a government they controlled, so they could use that government's military to protect their huge business interests in the Middle East. 1876: Otto von Bismarck states, \"The division of the United States into two federations of equal force was decided long before the civil war by the high financial power of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economical and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world.The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They foresaw the tremendous booty if they could substitute two feeble democracies, indebted to the financiers, to the vigorous Republic, confident and self-providing.Therefore they started their emissaries in order to exploit the question of slavery and thus dig an abyss between the two parts of the Republic.\" 1879: Lionel de Rothschild dies. 1880: Rothschild agents begin formenting a series of pogroms predominantly in Russia, but also in Poland, Bulgaria and Romania. These pogroms resulted in the slaughter of thousands of innocent Jews, causing approximately 2 million to flee, mainly to New York, but also to Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Los Angeles. The reason these pogroms were initiated, was to create a large Jewish base in America, who when they arrived, would be educated to register as Democrat voters. Some twenty years later, this would result in in a massive Democratic power base in the United States and be used to elect Rothschild front men such as Woodrow Wilson, to the Presidency, to carry out the bidding of the Rothschilds. 1881: President James A. Garfield (The 20th President of the United States who lasted only 100 Days) states two weeks before he is assassinated, \u201cWhoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce\u2026and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.\u201dEdmond James de Rothschild has a son Maurice de Rothschild. 1883: After 6,000 feet of tunnel in the channel tunnel project being excavated, the British government halt the project citing the fact that it would be a threat to Britain\u2019s security. 1885: Nathaniel Rothschild, son of Lionel De Rothschild, becomes the first Jewish peer and is takes the title of Lord Rothschild. 1886: The French Rothschild bank, de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res obtains substantial amounts of Russia's oil fields and forms the Caspian and Black Sea Petroleum Company, which quickly becomes the world's second largest oil producer. 1887: Opium trafficker in China, Edward Albert Sassoon, marries Aline Caroline de Rothschild, the grand-daughter of Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild. Aline Caroline's father, Gustave, together with his brother, Alphonse, took over the Rothschild's french arm following their father Jacob's death. The Rothschilds finance the amalgamation of the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa. They subsequently become the biggest shareholders of this company, De Beers, and mine precious stones in Africa and India. 1888: No\u00e9mie Halphen, future wife of Maurice de Rothschild born. 1891: The British Labour Leader makes the following statement on the subject of the Rothschilds, \"This blood-sucking crew has been the cause of untold mischief and misery in Europe during the present century, and has piled up its prodigious wealth chiefly through fomenting wars between States which ought never to have quarrelled.Whenever there is trouble in Europe, wherever rumours of war circulate and men\u2019s minds are distraught with fear of change and calamity you may be sure that a hook-nosed Rothschild is at his games somewhere near the region of the disturbance.\" Comments like this worry the Rothschilds and towards the end of the 1800\u2019s they purchase Reuters news agency so they can have some control of the media. 1895: Edmond James de Rothschild the youngest son of Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild visits Palestine and subsequently supplies the funds to found the first Jewish colonies there, this is to further their long term objective of creating a Rothschild owned country. 1897: The Rothschilds found the Zionist Congress to promote Zionism (a political movement with the sole aim of moving all Jews into a singularly Jewish nation state) and arrange its first meeting in Munich. However due to extreme opposition from local Jews, who are quite happy where they are, this meeting has to be moved to Basle, Switzerland and takes place on 29 August. The meeting is chaired by Ashkenazi Jew, Theodor Herzl, who would state in his diaries, \"It is essential that the sufferings of Jews\u2026.become worse\u2026.this will assist in realization of our plans\u2026.I have an excellent idea\u2026.I shall induce anti-Semites to liquidate Jewish wealth\u2026.The anti-Semites will assist us thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews. The anti-Semites shall be our best friends.\"Herzl is subsequently elected President of the Zionist Organisation which adopts the, \"Rothschild Red Hexagram or Sign,\" as the Zionist flag which 51 years later will end up as the flag of Israel. Edward Henry Harriman becomes a director of the Union Pacific Railroad and goes on to take control of the Southern Pacific Railroad. This is all financed by the Rothschilds. 1898: Ferdinand de Rothschild dies. 1901: The Jews from the colonies set up in Palestine by Edmond James de Rothschild, send a delegation to him which tell him, \"If you wish to save the Yishuv (The Jewish settlement) first take your hands from it, and\u2026for once permit the colonists to have the possibility of correcting for themselves what needs correcting.\"Edmond James de Rothschild is very angry about this and states, \"I created the Yishuv, I alone. Therefore no men, neither colonists nor organisations have the right to interfere in my plans.\"The Rothschild banking house in Frankfurt, Germany, M. A. von Rothschild und S\u00f6hne, closes as there is no male Rothschild heir to take it on. 1902: Philippe de Rothschild born. 1905: A group of Rothschild backed Zionist Jews led by Georgi Apollonovich Gapon attempt to overthrow the Tsar in Russia in a Communist Coup. They fail and are forced to flee Russia only to be given refuge in Germany. The Jewish Encyclopaedia (Vol. 2, p.497) states, \"It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure.\"1906: The Rothschilds claim that due to growing instability in the region and increasing competition from Rockefeller (the Rockefeller family are Rothschild descendants through a female bloodline) owned Standard Oil, this is why they sell their Caspian and Black Sea Petroleum Company to Royal Dutch and Shell. This is another example of the Rothschilds trying to hide their true wealth. 1907: Rothschild, Jacob Schiff, the head of Kuhn, Loeb and Co., in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce, warns that, \"Unless we have a Central Bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history.\"Suddenly America finds itself in the middle of another typical run of the mill Rothschild engineered financial crisis, which ruins as usual ruins the lives of millions of innocent people throughout America and makes billions for the Rothschilds. 1909: Jacob Schiff founds the National Advancement for the Association of the Coloured People (NAACP). This was done to incite black people into roiting, looting and other forms of disorder, in order to cause a rift between the black and white communities. Jewish historian, Howard Sachar, states the following in his book, \"A History of the Jews in America,\" \"In 1914, Professor Emeritus Joel Spingarn of Columbia University became chairman of the NAACP and recruited for its board such Jewish leaders as Jacob Schiff, Jacob Billikopf, and Rabbi Stephen Wise.\"Other Ashkenazi Jew co-founders included Julius Rosenthal, Lillian Wald and Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch. It was not until 1920 that the NAACP appointed its first black president, James Weldon Johnson. Maurice de Rothschild marries Ashkenazi Jew, No\u00e9mie Halphen. 1911: Werner Sombart, in his book, \"The Jews and Modern Capitalism,\" stated that from 1820 on, it was the, \"Age of the Rothschild,\" and concluded that there was, \"Only one power in Europe, and that is Rothschild.\"1912: In the December issue of, \"Truth,\" magazine, George R. Conroy states of banker Jacob Schiff, \"Mr Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb, and co, which represents the Rothschilds interests on this side of the Atlantic.He has been described as financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the great impersonal power known as Standard Oil. He was hand in glove with the Harrimans, the Goulds, and the Rockefellers in all their railroad enterprises and has become the dominant power in the railroad and financial power of America.\"1913: On March 4, Woodrow Wilson is elected the 28th President of the United States. Shortly after he is inaugurated, he is visited in the White House by Ashkenazi Jew, Samuel Untermyer, of law firm, Guggenheim, Untermyer, and Marshall, who tries to blackmail him for the sum of $40,000 in relation to an affair Wilson had whilst he was a professor at Princeton University, with a fellow professor's wife. President Wilson does not have the money, so Untermyer volunteers to pay the $40,000 out of his own pocket to the woman Wilson had had the affair with, on the condition that Wilson promise to appoint to the first vacancy on the United States Supreme Court a nominee to be recommended to President Wilson by Untermyer. Wilson agrees to this. Jacob Schiff sets up the Anti Defamation League (ADL) in the United States. This organisation is formed to slander anyone who questions or challenges the Rothschild global conspiracy as, \"anti-semitic.\" Strangely enough, the same year that they do this they also set up their last and current central bank in America, the Federal Reserve. Congressman Charles Lindbergh stated following the passing of the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, \"The Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President signs this Bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized.......The greatest crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.\"It is important to note that the Federal Reserve is a private company, it is neither Federal nor does it have any Reserve. It is conservatively estimated that profits exceed $150 billion per year and the Federal Reserve has never once in its history published accounts. 1914:  The start of World War I. In this war, the German Rothschilds loan money to the Germans, the British Rothschilds loan money to the British, and the French Rothschilds loan money to the French. Futhermore, the Rothschilds have control of the three European news agencies, Wolff (est. 1849) in Germany, Reuters (est. 1851) in England, and Havas (est. 1835) in France. The Rothschilds use Wolff to manipulate the German people into a fervour for war. From around this time, the Rothschilds are rarely reported in the media, because they own the media. 1916: On June 4, Ashkenazi Jew, Louis Dembitz Brandeis is appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States by President Wilson as per his agreed blackmail payment to Samuel Untermyer some three years earlier. Justice Brandeis is also the elected leader of the Executive Committee for Zionist Affairs, a position he has held since 1914. The middle of World War II. Germany were winning the war as they were being financed by the Rothschilds to a greater extent than France, Italy and England, because Rothschilds, did not want to support the Tsar in Russia, and of course Russia was on the same side as France, Italy and England. Then a significant event occurred. Germany, although they were winning the war and not one foreign soldier had set foot on their soil, offered armistice to Britain with no requirement of reparations. The Rothschilds were anxious to make sure this didn't happen as they were expecting to make far more money off this war, so they played another card they had up their sleeve. Whilst the British were considering Germany's offer, Rothschild agent Louis Brandeis sends a Zionist delegation from America to Britain to promise to bring America into the war on the side of the British, provided the British agree to give the land of Palestine to the Rothschilds. The Rothschilds wanted Palestine for the following reason. They had great business interests in the far east and desired their own state in that area along with their own military which they could use as an aggressor to any state that threatened those interests. The British subsequently agree to the deal for Palestine and the Zionists in London contact their counterparts in America and inform them of this fact. Suddenly all the major newspapers in America that up to that point had been pro-German turned on Germany running propaganda pieces such as: German soldiers were killing Red Cross Nurses; German soldiers were cutting off babies hands, etc, in order to manipulate the American public against the Germans. This same year, President Woodrow Wilson, ran a re-election campaign under the slogan, \"Re-Elect The Man Who Will Keep Your Sons Out Of The War.\" On December 12, Germany and her allies offer peace terms to end the war. 1917:  As a result of Germany's offer of peace the Rothschild war machine goes into overdrive in America, spreading propaganda which leads to President Wilson under the instructions of American Zionist leader and Supreme Court Justice, Louis Dembitz Brandeis, reneging on his promise to the electorate and taking America into the first world war on April 6. As per the Rothschild Zionist promise to the British, to take America into the war, they decide they want something in writing from the British to prove that they will uphold their side of the bargain. The British Foreign Secretary, Arthur James Balfour therefore drafts a letter which is commonly known as the, \"Balfour Declaration,\" which is reprinted below. Foreign OfficeNovember 2nd, 1917 Dear Lord Rothschild, I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet. His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation. Yours sincerely, Arthur James Balfour The Rothschilds order the execution by the Bolsheviks they control, of Tsar Nicholas II and his entire family in Russia, even though the Tsar had already abdicated on March 2. This is both to get control of the country and an act of revenge for Tsar Alexander I blocking their world government plan in 1815 at the Congress Of Vienna, and Tsar Alexander II siding with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864. It is extremely important for them to slaughter the entire family including women and children in order to make good on the promise to do so made by Nathan Mayer Rothschild in 1815. It is designed to show the world what happens if you ever attempt to cross the Rothschilds. U.S. Congressman Oscar Callaway informs Congress that J. P. Morgan is a Rothschild front and has taken control of the American media industry. He states, \"In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, shipbuilding, and powder interest, and their subsidiary organizations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press......They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers...An agreement was reached. The policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month, an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies, and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers.\" 1919: In January, Ashkenazi Jews, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, are killed as they attempt to lead another Rothschild funded Communist coup, this time in Berlin, Germany. The Versailles peace conference is held to decide reparations that the Germans need to pay to the victors following the end of the first world war. A delegation of 117 Zionists headed up by Ashkenazi Jew, Bernard Baruch, bring up the subject of the promise of Palestine for them. At this point the Germans realised why America had turned on them and under whose influence, the Rothschilds. The Germans, naturally, felt they had been betrayed by the Zionists. This is because, at the time the Rothschilds made their deal with Britain for Palestine, in exchange for bringing America into the war, Germany was the most friendly country in the world towards the Jews, indeed the German Emancipation Edict of 1822 guaranteed Jews in Germany all civil rights enjoyed by Germans. Also, Germany was the only country in Europe which did not place restrictions on Jews, even giving them refuge when they had to flee from Russia after their first attempted Communist coup failed there in 1905. Nevertheless, the Rothschilds had held up their side of the bargain to spill the blood of millions of innocents and as a result, Palestine is confirmed as a Jewish homeland, and whilst its handover to the Rothschilds takes place it is to remain under the control of Britain as the Rothschilds control Britain. At that time less than one percent of the population of Palestine was Jewish. Interestingly, the host of the Versailles peace conference is its boss, Baron Edmond de Rothschild. The Versailles peace conference is also used as an attempt by the Rothschilds to set up a world government under the pretext of ending all wars (which they create). This was called the, \"League of Nations.\" Fortunately not enough countries accepted it and so it soon died. On March 29th The Times of London reports on the Bolsheviks in Russia, \"One of the curious features of the Bolshevist movement is the high percentage of non Russian elements among its leaders. Of the twenty or thirty commissaries, or leaders, who provide the central machinery of the Bolshevist movement, not less than 75% were Jews.\"It is reported that the Rothschilds were angry with the Russians because they were not prepared to allow them to form a central bank within their nation. They therefore gathered groups of Jewish spies and sent them into Russia to drum up a revolution for the benefit of the common man, which was actually a takeover of Russia by a Rothschild controlled satanic elite. These Jewish spies were, in age old deceptive Ashkenazi tradition, given Russian names, for example Trotsky was a member of the first group and his original name was Bronstein. These groups were sent to areas throughout Russia to incite riots and rebellion. The Jewish Post International Edition, week ending January 24th 1991, confirms Vladimir Lenin was Jewish. Lenin is also on record as having stated, \u201cThe establishment of a central bank is 90% of communizing a nation.\u201dThese Jewish, Rothschild funded Bolsheviks would go on in the course of history to slaughter 60 million Christians and Non-Jews in Soviet controlled territory. Indeed the author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his work, \u201cGulag Archipelago, Vol 2,\u201d affirms that Zionist Jews created and administered the organized Soviet concentration camp system in which these tens of millions of Christians and Non-Jews died. On page 79 of this book he even names the administrators of this the greatest killing machine in the history of the world. They are Aron Solts, Yakov Rappoport, Lazar Kogan, Matvei Berman, Genrikh Yagoda, and Naftaly Frenkel. All six are Zionist Jews. In 1970 Solzhenitsyn would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for literature. N. M. Rothschild & Sons\u2019 are given a permanent role to fix the world\u2019s daily gold price. This takes place in the City of London offices, daily at 1100 hours, in the same room until 2004. 1920: Winston Churchill (whose mother, Jenny (Jacobson) Jerome, was Jewish \u2013 meaning he is Jewish under Ashkenazi law as he was born of a Jewish mother) writes in an article in the Illustrated Sunday Herald, dated February 8th, \"From the days of Illuminati leader Weishaupt, to those of Karl Marx, to those of Trotsky, this worldwide conspiracy has been steadily growing.And now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America, have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.\" 1921: Under the orders of Jacob Schiff the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is founded by Ashkenazi Jews, Bernard Baruch and Colonel Edward Mandell House. Schiff gave his orders prior to his death in 1920, as he knew an organisation in America needed to be set up to select politicians to carry on the Rothschild conspiracy,and the formation of the CFR was actually agreed in a meeting on May 30, 1919 at the Hotel Majestic in Paris, France. The CFR membership at the start was approximately 1000 people in the United States. This membership included the heads of virtually every industrial empire in America, all the American based international bankers, and the heads of all their tax free foundations. In essence all those people who would provide the capital required for anyone who wished to run for Congress, the Senate or the Presidency. The first job of the CFR was to gain control of the press. This task was given to John D. Rockefeller who set up a number of national news magazines such as Life, and Time. He financed Samuel Newhouse to buy up and establish a chain of newspapers all across the country, and Eugene Meyer also who would go on to buy up many publications such as the Washington Post, Newsweek, ant The Weekly Magazine. The CFR also needed to gate control of radio, television and the motion picture industry. This task was split amongst the international bankers from, Kuhn Loeb, Goldman Sachs, the Warburgs, and the Lehmanns. 1925: This year's Jewish Encyclopaedia, states of the existence of Ashkenazi Jews (who represent approximately 90% of so-called world Jewry), with the startling admission that the so called enemy of the Jews, Esau (also known as Edom, see Genesis 36:1), now actually represents the Jewish race, when on page 42 of Volume V it is stated, \"Edom is in modern Jewry.\"So what they're basically saying is that these Ashkenazi Jews, who represent 90% of the so-called Jewish population, are actually gentiles or goyim themselves. 1926: N. M. Rothschild & Sons refinance the Underground Electric Railways Company of London Ltd which has a controlling interest in the entire London Underground transport system. Maurice de Rothschild has a son, Edmond de Rothschild. 1929:  The Rothschilds crash the United States economy by contracting the money supply. 1930: The first Rothschild world bank, the, \"Bank for International Settlements (BIS),\" is established in Basle, Switzerland. The same place as where 33 years earlier the first ever World Zionist Congress was held. 1933: On January 30, Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany. He drives Jews, many of which were Communist out of Governmental positions within Germany. As a result of this, in July, the Jews hold a World Conference in Amsterdam during which they demand that Hitler re-instate every Jew back to his former position. Hitler refuses and as a result of this, Samuel Untermyer, the Ashkenazi Jew who blackmailed President Wilson, and is now the head of the American delegation and the president of the whole conference, returns to the United States, and makes a speech on radio which was transcribed in the From the New York Times, Monday, August 7, 1933. In the speech he made the following statements, \"...the Jews are the aristocrats of the world...Our campaign is...the economic boycott against all German goods, shipping and services...What we are proposing...is to prosecute a purely defensive economic boycott that will undermine the Hitler regime and bring the German people to their senses by destroying their export trade on which their very existence depends......Each of you, Jew and Gentile alike...must refuse to deal with any merchant or shopkeeper who sells any German-made goods or who patronizes German ships or shipping.\" As two thirds of Germany's food supply had to be imported, and could only be imported with the proceeds of what they exported, if Germany could not export, two thirds of Germany's population would starve, as there would be not enough food for more than one third of the population. As a result of this boycott, Jews throughout America, would protest outside and damage any stores in which they found any products with, \"Made in Germany,\" printed on them, causing stores to have to dump these products or risk bankruptcy. Once the effects of this boycott began to be felt in Germany, the Germans, who had demonstrated no violence towards the Jews up to this point, simply began boycotting Jewish stores in the same way the Jews had done to stores selling German products in America. Rothschild financed IBM, supply machines to the Nazis which produce punch cards to help organize and manage the initial identification and social expulsion of Jews, the confiscation of their property and their extermination. On November 16, President Roosevelt recognizes the Zionist regime of Stalin in Russia without consultation with Congress even as 8,000 Ukrainians march in protest in New York. Also this year, President Roosevelt, born of a Jewish mother, therefore satisfying Ashkenazi rules of being Jewish, orders the all-seeing eye to be placed upon all new dollar bills along with the motto, \"Novus Ordo Seclorum.\" This is latin for, \"A New Order of the Ages.\" 1934: Swiss banking secrecy laws are reformed and it becomes an offence resulting in imprisonment for any bank employee to violate bank secrecy. This is all in preparation for the Rothschild engineered Second World War in which as usual they will fund both sides. Edmond de Rothschild dies. 1936: With regard to the increase in anti-semitism in Germany, Samuel Landman (at the time, secretary to the World Zionist Organisation), in his 1936 book, Great Britain, The Jews, and Palestine states the following of the United States entry into World War 1, \"The fact that it was Jewish help that brought USA into the War on the side of the Allies has rankled ever since in German \u2013 especially Nazi \u2013 minds, and has contributed in no small measure to the prominence which anti-Semitism occupies in the Nazi programme.\"1938: On 7th November, a Jew, Herschel Grynszpan, assassinated Ernst vom Rath, a minor official at the German Embassy in Paris. As a result of this German hostility towards Jews in Germany started to turn violent. The Rothschilds Austrian banking house in Vienna, S. M. von Rothschild und S\u00f6hne, closes following the Nazi occupation of Austria. 1939: I.G. Farben the leading producer of chemicals in the world and largest German producer of steel dramatically increases its production. This increased production is almost exclusively used to arm Germany for the Second World War. This company was controlled by the Rothschilds and would go on to use Jews and other disaffected peoples as slave labour in the concentration camps. I.G. Farben also created the lethal Zyklon B gas that was used to exterminate the Jews. On 1 September, the Second world war starts when Germany invades Poland. This was because the German leadership were a Christian leadership, who understood that Soviet Russia was led by Rothschild funded Communists, and they feared that as the Soviet Union grew in strength, these Jewish Communists would invade and wipe all the Christians off the map. 1940: Hansjurgen Koehler in his book, \"Inside The Gestapo,\" states the following, of Maria Anna Schicklgruber, Adolf Hitler's grandmother, \"A little servant girl\u2026\u2026.came to Vienna and became a domestic servant\u2026\u2026.at the Rothschild mansion\u2026\u2026.and Hitler\u2019s unknown grandfather must be probably looked for in this magnificent house.\"This is backed up by Walter Langer in his book, \"The Mind Of Hitler,\" in which he states, \"Adolf\u2019s father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber\u2026\u2026.Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at the time she conceived. At that time she was employed as a servant in the home of Baron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back home\u2026\u2026.where Alois was born.\"On the surface, it would appear Hitler was unlikely to be a Rothschild, but then again, when you discover the benefits that the Rothschilds got out of this war, both financially and politically, a Rothschild connection does not appear as outlandish as it may initially seem. 1941: President Roosevelt takes America into the second world war by refusing to sell Japan any more steel scrap or oil. Japan was in the midst of a war against China and without that scrap steel and oil, Japan would be unable to continue that war. Japan was totally dependent upon the United States for both steel scrap and oil. Roosevelt knew this action would provoke the Japanese to attack America, which they subsequently did at Pearl Harbor. 1942: Prescott Bush, father of future American Presidents\u2019 George Herbert Walker and George W, has his company seized under the, \u201cTrading With The Enemy,\u201d Act. He was funding Hitler from America, whilst American soldiers were being killed by German soldiers. Jews are also being slaughtered by these same soldiers. Interestingly the ADL never criticizes any of the Bushes for this. 1943: February 18th, Zionist, Izaak Greenbaum, head of the Jewish Agency Rescue Committee, in a speech to the Zionist Executive Council states, \u201cIf I am asked, could you give from the UJA (United Jewish Appeal) monies to rescue Jews, I say, no and I say again no!\u201dHe would go onto state, \u201cOne cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Poland!\u201dThis is not a surprise, the whole idea of Zionist support for the slaughter of innocent Jews was to scare the survivors into believing that their only place of safety was Israel. How else do you think the Zionists could ensure Jews leave the beautiful European cities in which they live, in order to settle in a desert! 1944: On 6 November Lord Moyne, British Minister Resident in the Middle East was assassinated in Cairo by two members of the Jewish terrorist group, the Stern Gang, led by future Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Shamir. He is also responsible for an assassination attempt against Harold MacMichael, the High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine, this same year. Interestingly he also masterminds another successful assassination this year against the United Nations representative in the Middle East, Count Folke Bernadotte who, although he had secured the release of 21,000 prisoners from German camps during World War II, was seen by Yitzak Shamir and his terrorist collaborators as an anti-Zionist. In Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, two further Rothschild world banks are created. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. 1945: The end of the Second World War. It is reported that I.G. Farben plants were specifically not targeted in the bombing raids on Germany. Interestingly at the end of the war, they were found to have only sustained 15% damage. The tribunals held at the end of the Second World War, to investigate Nazi War Crimes, censored any materials recording Western assistance to Hitler. The Rothschilds take a giant step towards their goal of world domination when the second, \"League of Nations,\" called the, \"United Nations,\" was approved this year. 1946: On July 22 the future Prime Minister of Israel, Ashkenazi Jew, David Ben-Gurion, orders another future Prime Minister of Israel, Ashkenazi Jew, Menachem Begin, to carry out a terrorist attack on the King David Hotel in Palestine, to try and drive out the British. As a result of this 91 people were killed, most of them civilians: 28 British, 41 Arabs, 17 Jews, and 5 others. Around 45 people are injured. Menachem Begin went on to proudly proclaimed himself as, \"the father of modern terrorism.\" Just to put the gravity of the attack on the King David Hotel into perspective, it was at the time the biggest death toll as a result of single terrorist action ever and was only surpassed over forty years later by the Bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie. 1947: The British who prior to World War 2 declared that there would be no more immigration of Jews to Palestine in order to protect the Palestinians from their acts of terror against both them and British soldiers, transfer control of Palestine to the United Nations. The United Nations resolve to have Palestine partitioned into two states, one zionist and one arab, with Jerusalem to remain as an international zone to be enjoyed by all religious faiths. This transfer was scheduled to take place on May 15, 1948. The United Nations had no right to give Arab property to anyone, as indeed even thought the Jews owned 6% of Palestine at that time, resolution 181 granted the Jews 57% of the land leaving the Arabs who at that time had 94% with only 43%. Information collected by the ADL in its spy operations on US citizens is used by the House Select Committee on Unamerican Activities. Subcommittee Chair Clare Hoffman dismisses the ADL\u2019s reports on suspected communists as \"hearsay.\" 1948: In the Spring of this year, the Rothschilds bribe President Harry S. Truman (33rd President of the United States 1945 \u2013 1953) to recognise Israel (Rothschild owned Zionist not Jewish territory) as a sovereign state with $2,000,000 which they give to him on his campaign train. They then declare Israel to be a sovereign Jewish state in Palestine and within half an hour President Truman declared the United States to be the first foreign nation to recognise it. The Flag of Israel is unveiled. Despite tremendous opposition the emblem on the flag is a blue coloured version of the Rothschild, \"Red Hexagram or Sign.\" This angers many Jews who realise this Hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions as the symbol of, \"Moloch,\" (described as a demon of unwilling sacrifice and is also interestingly the name of the stone owl the elite worship at Bohemian Grove), and, \"Astaroth,\" (described as the Lord Treasurer of Hell). The Hexagram was also used to represent Saturn, which has been identified as the esoteric name for, \"Satan.\" This indicates that anyone killed in the name of Israel is actually a sacrifice to Satan. These dissenting Jews believe the, \"Menorah,\" the oldest Jewish symbol should be used and pointed out that the Hexagram is not even a Jewish symbol, but of course as the Rothschild Zionists use it that is what ends up on the Rothschild, I mean Zionist, I mean Israeli flag. In the early hours of April 19, 132 Jewish terrorists from the Irgun gang, led by future Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and the Stern gang, led by future Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, brutally massacre 200 men, women and children as they are sleeping peacefully in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. Following the United Nations transfer of Palestine to an independent Jewish state and an independent Arab state on May 15, the Israelis launched a military assault on the Arabs with blaring loudspeakers on their trucks informing the Arabs that if they did not flee immediately, they would be slaughtered. 800,000 Arabs with the recent memory of the Deir Yassin massacre at the forefront of their minds, fled in panic. They asked for help from nighbouring Arab states, but those states did not get involved as they were no match for the Israelis whose up to date military hardware had been supplied by the Jewish Stalinist regime in Russia. Following this assault, the Jews now controlled 78% of the former Palestine as oppose to the 57% that had been given to them illegally by the United Nations. The Palestinians, many of them Christians, were never paid compensation for their homes, property and businesses stolen from them during this illegal Jewish assault, and these people ended up in slum refugee cities of tents. Futhermore at least half of the Palestinians in their hurry to flee, left their birth certificates behind. The State of Israel then passed a law that only those who could prove citizenship were allowed to return to Israel, thus meaning these 400,000 Palestinians could not return and lost all their property they had left there. Ashkenazi Jew, David Ben-Gurion, one of the father founders of Israel and its first Prime Minister, candidly describes Zionist aims in his diary (21 May 1948) as follows, \u201cThe Achilles heel of the Arab coalition is the Lebanon. Muslim supremacy in this country is artificial and can easily be overthrown. A Christian State ought to be set up there, with its southern frontier on the river Litani.We would sign a treaty of alliance with this State. Thus when we have broken the strength of the Arab Legion and bombed Amman, we could wipe out Trans-Jordan, after that Syria would fall. And if Egypt still dared to make war on us, we would bomb Port Said, Alexandria and Cairo. We should thus end the war and would have but paid to Egypt, Assyria and Chaldea on behalf of our ancestors.\u201d1949: On October 1, Mao Tse Tsung declares the founding of the People's Republic Of China in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. He is funded by Rothschild created Communism in Russia and also the following Rothschild agents: Solomon Adler, a former United States Treasury official who was a Soviet Spy; Israel Epstein, the son of a Jewish Bolshevik imprisoned by the Tsar in Russia for trying to forment a revolution there; and Frank Coe, a leading official of the Rothschild owned IMF. 1950: Israel passes their law of return, guaranteeing every Jew worldwide the right to dwell in the state of Israel, however the Palestinians even though they had lived there for 1300 years, were denied that right. John Davitt, former chief of the Justice Department's internal security section notes that the Israeli intelligence service is the second most active in the United States after the Soviets and of course both Israel and the Soviet Union are run by an Ashkenazi Jewish leadership. 1951: On 1 April the Israeli Secret Intelligence Agency the Mossad, which will go on to terrorize the world, is formed. The motto of the Mossad is probably the most disgusting secret service motto in the world, it is, \"By Way Of Deception,\nThou Shalt Do War.\" 1953: N. M. Rothschild & Sons found the British Newfoundland Corporation Limited to develop 60,000 square miles of land in Newfoundland, Canada, which comprised a power station to harness the power of the Hamilton (later renamed Churchill) Falls. At the time this was the largest construction project ever to be undertaken by a private company. 1954: \"The Lavon Affair.\" Israeli agents recruit Egyptian citizens of Jewish descent to bomb Western targets in Egypt, and plant evidence to frame Arabs, in an apparent attempt to upset American/Egyptian relations. Israeli defense minister, Ashkenazi Jew, Pinhas Lavon is eventually removed from office, though many think real responsibility lay with David Ben-Gurion. A hidden microphone planted by the Israelis is discovered in the Office of the US Ambassador in Tel Aviv. 1955: Edmond de Rothschild founds Compagnie Financiere, Paris. 1956: Telephone taps are found connected to two telephones in the residence of the US military attach\u00e9 in Tel Aviv. 1957: James de Rothschild dies and it is reported (by the Rothschild owned media) that he bequeaths a large sum of money to the state of Israel to pay for the construction of their parliament building, the Knesset. He states that the Knesset should be, \"a symbol, in the eyes of all men, of the permanence of the State of Israel.\"On page 219 of his book, \"Tales of the British Aristocracy,\" L.G. Pine, the Editor of Burke\u2019s Peerage, states that the Jews, \"have made themselves so closely connected with the British peerage that the two classes are unlikely to suffer loss which is not mutual. So closely linked are the Jews and the lords that a blow against the Jews in this country would not be possible without injuring the aristocracy also.\"Maurice de Rothschild dies in Paris. 1962: de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res establishes Im\u00e9tal as an umbrella company for all their mineral mining interests. Frederic Morton publishes his book, The Rothschilds, in which he states, \"Though they control scores of industrial, commercial, mining and tourist corporations, not one bears the name Rothschild. Being private partnerships, the family houses never need to, and never do, publish a single public balance sheet, or any other report of their financial condition.\"This attitude reveals the true aim of the Rothschilds, to eliminate all competition and create their own worldwide monopoly. 1963: On June 4th President John F. Kennedy (the 35th President of the United States 1961 \u2013 1963) signs Executive Order 11110 which returned to the U.S. government the power to issue currency, without going through the Rosthchilds owned Federal Reserve. Less than 6 months later on November 22nd , president Kennedy is assassinated by the Rothschilds for the same reason as they assassinated President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, he wanted to print American money for the American people, as oppose to for the benefit of a money grabbing war mongering foreign elite. This Executive Order 11110, is rescinded by President Lyndon Baines Johnson (the 36th President of the United States 1963 to 1969) on Air Force One from Dallas to Washington, the same day as President Kennedy was assassinated. Another, and probably the primary, reason for Kennedy's assassination is however, the fact that he made it quite clear to Israeli Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, that under no circumstances would he agree to Israel becoming a nuclear state. The Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz on February 5, 1999, in a review of, Avner Cohen's book, \"Israel and the Bomb,\" states the following, \"The murder of American President John F. Kennedy brought to an abrupt end the massive pressure being applied by the U.S. administration on the government of Israel to discontinue the nuclear program...The book implied that, had Kennedy remained alive, it is doubtful whether Israel would today have a nuclear option.\"Edmond de Rothschild establishes La Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Edmond de Rothschild (LCF), in Switzerland as a venture capital house. This later develops into an investment bank and asset management company with many affiliates. He also marries his wife Nadine and they have a son, Benjamin de Rothschild. 1965: Israel illegally obtains enriched uranium from NUMEC (Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation). 1967: The treatment of the Palestinians by the Zionist Jews, finally ignites enough anger in the Arab world for Egypt, Jordan and Syria to mobilise on Israel's borders. All of these three countries are suddenly attacked by Israel and as a result the Sinai which included Gaza was stolen from Egypt, and the West Bank and the Jordan River stolen from Jordan. As a result of this, on June 8, the Israelis launch an attack on the USS Liberty with Israeli aircraft and motor torpedo boats, in an effort to blame it on Egypt, to bring America into the war on their side, and of course follow to the letter, their Mossad motto, \"By Way Of Deception,\nThou Shalt Do War.\" As a result of their attack, 34 American servicemen were killed and 174 wounded. Israel lies as usual, claiming it mistook this warship that was flying a large United States flag, for an ancient out-of-service Egyptian horse carrier El Quseir, that was 180 feet shorter. They also claim the ship was in the war zone, when it was actually in international waters, far from any fighting. The Israeli's attack on this warship lasts for 75 minutes during which time they shoot up one of the United States flags, resulting in the sailors desperately raising another one. In the aftermath of this attack, the American sailors who survived are warned by the United States military not to discuss the matter with anyone due to, \"national security.\" This story gets no prominence in the Rothschild controlled mainstream media and as usual Israel is in no way even rebuked for their crimes by their subservient country of America. The following day, June 9th, Israel illegally occupies the Golan Heights which it seizes from Syria. This area goes on to provide Israel with one third of its fresh water. Israeli General Matityahu Peled, is quoted in Ha'aretz (19 March 1972) with the following statement, \"The thesis that the danger of genocide was hanging over us in June 1967 and that Israel was fighting for its physical existence is only bluff, which was born and developed after the war.\" Another sickening and deceptive statement but again at least he's consistent with the Mossad motto, \"By Way Of Deception, Thou Shalt Do War.\"de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res is renamed Banque Rothschild. 1968: No\u00e9mie Halphen, wife of Maurice de Rothschild dies. 1970: While working for Senator Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson, Ashkenazi Jew, Richard Perle is caught by the FBI giving classified information to Israel. Nothing is done. British Prime Minister Edward Heath makes Lord Victor Rothschild the head of his policy unit. Whilst he is in that role Britain enters the European Community. 1973: In his book, None Dare Call It Conspiracy, Gary Allen states, \"One major reason for the historical blackout on the role of the international bankers in political history is the Rothschilds were Jewish\u2026\u2026.The Jewish members of the conspiracy have used an organisation called The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as an instrument to try and convince everyone that any mention of the Rothschilds and their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this way they have stifled almost all honest scholarship on international bankers and made the subject taboo within universities. Any individual or book exploring this subject is immediately attacked by hundreds of ADL communities all over the country. The ADL has never let the truth or logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs\u2026 \u2026.Actually, nobody has a right to be more angry at the Rothschild clique than their fellow Jews\u2026 \u2026.The Rothschild empire helped finance Adolf Hitler.\"\u201d George J. Laurer an employee of the Rothschilds controlled IBM, invents the UPC (Universal Product Code) barcode which will eventually be placed upon every item traded worldwide and bear the number, 666. The Book of Revelation, Chapter 13, Verse 17 through 18, states the following in relation to this number, \"And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\" The whole Satanic aims of the Rothschilds are now in full view of the world, everything bought or sold carries the mark of the beast, 666. N. M. Rothschild & Sons British Newfoundland Corporation, Churchill Falls project in Newfoundland, Canada, is completed. N. M. Rothschild & Sons also create a new asset management part of the company which traded worldwide. This eventually became, Rothschild Private Management Limited. Edmond de Rothschild, a great-grandson of Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild, bought the cru bourgeois estate of Ch\u00e2teau Clarke in Bordeaux. 1976: Ashkenazi Jew, Harold Rosenthal, aide to Ashkenazi Jew, Senator Jacob Javits, states, \"Most Jews do not like to admit it, but our god is Lucifer.\"1978: Ashkenazi Jew, Stephen Bryen, then a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer, is overheard in a Washington D.C. hotel offering confidential documents to top Israeli military officials. Bryen obtains a lawyer, Nathan Lewin, and the case heads for the grand jury, but is mysteriously dropped. Bryen later goes to work for Richard Perle. 1979: The Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979 was underwritten by United States aid which pledged $3 billion annually to Israel from the United States taxpayer (not even a drop in the ocean when you consider the amount they make off the Federal Reserve). Shin Bet (the Israeli internal security agency) tries to penetrate the US Consulate General in Jerusalem through a \u201cHoney Trap\u201d, using a clerical employee who was having an affair with a Jerusalem girl. Baron and Baroness Phillipi de Rothschild in a joint venture with Robert Mondavi, begin the construction of a pyramid in Napa Valley, California, where the leader/founder of the Church Of Satan, Ashkenazi Jew, Anton LaVey, was based. This is known as Opus 1 (which means, the first work), and the front for this temple is that it is a winery. 1980: The global phenomenon of privatisation starts. The Rothschilds are behind this from the very beginning in order to seize control of all publicly owned assets worldwide. 1981: Banque Rothschild is nationalised by the French government. The new bank is called, Compagnie Europ\u00e9enne de Banque. The Rothschilds subsequently set up a successor to this French bank, Rothschild & Cie Banque (RCB), which goes on to become a leading French investment house. 1982: From September 16 to 18, future Prime Minister of Israel and then Defence Minister, Ashkenazi Jew, Ariel Sharon, orchestrates Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which provided ariel lighting in order to facilitate the killing of between 1000 and 2000 men, women and children in the Sabra and Shatila massacres. 1985: Eustace Mullins publishes, \"Who Owns The TV Networks,\" in which he reveals the Rothschilds have control of all three major U.S. Networks, which are: NBC; CBS; and ABC. The New York Times reports the FBI is aware of at least a dozen incidents in which American officials transferred classified information to the Israelis, quoting (former Assistant Director of the F.B.I.) Raymond Wannal. The Justice Department does not prosecute. Richard Smyth, the owner of MILCO, is indicted on charges of smuggling nuclear timing devices to Israel. N. M. Rothschild & Sons advise the British government on the privatisation of British Gas. They subsequently advise the British government on virtually all of their other privatisations of state owned assets including: British Steel; British Coal; all the British regional electricity boards; and all the British regional water boards. A British MP heavily involved in these privatisations is future Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, a former Rothschild banker. 1986: Mordechai Vanunu a technician at Dimona, Israel's nuclear installation, from 1976 to 1985, discovers that the plant was secretly producing nuclear weapons. His conscience made him speak out and in 1986 he provided the London Sunday Times with the facts and photos they used to tell the world about Israel's nuclear weapons programme. His evidence showed that Israel had stockpiled up to 200 nuclear warheads, with no debate or authorisation from it own citizens. On 30th September 1986, Vanunu was lured from London to Rome. There he was kidnapped, drugged and shipped to Israel. After a secret trial he was sentenced to 18 years for, \"treason,\" and, \"espionage,\" (something Israel are very familiar with) though he had received no payment and had communicated with no foreign power. He goes on to be held in complete isolation for 11 years, only allowed occasional visits from his family, lawyer and a priest, conducted through a metal screen. Although he completes his sentence, the Israeli government continues to hold him against his will. 1987: Edmond de Rothschild creates the World Conservation Bank which is designed to transfer debts from third world countries to this bank and in return those countries would give land to this bank. This is designed so the Rothschilds can gain control of the third world which represents 30% of the land surface of the Earth. On April 24 the Wall Street Journal reveals the, \"Role of Israel in Iran-Contra Scandal Won't be Explored in Detail by Panels.\" 1988: The ADL initiate a nationwide competition for law students to draft anti-hate legislation for minority groups. That competition is won by a man named, Joseph Ribakoff, whose thesis proposes that not only must hate motivated violence be banned, but also any words which stimulate: supiscion; friction; hate; and possible violence, these must also be criminalised. This ADL prize-winning paper suggests that not only should state-agencies monitor and restrict free speech in general, but they should also censor all films that criticize identifiable groups. Furthermore, even if the person making the statement can justify it, for example Christians criticizing homosexuality because the bible expressly forbids it, Ribakoff asserts that the truth is to be no defence in court. The only proof a court will need in order to secure a conviction of hate speech is that something has been said, and a minority group or member of such group has felt emotionally damaged as a result of such criticism. Therefore, under these proposals which the ADL will have forced into law all over the world less than 15 years later, Jesus Christ would have been arrested as a hate criminal. This law is designed to protect the Rothschild conspiracy from being revealed in that if you criticize the Rothschilds criminal cabal, you will be targeted as anti-semitic, and thus risk imprisonment. Philippe de Rothschild dies. 1989: Many of the satellite states in Eastern Europe, through the influence of Glasnost, become more open in their demands of freedom from Communist governance in their Republics. Many revolutions happen in 1989, most of them involving the overthrow of their respective Communist governments and the replacement of them with Republics. Thus, the hold the Communists had over Eastern Europe (the Iron Curtain) becomes very weak. Eventually, as a result of Perestroika and Glasnost, Communism collapses, not only in the Soviet Union but also in Eastern Europe. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin (whose wife is the daughter of Joseph Stalin\u2019s marriage to Rosa Kaganovich) and the Republican government takes steps to end the power of the Communist party by suspending and banning the party and seizing all their property. This symbolised the fall of Communism in Russia, and resulted in the start of a mass exodus of 700,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union to Israel. In the Israeli Journal, Hotam (24 November 1989), there is a report of a speech that then Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, Ashkenazi Jew, Binyamin Netanyahu, gave to students at Bar Ilan University in which he states, \"Israel should have exploited the repression of the demonstrations in China, when world attention focused on that country, to carry out mass expulsions among the Arabs of the territories.\"The London and Paris Rothschilds announce the launch of a new subsidiary, Rothschild GmbH, in Frankfurt, Germany. 1991: Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, on January 16 of this year the United States and Britain began an aerial bombing campaign of targets within Iraq. On 24 February the ground campaign commenced which was to last 100 hours until on February 28 when a horrendous war crime occurred. This crime was the slaughter of 150,000 Iraqi troops with fuel air bombs. These Iraqis were fleeing on a crowded highway from Kuwait to Basra. President George Herbert Walker Bush ordered United States military aircraft and ground units to kill these surrendering troops, they were then bulldozed into mass unmarked graves in the desert, some still alive. President Bush then ordered a cessation of hostilities. What was the significance of this slaughter and President Bush declaring the war over on this day? Well it was the day the, \"Day of Purim,\" fell on this year. This the day the Jews celebrate their victory over Ancient Babylon, now based within the borders of Iraq and a day when the Jews are encouraged to get bloody revenge against their perceived enemies. At the Bilderberg Conference on June 6 to 9 of this year, in Baden-Baden, Germany, David Rockefeller (a Rothschild) made the following statement, \"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world, if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years.But the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The super-national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practised in past centuries.\" 1992: In March, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Paul A. Volker became Chairman of the European banking firm, J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn and Co. Stephen Bryen, caught offering confidential documents to Israel in 1978, is serving on board of the pro-Israeli Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs while continuing as a paid consultant, with security clearance, on exports of sensitive US technology. \u201cThe Samson Option,\u201d by Seymour M. Hersh reports, \u201cIllicitly obtained intelligence was flying so voluminously from LAKAM (a secret Israeli intelligence unit, a Hebrew acronym for Scientific Liaison Bureau) into Israeli intelligence that a special code name, JUMBO, was added to the security markings already on the documents. There were strict orders, Ari Ben-Menashe recalled, \u201cAnything marked JUMBO was not supposed to be discussed with your American counterparts.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal reports that Israeli agents apparently tried to steal Recon Optical Inc's top-secret airborne spy-camera system. On September 16th Britain\u2019s pound collapses when currency speculators led by Rothschild agent, Ashkenazi Jew, George Soros, borrow pounds and sell them for Deutsche Marks, in the expectation of being able to repay the loan in devalued currency and to pocket the difference. This results in the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, announcing a rise in interest rates of 5% in one day and as a result drives Britain into a recession which lasts many years as large numbers of businesses fail and the housing market crashes. This is right on cue for the Rothschilds, after they had privatised Britain\u2019s state owned assets during the 1980\u2019s, driven the share price up, and then collapsed the markets so they could buy them up for pennies on the pound, a carbon copy of what Nathan Mayer Rothschild did to the British economy 180 years before, in 1812. It cannot be overstated that the Chancellor of the Exchequer at that time, Norman Lamont, prior to becoming a MP, was a Merchant Banker with N. M. Rothschild and Sons, who he joined after reading Economics at Cambridge. 1993: Norman Lamont leaves the British government to return to N. M. Rothschild and Sons as a director, after his mission to collapse the British economy to profit the Rothschilds is accomplished. Former Congressman, Paul Findley publishes his seminal book, Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About the U.S. Israeli Relationship. In this book he lists the 65 United Nations Member Resolutions against Israel from the period 1955 to 1992, and the 30 United States vetoes on Israel\u2019s behalf which if not made would have seen Israel have 95 resolutions against them at this point. No matter, even with Israel\u2019s puppet the United States helping them terrorise others, the 65 Resolutions passed against Israel are more than all the Resolutions passed against all other countries combined. Not that Israel care too much about the views of the United Nations when you consider that less than two weeks after Israel\u2019s attack on the USS Liberty (an attack designed to sink the Liberty and blame it on Egypt prompting the USA into a war with Egypt on behalf of Israeli Lies, remember the Mossad motto, \u201cBy Way Of Deception, Thou Shalt Do War\u201d), the Israeli Foreign Minister, Aba Eban, stated of the United Nations, \"If the General Assembly were to vote by 121 votes to 1 in favor of, \"Israel,\" returning to the armistice lines (pre June 1967 borders), \"Israel,\" would refuse to comply with the decision,\" New York Times \u2013 19 June 1967.The ADL is caught operating a massive spying operation on critics of Israel, Arab-Americans, the San Francisco Labor Council, ILWU Local 10, Oakland Educational Association, NAACP, Irish Northern Aid, International Indian Treaty Council, the Asian Law Caucus and the San Francisco Police. Data collected was sent to Israel and in some cases to South Africa. Pressure from Jewish organizations forces the city to drop the criminal case, but the ADL settles a civil lawsuit for an undisclosed sum of cash. 1995: Former atomic energy scientist, Dr Kitty Little claims the Rothschilds now control 80% of the world\u2019s uranium supplies giving them a monopoly over nuclear power. The Defense Investigative Service circulates a memo warning US military contractors that, \"Israel aggressively collects (US) military and industrial technology.\"The report stated that Israel obtains information using, \"ethnic targeting, financial aggrandizement, and identification and exploitation of individual frailties,\" of US citizens.1996: A General Accounting Office report, \"Defense Industrial Security: Weaknesses in US Security Arrangements With Foreign-Owned Defense Contractors,\" found that according to intelligence sources, \"Country A,\" (identified by intelligence sources as Israel, Washington Times, 22 February 1996), \"conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the United States of any US ally.\" A pdf file of the report is here: www.gao.gov/archive/1996/ns96064.pdfAn unformated text version is here: http://fas.org/man/gao/gao9664.htm\n The Jerusalem Post (30 August 1996) quoted the report, \"\u201cClassified military information and sensitive military technologies are high-priority targets for the intelligence agencies of this country.\"The report described, \"An espionage operation run by the intelligence organization responsible for collecting scientific and technologic information for (Israel) paid a US government employee to obtain US classified military intelligence documents.\" The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs (Shawn L. Twing, April 1996) noted that this was, \"a reference to the 1985 arrest of Jonathan Pollard, a civilian US naval intelligence analyst who provided Israel's LAKAM espionage agency an estimated 800,000 pages of classified US intelligence information.\" www.washington-report.org/backissues/0496/9604014.htm The GAO report also noted that, \"Several citizens of (Israel) were caught in the United States stealing sensitive technology used in manufacturing artillery gun tubes.\" An Office of Naval Intelligence document, \"Worldwide Challenges to Naval Strike Warfare\" reported that, \"US technology has been acquired (by China) through Israel in the form of the Lavi fighter and possibly SAM (surface-to-air) missile technology.\"Jane's Defense Weekly (28 February 1996) noted that, \"until now, the intelligence community has not openly confirmed the transfer of US technology (via Israel) to China.\" The report noted that this, \"represents a dramatic step forward for Chinese military aviation.\" (Flight International, 13 March 1996). Amschel Rothschild, 41, is strangled with the heavy cord of his own towel robe in his hotel room in Paris. French Prime Minister orders the French Police to close their investigation, and, Rupert Murdoch, born of a Jewish mother and so a Jew by Ashkenazi standards, instructs his editors and news managers around the world to report it as a heart attack, if they need to report it at all. On 12 May United Nations Ambassador and Ashkenazi Jew, Madeleine Albright, when appearing on 60 Minutes, was asked the following by correspondent Lesley Stahl, in reference to the years of United States led economic sanctions against Iraq, \"We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that is more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?\"To which Ambassador Albright replied, \"I think that is a very hard choice, but the price, we think, the price is worth it.\"Her comments cause no public outcry. In fact, the holocaust of half a million Iraqi children is positively admired by the United States government when you consider less than 8 months later, President Clinton appointed Albright as secretary of state. Whilst appearing before the Senate Committee, who were considering her appointment, Albright is literally chomping at the bit for the blood of more Iraqi children and she states, \"We will insist on maintaining tough UN sanctions against Iraq unless and until that regime complies with relevant Security Council resolutions.\"1997: An Army mechanical engineer, Ashkenazi Jew, David A. Tenenbaum, \"inadvertently,\" gives classified military information on missile systems and armored vehicles to Israeli officials (New York Times, 20 February 1997). The Washington Post reports US intelligence has intercepted a conversation in which two Israeli officials had discussed the possibility of getting a confidential letter that then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher had written to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. One of the Israelis, identified only as, \u201cDov,\u201d had commented that they may get the letter from, \u201cMega,\u201d the code name for Israel\u2019s top agent inside the United States. US ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, complains privately to the Israeli government about heavy-handed surveillance by Israeli intelligence agents. Israeli agents place a tap on Ashkenazi Jew and daughter of a Rabbi, Monica Lewinsky\u2019s, phone at the Watergate and record phone sex sessions between her and President Bill Clinton. The Ken Starr report confirms that Clinton warned Lewinsky their conversations were being taped and ended the affair. Interestingly, at the same time, the FBI\u2019s hunt for, \"Mega,\" is called off. On 29 October Edmond de Rothschild dies in Geneva. Interestingly on the exact same day Anton Szandor LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan also dies, who in his book, \"Satan Speaks,\" he states in relation to The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion, \"The first time I read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, my instinctive reaction was, So what's wrong with THAT? Isn't that the way any master plan should work? Doesn't the public deserve - nay, demand - such despotism?\"Kofi Annan becomes Secretary General to the United Nations. He is married to Nane Lagergren, a Rothschild, who he wed in 1984. 1998: The European Central Bank is set up in Frankfurt, the city from which the Rothschilds originate. 2000: George W. Bush is elected (so they tell me) President of the United States. Bush and his family claim to be descendants of the House of Plantagenet which is descended from the Royal House of Judah. 2001: On September 11th the attack on the World Trade Center is orchestrated by Israel with the complicity of Britain and America, under the orders of the Rothschilds as a pretext for removing the liberty of people worldwide in exchange for security, just as happened with the Reichstag fire in Germany where the citizens were lied to in order to give up liberty for security. They also will use the attacks to gain control of the few nations in the world who don\u2019t allow Rothschild central banks and so less than one month after these attacks, US forces attack Afghanistan, one of only 7 nations in the world who don\u2019t have a Rothschild controlled central bank. Less than a week before the 9-11 attack on 5 September, the so-called lead hijacker Mohamed Atta and several other hijackers made a still-unexplained visit onboard one of Pro Israeli lobbyist, Ashkenazi Jew, Jack Abramoff\u2019s casino boats. No investigation is undertook as to what they were doing there. It is discovered that US drug agents\u2019 communications have been penetrated. Suspicion falls on two companies, AMDOCS and Comverse Infosys, both owned by Israelis. AMDOCS generates billing data for most US phone companies and is able to provide detailed logs of who is talking to whom. Comverse Infosys builds the tapping equipment used by law enforcement to eavesdrop on all American telephone calls, but suspicion forms that Comverse Infosys, which gets half of its research and development budget from the Israeli government, has built a back door into the system that is being exploited by Israeli intelligence and that the information gleaned on US drug interdiction efforts is finding its way to drug smugglers. The investigation by the FBI leads to the exposure of the largest foreign spy ring ever uncovered inside the United States, operated by Israel. Half of the suspected spies have been arrested when 9-11 happens. On 9-11, 5 Israelis are arrested for dancing and cheering while the World Trade Towers collapse. Supposedly employed by Urban Moving Systems, the Israelis are caught with multiple passports and a lot of cash. Two of them are later revealed to be Mossad. As witness reports track the activity of the Israelis, it emerges that they were seen at Liberty Park at the time of the first impact, suggesting a foreknowledge of what was to come. The Israelis are interrogated, and then eventually sent back to Israel. The owner of the moving company used as a cover by the Mossad agents abandons his business and flees to Israel. The United States Government then classifies all of the evidence related to the Israeli agents and their connections to 9-11. All of this is reported to the public via a four part story on Fox News by Carl Cameron. Pressure from Jewish groups, primarily AIPAC, forces Fox News to remove the story from their website. Two hours prior to the 9-11 attacks, Odigo, an Israeli company with offices just a few blocks from the World Trade Towers, receives an advance warning via the internet. The manager of the New York Office provides the FBI with the IP address of the sender of the message, but the FBI does not follow this up. The FBI is investigating 5 Israeli moving companies as possible fronts for Israeli intelligence. It is revealed that prior to the attack millions of dollars of put options on both American Airlines and United Airlines, were traded. The FBI have promised to followed the purchasers up, but have never revealed their findings. That is because this would lead directly to Israel, the state behind the 911 attacks. Following the World Trade Center attack, anonymous letters containing anthrax are sent to various politicians and media executives. Like the 9-11 attack this is immediately blamed on Al-Qaeda , until it is discovered that the anthrax contained within those letters is a specific type of weaponized anthrax made by a United States military laboratory. The FBI then discover that the main suspect for these anthrax letters is a Ashkenazi Jew, Dr. Philip Zack, who had been reprimanded several times by his employers due to offensive remarks he made about Arabs. Dr. Philip Zack, was caught on camera entering the storage area where he worked at Fort Detrick which is where the Anthrax was kept. At this point, both the FBI and the mainstream media stopped making any public comments on the case. Jewish Defence League Chairman since 1985, Ashkenazi Jew, Irv Rubin is jailed for allegedly plotting to bomb a mosque and the offices of a Arab-American congressman. He dies shortly after slitting his throat in a suicide attempt, before he can be brought to trial. One week prior to the WTC attack, the Zim Shipping Company moves out of its offices in the WTC, breaking its lease and costing the company $50,000. No reason has ever been given, but Zim Shipping Company is half owned by the State of Israel (The Rothschilds). On October 3, Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, makes the following statement to Ashkenazi Jew, Shimon Peres, as reported on Kol Yisrael radio. \"Every time we do something you tell me America will do this and will do that....I want to tell you something very clear, don't worry about American pressure on Israel. We, the Jewish people, control America, and the Americans know it.\"2002: Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged), re-printed in 2002, provides a new definition of Anti Semitism which has not been updated since 1956. It reads, \"Anti-Semitism: (1) hostility toward Jews as a religious or racial minority group, often accompanied by social, political or economic discrimination (2) opposition to Zionism (3) sympathy for the opponents of Israel.\"It was definition (2) and (3) that were added in the 2002 edition, just before the USA decide to invade Iraq under orders from the State of Rothschild, I mean Israel. Also this year, the Prime Minister of Israel, war criminal, Ariel Sharon, orders the massacre in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. Best get that definition updated to protect these criminals. The DEA issues a report that Israeli spies, posing as art students, have been trying to penetrate US Government offices. Police near the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in southern Washington State stop a suspicious truck and detain two Israelis, one of whom is illegally in the United States. The two men were driving at high speed in a Ryder rental truck, which they claimed had been used to, \"deliver furniture.\" The next day, police discovered traces of TNT and RDX military-grade plastic explosives inside the passenger cabin and on the steering wheel of the vehicle. The FBI then announces that the tests that showed explosives were, \"false positived,\" by cigarette smoke, a claim test experts say is ridiculous. Based on an alibi provided by a woman, the case is closed and the Israelis are handed over to INS to be sent back to Israel. One week later, the woman who provided the alibi vanishes. 2003: The United States invade Iraq on 19 March, which this year is the holy, \"Day of Purim,\" in the Jewish calendar. This, \"Day of Purim,\" is a day the Jews celebrate their victory over Ancient Babylon, now based within the borders of Iraq, how interesting. What is also significant is that the previous U.S. led invasion of Iraq ended on the Day of Purim ten years earlier with the slaughter of 150,000 fleeing Iraqis under the current President's father, George Herbert Walker Bush. Purim is also the time when the Jews are encouraged to get bloody revenge against their perceived enemies. Ancient Babylon, I mean Iraq, is now one of six nations left in the world who don\u2019t have a Rothschild controlled central bank. This war is mainly about stealing Iraq\u2019s water supply for Israel and is being fought with the blood of the American military which the State of Rothschild, I mean Israel control. Israel has always struggled for water, it had to steal the Golan Heights from Syria which provided Israel with one third of its fresh water 36 years before, yet still in Israel water extraction has surpassed replacement by 2.5 billion metres in the last 25 years. This means the water is far more precious to them than the oil reserves which are the second largest reserves of oil on the planet. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed states in a speech, \"Jews rule the world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them.\"The Police Chief of Cloudcroft stops a truck speeding through a school zone. The drivers turn out to be Israelis with expired passports. Claiming to be movers, the truck contains junk furniture and several boxes. The Israelis are handed over to immigration. The contents of the boxers are not revealed to the public. Israel deploys assassination squads into other countries, including the United States. The US Government does not protest. 2004: Two years into an investigation of AIPAC\u2019s (The American Israel Public Affairs Committee \u2013 the largest political lobbying group in the USA with over 65,000 members whose only purpose is to use the USA for the purposes of Israel) possible role as a spy front for Israel, Ashkenazi Jew, Larry Franklin, a mid-level Pentagon Analyst is observed by the FBI giving classified information to two officials of AIPAC suspected of being Israeli spies. AIPAC hires lawyer Nathan Lewin to handle their legal defense, the same lawyer who defended suspected Israeli spy Stephen Bryen in 1978. Larry Franklin worked in the Pentagon Office of Special Plans, run by Richard Perle, at the time Perle (who was caught giving classified information to Israel back in 1970) was insisting that Iraq was crawling with weapons of mass destruction requiring the United States to invade and conquer Iraq. There were no WMDs, of course, and Perle has dumped the blame for the, \"bad intelligence,\" on George Tenet. But what is known is that the Pentagon Office of Special Plans was coordinating with a similar group in Israel, in Ariel Sharon\u2019s office. With two suspected Israeli spies (at least) inside the office from which the lies that launched the war in Iraq originated, it appears that the people of the United States are the victims of a deadly hoax, a hoax that started a war using the blood and money of American citizens for the purposes of Israeli oppression. The leaking of the investigation of AIPAC to the media on August 28th, 2004 gave advance warning to other spies working with Franklin. The damage to the FBI\u2019s investigation was completed when United States Attorney General John Ashcroft ordered the FBI to stop all arrests in the case. Like the Stephen Bryen case and the hunt for, \"Mega,\" this latest spy scandal seems destined by officials who have their own secret allegiances to protect, barring a massive public outcry. Police near the Nuclear Fuel Services plant in Tennessee stop a truck after a three mile chase, during which the driver throws a bottle containing a strange liquid from the cab. The drivers turn out to be Israelis using fake identifications. The FBI refuses to investigate and the Israelis are released. Two Israelis try to enter Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, home to eight Trident submarines. The truck tests positive for explosives. The National Director of the ADL, Abraham H. Foxman, publishes a book entitled, \"Never Again? The Threat Of The New Anti-Semitism,\" in which he states that the New Testament's \"lie,\" that the ancient Pharisees were responsible for the death of Christ, has been responsible for anti-semitism throughout the millennia and thus the New Testament of the bible is, \"hate speech,\" and should be censored or banned. 2005: On January 20, President Bush makes the following statement as part of his second inaugural address, \"When our Founders declared a new order of the ages.\" This is not true. The founders did not declare a, \"new order of the ages,\" President Roosevelt did when in 1933, he put it's latin translation, \"Novus Ordo Seclorum,\" on the dollar bill. On 7 July the London Underground Network is bombed. Israel\u2019s Finance Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu is in London on the morning of the attacks in order to attend an economic conference in a hotel over the underground station where one of the blasts occurred, but stayed in his hotel room instead after he had been informed by Israeli intelligence officials attacks were expected. There are now only 5 nations on the world left without a Rothschild controlled central bank: Iran; North Korea; Sudan; Cuba; and Libya. Physics Professor, Stephen E. Jones of Brigham Young University publishes a paper in which he proves the World Trade Center buildings could have only been brought down in the manner they were by explosives. He receives no coverage in the mainstream media for his scientific and provable claims. 2006: The Edmond De Rothschild Banque, a subsidiary of Europe's Edmond De Rothschild family bank group in France, becomes the first foreign family bank that has obtained approval of the China Banking Regulatory Commission and entered China's financial market. The ADL ruthlessly leans on governments throughout the world to pass hate crimes legislation, as they are scared that the criminal cabal that is Israel and the Rothschilds is being exposed more and more on a daily basis, predominantly on the internet. Their job is to protect this criminal network and what better way to do it than by passing laws in which anyone who exposes a Jewish criminal becomes a criminal. David Irving is sentenced to three years in jail in Austria, for denying the holocaust. It is important to note that the only historical event you can be arrested for questioning is the holocaust.New World Order Wiki September 11th, 2001  A date which is famous for the false flag terror attack on the United States, carried out by Israelis under the direction of Evelyn de Rothschild, and with cooperation from the United States and English governments. EVENTS Plane Strikes North Tower At 8:46 ET, a drone plane carrying no passengers was flown into the building via remote control. This plane was reported by media to be American Airlines Flight 11, but a check of the identification number shows us that the plane was renumbered and is still in circulation today.New World Order Wiki Oklahoma City Bombing  Oklahoma City Bombing is a term commonly used to describe the false flag terror attack that took place against the United States for the purpose of creating tougher laws against citizen groups that may rise against the government in coming years. Three bombs were placed inside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. Only one of the bombs exploded, but it killed 168 people. Numerous local Oklahoma media outlets reported that two other bombs were found in the building and defused. There was no initial mention of any truck explosion.New World Order Wiki Leo Tanguma  Lead artist of the highly symbolic murals in Denver Internarional Airport.New World Order Wiki Federal Reserve  A private bank with locations all around the United States, its objective since its founding has been the avenue through which the Rothschilds may print money at the rate they see fit, to drive up inflation. According to the United States Constitution, Congress is the central authority on printing banks notes to represent the amount of bullion we have in our reserves. Clearly this process does not happen. HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE Many attempts were made by European bankers, under orders from the Rothschilds, to make a private central bank that United States citizens had to borrow from. Two American Presidents were assassinated in the span of twenty years for opposing a central bank; James Garfield in 1881, and William McKinley in 1901. Jekyll Island In 1910, seven of the wealthiest men in the world met on a small island off the coast of Georgia called Jekyll Island. At the time, it was home to the most expensive and exclusive \"club\" in the world. Non-members were not allowed to attend, this included President McKinley. The seven men who met at Jekyll Island are as follows: Together, they drafted the Federal Reserve Act. Congress passed it, unread, during Christmas recess 1913. President Woodrow Wilson signed it in to law immediatly. NEW CENTRAL BANK Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has illegally printed American money and loaned it to the government at interest. This is why Federal Income Tax was created in the same year of 1913; for Americans to pay off the interest of the money we were unknowingly borrowing. It was the perfect plan for the Rothschild family as they and their interests were making amazing amounts of profits. America began to go into debt. The owners of the banks that made up the Federal Reserve were actually twelve different banking cartels. It was these groups which manufactured the Stock Market Crash of 1929. This was done to create the need for the Emergency Banking Act of 1933. After this bill passed, not only could you no longer trade in your notes for gold, but it became illegal to do so. Making a cash for gold trade-in was punishable by 10 years in prison. Internationally, you could still trade your notes for gold, however.New World Order Wiki Adam Weishaupt  Johann Adam Weishaupt (February 6, 1746 - November 18, 1830) was a Jesuit and professor of cannon law who was tapped by Mayer Amschel Rothschild to head the Bavarian occult group referred to then as the Illuminati.Early Life  Born to Johann Georg Weishaupt who died when Adam was five years old. \u00a0After being adopted by a fellow professor at the University of Ingolstadt, Weishaupt was forced into formal indoctrination of Jesuit ideals of Catholic global-Luciferianism at the age of seven. \u00a0After enrolling at the University of Ingolstadt, he graduated at age 20 with a law degree.Founder of the Illuminati  As early as 1770, Rothschild approached Weishaupt with his plan of having a group of wealthy individuals--mostly his banking partners--that could help further the general agenda of the Jesuits. \u00a0Weishaupt became a fanatic of the idea, and by 1775 had an outline of what the agenda of the Illuminati would be. \u00a0Weishaupt was instructed to wait until May 1 before formally organizing the order, a date which is of high spiritual signifigance in Witchcraft. \u00a0On May 1, 1776 the Order of the Illuminati was founded by Weishaupt with the approval of the Catholic Church and the funding of the Rothschild family.Post-Illuminati Activities  Intentional Disinformation Campaigns (IDC) such as Wikipedia will go on to insinuate that after an Illuminati messenger was struck by lightning and plans to provoke the French Revolution were uncovered, that the Illuminati was disbanded and Weishaupt disappeared, only to have a small influence by prodicing writings in exile. \u00a0Nothing could be further from the truth. \u00a0He left Bavaria to join Prieure de Sion, a group that Rothschild himself was debating on heading at one point, but decided that his efforts would be best utilized on the financial aspect. \u00a0Other members of Weishaupt's order carried out infiltrating Rosicrucian-like ideals into various areas of Europe.Modern Influence  Today, Weishaupt is idolized within Masonic Lodges by high-level Freemasons. \u00a0His efforts into New World Order and contributions toward a Luciferian hierarchy have made him a hero in Satanism. \u00a0He is references by several singers who are contracted by a Rothschild-run record label.New World Order Wiki Hurricane Katrina  A storm in 2005 that was destructive in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly to areas like New Orleans, Louisiana and Boloxi, Mississippi. TIMELINE OF EVENTS Hurricane Katrina Makes Landfall Aftermath of Katrina Eric Arceneaux, a survivor of the floods, says that after the moderatly damaging hurricane was over, the sun came out. \"In fact we went to sleep, cause we stayed up all night worrying.\" He was woken from his nap by his mother who explained that he had to move his car because the water was rising.\n\n Industrial Canal Levee (A Levee is somethng that is meant to stop the overflow of rivers)\n Well after Hurricane Katrina had come and gone, major areas of New Orleans levees that had already reported the need for repair work, were intentially blown out by the Army Corps of Engineers in an effort to flood the poor areas of the city, rather than the wealthier areas. Among the destroyed areas is the Industrial Canal Levee, which was blown out between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The flooding from this explosion destroyed the Ninth Ward.New World Order Wiki Family Guy  Family Guy is a popular American television show from FOX Network headed by News Corporation.

The general purpose of the operation was to safely retain top Nazi scientists and keep ideals of Babylonian sun worship intact. The operation was a success, and it's widely believed that somewhere in between 1,200 and 1,600 scientists and other Nazis were secretly and safely relocated to the United States using U.S. citizen's tax dollars, and given new identities\u00a0New World Order Wiki Rhodes Scholarship  A scolarship given to one of the top minds in the world annually, in a basic recruitment attempt into working towards One World Government.New World Order Wiki List of New Religious Movements  Is an element of occultism that is deeply tied to Jesuits and members of the Illuminati, as their oaths nearly mirror each other. \"I, ............, now in the presence of Almighty God, the blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed St. John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, and all the saints, sacred host of heaven, and to you, my Ghostly Father, the superior general of the Society of Jesus rounded by St. Ignatius Loyola, in the pontification of Paul the III and continued to the present, do by the womb at the Virgin, the matrix of God, and the rod of Jesus Christ, declare and swear that His Holiness the Pope, is Christ's vice regent and is the true and only head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth; and that by virtue of the keys of binding and loosing given His Holiness by my Savior, Jesus Christ, he hath power to depose heretical kings, princes, States, Commonwealths, and Governments and they may be safely destroyed.

They are some of the richest and most prominent people in society who have been tapped and groomed for training in the Satanic Hierarchy.

Its messages to the public from blatant items such as a Freemasonic capstone in the airport's main terminal, also called the \"Great Hall\" (what Masons commonly refer to as their meeting place) to the subtile yet frightening pieces of artwork with a very clearly engineered message and tone, the airport is an obvious tribute to the New World Order agenda, and possible headquarters of a regional New World Order area or district. This would make sense as well, as it is close to the geographic center of the USA. Becuase of its irrational budget, ongoing construction that never ends and its poor location logistically as far as the city of Denver is concerned, it intially raised eyebrows with regards to it also operating as a multi-level base for the US government. It has even been the central theme of the popular Reptilian Intentional Disinformation Campaign (IDC).

As seen in the events from Rocky Legends, Drago was first scouted by Nicolai Koloff in Russia, Koloff was tasked with finding a fighter that could be built and sent to the United States in order to become champion. At the time, the Soviet Union and the United States were at war with each other and the Soviet Union wanted to prove their superiority. In 1985 (Rocky IV), Drago would fight one of America's greatest fighters Apollo Creed in an exhibition match, destroying him with ease and knocking him out in the second round, resulting in the death of Creed. Creed's close friend Rocky Balboa took it upon himself to avenge Creed and agreed to a fight against Drago in Russia, Drago lost the fight, making it his first and only loss ever. Drago was shamed by the USSR and exiled from Russia, forcing him to move to Ukraine. He was divorced by his wife Ludmilla Vobet and was forced to raise his son, Viktor, on his own. Drago trained his son ruthlessly for the next 20 years, attempting to make him a better boxer than he was. In 2018 (Creed II), Drago issued a challenge to newly crowned Heavyweight Champion Adonis Creed, son of Apollo Creed on the behalf of his son, hoping to avenge his loss to Balboa all those years ago. Drago's son Viktor pummelled Creed in their first encounter but lost to Creed via disqualification because he punched Creed when he was down. Viktor had a rematch with Adonis in Russia, the fight was a war with both men destroying each other. In the final round, Viktor was very fatigued and had nothing left, he was unable to defend himself, causing Drago to throw the towel in for his son. Drago hugged his son, telling him he is proud of him. Drago is now focusing on developing a deeper bond with his son, training side-by-side with him. The Soviet Union was extremely arrogant in Drago's abilities; however, Drago never bragged about it. His wife, Ludmilla Drago, spoke for him at press conferences, with Drago simply staring at the press without saying anything. He was given several nicknames, such as the Siberian Bull, the Siberian Express, and even Death from Above, referring to Drago's height and Apollo's death at the hands of Drago. After the fall of Soviet Union, he had a son, Viktor Drago who succeeded him in his boxing career.Biography Early Life  Ivan Drago was born on November 3rd, 1961 in Moscow, Russia, there isn\u2019t much information surrounding Drago\u2019s childhood, but one would assume that he was raised with discipline, due to growing up in such a rough environment. Drago would eventually join the Soviet Army becoming an Infantry Captain, it was during this time that boxing trainer Sergei Igor Rimsky and political adviser Nicolai Koloff were scouting the soldiers in order to find a worthy athlete. Drago fought fellow soldier Alexei Baluk defeating him and catching the eye of prospects, from here Drago was trained in Soviet Russia and went on to defeat a series of other boxers. He had an impressive amateur record of 131 wins, 0 losses, 0 draws and 93 knockouts. The ultimate fight in the USSR is on the deck of a warship, where Drago is pitted against the best boxer in the Red Navy. After Drago wins that fight, his Soviet trainers were convinced that he would beat any boxer in the world. They flew to America in hopes of booking a title fight against the World Champion Rocky Balboa, convinced Drago could defeat the American and take the title. This was announced at the press conference held as soon as Drago got off the plane. This press conference was seen by retired professional boxer Apollo Creed. Drago holds an Olympic gold medal and holds a strongest punch of over 2100\u00a0psi, his average was 1850 psi. The average psi for a heavyweight boxer is only 700 psi. Drago was married to another athlete, Ludmilla Vobet Drago who is a double gold medalist in\u00a0swimming. She is more articulate than Drago, who seldom talks, and always spoke on his behalf at press conferences and interviews. She dismissed allegations of Drago's steroid use, explaining her husband's freakish size and strength by saying, \"he is like\u00a0your Popeye. He eats his spinach every day!\" Following his loss to Rocky Balboa, Ludmilla divorced Drago and left him to raise their son, Viktor, on his own. Viktor succeeded his father and pursued a career in boxing.Rocky IV Arrival in America  In 1985, undefeated amateur Russian world boxing champion, 24-year-old Ivan Drago arrived in the United States along with his wife Ludmilla Vobet Drago, political advisor Nicolai Koloff, and trainers Sergei Igor Rimsky, and Manuel Vega. Drago held a post-conference right off the plane to announce his entry into the American professional boxing world. At the press conference, Drago didn't say a word, he sat in silence while his wife Ludmilla answered all the questions about him. Drago's political advisor Nicolai issued the challenged to have an exhibition bout with the ''American Champion'' the current Heavyweight Champion at the time, Rocky Balboa. Nicolai is asked if Drago can withstand the pressure of fighting someone like Balboa to which Nicolai responds that nobody can match Drago's strength, endurance, or aggressiveness, making him indestructible. Former Heavyweight Champion and retired boxer Apollo Creed watched the press conference from his home, looking visibly frustrated and annoyed with the comments. Drago and his team held another press conference from their training facility, showcasing the advanced technology they're using to train him. Nicolai drops a few snide insults towards the Americans, stating he hopes they can educate them on body chemistry among other things. The press questions if Dragos has used any anabolic steroids to which Ludmilla replies ''he is like your Popeye, he eats his spinach!'' The conference culminates with Nicolai informing the press that the average heavyweight boxer averages 700 pounds of pressure per square inch when punching, Drago then demonstrates a punch that totals at 1850 psi. Nicolai states that whatever he hits, he destroys.Challenged by Apollo Creed  42 year old, Apollo Creed came out of a five-year retirement to challenge Drago to an exhibition match, which would be promoted by Rocky Balboa. Drago and his team accepted the challenge and agreed on a venue and date. A pre-fight press conference was held with Apollo cracking jokes and making fun of the Russian, stating that he is going to teach Drago to box ''The American way'', Apollo was asked about Drago's inexperience to which Apollo replied ''Some people just have to learn the hard way!'' while smirking. The press then attempted to ask Drago a question, asking him his thoughts on Apollo, Drago just stared at the press and didn't say a word, prompting Apollo to say ''his tongue didn't make it through customs!'' The press continued to laugh at Drago while he sat there in silence with the rest of his team until Ludmilla claimed that this would be a great victory, causing Apollo to take a more serious tone and say ''You don't really think your gonna whip me?'' Lumilla then states that they didn't come here to lose, Apollo then says that Drago is going to lose and lose royally! Nicolai becomes fed up with the jokes and calls Apollo a has-been, Apollo becomes infuriated by this and jumps out of his seat, pointing fingers at Nicolai, Drago then gets up, and a small melee ensues, with Drago pushing Apollo as the conference comes to an end. On the night of the fight, Ivan Drago stood in the boxing ring alone and in the dark, unknown to him the ring rose up from under the ground and into the arena with him standing in it. The ring came up while Living in America was being performed by James Brown and Apollo Creed was making an elaborate entrance, dancing his way around all the showgirls, dancers and James Brown! Drago looked confused by all the entertainment, but kept his composure and backed into his corner, awaiting Creed to enter the ring. Creed continued showboating to the crowd and dancing around before finally entering the ring as James Brown finished the song. The audience erupted for Creed while booing Drago. The two fighters met in the middle of the ring with the referee going over the rules, Creed seemed confident and excited telling Drago ''It's time to go to school!'' They then touched gloves with Drago slamming his hands down onto Creed's and saying ''You will lose'' causing Creed's expression to become more worrying.Killing Creed in the ring  It was predicted by the majority of sports analysis that Creed would defeat Drago because of his outweighing experience and his ability to win under pressure. In the early stages of the first round, Creed orbited the Russian, Drago stood in the middle of the ring and Creed danced around him, keeping distance to avoid any strikes from Drago, but slipping in every second or two to land a quick jab on Drago! Creed was doing well, landing combinations while Drago stood back cocking his right hand and awaiting the right time to strike, Creed continued at this pace for a bit longer until Drago's trainer Sergei yelled for him to strike, causing Drago to take a step forward, closing the distance, and landing a huge straight right hand that pushed Apollo right into the ropes! Drago then unloaded on Creed for the remainder of the round, trapping Creed in the corner and unloading with body shots and right hooks, bloodying Creed! Drago continued after the sound of the bell, throwing two more punches to the bloodied Creed. Creed's trainer Tony Evers ran into the ring and yelled at Drago's team, telling them it's meant to be an exhibition. In the second round, Drago stood with his hands down and slipped Creed's punches, intimidating Creed. Finally, Drago countered and unloaded on Creed, connecting with countless hooks and strikes, eventually dropping Creed and winning the fight by KO. Balboa swopped into the ring and held Apollo in his arms while Drago was being interviewed by the press, Drago said, ''I defeat anybody... I defeat anyman... I defeat real champion..'' and then in regards to Creed's fatal injuries, Drago said, ''If he dies... he dies.''Balboa vs. Drago  After the fight, Balboa did whatever he could to get a fight with Drago, but the boxing commission stated that they would not sanction the fight, urging Balboa to wait two years. Eventually, Balboa was able to work out a deal with Drago's team to have the fight take place in the USSR on Christmas Day for no money whatsoever. Balboa made it clear to everyone that he would attempt to avenge Creed's death at the hands of Drago, now labelled \"Death from Above\". During the press conference, the Soviets belittled Balboa, claiming that Drago would win for certain, due to Drago's superior genetics, superior strength, and superior training. After the conference, Drago flew back to the USSR and began his training for the fight. Drago is placed in an incredible gym with fifteen to twenty scientists and trainers all monitoring and focusing on him! He is seen lifting extreme amounts of weight, using various machines for his arms and legs, even running around a private indoor track, whilst his personal trainers tracked the minutiae of Drago's biology, monitoring even his heart rate. Drago also spars and knocks out his opponent very quickly. He is then seen being injected with anabolic steroids, despite the earlier denial by the Soviets that he didn't use steroids. On the night of the fight, Balboa made his way to the ring first and to the surprise of nobody was hugely booed by the audience. Drago came out second and was praised with support from his home crowd, he entered the ring and nodded to his superiors who were sitting in the upper decks of the crowd. The national anthem of the USSR was then played as they unveiled a huge mural of their star athlete Ivan Drago! The fighters touch gloves and like his previous encounter with Creed, Drago slammed his gloves down on top of Balboa's and said ''I must break you.''Defeated by Rocky Balboa  In the first round of the fight, Drago had the upper-hand and came out firing! Unlike his fight with Apollo where he waited and timed his shots, Drago stormed out of his corner and charged Balboa, trapping him in his own corner and unloading with body shots and hooks! Balboa was able to land a few body shots, prompting Drago to smile and point at his stomach, asking Balboa to bring it! Drago counters and continues to unload, eventually knocking Balboa down with ease! It's clear that Drago is looking to finish the fight as quickly as possible. By the end of the first round, Rocky was already cut and bleeding with Drago hungry for more. Despite Drago's impressive performance in the first round, his trainers place an exceptional amount of pressure on him, expecting Drago to dominate Balboa more. In the second round, Drago continually lands blows on Balboa, and knocks him down again, much to the chagrin of Balboa's trainers, and Adrian Balboa, but the turning point comes when Balboa catches Drago with a right hook that opens up a bad cut on his cheek! Drago seems stunned by the fact that he has been cut open and backs away, causing Balboa to charge at him, unloading with rights and lefts before trapping the Russian in the corner and unloading with body shots. Balboa hits Drago with a few shots after the bell, causing Drago to grab him by the throat and punch him with a straight right, Rocky then picks Drago up and slams him on the ground, the short melee is quickly broken up by the trainers of each fighter. In rounds three, four, and five, Drago continued to have the upper hand, dominating Balboa by using his reach advantage, Balboa was unable to cut the distance and Drago continued to unload with heavy strikes on Balboa, but with every punch that Drago threw, Balboa kept coming back for more and more. He wouldn't go down. Balboa withstood everything that Drago threw at him during those rounds. In round six, Balboa began to cut off the distance and make an impact on Drago, trapping him in the corner and unloading with a flurry of body shots that were clearly hurting the Russian! This is the first time in the fight that Balboa was making a real dint on Drago apart from the cut in the second round. At the beginning of the seventh round, the president of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev looked over with a worrying look to Nikolai Koloff who was seated next to him. Drago had a dominating round, but it was called upon by Rocky because Balboa began taunting at Drago to bring it, similar to how he did in his fight against Clubber Lang. The fight became fairly evenly matched in the next few rounds with both fighters landing their power punches, stringing together combos, and continuing to batter their opponent. In the twelfth round, a small portion of the audience began chanting for Rocky, respecting him for his courage and spirit. At the end of the fourteenth round, Nicolai Koloff became so furious that he left his seat in the upper deck and personally got to Drago's corner, and started to rant at him for how his performance was weak, to the point where the Soviet's started cheering for Balboa, and how Drago needed to win, or else. Drago's temper then snaps, prompting him to grab and hold Koloff by the neck, and throw him into the audience, exclaiming \"I fight for me! FOR ME!\", contrarily to how Soviets suggested that Drago was fighting for his country. Drago then commences the final round with Balboa. Balboa continued taunting Drago, asking him to throw real punches, which prompted the then infuriated Drago to throw more punches, but to little avail. Much like Lang, Drago fatigued severely, rendering him helpless as Balboa rallied several punches against Drago, uppercutting him into a knockdown. Due to his fatigue, Drago was incapable of answering the count and nearly fell out of the ring. He was awarded the loss via knockout in the fifteenth and final round.Events Between Rocky IV & Creed II Exiled from Russia and Training his son  After his loss to Rocky, Drago was disgraced by the USSR. He was shamed and kicked out of the country, tainting the Drago name forever. Ludmilla divorced him and left him to raise their son, Viktor, on his own. Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Drago fought pro for a short time while raising his son. During this time, he accumulated a record of 28-1 (28 KO) before winning a portion of the Heavyweight title. However, Drago never unified the title or fought the very top contenders because of promotional politics. He eventually retired, forced to live in Ukraine, where he lived a modest life while relentlessly training Viktor to be an even more formidable boxer than he was.Creed II Setting up Adonis Johnson Creed vs. Viktor Drago  In 2018, the Drago name is still shamed on by the Russians, leaving Ivan Drago alone in Ukraine with his son, Viktor Drago. Drago has raised his son in hate and has continued to train his son ruthlessly for the last 20 years. Drago knows that there isn't anything he himself can do to get back into the Russians good graces, but he knows that he can use his son in order to be accepted back by them. Drago trains his son without remorse, pushing him, and often looking down on him for not doing better. The first example of this is when Viktor is running in front of Ivan's truck, and Ivan continues to pick the speed up, eventually cutting in front of Viktor and telling him \"When I tell you to run faster, you run faster'' followed by slamming his car door. Ivan's son Viktor has been fighting in Ukraine for some time, winning all of his fights by KO. Along the way, Ivan and Viktor met boxing promoter, Buddy Marcelle. After Viktor knocked out another opponent in Ukraine and Adonis Creed won the World Heavyweight Championship, Ivan, Viktor, and promoter Buddy Marcelle travel to Philadelphia to issue a challenge to Adonis for the title. Drago visits Rocky in his restaurant to tell him how Rocky cost him everything, from his standing in the country all the way to his wife leaving him. He tells Balboa that they treated him like a stray dog, kicking him out. He mentions that the loss ruined his life and then threatens to avenge that loss through Viktor, telling Rocky, \"My son will break your boy.\"Training Viktor for the fight  Adonis accepts the fight and Rocky refuses to train him, Drago intensifies Viktor's training regiment. During the weigh-in, Ivan taunts Adonis, telling him he is much smaller than Apollo was. Adonis shoves Ivan, prompting Viktor to shove Adonis, causing Adonis to become infuriated and attempt to go at Viktor, but Viktor is clearly not deterred by it and simply looks at Ivan, followed by walking away. Viktor pummels Adonis, breaking his orbital bone, ribs, and brutally puncturing one of his kidneys, but is disqualified for landing a punch on Adonis while he was down. During the time that Adonis is recovering from his injuries and regaining his confidence that was shattered, Viktor claims his first official victory on the American stage, knocking out an unnamed opponent in the first round, followed by rising to the top of the boxing ranks over the next few months thanks to his unmatched power and brutal offense. Ivan briefly finds his way back into the good graces of the Russians as he and his son are invited to a private dinner held by some of the most powerful and influential people in Russia. The Russian's present their faith and support by offering a gift to Viktor, custom-made boxing shorts. Ivan seems delighted by all of this while Viktor doesn't seem to care for their stamp of approval. Viktor's mother and Ivan's ex-wife Ludmilla appears at the dinner, sitting next to another man, causing Viktor to storm out.\u00a0 He scolds Ivan for seeking validation from the very people who turned their backs on him when he needed them, telling his father that these people kicked him out.Forgiving and Finding Peace  Viktor is now recognised as the official number one Heavyweight fighter in the world but is still lacking the championship belt, the Dragos challenge Adonis to a rematch in Russia. Ivan pushes Viktor to his limit in training for the bout. However, Adonis spent his sessions training his body to repeatedly absorb heavy impact and uses Viktor's lack of technique and reliance on power punches to his advantage. Viktor enters the tenth round with the lead on the scorecards, but begins to tire, as he had never gone past the fourth round in previous matches without knocking his opponent out. Adonis knocks Viktor down twice in the round, causing a number of Viktor's supporters, including Ludmilla, to leave the fight. At this moment, Ivan realises that his son is far more important to him, not caring what the Russian's think and finally at peace with his past, he throws in the towel, stopping the fight, and allowing Adonis to emerge victoriously.Bonding with Viktor  Drago hugs a humiliated Viktor after the fight, assuring him that it is okay and that he is proud. Finally, at peace with his past, Ivan focuses on developing a deeper bond with his son, training with him side-by-side.Personality and Traits  Unlike the opponent from the previous movie, Clubber Lang, Drago is a man of few words. In the movie, his wife always spoke for him during interviews, as Drago simply looked at the cameras, whilst occasionally looking at others. He is an individual who hates being treated like an object of somebody else's intentions. He seems to be a very pitiless and cold-hearted person, as shown when he comments on Apollo's death: \"If he dies, he dies\", feeling no remorse for his actions. Drago also is remembered for saying \"I must break you\" to Rocky Balboa immediately before the match begins. Drago seems to be fighting for his country (as the Soviet officials indicate), but as one of his promoters starts yelling at him in the fourteenth round for not fulfilling expectations, Drago angrily lifted the promoter by the neck, and threw him into the crowd, exclaiming, \"I fight for me! FOR ME!\" Drago takes great pride in representing his country as seen in Rocky IV and Creed II. Drago went to extreme lengths in order to be accepted back by the Russian people, Drago held onto the pain of being kicked out of the country for 30 years. He shows that he does have a cold heart as he trains his son Viktor, relentlessly rather than bonding with him, but by the end of Creed II, Drago made the decision to put his son over his nation, letting go of the past and bonding with his son.Boxing Style  Drago's style was based on size, strength, and mental resilience. He was vicious and relentless, not stopping until he finished an opponent. He was extremely determined in the ring, capable of outworking any opponent. Drago was also incredibly strong, a single punch impacting with the force of over two thousand pounds per square inch, hence the expression that whatever he hits, he destroys. Ivan Drago also showed surprising agility for his size, demonstrated in his elusiveness during the Apollo Creed fight. Drago tended to become more aggressive as fights went on. Drago, however, wasn't capable of enduring consistent punishment, which contributed to his loss against Rocky Balboa.Accomplishments  Held a portion of the Heavyweight Championship (One of these WBC, WBA, WBO, IBF, or The Ring) (1 time) (defeated unknown, lost to unknown)Quotes Trivia Ivan Drago: Justice Enforcer  After the match, Drago was locked up in the Soviet Embassy for years. Gorbachev, knowing of Drago's power, released him into the streets of the United States after briefing Drago on his mission. Drago was attacked by several people. Sporto McJockitch attacked first, some of them followed by their girlfriends, who did no damage. Ivan defeated these, only to be met by Stabby Jenkins, a short man with a dagger. He killed these and moved on. Next, he met someone unusual\u2014Segway Jerkwad. Segway was a cyborg (presumably), he had a wheel attached where his legs and feet were supposed to be. Segway attacked immediately, but Drago was able to defeat the cyborg. Then he met another unusual sight, a cowboy. The cowboy tried really hard with his lasso to strangle him, but Drago was able to defeat him, too. Next came Pauly's Robot, another machine, that did not attack. Drago destroyed the robot as well. After that, Mafioso Alfredo, a man dressed in black with a small pistol, attacked. Drago dodged all the bullets he could and killed Alfredo. . He also met Serial mom whom the criminals used to fool Drago, but to no avail, and he, in disgust, killed her and the baby was a doll filled with blood which did not fool Drago at all. Then came Herbert the Dinosaur, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The T-Rex used all its might to kill Drago, but in the end, Drago defeated it. He then fought several more of the criminals before entering Mighty Mick's Gym. Drago fought a cyborg of Apollo Creed and eventually Rocky Balboa, who was confined to a wheelchair. Non-canon information ends here.References Rocky Wiki Rocky Balboa  Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa, Sr. (born July 6th, 1946) is an Italian-American retired heavyweight\u00a0boxer and former Two-Time Heavyweight Champion. He is famous for his indomitable spirit, extreme tenacity and ferocious body attack. Balboa is the titular protagonist in\u00a0Rocky, Rocky II,\u00a0Rocky III,\u00a0Rocky IV,\u00a0Rocky V\u00a0and\u00a0Rocky Balboa\u00a0and the deuteragonist in\u00a0Creed and Creed II.Biography Rocky: An Opportunity  On November 25, 1975,\u00a0Rocky Balboa is introduced as a small-time\u00a0boxer\u00a0and \"leg-breaker,\" or debt collector, for an apparently \"connected\"\u00a0loan shark\u00a0named Anthony Gazzo. He lives in the\u00a0Kensington neighbourhood of\u00a0Philadelphia. Rocky is first seen defeating the boxer Spider Rico in the second round, but is considered by the audience to be a bum. The World Heavyweight Championship\u00a0bout, with undefeated\u00a0heavyweight champion Apollo Creed defending against Mac Lee Green, is scheduled to take place at the\u00a0Philadelphia Spectrum\u00a0on\u00a0New Year's Day\u00a01976, the year of the\u00a0United States Bicentennial. When Green drops out because of an injured hand, Creed and his entourage, and trainer (Tony \"Duke\" Evers) are stymied on what to do. Other contenders say there is not enough time to get into shape. Creed comes up with the idea of giving a local underdog a shot at the title and, because he likes Rocky's nickname \"The Italian Stallion,\" he selects the relatively unknown fighter. He puts it in lights by proclaiming \"Apollo Creed Meets The Italian Stallion.\" The fight promoter Miles Jergens says the decision is \"very American\"; but Creed says, rather, that it is \"very smart.\" To prepare for the fight Rocky trains with a 1920s-era ex-bantamweight\u00a0fighter and gym owner,\u00a0Mickey Goldmill. Mickey always considered Rocky's potential to be better than his effort\u2014telling him he had heart but also calling him a \"tomato\" and \"leg breaker for some cheap second-rate loan shark\" among other endearments, and putting Rocky out of his gym locker preceding the \"freak luck\" opportunity that comes Rocky's way, and Rocky is initially skeptical of Mickey's motives and timing for wanting to train Rocky for the big fight. Rocky's good friend Paulie Pennino, a meat-packing-plant worker, lets him practice his punches on the carcasses hanging in the freezers. Rocky courts and eventually dates Paulie's shy, quiet sister, Adrian Pennino, who works as a clerk in a local pet store. He draws Adrian out of her shell and, as Rocky's girlfriend, she begins to gain in confidence. Paulie, however, is jealous of the relationship. The night before the fight, Rocky privately tours the Spectrum and notices the photograph of him wearing the wrong coloured shorts. Mr. Jergens tells Rocky the incorrect photograph doesn't really matter. Dejected, Rocky confides to Adrian that he does not expect to beat Creed and that all he wants is to\u00a0go the distance\u00a0because no one had ever gone the distance with Creed.  On New Year's Day, the climactic boxing match begins. Apollo Creed has never taken the fight seriously, and Rocky unexpectedly knocks him down in the first round (the first time Creed has been knocked down in his professional career), embarrassing Creed, and the match turns intense. Creed's prediction that he would knockout Rocky in three rounds is quickly erased as the two fighters engage in a brutal match. Creed realizes that he has underestimated his opponent and desperately defends his title. The fight indeed lasts 15 rounds, with both fighters sustaining many injuries; Rocky suffers his first broken nose and debilitating trauma around the eye, and Creed sustains brutal blows to his ribs with substantial internal bleeding. As the match progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punishment, and his dogged refusal to be knocked out. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each others arms, an exhausted Creed vows \"Ain't gonna be no re-match,\" to which an equally spent Rocky replies, \"Don't want one.\"After the fight, multiple layers of drama are played out: sportscasters and audience are going wild; the promoter/ring announcer Miles Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the match was \"the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring\"; Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts the security personnel. As Jergens declares Apollo Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace while they profess their love to one another, not caring about the result of the fight. After that fight, Rocky Balboa became a national celebrity and endorsements poured in for him.Rocky II: The Rematch  Following the fight at the end of\u00a0Rocky, in which Apollo Creed has successfully defended his heavyweight title in a split decision, he and Rocky are taken to the same hospital for treatment of their injuries. Apollo challenges Rocky to a rematch in front of the press, but Rocky declines and announces his retirement. Rocky became a national celebrity and a worldwide hero going the distance against Creed. He was offered a lot of endorsements offers after that fight. His girlfriend Adrian supports this choice, as do his doctors, who reveal he will require surgery for a\u00a0detached retina, which could lead to permanent blindness. After Rocky is discharged from the hospital, he begins to enjoy the benefits of his life's changes resulting from the match: Rocky's new fame attracts him an agent who sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Rocky and Adrian happily learn that Adrian is pregnant with their first child. His first commercial beast after shave commercial was terrible, he care barely read the lines. He quit after that. He couldn't find any other job, since he never graduated high school and they offered him a manual labor job. But Paulie his brother in law gave him his old job in Shamrock Meat. Rocky needed the money and he took it. Rocky loved that job, but he got fired because they were cutting back. He went to Mickey and ask him to train him. He is considering accepting a rematch against Creed. He went the distance last time, maybe this time he will go for the win. But Mickey was against it, tested him that he doesn't have the tools like he used to. Rocky asked him for a job in his gym, Mickey accepted it. Meanwhile, fuelled by hate mail he has started to receive by the outraged fans, who claim that he was defeated and that the judges were voting in his favour, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish, Apollo ignores all pleas by his friends and family to forget the fight and move on to other potential opponents, and instead, demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of retirement and into a rematch with him. Rocky at first seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After largely unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of returning to the ring. At first, Mickey refuses, worried about Rocky's health, but changes his mind after Apollo publicly insults Rocky on television. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to fighting and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky argues he knows nothing else so this is the only way he can provide. Adrian, angry at Rocky for breaking his promise, refuses to support him. Rocky and Mickey begin training, but it soon becomes apparent Rocky is not focused on the job at hand due to Adrian's disapproval. Adrian's brother, Paulie confronts his sister about not supporting her husband, but she faints during the confrontation and is rushed to the hospital where she goes into labor. Despite being premature, the baby is healthy but Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames himself for what has happened and refuses to leave Adrian's bedside until she wakes up, and will not go to see his new baby until they can see it together. When Adrian comes out of her coma, she finds Rocky by her bedside and the couple are shown their new baby, a boy, which they name Robert \"Rocky\" jr. Adrian gives her blessing to the rematch which enables Rocky to refocus on his training and he quickly gets into shape for the fight.  The night of the fight arrives and Apollo has made a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first fight going the full 15 rounds was a fluke. Rocky, fighting right-handed to protect his eye instead of his natural\u00a0southpaw, is not able to mount much of an offensive effort through the first two rounds but manages to survive them disproving Apollo's theory that the first fight's result was a fluke. As before, the fight once again reaches the 15th round, by which point Apollo has built a lead on points that Rocky cannot possibly beat. However, Apollo's obsession with knocking Rocky out (against the advice of his corner men) leads him to trade blows with Rocky despite his lead.In the final round, Rocky, who switched the tactics and is fighting left-handed again, lands a devastating blow on Apollo that knocks the champ down, but an exhausted Rocky loses his balance and falls to the canvas as well. Rocky manages to stand up before the referee counts to ten, while Apollo is counted out, having his first defeat. Rocky thus wins the fight by knockout and becomes the heavyweight champion of the world. In his post-fight announcement Rocky, who has won back the respect of his fans and Adrian, humbly thanks Apollo for the match.Rocky III: The New Challenge  In the three years since winning the world heavyweight title, Rocky has had a string of ten successful title defences and has seen his fame, wealth and celebrity increase. Rocky did better in commercials like he did last time and he earned those endorsements when he won the title. Meanwhile, Rocky's trainer Mickey worriedly eyes a young and hungry fighter named James \"Clubber\" Lang. Lang rapidly climbs the ranks with six consecutive knockouts and is now the number one contender for Rocky's heavyweight championship. While unveiling a statue of himself at the\u00a0steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Rocky is publicly challenged by Lang. Lang accuses Rocky of selective matchmaking by intentionally accepting challenges from lesser opponents. Lang also questions Rocky's manhood to his wife Adrian enraging Rocky, who accepts his challenge. Rocky's trainer Mickey initially wants no part of the match and refuses to train Rocky. After Rocky demands to know why, Mickey tells him that Lang was correct and all of his title defences were fought against handpicked opponents in order to keep him successful, as well as to avoid more devastating injuries, such as the ones he suffered in the fight against Apollo Creed in their two matches. Mickey also tells Rocky that if he fights Lang, he would \"kill (him) to death inside of three rounds\" because Lang is younger, stronger, and hungrier than Rocky. Knowing this, Rocky questions his whole title reign and Mickey agrees to train Rocky for the fight, which Rocky declares will be his last. Both fighters go in different directions in regards to their training for the fight. Lang works out alone in a spartan setting with very little equipment. Rocky, on the other hand, rents out a hotel ballroom and opens his training camp to the public with dozens of distractions that frustrate Mickey, who fears they will lead to disaster in the fight. Lang and Rocky meet at Philadelphia's\u00a0Spectrum. During a melee before the fight, Lang shoves Mickey, who suffers a heart attack. Rocky decides to call off the fight, but Mickey refuses and implores him to fight and win. As the fight begins, Rocky comes out aggressively and tries to knock out the challenger early. Lang, however, is unfazed by the early assault and quickly takes control of the fight. By the end of the first round Rocky is battered and bloody, and calls for Mickey. The condition of his trainer continues to distract him into the second round, where Lang knocks Rocky out to win the title. Rocky heads back to his dressing room, where Mickey has taken a turn for the worse. Rocky tells Mickey that the fight ended by knockout in the second round but does not say he lost. He tries to convince Mickey there is more to do, but Mickey simply says, \"I love ya, kid,\" and dies in Rocky's arms. Rocky is devastated at losing his manager, mentor and father figure. Rocky goes into a deep depression fueled by Mickey's death, no longer sure if he was ever truly the champion. One night, he rides to his statue and in a fit of anger throws his motorcycle at it. He then stops at Mickey's now-shuttered gym where he is confronted by Apollo Creed, who tells him that Rocky has lost his edge and needs to get it back. To do this, Apollo offers to train Rocky for a rematch with Lang. Rocky agrees and he, with Adrian and Paulie, follows Apollo to Los Angeles. Apollo's plan is to take Rocky back to the basics, from putting him and his family up in an old, unkempt hotel in Creed's old neighbourhood, as well as returning to his old gym, where he hooks Rocky up with\u00a0Duke, Apollo's former trainer. Despite Apollo's best efforts at getting Rocky back into fighting shape, Rocky is still distraught and disillusioned. However, Adrian finally decides to talk to Rocky who, in his frustration, admits to being afraid and feeling responsible for Mickey's death. Through heated compassionate criticism Adrian is finally able to talk him out of his funk and convince him to get back on track, and with Apollo and Duke's expertise, Rocky develops into a completely different fighter by trading his power game for a quick hitting counter-attacking style, which confuses everyone including Lang. The rematch is held at\u00a0Madison Square Garden\u00a0in New York City. At the start of the fight, Rocky sprints from his corner, fighting with a level of skill and spirit that no one expected. As a result, Rocky dominates the first round. After the bell, Lang is in a fit of rage and has to be restrained by his trainers. In the second round, Rocky starts as he did in the first. However, Lang gains the upper hand; from here he dominates Rocky, knocking him down twice. Getting up from the second KD, Rocky adopts a strategy that bewilders Apollo (and Lang) by\u00a0intentionally taking a beating from Lang\u00a0while taunting him for being unable to knock him out. The round ends with a verbal altercation between Lang and Rocky. In the third round, Lang (who is used to winning fights swiftly with knockouts in the early rounds) becomes increasingly angry and quickly exhausts his energy trying to finish Rocky off with repeated knockout blows, most of which miss the newly-agile Rocky. Rocky taunts the champion in order to psych him out, and the aggressive Lang is infuriated. He attacks even harder, walking into Rocky's trap. The tide turns, and Rocky overpowers the winded and outboxed Lang, knocking him out and re-gaining the heavyweight championship of the world. Afterwards, Rocky fulfills Apollo's vague \"big favor\": a private rematch with him at Mick's old gym. The film concludes with the fighters throwing their first punch simultaneously, but this time, after the two massive bouts between them previously, this fight is purely for pride and they fight in the spirit of friendly competition rather than as fierce rivals.Rocky IV: East vs. West  In 1985, Ivan Drago, an immensely muscular 6-foot 5, 261-pound Soviet boxer, arrives in the United States with his wife Ludmilla, and a team of trainers from the USSR and Cuba. His manager, Nicolai Koloff, takes every opportunity to promote Drago's athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations, but agrees to train Apollo despite his misgivings about the fight. He asks Apollo whether the fight is against the Russian, or \"you against you\". During a press conference regarding the match, hostility is created between Apollo and Drago's respective camps. The exhibition takes place at the\u00a0MGM Grand Hotel\u00a0in\u00a0Las Vegas. Apollo enters the ring, wearing his old Uncle Sam outfit, in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with\u00a0James Brown\u00a0performing \"Living in America\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that have no effect on the Russian. It soon turns serious though, as Drago starts clobbering hard. Apollo is worn by the end of the first round. Rocky and Apollo's trainer\u00a0Duke plead with him to give up, but Apollo refuses to do so, and tells Rocky to promise him not to stop the fight no matter what. The second round doesn't go any better, and despite Duke begging Rocky to throw in the towel, he reluctantly honours Apollo's wish. To his ever-lasting regret, this turns out to have fatal consequences as Drago lands a final punch on Apollo that knock him to the ground, killing him. In the immediate aftermath, Drago displays no sense of remorse commenting to the assembled media:\u00a0\"If he dies... he dies.\" Rocky gave the eulogy at his funeral, he didn't lose a best friend. He lost his brother figure and he thanked him for making him the greater fighter he was. Incensed by Drago's cold indifference and feeling a deep sense of guilt, Rocky decides to avenge Apollo's death by agreeing to fight Drago in Russia on Christmas Day in a 15-round bout. As the match is unsanctioned, he is required to forfeit the title. He flies to the USSR without Adrian, setting up his training base in Krasnogourbinsk with only Duke and brother-in-law Paulie to accompany him. To prepare for the fight, Drago uses very high-tech equipment, steroid enhancement, and a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement. Rocky, on the other hand, throws heavy logs, chops down trees, pulls an overloaded snow sleigh, jogs in heavy snow and treacherous icy conditions and climbs a mountain. Adrian shows up unexpectedly to give Rocky her support after initially refusing to travel to Russia because of her doubts on his fighting chances. Her arrival increases Rocky's focus and enhances his training. Drago is introduced with an elaborate, patriotic ceremony that puts the Russian crowd squarely on Drago's side. Rocky turns up more muscular and confident than ever, but is booed by all in attendance. In contrast to his fight with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive and Rocky takes a fierce pounding. Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and silences the Russian crowd by landing a strong right hook that cuts Drago just below his left eye. While Drago is visibly shaken, Rocky is fired up and assaults Drago, which continues even after the bell rings. While Duke and Paulie cheer Rocky for his heroism, they remind him that Drago is not a machine, but a man. Ironically, Drago comments that Rocky \"is not human, he is like a piece of iron\" with his own corner reprimanding him for being \"weak\" in comparison to the \"small American.\" The two boxers continue to hit each other over the next dozen rounds, with Rocky holding his ground despite Drago's powerful punches. His resilience rallies the previously hostile Soviet crowd to his side, which unsettles Drago to the point that he shoves Koloff off the ring for berating his performance. Rocky finally takes out Drago in the 15th and last round, winning by knockout to the shock of the\u00a0Soviet Politburo\u00a0members watching the fight. A bloody and battered Rocky gives a victory speech that's translated to Russian, acknowledging the mutual disdain at first between himself and the crowd. He says it is like the wider disdain between Russians and Americans, but that he and the crowd have come to respect and admire each other during the course of the fight. Rocky adds that the crowd has seen \"two guys killin' each other, but I guess that's better than 20 million\". Rocky finally declares, \"If I can change, and you can change, then everybody can change!\" The Soviet General Secretary stands and passionately applauds Rocky, and his aides follow suit. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son a Merry Christmas, and throws his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds on Christmas Day.Rocky V: Retirement and Return to South Philadelphia  At the press conference held at the airport upon returning home, a flamboyant promoter named George Washington Duke showed up and challenged Rocky to fight Duke's protege, Union Cane who had been declared the new heavyweight champion. Rocky, however, easily blew off the challenge and headed back home with his family. That evening, Robert overheard an argument between Adrian and Paulie. It turned out that during their stay in Russia, Paulie had inadvertently given power of attorney to the Balboas' shady accountant, who then disappeared with their fortune when the accountant duped Rocky and Paulie to sign a tax extension, but it wasn't a tax extension it was power of attorney. Rocky's accountant embezzled his fortune and had invested it in a real estate scheme that had crashed. He lost a lot of money on that investment and made Rocky broke. The family's lawyer also revealed that he had filed 8 criminal acts against the accountant but their mortgage was not entirely paid off, and that Rocky still owed six years of back taxes because of the accountant. The family's lawyer had a solution, if he accepted the fight against Union Cane, the ticket money from the event will enable him to be out of this debt no time. Adrian didn't want him to fight again, but Rocky refused and is considering called Duke to schedule a fight against Union Cane. That would get his fortune back. But Adrian stopped him and asked him to see a doctor first. Rocky refused, but decided to go through with it for Adrian. There was bad news from the doctor, as he confirmed that Rocky was suffering from Cavum septum pellucidum, a condition common to boxers who take too many hard hits to the head. This effectively ended his fighting career. The announcement of Rocky's official retirement made headlines. Rocky declared himself bankrupt leading to his mansion and almost all of his possessions being repossessed, leaving him and his family broke. The only asset remaining was Mighty Mick's Gym, which had been willed to Rocky by Mickey thereby keeping it safe from the accountant. Luckily, Paulie had kept his old home in South Philadelphia, and in 1986, the family packed up and moved back into the modest home. Rocky assured Adrian that the move would only be temporary. Some time later, Rocky reopened Mickey's old gym, Mighty Mick's Gym, and was approached by a young fighter named Tommy Gunn. Tommy came from Oklahoma, and was eager to meet Rocky, with the intent of showing him how good of a fighter he was and hoped Rocky would become his manager after seeing him in action. At first, Rocky was unsure about the idea, not considering himself manager material, but he eventually began to see his younger self in Tommy, and feeling he could pass on some of Mickey's teachings to Tommy, he not only accepted to become his manager, but also offered him to stay with his family. Tommy could have helped Rocky get his fortune back if Rocky leads him to the heavy title. Starting then, Rocky began to relive the older days; he was Mick, and Tommy was Rocky, and since he had to retire, he felt that through Tommy, he would feel like he would win again, feel in his prime again. This unfortunately had a bad side effect, as Rocky became so focused on his role as Tommy's manager, and Tommy himself, that he began to neglect his son, rapidly severing the bond between the two. That bond would be rekindled later. The more Tommy fought, the more he became famous, but all for the wrong reasons. If the media referred to Tommy, it was indirectly through Rocky (i.e. \"Rocky's Gunn aims at the title!\"), and Tommy became frustrated for being trapped in Rocky's shadow. George Washington Duke tempted him with promises of fame and riches, and Tommy aligned himself with him instead of Rocky. Tommy dumped Rocky as his manager for Duke. He was also given a chance at the title, something he wanted very eagerly. During the match between Union Cane and Tommy, Rocky watched the match through television rather excitedly, cheering him on and even punching his punching bag in symmetry with Tommy's punches. Cane had an early lead, and almost knocked Tommy down, but Tommy made a sudden comeback toward the end of the round, and knocked Cane out. After Tommy won the match, Rocky literally screamed and jumped in joy, and when Tommy was about to thank the man whom he described as the one that got him there, and Rocky smiled as he knew he was talking about him, or so he thought. Hearing Tommy give all the credits to Duke and thank him for everything, followed by the crowd showing great displeasure towards Tommy, and praising Rocky instead, while on his end, Rocky lost all the excitement and his smile from the event, and after his son tried to comfort him, Paulie asked him to go out with him to take his mind out of all of this. After being insulted by the media in comparison to Rocky, they told Tommy that Cane was a paper champion that he never won the belt from Rocky. He never fought a real champion and his frustration and rage fuelled by Duke in his scheme to get Tommy to taunt Rocky into a ring, they both went to look for Rocky in town with the press and the camera crew, and after finding him, began taunting him into fighting him in a ring; Tommy, however, vented off his anger at Rocky, the very man who trained him to become the fighter that he is and the one who genuinely cared for him, who was prepared to ignore him until Paulie began criticising Tommy. The new champion's response was to punch Paulie down, resulting in an angered Rocky to challenge him into trying to knock him down now. Duke tried to stop the imminent fight by saying that Tommy would only fight in the ring. Rocky followed by saying, \"My ring's outside.\" This triggered a street fight between the two former friends. Surrounded by a crowd, which was entirely on Rocky's side, Rocky took the initiative by punching Tommy down, then expressed his disappointment in how they should've been friends, like brothers, two fingers of the same hand, and walked off. However, Tommy got back up and attacked Rocky from behind. A few of the crowd attempted to help Rocky out of this back attack, resulting in them being punched out by a wild Tommy. After taking a brief beating from Tommy, Rocky began having flashbacks of his horrifying fight with Ivan Drago, and lost his focus almost completely over what was happening until he began having flashbacks of Mickey instead, with the words, \"Get up and fight, you son-of-a-bitch, 'cause Mickey loves ya!\" echoing through his head. Completely rejuvenated, Rocky got back on his feet, and taunted Tommy into fighting \"one more round\" with him. Cheered on by the crowd, which now included his wife and son, Rocky eventually knocked his former pupil out. Duke dumped Tommy Gunn and strip him from the title when he lost that street fight against Rocky. He then approached Duke, who threatened to sue him should he lay a finger on him, but Rocky knocked him down with an uppercut and nonchalantly asked him, \"Sue me for what? Since he is broke\" Rocky completely moved on from the boxing world after the Tommy Gunn incident, and in 1995, opened a small but successful restaurant named Adrian's, after his beloved wife. The walls of the place were adorned with several family photos as well as magazine covers and pictures from throughout Rocky's fighting career. The patrons loved it when Rocky would visit their table and tell them stories about his past fights. Rocky's world came crashing down in 2002 when Adrian succumbed to ovarian cancer. Every year afterward, on the anniversary of her death, Rocky would visit Adrian's grave and tour all of the places (Rocky's old apartment, the site of the old skating rink and J&M Tropical Fish, the pet store where Adrian worked for years) that held some significance to them. By early 2005, Rocky was pushing 60 and living out his days mainly focusing on his restaurant, he is no longer broke and doing a lot of better than he is now. He was content with the modest life he'd been living for the past fifteen years, and he continued to be recognised on the streets and received friendly greetings from fellow Philadelphians. He even managed to reconnect with a woman named Marie, who, as a young girl, Rocky had saved from going down the wrong path in life.Rocky Balboa: The Final Round  In 2006, Rocky Balboa has been retired from boxing for twenty years and lives a quiet life as a widower. His wife Adrian Pennino Balboa had died from\u00a0cancer\u00a0four years earlier. Adrian's is still very successful, where he regales his patrons with stories of his past. He is still a big shot celebrity and Philadelphians have never forgotten him wherever he goes. He also battles personal demons involving his grief over Adrian's death, the changing times, and his eroding relationship with his son Robert, a struggling corporate employee. Paulie Pennino, Rocky's brother-in-law and best friend, continues to support him whenever he can. Paulie went back to his old job at Shamrock Meat. Late one night, Rocky reunites with a much older \"Little\" Marie, a once mischievous neighbourhood girl that Rocky met when she was a child, now working as a bartender at the Lucky Seven (a bar Rocky once frequented in the mid-1970s), and a single parent of a teenage son born out of wedlock: Stephenson, nicknamed \"Steps\". Rocky's friendship with the two quickly blossoms over the following weeks, and Steps takes to him as a father figure. Meanwhile on the professional boxing circuit, Mason \"The Line\" Dixon reigns as the undisputed world heavyweight champion.\u00a0ESPN\u00a0broadcasts a computer simulation of a fight between Rocky (in his prime) and Mason \u2014 likened to a modern-day version of\u00a0The Super Fight, a 1970 computer simulation of a 15-round fight between\u00a0Rocky Marciano\u00a0and\u00a0Muhammad Ali\u00a0in their prime (that Marciano \"won\" by a KO in the 13th round) \u2014 which ends in a controversial KO victory for Balboa, riling the champ. In contrast, the simulation inspires Rocky to take up boxing again \u2014 an intention that goes public when he successfully renews his license. Dixon's promoters pitch the idea of holding a charity exhibition bout at the\u00a0Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino\u00a0in\u00a0Las Vegas\u00a0to bolster Dixon's falling popularity. Rocky was reluctant at first, when they came to his restaurant and offered him the proposition. But talking to Marie, he decided to go for it and take that exhibition fight. Rocky became a bigger celebrity and was offered a lot of endorsement deals with that fight thanks to Paulie. With some hesitation, both men agree to the match, creating a media buzz that stabs at Rocky's has-been status and Dixon's credibility; Dixon having yet to face a challenging opponent. Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some advice: that to succeed in life, \"it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can\u00a0get\u00a0hit, and keep moving forward\", and that blaming others won't help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky's side. Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed's old trainer Duke who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible. The fight becomes an\u00a0HBO\u00a0pay-per-view\u00a0event. Dixon easily dominates the first round only to injure his left hand against Rocky's hip in the second, after which Rocky makes a dramatic comeback: he manages to knock Dixon down once and then continues to surprise the audience with his prowess and\u00a0chin\u00a0against the much younger and faster fighter. Dixon sends Rocky to one knee in the final round, but the elder fighter pulls himself to his feet for one last assault. The two opponents then continue to punish each other severely throughout the remainder of the final round,\u00a0ending with the two fighters both still standing. Rocky thanks an appreciative Dixon for the fight and leaves the ring to the adulation of the crowd as the result is announced: A win for Mason Dixon by split decision. The fans still cheered for Rocky and he became a bigger celebrity for going the distance against Dixon. He finally got a chance to say goodbye to boxing for good. He never had a chance to back then after fighting against Ivan Drago. In the closing shot, Rocky returns home and visits Adrian's grave again; thanking her for helping him.Creed: Training Adonis Johnson Creed  Nine years after the Mason Dixon fight, Rocky still lived a quiet life in an nicer house back in upper-class Philadelphia. Adonis Johnson Creed never knew his famous father, World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed, who died before he was born. Still, there\u2019s no denying that boxing is in his blood. After arriving from Los Angeles, Donnie tracks down Rocky at Adrian's just before closing time and asks Rocky to become his trainer. Rocky is reluctant to get back into boxing, having already made a one-off comeback at a very advanced age despite having suffered brain trauma during his career as a fighter. One reason why he doesn't want to manage Adonis Creed, because of Tommy Gunn, where George Washington Duke stole his prize pupil from him. He can also immediately tell just by the way Donnie talks that the young man has a higher education, and doesn't get why he wants to be a boxer when he really doesn't have to. However, Rocky still feels guilt about Apollo's death, and seeing that the son is determined to box decides that he will train Donnie the very best he can, as his knowledge will help keep the young man safe in the ring. On November 19, after Donnie has been training solo at Mighty Mick's Gym for some time (using drills he got Rocky to write out for him), Rocky drops by after visiting Paulie's and Adrian's graves for Paulie's birthday. Rocky finally agrees to train him under the condition that Donnie gives his all and oversees his basics. He also has him on runs outdoors, and just as Micky did, catching chickens. Balboa allows Donnie, now known as \"Hollywood Donnie,\" to fight against Leo \"The Lion\" Sporino in six weeks, a local fighter who's the son of Mighty Mick's manager Pete Sporino, a childhood friend of Rocky's. As Leo is already a fighter at Mick's, Balboa moves Donnie to train at the Front Street Gym in north Philadelphia, with several of his longtime friends, and agrees to have Donnie move into his home. On the day of the fight, Pete confronts Rocky, not pleased to have uncovered through calls to LA that Donnie is a Creed, and Rocky asks him to keep it quiet. However, after Donnie wins, word gets out \"anonymously\" the next day that he is Creed's illegitimate son. Rocky gets a call from the trainer/manager of IBF, IBO, WBO and the Lineal light heavyweight champion \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan, who is due to be forced into retirement by an impending prison term. In a meeting at Adrian's, he offers Donnie to be Conlan's final challenger\u2014provided that he change his name to Adonis \"Hollywood Donnie\" Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy, and Conlan's trainer leaves the offer on the table for 24 hours so Donnie can think about it. Rocky gives his support to whatever decision Donnie makes, but can see that he's interested. After asking Rocky about the factual disadvantages of fighting someone bigger and more experienced, let alone the champion, Donnie decides he can do it only because his trainer is Rocky Balboa. While helping Donnie train, Rocky collapses, and from hospital tests learns he has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He is unwilling to undergo chemotherapy, remembering that it was not enough to save Adrian when she had ovarian cancer. His diagnosis and the fact that his best friend and brother-in-law Paulie Pennino, Adrian's brother, has now passed away in addition to Adrian, Apollo and his old trainer Mickey Goldmill further force him to confront his own mortality. Seeing Rocky shaken, Donnie urges him to seek treatment; as long as Rocky agrees to fight his cancer, Donnie will train for the fight, and Rocky agrees. Donnie trains at the hospital and the gym, in addition to assisting the weakened Rocky at home and going over fight strategies.   Donnie fights Conlan at Goodison Park in Conlan's hometown of Liverpool, and many parallels emerge between Apollo and Rocky's first fight forty years earlier. First, before going into the ring, Donnie receives a present from Mary Anne \u2014 new American flag trunks similar to the ones Apollo and later Rocky wore. Additionally, to the surprise of nearly everyone, Donnie goes the distance after giving Conlan all he can handle. Conlan wins on a split decision (just as Apollo retained his title by split decision against Rocky), but Donnie has won the respect of Conlan and the crowd. As Jim Lampley puts it while calling the fight for HBO, \"Conlan won the fight, but Creed won the night.\" Conlan tells Donnie that he is the future of the light heavyweight division, and to wear the Creed name with pride. The film ends with Donnie and a frail but improving Rocky climbing the \"Rocky Steps\" at the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.Creed 2: Facing his nemesis again  In Creed 2, Rocky trains Adonis against Viktor Drago, the son of his friend's killer. He and Ivan Drago face each other once again after decades.Boxing style  Although Rocky is a southpaw, he will often switch stances and fight right-handed. He's a hybrid-fighter, possessing the qualities of an inside-fighter, brawler and swarmer. With the exception of his rematch against Clubber Lang where he fights as an outside-fighter, he advances quickly upon his opponents, driving them into the ropes and setting upon them with a devastating body attack. Rocky is well known for wearing opponents down over the course of a bout. Balboa's iron jaw allows him to take brutal punishment throughout his fights. With a will of steel, he is known for overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds to triumph over his opponents. It is this trait that inspires fans worldwide, sending the message that nothing is out of reach if one believes in himself. Balboa, as stated by Jim Lampley during the fight against Mason Dixon, is renowned for his \"cast iron jaw, ferocious body attack, and will of steel\". All of these traits carried him to victories over the years against physically superior opponents. Rocky has an uncanny ability to sense weakness in his opponents, seizing every opportunity to capitalise on a momentum shift in his fights. No matter how exhausted and battered, Balboa pushes his offensive edge. In the first title fight with Apollo Creed, announcer Stu Nahan refers to Rocky as a \"bull in a china shop\" after witnessing the offensive onslaught. Rocky retired as a 2 time world heavyweight champion and with a pro record of 58 wins, 23 losses and 1 draw with 51 wins by knockout. The fight scenes in the last movie, Rocky Balboa, are considered to be the most realistic in film history, with many boxing experts considering Stallone's in-ring performance to be his best ever.Notable quotes Skills and Attributes Appearances Trivia Fights Before the movies (1966-1975) During the movies Rocky (1975-1976)  Spider Rico-Winner by KO in Round 2 of 8 (44-20) 38 KO Dipper Brown-(Informal match, Rocky won) Apollo Creed-Loss by Split Decision of 15 Rounds (For Heavyweight Title; 44-21) 39 KORocky II (1976)  Apollo Creed-Winner by KO in Round 15 of 15 (Won Heavyweight Title; 45-21) 39 KORocky III (1977-1982)  Virgil Abrams-Winner by KO in Round 1 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 46-21) 40 KO Razor Robinson-Winner by TKO in Round 2 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 47-21) 41 KO Ernie Roman-Winner by KO in Round 3 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 48-21) 42 KO Mac Lee Green-Winner by TKO in Round 6 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 49-21) 43 KO Vito Soto-Winner by KO in Round 6 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 50-21) 44 KO Big Yank Ball-Winner by KO in Round 5 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 51-21) 45 KO Joe Czak-Winner by KO in Round 2 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 52-21) 46 KO Joe Chan-Winner by TKO in Round 2 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 53-21) 47 KO Billy Snow-Winner by TKO in Round 10 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 54-21) 48 KO Big Chuck Smith-Winner by KO in Round 8 of 15 (Retained Heavyweight Title; 55-21) 49 KO \"Thunderlips\"-Draw of 1 Round (Exhibition fight; 55-21-1) 49 KO James \"Clubber\" Lang-Loss by KO in Round 2 of 15 (Lost Heavyweight Title; 55-22-1) 49 KO James \"Clubber\" Lang-Winner by KO in Round 3 of 15 (Won Heavyweight Title; 56-22-1) 50 KO Apollo Creed-(Informal match, Rocky later claims Apollo won the fight)Rocky IV (1983-1985)  Ivan Drago-Winner by KO in Round 15 of 15 (57-22-1) 51 KORocky V (1986-1990)  Tommy Gunn-(Street fight, Rocky won)Rocky Balboa (2006)  Mason Dixon-Loss by Split Decision of 10 Rounds (57-23-1) 51 KOExternal links References Rocky Wiki Apollo Creed  Apollo Creed (August 17, 1942 - August 31, 1985) is a tough agile heavyweight boxer and former Heavyweight Champion that starts out as an antagonist, followed by transitioning into a deuteragonist in the Rocky Franchise. Creed is presented as the undisputed heavyweight world champion in Rocky, he was undefeated and had cleared out his division of challengers prior to his fight with Rocky Balboa, following his split-decision victory over Rocky, Creed challenges Rocky to a rematch in Rocky II, which he loses, losing his world championship and suffering his first career loss. Creed retires after this fight, but he returns to train his former foe, Balboa, in Rocky III following Rocky's loss to Clubber Lang. Creed and Balboa bond over this time, becoming close friends. In Rocky IV, Creed decides to make a one-off return to the ring to fight a Soviet Union boxer by the name of Ivan Drago. The fight is billed as an exhibition, but unfortunately, Creed is knocked unconscious in the second round, resulting in his deathBiography Early Life  Apollo Creed was born on August 17th, 1942 in Los Angeles County, California, there isn't much information regarding Creed's childhood, but based off Creed's bright intelligence, it is assumed that he had a good education and that his family was middle class. Creed began boxing in 1968 at the age of 26, it is revealed in the video game Rocky Legends that Creed's first-ever professional boxing match was against an old Tony \"Duke\" Evers! At the end of the fight, Creed approached Duke and mentioned how it would be good to have an experienced fighter managing his career and training him, Duke agreed and began training him at the Delphi Boxing Academy! In the coming years, Creed met and married Mary Anne, they had two children together, an unnamed daughter and unnamed son. It is revealed in Creed that Apollo was having an affair around 1984-85, resulting in an illegitimate son being born posthumously, this child was later revealed to be Adonis Johnson Creed.Rocky Discovering Rocky Balboa  Apollo Creed first appears as a charismatic, intelligent, and undefeated 34-year-old\u00a0World Heavyweight Champion. A planned\u00a0Bicentennial\u00a0fight against number one contender Mac Lee Green was scheduled for January 1, 1976, which Apollo gladly hypes whenever someone places a microphone in front of him. However, Green hurts his left hand in training and the other top ranked contenders, such as Ernie Roman, Buddy Shaw, are either busy or don't believe that they can get into shape in time. Duke suggested he should fight Big Chuck Smith or Billy Snow, but Creed thought Smith was too dull, and Snow fouled too much. Unwilling to waste the time, effort and money he's already invested in the fight, Creed comes up with a promotion that will generate huge publicity; he will offer an unknown local fighter an opportunity to battle Creed for the title, in a match in\u00a0Philadelphia,\u00a0Pennsylvania. Upon reviewing the local boxers in Philadelphia, Creed is drawn to a club fighter named\u00a0Rocky Balboa\u00a0because Balboa is Italian\u00a0and has a catchy nickname, \"The Italian Stallion\". Apollo also explains his choice by saying: \"Who discovered America?\u00a0An Italian, right? What better way to celebrate its 200th birthday than to get it on with one of his descendants?\". Duke warns Apollo against facing Balboa since he fights left-handed, but Apollo brushes off the idea that he could be anything resembling a legitimate threat, pledging to knock him out in three rounds. Duke raises concern again when he sees Balboa in a television interview, training by punching sides of beef in a meat packing plant - breaking the ribs - however, Apollo puts more effort into giving everyone a good show rather than training for the bout.Creed vs. Balboa 1  For the fight, Apollo dresses up like both\u00a0George Washington\u00a0and\u00a0Uncle Sam\u00a0in the pre-fight festivities (with his matching trademark \"stars and stripes\" boxing shorts) is in a jovial mood until Rocky knocks him down in the first round with a single uppercut. It's the first time Creed has ever been knocked down in his career. He then endures a gruelling 15-round fight with Balboa, who manages to get to his feet after Creed takes him down with an\u00a0uppercut\u00a0in the 14th round in what appears to be the end of the match. This was the first time anyone had ever taken the champion the full 15 rounds. Both fighters are beaten, bloodied, and bruised by the end of the bout - Rocky with severe eye damage and Apollo with internal bleeding, caused by broken ribs. Apollo gains a controversial split decision victory, and neither fighter wants a rematch.Rocky II Challenging Rocky Balboa  Creed is first seen in the ER alongside Rocky and a flurry of press, Creed, going against his earlier stance, denounces the fight as a fluke and challenges Rocky to finish the fight right there, which nearly happens when both men get out of their wheelchairs and look ready to brawl, only to be restrained by hospital employees. Later, when things have calmed down, Rocky goes to the recuperating Creed, and asks for Creed to be truthful if he gave his all in the fight against him. Creed replies in the affirmative.  Creed's desire for a rematch with Balboa intensifies when it becomes clear that the prevailing public opinion is that Creed had either gotten lucky, or the judges were fixed in his favour. Duke tries to pacify Apollo that it was he who won by decision. Creed remains frustrated by the feeling that he didn't truly 'beat' Balboa, and continues to be haunted by negative fan mail. Evers pleads with Creed to not fight Rocky again. His reason is that despite the horrific beating Rocky received from Creed, Balboa kept coming after him. Rocky has married his girlfriend, Adrian, after recovering from the first fight, and is not keen on fighting again, especially given Adrian's disapproval. Rocky hopes to cash in on his new fame by making commercials, but this doesn't pan out. Rocky decides he wants to fight again, but is discouraged by Mickey because of an injury to his eye in the first fight. It is not until Creed challenges Balboa to a second fight on\u00a0Thanksgiving Day, 1976 using various humiliation tactics that Mickey decides to train Rocky for a second fight. Creed is far more serious at the press conference, assuring the press that he took the last fight lightly, but this time the world will see the best Apollo Creed, citing that he would \"drop [Balboa] like a bad habit\" and tells Rocky when he leaves \"Come November, you're mine!\" In a press interview during training, he also insists that Rocky \"cannot last five minutes in the ring with a superior athlete like me!\" Creed plows through sparring partners and trains harder than ever before, with the intention of punishing Balboa for the embarrassment eleven months earlier.Creed vs. Balboa 2  Unlike their first fight, Creed dominates Balboa throughout the second fight, managing to thwart Rocky's strategy of fighting right-handed. Despite this, he is unable to make good on his promise of an early knockout victory, as Rocky absorbs his punches. By the final round, he is well ahead on points and Duke begs Apollo to go on the defensive, as he'll win if he makes it to the end of the match; Apollo refuses, desperate to knock Rocky out rather than win on points. Apollo endures a substantial beating in later rounds, when it becomes apparent he cannot knock Balboa out, and Balboa begins landing his own punches on the tiring Creed. At the beginning of the 15th round, he tells Rocky, \"You're going down\", to which Rocky replied, \"No way\". After going toe-to-toe for much of the final round, Creed is knocked down by a left from Balboa, with Balboa falling down in exhaustion as well. If neither got up, it would be a draw, keeping the title with Creed. Rocky is able to get up by the count of 9, but Creed is unable to pull himself up and is counted out, losing the match and the championship by knockout, his first professional loss. Apollo retires from boxing soon after. Even though he has lost, he gains his respect from the crowd back since it feels that he fought and lost in a fair fight. The fight also results in Creed finally acknowledging Balboa's ability as a fighter, rather than seeing him as a fluke.Rocky III Training Rocky Balboa  Apollo (39 years old) first appears at the first fight between\u00a0James \"Clubber\" Lang, 23 years old, and Rocky Balboa, 34 years old, as a guest analyst, a match in which Lang defeats Rocky by KO in the second round. Before the match, the former champion Creed steps into the ring to greet the fighters. When he steps up to Lang, the latter slaps away Creed's hand and mockingly and rudely insists that he \"don't want no has-been in my corner\". He further says, \"You want to jump, Creed? Jump.\" When Creed walks away stunned at this rude display from the belligerent challenger, Lang laughs at him and calls him a \"chicken\". Creed then wishes Rocky luck, telling him to 'give everyone a present' and knock out Lang. Following the match, Rocky's beloved manager Mickey dies.  Determined in part to put the disrespectful brute in his place, Creed finds Rocky at Mickey's gym and they agree to have Apollo take over as Balboa\u2019s manager. The pair travels to the 'Tough Gym' in\u00a0Los Angeles, California\u00a0where Creed used to train in preparation for a rematch with Balboa. Creed encourages Rocky not to ignore the naysayers that say he is too old, but instead refocus himself. During this talk, he states, \"Now when we fought.. you had that eye of the tiger.\" Creed tells Balboa that he will help him get it back. Creed mentions that Rocky will owe him \"a big favour\" once he wins, which he does not specify at first. Rocky's training is geared toward making him quicker and more agile, to counter the larger, stronger brawler. Apollo teaches Rocky how to fight like himself. Rocky has trouble concentrating during his training, suffering from guilt over Mickey's demise and self-doubt. Adrian helps Rocky recognize this as a simple fear of losing again and convinces him that he can't let fear control his life and that he has to fight again, not to prove a point, but to live without fear. Rocky agrees and begins to put his fear aside. Creed helps Rocky rediscover the fire inside, which he had lost in the time leading up to the Lang fight, that had won him the title. Creed calls this fire the \"eye of the tiger\". Before the match begins, Creed expresses his confidence that Rocky will win. He gives Rocky his signature \"colours\" (Apollo's\u00a0stars and stripes\u00a0boxing trunks) to wear during the fight (and tells him to wash them afterwards). Rocky dominated the first round, but the second round is to Clubber's favour with Rocky barely landing any punches. Between the second and third rounds, Creed shouts at Rocky not to test Lang, but Rocky protests he knows what he is doing with the \"rope-a-dope\". During the third round, Lang is weakened from wasting all his strong punches on Rocky and is knocked out. Rocky wins the rematch and regains his title as Heavyweight Champion.Third Fight against Balboa  Throughout the training, Creed repeatedly told Rocky, \"Remember, when this is over, you owe me a favour\", but left it at that. After defeating Clubber Lang, Creed reveals the cost of his training - a second rematch with Rocky. However, this fight is not a bloody battle in an arena, but a friendly sparring match at Mickey's Gym. Rocky happily accepts the challenge. The film ends showing each boxer hitting the other at the same time, symbolizing the equality of their greatness. Rumours of the third fight would persist for decades afterwards, but the outcome was apparently not known to anyone but the two fighters until 2015, when, asked by Apollo's son Adonis Johnson Creed, Rocky confided that Apollo had won.Rocky IV Challenging Soviet Union Boxer Ivan Drago  In 1985, Apollo (43 years old), comes out of a five-year retirement to fight mammoth Soviet Olympic boxer\u00a0Ivan Drago, who had come to the United States on behalf of the Soviet Union to enter the world of professional boxing. Not wanting the Soviets to appear superior to American fighters, and searching for a return to the limelight and the adoration of the public, the patriotic Apollo challenges Drago to an exhibition match, and calls out Drago at the press conference that sets up their exhibition bout at the\u00a0MGM Grand\u00a0in\u00a0Las Vegas, Nevada\u00a0on August 31, 1985. Highlighted by a pre-match rendition of \"Living in America\" by\u00a0James Brown, Apollo enters the arena from a descending scaffold overhead, dancing to the music in his old red, white, and blue Uncle Sam outfit. With Rocky, Duke and Paulie in his corner, Apollo was overly confident that he could dispense of Drago with ease. However, Apollo was not ready for the extreme size and strength of the Russian. After taunting the Russian and landing a number of ineffectual punches, Creed was pummeled badly in the first round. Rocky wanted to stop the fight but Apollo refused. Apollo told Rocky not to stop the fight \"no matter what...no matter what!\"Death  By the start of the second round, Drago continued to pummel Creed with ease. Rocky again tried to stop the fight by throwing in the towel. Apollo told Rocky not to stop the fight, giving Drago a chance to deliver a blow (as Rocky dropped the towel) that unfortunately killed Apollo, who died in Rocky's arms in the middle of the ring. Rocky then sets out to avenge Apollo's death by beating Drago in the\u00a0Soviet Union, with the\u00a0Soviet premier\u00a0and the\u00a0Politburo\u00a0looking on. He succeeds as the film ends with Rocky Balboa winning the fight by knockout in the last round.Rocky Balboa Legacy  In 2006 (Rocky Balboa), Rocky is seen paying tribute to Apollo by telling customers at his restaurant stories about his friendship and fights with him. During the commentary before the Rocky vs Mason Dixon fight, a montage of Rocky's opponents was shown which included his two fights against Apollo.Creed Illegitimate Son Adonis Johnson Creed  In 2016 (Creed), it has been revealed that Creed had an affair sometime before his death, and from that, Adonis Johnson Creed was born. After his biological mother's death in the late '90s, Apollo's widow, Mary Anne, adopts him. At a young age, not only does he possess the boxing skills of his father, but also his fiery temper. Years later, presumed to be a well-educated young man, Adonis leaves his job to pursue a full-time career in boxing. He first seeks tutelage from Duke's son, Little Duke, who runs the Delphi Boxing Academy, the gym that Apollo was trained at. Little Duke refuses to work with Adonis to ensure his safety. Adonis, to his mother's dismay, moves to Philadelphia to seek out Rocky Balboa. While meeting up at Adrian's, Rocky is surprised when Adonis mentions a third fight between him and Apollo that happened behind closed doors, presenting himself to be Apollo's son. Rocky compliments his father's boxing ability and reveals that Apollo won their third match.Adonis trains with Rocky Balboa  When the word got out that Adonis is Apollo's illegitimate son, the media heavily publicized the story of his infidelity, which catches the eye of the trainer for the reigning light-heavyweight champion, \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan. Both parties would want the fight to happen, however, on the condition that Adonis would assume his actual name instead of his mother's last name, Johnson, to which he agrees, similar to Apollo's desire to select Rocky due to his nickname: \"The Italian Stallion\". Leading up to the fight, Rocky has been diagnosed with cancer, which greatly impacts Adonis' behavior, including being incarcerated for the night after a brawl at a club. While Rocky visits him in jail, Adonis angrily blames him for his\u00a0father's death, while Rocky tries to calm him down and understand Apollo, who isn't there to defend himself. After getting his mind straight, Adonis makes a pact with Rocky that they would both fight their respective battles together. In\u00a0Liverpool, Adonis receives a gift from Mary Anne; boxing trunks that heavily resembles his father's trunks, who he passed to Rocky, who he passed to\u00a0Tommy \"The Machine\" Gunn. The fight presents many parallels to Rocky and Apollo's original fight, with Adonis assuming his trainer's role. Conlan presents an unrelenting attack on Adonis, in which he knocks him down. After a less than stellar introductory round, Adonis finally manages a right hook strong enough to cut Conlan by surprise. In the eleventh round, after an intense flurry, Conlan manages a strong shot that seemingly knocked Adonis unconscious, however Adonis sees visions of his relationship with his girlfriend and Rocky's ailing composure, but finally wakes up after seeing a vision of his father in his prime, which baffles Conlan and the audience.Adonis lives up to the Creed Legacy  Before the final round, Rocky is adamant on stopping the fight to save Adonis from the long-term effects of his injuries, a decision he contemplated 30 years after Apollo's death. However, Adonis wants to continue to fight to prove that he is not \"a mistake\". After the revelation, Rocky tells Adonis that, though he's never had the chance to thank Apollo for stepping in when Mickey died, it does not match what he's done for him and that he loves him. In the closing seconds of the fight, Adonis finally unleashes a style that is comparable to his father's and Rocky's and manages to knock down Conlan for the first time in his career. A split decision determines Conlan the winner of the fight, and gives Adonis the ultimate respect, telling him that he's \"the future of this division\". During the post-fight interview,\u00a0HBO Boxing\u00a0analyst\u00a0Max Kellerman\u00a0asks Adonis what he would like to say to his father, to which Adonis tearfully says that he loves him and he knows he didn't leave him on purpose, in which he concludes the interview saying he's \"proud to be a Creed\".Personality and Traits  As Apollo Creed's fighting style is reminiscent of Muhammad Ali, so is his personality. Creed is charismatic, quick-witted, and a wisecracker, usually rhyming his words and insults like Ali. Creed was viewed as cocky, but confident, always trash talking his opponents with a smile and then outclassing them in the ring. Creed has every right to be overly-confident because of his perfect record. Creed is known for his quick wits, he is able to spin together a few words and insult his opponent. An example is when Ivan Drago doesn't answer a question and Creed says \"The man's tongue didn't make it through customs!\"Boxing Style  Because the original film was released in 1976 during the reign of Muhammad Ali, it is reasonable to assume that, with Ali being considered the quintessential boxer by having defeated some of the best of the time, Creed was based largely on him, although his public image is more in the vein of Sugar Ray Leonard or Joe Louis. Like Ali, Apollo was an outside fighter, relying on his speed and power to get through fights. His jab-cross-hook combination were his mainstay, and also just like Ali, Creed's defence was heavily contingent upon his speed. Apollo used Ali's \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\" philosophy, being able to bob and weave and frustrate his opponents. A notable difference was that though Creed had Ali's unorthodox hand positioning, he ducked, bobbed and weaved in the classic style, as opposed to Ali who preferred to move backwards, in contradiction to boxing's basic tenets, but with a delightful degree of success. Perhaps the reason for this was that only Ali could do be that unorthodox and look convincing; where most boxing instructors would tell you that you can't land a punch when you're retreating backwards, Ali did that too with alarming regularity. But just like Ali, Creed was susceptible to taking a lot of damage during fights because of the level at which he held his hands, a fact which ultimately proved to be his undoing. By the second film, he also has the bolo punch (wind up one fist and punch with the other) in his arsenal, which seems to be a result of the punch being used by then welterweight champion Sugar Ray Leonard. This punch, originated by Ceferino Garcia, a world middleweight champion hailing from Philippines, is a variation of the feint. One of the fists is winded up in rather spectacular fashion; the catch there is that the opponent may expect a punch from this hand or, sensing a trap, from the other. Whichever hand the opponent focuses on, the aggressor here may easily throw the other. This is more of a humiliating, crowd pleasing punch. A clear example was seen in the now famous no mas bout between welterweights Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto 'Hands of Stone' Duran. In Rocky I a reporter asked him if it was a coincidence that he was fighting a white man on the most celebrated day in our country's history; to which Apollo replied, \"I don't know about that. Is it a coincidence that he's fighting a black man on the most celebrated day in our country's history?\"Accomplishments  Heavyweight Champion (1 time, 1972-1979) (defeated Floyd McCallum, lost to Rocky Balboa)Quotes Trivia Rocky Wiki Tommy Gunn  Tommy \"The Machine\" Gunn (born May 13th, 1966) also nicknamed the Clone Ranger by the press is an American former professional boxer who competed in the Heavyweight division during the 1990s. He reigned as the undisputed heavyweight champion and was one of the deuteragonists-turned-secondary antagonists in Rocky V. Gunn left his hometown in Oklahoma, moving to Philadelphia in Rocky V with only a few hundred dollars to his name. He sought out Rocky Balboa when arriving in Philadelphia, hoping that Rocky would train him. At first, Balboa was reluctant due to the feeling that managing wasn\u2019t for him, but after seeing Gunn\u2019s persistence and skills, he decided to give him a shot. Balboa trained Gunn to 14 consecutive victories in the heavyweight division. During this time, the media began calling Gunn the \u2018\u2019Clone Ranger\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Rocky\u2019s Robot\u2019\u2019 due to the similar styles. Gunn eventually left Balboa and signed a contract with George Washington Duke; Duke offered Gunn a title fight and more money. Gunn would go on to defeat Union Cane, capturing the Heavyweight Championship. Despite the victory, the press still labelled Gunn as Balboa\u2019s clone and called him a paper champion. Gunn infuriated by this went to the local bar Balboa was at and challenged him to a fight, Balboa turned down the offer until Gunn punched Paulie. Balboa challenged Gunn to a fight in the street, Gunn accepted and brawled with Balboa. It all ended when Balboa knocked Gunn out, the police then picked Gunn up and arrested him.Biography Early Life  Tommy Gunn grew up in the streets of Oklahoma; he mentions that his family didn\u2019t have much, indicating that he was forced to fend for himself, also mentioning that his father was a violent alcoholic that regularly beat him and his mother up. He attributes a lot of his fury in the ring to his father, stating that the first man he knocked out was his father and that every time he steps in the ring, it\u2019s his father that he sees. Gunn held an amateur record of 45-1. He officially turned pro in 1984, at the age of 18, and generated a record of 8-0 (8 KOs) before he met Balboa. In 1986, Gunn packed up all his belongings and left any family he had left, heading to Philadelphia and seeking out Rocky Balboa, hoping that Balboa would manage and train him.Rocky V Tracking down Rocky Balboa  In 1986 Tommy Gunn, a young fighter from Oklahoma, arrived in Philadelphia to seek out a down-and-out Rocky Balboa, hoping for a chance to be taught boxing greatness from the man himself. Gunn approaches Balboa on the street, introducing himself, and telling him that he is a fighter with a 45-1 amateur record and an 8-0 pro record. He tells Balboa that he is a big fan and was wondering if Balboa would train him, mentioning that he has about $400 and would pay Balboa to work with him. Before Balboa has a chance to respond, boxing promoter, George Washington Duke interrupts and pulls Balboa away from Gunn to speak business. Gunn waits around until Duke leaves, but Balboa isn't interested in talking, telling Gunn to come back another time. Gunn showed up at Mighty Mick's Gym the following day and did some sparring with another member of the gym. He opted not to wear headgear and got popped with a few jabs at first, bloodying his nose, but Gunn quickly shook it off and unloaded on his opponent with deadly hooks, causing Balboa to scream at Gunn to take it down a notch, but Gunn continued to throw huge shots until his opponent almost got knocked down. Gunn quickly apologised to his opponent, but then asked Balboa what he thought, and Balboa told him that he doesn't listen to well and that he is more of a street fighter, reminding Gunn that this is boxing, not street fighting. Gunn continues to pester Balboa and asks him to manage him; Balboa agrees that Gunn has a lot of potential and skill, but tells Gunn that he isn't a manager, wishing Gunn good luck. Despite a poor first impression in Mighty Mick's Gym, Gunn decides to come back later that night and wait outside the gym for Balboa. He approaches Balboa and again asks him to manage him, telling Balboa that all he wants is an opportunity, a shot. Balboa still seems hesitant, telling Gunn to head home to his family, but Gunn tells him that he has no family left and that everything he has is right here, he tells Balboa that he is hungry and just wants a chance. Balboa invites Gunn into his home for dinner in which he learns that Gunn comes from an abusive alcoholic father that beat him and his mother up, Gunn mentions that the first man he ever knocked out was his father and that everytime he fights, he sees his father. Balboa then invites Gunn to stay if he has nowhere else to go, offering up the basement for him to sleep in, Gunn accepts and moves in.Training under Rocky Balboa  Thanks to Rocky's managing, Tommy's great talent was sharpened, and Tommy won 14 consecutive fights with great success; the first eight on his own, and between 1986 to early 1990, won the others with the help of Rocky, generating a record of 22-0 in the Heavyweight division. However, as he climbed the ladder of success, he took notice that he was almost always praised indirectly through Rocky, such as sports magazine covers referring to him as \"Rocky's Gunn.\" or other media outlets calling him \"Rocky's Robot\" He was aware that he was living in his shadow, and felt he was gaining no fame of his own, increasingly becoming frustrated. Along with these frustrations, Gunn believed that he should have had a shot at the Heavyweight title by now and was fed up with waiting around. Less-than-reputable promoter George Washington Duke approached Tommy eventually, promising him the fame and riches he couldn't get from being with Rocky, and having noticed that no formal papers were signed between the pair, Duke signed Tommy in for himself. Gunn along with Duke visited Balboa on Christmas, Gunn told Balboa that he was signing papers with Duke in the morning and that if Balboa wishes to continue training him, he can, and if he doesn't, that's it then. Gunn mentions that Duke is giving him things that Balboa can't, like a title shot. The next morning Gunn signed papers with Duke and officially parted ways with Balboa.Signing with Duke and Heavyweight Championship victory  After a somewhat short and non-spectacular battle between he and Union Cane, Tommy won with ease, knocking Cane out, and becoming champion, but the crowd rejected him, praising Rocky instead, as Tommy didn't thank Balboa in the post-fight interview and did not fight with the heart and passion that Rocky did, and as the media later criticized him for, he seemingly won the belt with no difficulty or struggle. In that same post-fight press conference, the press claimed that Cane was just a paper champion because his title reign was manufactured and he never had to defeat Balboa to claim the title. The press teased Gunn and asked him when he would fight a real fighter, causing Gunn to storm out of the room. Gunn expressed his anger to Duke over everyone's crude reaction towards his victory, and the latter told him that to get the respect he wants so much, he had to drag Rocky into the ring through any means and beat him. Duke kept insisting that Balboa had to be humiliated and insulted, and goaded into fighting.Street fight with Rocky Balboa and arrest  Later that night, Duke and Tommy, along with a small camera crew, went after Rocky in the city, heading to a local bar that Balboa hangs out at and challenging him to fight with Tommy. Duke's scheme went completely wrong when Tommy, in a fit of anger, punched down Rocky's brother-in-law, Paulie Pennino, who began criticising him for treating Rocky so bad and even betraying him, as he was the one who brought him to victory. Rocky's reaction to this act was to challenge Tommy to try knocking him down now, adding that \"his ring's outside.\", much to Duke's dismay as he wanted both of them to fight in the official boxing ring. A heated street fight triggered between the two former friends. Rocky used his street fight skills to beat Tommy. Duke told him during the fight with Rocky \"If you lose, you're finished.\". Despite being the Heavyweight Champion, the shame of being involved in a street fight with his former trainer would have had a negative impact on his career, and after the fight, Duke dumped Gunn who was picked up by the police. It's unknown what Gunn's fate was following his arrest. It is assumed that he was stripped of his Heavyweight Championship as he instigated an unlawful fight in the street.Events After Rocky V Professional Wrestler  Tommy Gunn would be stripped of his Heavyweight Championship and retire from the sport of boxing, becoming a second-rate professional wrestler. Gunn barnstormed around the country and eventually transformed himself into Tommy \u2018Boom Boom\u2019 Gunn, performing exclusively in the Midwest in third-rate venues.Personality and Traits  Tommy Gunn was a very angry and hungry individual. He hadn't been handed anything in his life and was left to work for everything that he had. Gunn was raised in a violent household where his father would regularly beat him and his mother up. Gunn's entire childhood shaped the man he would grow into, he began training at a young age because he had so much anger and was already thinking about knocking his dad out. Gunn eventually did knock his father out, despite thinking this would make him feel better, Gunn clearly still carries a lot of pent up anger. He mentions that he sees his dad every time he enters the boxing ring and his aggressive boxing style would make one think that Gunn is still consumed with rage. Gunn used this anger to drive himself to the top of the boxing world, along with Balboa's help. Gunn tastes success for the first time and begins to show signs of arrogance as well. In all, Gunn is a hardworking, heated fighter.Boxing Style  Tommy Gunn's fight style is very similar to Rocky Balboa's, Balboa taught Gunn practically everything he knew and Gunn mirrored it well. Gunn slips the jab, followed by striking his opponent with a body shot and finishing with a combo of hooks, almost identical to Balboa. Gunn can be seen as to having an iron jaw as he carries himself the same as Balboa by withstanding punches in the same way as Balboa, almost walking into them before countering with hooks and body shotsAccomplishments  Heavyweight Champion (1 time, 1990-unknown) (defeated Union Cane, lost to an unknown opponent or stripped)Quotes Trivia References Rocky Wiki Main Page Rocky Wiki  Welcome to the Rocky Wiki site!!!

In the game Rocky Legends we learn about Lang's prison life and how he discovered boxing. Lang gets into a confrontation with fellow prisoner Jack Jarrell. The two turn out to be scheduled for a fight in a boxing tournament held within the prison, Lang wins the fight and is released from prison not long after. Lang would then begin watching Rocky Balboa's rise to the top, which began to bother him. He began training, and soon after turned pro.Rocky III Challenging Rocky Balboa  Rocky Balboa has become a huge celebrity and a household name since defeating Apollo Creed for the Heavyweight Championship! He has had countless endorsement deals and has made 10 consecutive title defences against opponents that are said to be \"Out of Balboa's league\" Meanwhile, James \"Clubber\" Lang has rapidly climbing the heavyweight ranks, winning 27 consecutive fights and earning himself a number one contendership fight for the heavyweight championship. Lang wins the fight and is then seen yelling at Rocky\u2019s trainer Mickey, who was in the crowd, saying, \"I want Balboa\u2026 I want Balboa, you hear me old man, you tell Balboa, NOBODY CAN BEAT ME, you tell him what I said, he's next, I\u2019m gonna kill him, nobody can stop me, you tell Balboa that, I\u2019m coming after him. You tell him!\"  Lang is displayed as being annoyed at the relative ease with which Rocky wins his bouts. Lang was being interviewed after the fight when he says, \"I want a shot at the title, Balboa got the guts he\u2019ll meet me in the ring or anywhere else. My whole life been directed to this title and nothing else, I live alone, I train alone, I\u2019ll win the title alone, I want him, he can\u2019t duck me forever, he can run but he can\u2019t hide\". After Lang says this, the sports anchor says that Lang will have to wait since Balboa just defended his title for the 10 time and that Balboa has also agreed to face the World Wrestling Champion Thunderlips, the more he has to wait the angrier it makes Lang. Lang is seen sitting in the stands during Rocky\u2019s exhibition with Thunderlips, he looks annoyed and disgruntled, leaving the match before it ends. Lang shows up at the unveiling of Rocky\u2019s statue, hanging back in the crowd. Rocky begins his speech and mentions that he is considering retiring. Lang then pushes through the crowd saying \"Getting out while you can?, don\u2019t give this sucka no statue, give him guts!!, I told you I wasn\u2019t going away, you got your shot now give me mine!\" Mickey responds to Lang by telling him to get the hell out of here, Lang aggressively looks towards Mickey and says \"Shut up old man, I ain\u2019t going nowhere\" Lang then says \"They don\u2019t want a man like me to have the title because I\u2019m not a puppet like that fool up there\" Rocky finally responds telling Lang he has a big mouth. Lang then puts his fists up and tells Balboa to do something about it, Balboa proceeds to walk down towards Lang, but Mickey stops him. Lang proceeds to tell everyone that he is the number 1 ranked fighter in the world, also that Balboa has been taking fights from other bums the \"easy matches\" and that he will fight Balboa anywhere and anytime. Lang continues insulting Balboa saying he isn\u2019t a real man and that he\u2019s a coward, Lang then makes a sexual remark toward Rocky's wife Adrian, causing Balboa to snap and storm towards Lang, causing a small melee that is quickly separated by the surrounding police. Balboa accepts the challenge. Lang trains the same for this fight as his other fights and does not hire any trainers and works out in a squalid building using an old punching bag, a floor mat, a mirror, and rope attached to a doorway. Lang pushes himself to the limit during his training focusing on strength and power, by doing sit ups, pull ups, punching the punching bag, and boxing in front of the mirror, Lang trains by himself for the entire time in his quiet building, which may or may not also serve as his personal residence. Although not monitored like many other pro boxers, Lang's effort allows him full concentration into his exercise. This is in contrast to Rocky, who rented the lobby of a hotel and is constantly hounded by autograph seekers and souvenir peddlers.Becoming Heavyweight Champion  Before the fight, Lang is seen preparing in his locker room, the press have all squeezed their way in and are attempting to ask Lang questions, but Lang isn't having any of it. He is ignoring them and continuing to stick to himself, but with every question that is asked, Lang continues to get more and more infuriated. He tells them to go away, but they don't listen. Lang eventually snaps and hits his locker, followed by heading over to the press and smashing their camera on the ground. Lang leaves his locker at the same time that Balboa does, prompting Lang to yell out to Balboa in the hallway \"Ay Sucka, Balboa you through, you washed up.\" Balboa fires back at Lang which angers him, a brawl ensues and both men try to get through the crowd to get to each other, and during the pushing, Lang pushes Mickey over, this caused him to fall and have a heart attack, and later die. Apollo Creed, guest commentating, enters the ring to shake both fighters\u2019 hands. Creed approaches Lang to shake his hand, Lang slaps Creed\u2019s hand away and says \"Get out my face, don\u2019t need nothing you ain\u2019t got no more, don\u2019t need no has-been messing up my corner and you better get that bad look off your face before I knock it off\". Creed has a strong disliking to Lang after this and tells Balboa to do everyone a favour and \"Drop this chump\". When the two fighters meet in the middle of the ring, Lang does not take his eyes off of Balboa, he just whispers \"Dead meat Rocky bursts out of his corner throwing hook after hook and body shot after body shot, the punches seem to have little effect on Lang and when Lang decides to start hitting back, he unleashes deadly hooks onto Balboa, at one stage trapping him in the corner, and throwing hook after hook. The damage of Langs punches begin to show as Rocky has several cuts on his face and a badly bruised eye. The second round is completely dominated by Lang, he unleashes more hooks onto Balboa until he has Balboa stunned, wobbling in the corner, and staring at Lang, as if he to say finish it. Lang loads up and throws a huge right hook, dropping Balboa and winning the fight by KO! Lang won his 28th consecutive fight and became the new Heavyweight Champion.Rematch with Rocky Balboa  After Balboa agrees to train with Creed, he calls out Lang and asks for a rematch, Lang would respond during an interview on TV by saying \"I reject the challenge because Balboa is no challenge, but I'd be more than happy to beat up on him some more\". The interviewer proceeds to ask what Lang thought of Balboa being trained by Apollo Creed which he replies by saying \"Apollo who? You talking bout that old fool Apollo Creed, shucks, one has-been is enough, all Apollo been doing is running off at the mouth lately and when I see him I\u2019m gonna close it for him.\" When asked when the fight will take place, Lang says \"the sooner the better\" he goes on to say that he can\u2019t be beaten and that he will train even harder this time and make sure there is no quick knockdown \"I\u2019m gonna torture him, I\u2019m gonna crucify him real bad\". An example that Lang may have lost his focus or just isn't taking this fight as serious, is that he allowed the press in his locker room before the fight, usually, Lang prefers to be alone. Lang is interviewed and is asked for his prediction for the fight. Lang simply says, \"Prediction? ... Pain.\" It's clear that a large portion of the audience doesn't have much respect or love for Lang, he has failed to gain the kind of admiration and respect that Rocky did after he defeated Apollo. Lang is loudly booed by the audience upon his entrance except for a small portion of the crowd that calls themselves \"Clubber Fans\". On his way down to the ring, a spectator jumps out in front of Lang, prompting Lang to forcefully shove the spectator back into the audience, not caring at all. Lang climbs into the ring and immediately turns his attention to Balboa, playing more mind games and talking trash. Lang calls over to Balboa and says \"Ay fool you ready for another beating, you should have never came back\" Balboa and Creed choose to ignore Lang and his theatrics, but Lang doesn't stop. Lang then hovers around Creed and starts saying \"Ay boy... Ay boy\" Creed decides to turn around and Lang proceeds to say \"After I crucify him, your next\" Creed shakes it off and simply respond with \"Just stay out of my face chump.\" followed by turning his back on Lang, which infuriates Lang, prompting him to say \"Don't turn your back on me\" and forcefully push Creed in the back, causing a small melee to ensue that is quickly broken up by the fighters corners. Lang and Balboa meet in the middle of the ring, Lang again stares Balboa down, not taking eyes away. Before they separate, Lang tells Balboa \"I'm gonna bust you up\" to which Balboa responds \"Go for it\"Losing Heavyweight Championship  Just like the last fight Balboa comes right out of his corner and unleashes a flurry of jabs onto Lang, however, these didn't seem to deter Lang too much physically, but his temper built, and Lang begins throwing hooks wildly, but every hook Lang threw Balboa ducked or weaved out of the way. Lang threw around 15-20 punches in the first round with none of them connecting, while Balboa connected with all of his punches. Lang did not seem fazed by the punches physically. In the second round, Balboa started it just like the last round, hitting Lang with a few punches while once again ducking and weaving Lang\u2019s hooks. Lang finally gets a break when he pushes Balboa into the corner and brutally unleashes with hook after hook, busting Balboa open, Balboa finally gets out of the corner, but Lang still continues to punish him with hooks, knocking him to the ground. Balboa gets up before the 10 count and once again Lang unleashes more punches and knocks Balboa down again. Balboa is able to get up before the 10 count for the second time. Just before the round ends Balboa puts his gloves in front of his face and Lang punches Balboa's arms over and over, trying to break the defence. As the round ends Balboa says \"You ain\u2019t so bad, huh? You ain\u2019t so bad\" and puts his glove on Langs head and pushes him. In the third round, Balboa started to block Lang's extremely powerful blows and even started to taunt him as he did at the end of the second round, prompting Lang's temper to build, and prompting Lang to throw even more punches. However, due to Rocky's blocking techniques, Lang's extremely powerful punches weren\u2019t connecting fully and due to fatigue, weren\u2019t doing as much damage, eventually, Lang fatigued severely, being near incapable of landing his blows onto Rocky. Balboa then unleashed punch after punch mainly targeting Lang\u2019s body to gas him even more. Lang would then fall and was unable to get up before the count of 10, therefore suffering his first ever loss and losing his title to Balboa. At the end of the fight, Lang is seen rejecting medical attention for his bloody nose, followed by hanging his head in his lap, clearly disappointed in his loss.Events after Rocky III  The series has yet to specify what happened to Lang after his loss to Balboa. It is unknown if he retired or continued fighting.Personality and Traits  Clubber Lang was very belligerent and had a violent temper. He argues several times in the movie and loves to crash parties and ruin people's celebrations, as he did when the citizens of Philadelphia put up a statue of Rocky Balboa. While his fighting style suggests he is supposed to be like George Foreman, his personality and quest for respect after champions of grace like Apollo Creed and Rocky is similar to how Larry Holmes dealt with the press when he became champion after Muhammad Ali. He is also overconfident and wants people to know how great he thinks he is which is shown when he proclaimed to Mickey that he was unstoppable and that Rocky would never beat him and when he told his opponent that he would knock him out easily like the last time. This attitude eventually lead to Rocky's victory who used wits and techniques rather than hits. He is also shown to be a sore loser when he was defeated by Rocky, he was upset and crying.Boxing Style  Clubber Lang, the hard-hitting brawler, has a character which is much like his boxing style: direct, aggressive and brutal. His fighting style and record show a similarity to a young George Foreman and perhaps Mike Tyson (although it would be a few years after the film's debut that Tyson would become a renowned boxer). His quest for respect from pro boxing and the media is similar to Larry Holmes. Also, he is mentioned by a reporter that he is a southpaw like Rocky. However, there is a weakness in this fighting style, as Lang relied entirely on knockout punches, and never made serious effort to study combos or technique. This allows him to fatigue severely if he doesn't make quick work of his opponents, which Balboa exploited in their rematch, knocking out Lang fairly early, in just the third round.Professional Boxing Record  List of Clubber's fight during the series.Accomplishments  Heavyweight Champion (1 time, 1982 - 1982) (defeated Rocky Balboa, lost to Rocky Balboa)Quotes Trivia References  Rocky Balboa- Before the fightRocky Wiki Spider Rico  \"Hey, you really got lucky tonight\" \u2013 Spider Rico Spider Rico (played by Pedro Lovell) was a Puerto Rican boxer that, as a Philadelphia-area club fighter in the film Rocky, fought Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) at the time, which would set the timeline at around 1976. Spider is the first opponent of Rocky we see in the series. Spider made one attempt in pro boxing against unknown fighter Ken Thorton, Spider was able to pull off a majority decision win before his retirement. He is presented as a strong Christian character in the 2006 film Rocky Balboa, where he eats free at Rocky's restaurant \"Adrian's\", which he also works at as a dish washer to not be a free-loader. Rocky befriends and keeps him around out of the goodness of his heart.Appearances Rocky Wiki Adrian Balboa  Adrian Balboa (ne\u00e9 Adriana Pennino) was the spouse of Rocky Balboa and sister of Paulie Peninno who worked at the pet store near where Rocky lived in South Philadelphia in the first film Rocky; Rocky and Adrian would later marry in Rocky II where their son, Rocky Balboa, Jr., was born, the only child of the marriage. Between the events of Rocky V and Rocky Balboa, Adrian died on January 11, 2002, at the age of 51, from ovarian cancer, leaving her husband a widower.Biography Pet store meeting/Courting of Rocky Balboa  Adrian, worked at neighbourhood pet store in South Philadelphia, which Rocky, who lived nearby, would visit from time to time to buy food and pet supplies for his turtles. When Rocky told Paulie that he intended to go out on a date with the shy, bookish, and bespectacled Adrian, the overprotective Paulie in turn yelled at Adrian, who had been on very few dates beforehand, and had fearful apprehensions, to go out on the date with Rocky. When Adrian finally accepted Rocky's invitation, Rocky took her to the ice rink. When Rocky took Adrian to his house and kissed her for the first time, the two became an item. When Rocky started training for the match against Apollo Creed, Adrian gave Butkus to accompany him while he was training.Marriage  In Rocky II, Rocky proposed marriage to Adrian in the Philadelphia zoo. Shortly after their marriage, Rocky started to lavish things upon Adrian from the money he made from the fight with Apollo Creed. Rocky bought a new house and a few\u00a0weeks later Rocky found out that Adrian was pregnant; Due to money issues, Adrian suggested that she should work in the pet store part time while Rocky was training in the gym. When Paulie visited Adrian at the hospital upon her giving birth to Rocky, Jr., at the hospital Rocky and Paulie would find out from the doctors that there were complications. Adrian had slipped into a coma and the child was born one month premature. Rocky stood by Adrian's bed until she woke up from the coma. Adrian then told Rocky to \"Win!\" the rematch of the fight against Apollo. Adrian was watching the fight on the television and saw Rocky prevail against Apollo.Later Years  Adrian had became a source of stability for Rocky during their marriage. Despite her unhappiness with Rocky's boxing career, she convinced him to find the strength to continue his training for his rematch against Clubber Lang. When Rocky wanted to fight Ivan Drago, Adrian didn't support his decision at first, but decided to visit him in Russia, saying that she would be with him no matter what. After the fight with Drago, Rocky was diagnosed with irreversible brain damage, and the Balboa fortune was stolen by their lawyer (due to Paulie's inadvertently signing a Power of Attorney). Adrian told Rocky that she would stand by him, money or not. When Rocky had committed himself to training Tommy Gunn at the expense of Rocky Jr., Adrian reminded Rocky of his priorities, the elder Rocky would cease his near-neglect of his son and the Balboa's bond was repaired.Death  In 2002, she died of ovarian cancer. Rocky would thereby make regular visits to her gravesite, annually visit places that held importance to the two, and would continue to run the restaurant \"Adrian's\" in her name.Appearances Rocky Wiki Paulie Pennino  Paul \"Paulie\" Pennino is the tritagonist in the first film, and the deuteragonist in all the other Rocky films. He was Adrian's brother and a close friend of Rocky Balboa. In all the movies, he is played by actor Burt Young.Personality  He was the close friend/brother-in-law of Rocky Balboa, the older brother of the late Adrian Pennino (who became Balboa's wife), and the uncle of Rocky Balboa, Jr.. Pennino was also a hardcore alcoholic, had a cynical attitude, and usually gave out negative comments, much to the dislike of his brother-in-law. From 1980 to 2012, he lived with Rocky Balboa. Paulie is known for owning a robot in Rocky IV. Up until 2006, he worked as a Meat packer in Philadelphia. In 1976 he confronted a pregnant Adrian about what her lack of faith in Rocky was doing to her husband's career. In 1980, a drunk asked Rocky for an extra job to help the champ train. Before Rocky went to Russia, he accidentally signed a power of attorney to the family accountant who stole nearly all of the family's money, when the accountant duped Rocky and Adrian when the papers they signed that wasn't a tax extension, but a power of attorney to the accountant. Despite his alcoholism, drunken outbursts, jealously towards Rocky, and his generally-negative attitude, he has always been a dedicated friend to Rocky, staying at his side through success, loss, rough patches in their friendship, and trips throughout the world. Paulie has been known to be a boorish, drunken, jealous, angry, intolerant person. As Rocky would later call him as a \"Jealous, lazy bum.\" He has been known to be negative about everything in his life and lashing out on everybody he can. He also has a tendency to believe that friends owe him even if they already repaid him. Although despite all this he cares for his sister Adrian, and his friend/brother in law, Rocky. Although his sayings are negative and insulting, he has always known to have some truth in them. For example, when Tommy Gunn challenged Rocky to a fight, it was Paulie that pointed out that if it wasn't for Rocky that Gunn wouldn't be a contender. He was very loyal to Rocky and a good uncle to Robert. It is only after Tommy hits Paulie that Rocky is moved enough to fight him. Despite all the negative personality traits attributed to Paulie, it must be said that from the beginning of the films (and evident in the backstory) that Paulie is the single longest and most loyal relationship in Rocky's life. They were friends long before Mickey Goldmill came begging Rocky for a chance to manage him - once Rocky already had the championship fight set. It is Mickey who drives a reluctant Adrian to date Rocky, in response to Rocky's plea to Paulie after Adrian continues to reject his advances. It is Paulie who jumps into the ring to protect Rocky when he is being abused by wrestler, Thunderlips. Between rounds with the Russia, Ivan Drago, that he sees three of him, Paulie - drawing on his experience as an alcoholic - advises Rocky to \"hit the one in the middle.\" It is Paulie who knows Rocky well enough that, when he seems to be losing to Clubber Lang, that he is in fact not losing but \"getting mad\" - which only Paulie knows is the fuel he will need to defeat him. Every time Adrian cannot support Rocky's decisions to fight, it is Paulie who stays by Rocky's side; both in his second match with Apollo Creed - knowing his friend well enough to know that it is Adrian's disapproval that is keeping Rocky from giving his all to his preparation - and he confronts her about it, and in going to Russia with his brother-in-law when his sister refuses to do so). The friendship between Rocky and Paulie is one of the truest in film history. Despite Paulie's shortcomings, he is loyal to Rocky and Rocky is loyal to him as well. They are brutally honest with one another, and Paulie reveals his true admiration for Rocky on the way to the ring for the fight with Ivan Drago, in a moment that must be seen to be truly felt. While many blame Paulie for causing the problem with Adrian's pregnancy, the injury actually occurs before Paulie arrives when she picks up, moves, and the quickly drops the heavy load of pet feed in the pail. Had Paulie not gone there to set her straight about Rocky's mindset, she would have been alone when the trouble began. Paulie is also blamed, by his sister, for their financial downfall, but the truth is that neither she nor Rocky read the paperwork for themselves, and signed away the power of attorney. Paulie is correct when he tells them that the accountant is the thief, he was simply duped like they were. In the last film in which Paulie appears, Rocky Balboa, again it is only Paulie who is with Rocky at the cemetery to visit Adrian. They are best friends - and brothers (in law) to the end of Paulie's life. He knows Rocky better than anyone, at times even better than his wife. He knows what makes Rocky tick, and while he is often an opportunist and cynic, there is a reason why of all the people whom Rocky knows, he is the last man standing in his life, because he was there before anyone else.Biography  Paulie first appears in Rocky along with the rest of the recurring characters. As evidenced by a photo in the home he shares with Adrian, Paulie is a Navy veteran. When we first meet Paulie, he is employed as a butcher in a meat packing plant. Rocky has a crush on Paulie's sister, Adrian. Paulie brings Rocky home on Thanksgiving and insists that she goes out with him. When she refuses, using the holiday and the meal she has prepared as an excuse, Paulie goes so far as throwing away the Thanksgiving turkey away so that Adrian to force her to go out with Rocky. Paulie hates working in the cold packing plant and repeatedly asks Rocky for a hookup with is loan shark boss, Gazzo, for a job for him as a collector/enforcer, but Rocky politely denies him. After the first fight with Apollo Creed, Paulie is given the job as a collector for Gazzo. During one of Rocky's visits to the meat packing plant Rocky, angered by yet another of Paulie's angry outbursts about how it stinks in the meat plant and how he hates working in the cold, Rocky starts hitting a side of beef - eventually breaking the ribs. Paulie remarked that if Rocky does that to Apollo Creed that he would be hauled in for murder. He and Rocky have their first falling out on Christmas Eve, when Paulie alerts a news crew to Rocky's unique training regime - punching sides of beef. It was then Rocky and Adrian discuss Paulie behind his back, when Paulie comes in the house and in a drunken rage berates Rocky about how he did everything for him and that Rocky never gave him anything in return. Rocky's calm demeanour enrages Paulie all the more, and he grabs a baseball bat and starts breaking things, even threatening to break Rocky's arms so that he cannot fight. When he remarked that he even gave Rocky his sister, she snapped at him that she owed him anything because she has been taking care of him for years and all he has ever done was make her feel like a loser. Rocky restrains him while Adrian runs to her room crying. Paulie is left sobbing that he can't keep working in the packing plant. Working there is partly responsible for Paulie's drinking, which he does on the job to keep warm. While Rocky is training, Paulie reconciles with Rocky and asks whether or not it would be okay to make money using Rocky's name. Before the first fight with Apollo Creed, Paulie gives Rocky a robe with an advertisement for \"Shamrock Meats\" on the back. After the fight, Paulie causes a ruckus with security distracting them so Adrian could get to Rocky in the ring. After his passing, Paulie was buried beside Adrian. Three years later in 2015, Rocky visits their graves on Nov. 19 to commemorate Paulie's birthday, setting out a bottle of Four Roses bourbon for him, and a long-stemmed red rose for his love.Appearances Rocky Wiki Ivan Drago: Justice Enforcer  Ivan Drago: Justice Enforcer is an online game created by I-Mockery in which the player plays as Ivan Drago and fights crime throughout the streets of the United States. He begins at the Soviet Embassy and ends inside Mickey's gym. Drago there fights a cyborg of Apollo Creed and then Rocky Balboa, as in Rocky IV. After playing through the game as Drago, the player can unlock Apollo Creed and Herbert the Dinosaur as playable characters. Rocky Balboa's greased lightning game can also be unlocked.List of Characters Controls  Arrow keys\u2014move Ivan around A\u2014punch (hold to charge) S\u2014Block D\u2014Kneel/Duck A,S,D at the same time\u2014Super punchExternal Links Rocky Wiki Mason Dixon  Mason \u201cThe Line\u201d Dixon (born July 4, 1971) is an American former professional boxer who competed in the Heavyweight division during the 2000s. He reigned as the undisputed heavyweight champion (series is yet to specify the end of Dixon's reign). He is the main antagonist in Rocky Balboa (film) In 2006 Dixon had cleared out the entire heavyweight division accumulating a perfect record of 33-0 with 30 knockouts, despite his dominance Dixon was not accepted by the fans or media as a legitimate champion due to his poor competition. The heavyweight division was viewed as being at its worst ever due to Dixon defeating all opponents with ease, the lack of challengers had the media and fans questioning if Dixon was that good or if it was just because of the weak competition. Dixon had never been tested or pushed to his limits, many fans believed that if he was pushed that he would lose. During this time, ESPN aired a simulated fight between Rocky Balboa and Mason Dixon, both in their primes, Balboa won the simulated fight via knockout. Around the same time that the simulated fight aired, Balboa requested a boxing license, due to feeling that he had some frustrations locked away and that a few small, local fights would help him let those frustrations out. Dixon\u2019s manager frightened that nobody wanted to watch Dixon fight anymore due to the predictable outcomes proposed that Dixon fight Balboa in an exhibition, expressing that it will help with Dixon\u2019s image and make him millions. Reluctant at first, Dixon accepts. \u00a0 Dixon breaks his hand in the second round of the fight, but he fights through, taking all that Rocky has to offer and wins the fight by split decision after 10 rounds. Dixon earnt the respect of the media, fans and proved that he can battle through adversity. \u00a0Biography Early Life  We learn about Dixon's past when he revisits his old trainer Martin at his gym in Rocky Balboa (film). The gym seems to be in a small neighbourhood due to its condition and size, on top of that Martin lives there. Martin mentions that Dixon walked into the gym by himself at the age of 10, hinting at the fact that Dixon grew up fighting for himself and that he put many hours into that gym. It is also implied that Dixon had a rough upbringing and that Martin was always there for him, basically watching him grow up. Dixon has been fighting his whole life; eventually, his hard work paid off, and he turned pro, dominating the heavyweight division with a 33-0 record, 30 knockouts and becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion.Rocky Balboa Number One Boxer in the World  In 2006, Mason Dixon (25 years old) was at the height of his career at 33-0-0 with 30 KOs. He was a Tampa, Florida native who now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. Despite the initial promise of his career and the fame that came with being undisputed champion, over the years, with the decline of the Heavyweight division and boxing in general, he had failed to capture the fans of the sport due to a lack of worthwhile contenders. He had the media questioning \"is Mason Dixon that good? Or is his competition that bad?\" Dixon had yet to face a real challenge and people believed that if Dixon was tested, he would lose. This is most evident in his latest title defence before the Balboa fight, where after a quick knockout win, the spectators showered him with boos and even pelted him with ice. Dixon lived a lavish lifestyle; even his training facilities were high-tech, a stark contrast to his old Tampa gyms. Dixon acts as if all the comments from the media and fans don't get to him, shrugging them off when other people are around, but it's evident that the comments mean something to him when he tries to escape his entourage, retreating to his fleet of cars to watch videos of his latest match and listen to the comments from Jim Lampley. Upset that many feel him the product of an inferior division in a corrupt sport, he retreated to his old gym once more and confided in his former trainer Martin. It seems that Martin has played a pivotal role in Dixon's life, Martin mentions that Dixon walked into the gym at 10 years old, meaning that Martin has practically watched Dixon grow up. He then mentions that he has always known what's best for Dixon, finally mentioning that soon enough, he will be tested by a formidable opponent, and his history can be written in that moment.ESPN Simulated fight against Rocky Balboa  Meanwhile, ESPN broadcasted \"Then and Now\", a segment pitting the best athletes of the past against the best of the present, and Dixon was matched up against Rocky Balboa, the former two-time champion whose fame has also faded after retirement with the decline of boxing. The simulation ended in an 11th round knockout victory of Balboa over Dixon, with fans and media already disliking Dixon, they ran with this simulation and supported the Balboa victory. Dixon's promoters went public with a strong denouncement of the simulation, going as far as to insult Balboa for owning a small successful Philadelphia restaurant. Rocky Balboa with the intention of fighting a few small local fights re-applied for his boxing licensed and got it renewed since he passed his physical, Balboa passing made it onto the front page of the paper, alerting Dixon's managers. Dixon initially scoffs at the idea of fighting a 59-year-old Rocky Balboa, claiming he would beat Balboa \"with his arms tied behind his back'' but his managers remind him that the last two PPV's were in the toilet and that there are no worthy challengers out there, meaning that nobody will pay to watch Dixon fight, they urge Dixon to capitalise on the computer fight, capitalise on nostalgia, telling him that he would make an easy 20 million from the fight, and have the chance to reinvent his image. Dixon's managers journey down to Philadelphia to try and talk Rocky into an exhibition match, they mention that a portion of the fight will be donated to charity and that Balboa wouldn't be brutalised because it will be an exhibition, like a glorified sparring session.Challenging Rocky Balboa  The fight was marketed as \"Will (Balboa) vs. Skill (Dixon)\". The press conference took place at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, Dixon's manager opened the conference by stating the fight was Mason Dixon's idea, calling it the \"brainchild'' of Mason Dixon as he hopes to honour past heavyweight champions, warriors like Rocky Balboa. Dixon seemed relaxed and chilled out, he was asked what would happen if he lost, in which he responded with a laugh and said ''You know that'll never happen'' Dixon lost his cool when a reporter questioned that Dixon's legacy and popularity were in doubt, causing Dixon to stand up, and take stance at the podium. He mentions that he is ''33-0, with 30 knockouts, what else do I have to do?\" Dixon then goes on to say that he is having this exhibition for the fans and they still want to make a mockery out of him? Balboa and Dixon speak off the record at the weigh-ins, Dixon tells Balboa that he will do his best to carry him through the fight and that he won't get embarrassed, but if Balboa tries to press him, hurt him or hit him low, he will ''Get [Balboa] outta there'' meaning he will quickly KO him. Balboa tells him that he came to win, Dixon fires back by telling him it's already over, prompting Balboa to say it ain't over till it's over. Balboa then asks Dixon if he gets scared to which Dixon replied ''I don't get scared.\"Dixon vs. Balboa  On the night of the fight, many were predicting a 1st, 2nd or 3rd round TKO victory for Mason Dixon, with the commentators calling it an ''execution'' before the fight began. The fight went exactly as experts predicted in the fight two rounds, Balboa was far too slow for the ultra-fast Dixon, Balboa was throwing hooks that weren't landing anywhere near Dixon, meanwhile, Dixon used his distance to slowly pick apart Balboa with his jab! Balboa landed a quick 1-2 towards the end of the first that shocked Dixon, causing him to push Balboa back and unload with strikes, knocking Balboa all the way back to the corner and unloading in the final 10 seconds of the round, this calls back to when Dixon told Balboa that if he pressed him, he will get him out of there. The stats for the first round had Balboa land 9 out of 13 punches compared to Dixon's 59 out of 69! Dixon's cornerman Martin told Dixon that Balboa came to battle and that Dixon needs to show Balboa some respect! Dixon replies with ''What about my respect?'' pushing past Martin as the second round begins, clearly wanting to end the fight. Dixon opens the second round with the same game plan, using his range and distance to keep Balboa at bay with jabs, but Dixon is clearly more agitated this round and is firing off a lot more quick jabs, hoping to end the fight. Dixon lands a right hook, dropping Balboa for a five count. Dixon immediately rushes Balboa, landing combinations to the gut and head, dropping Balboa for a second time with a left and right hook combo. The commentators, audience, and Dixon are all adamant that the fight is over, but Balboa is able to get up at the count of nine! Dixon argues with the referee to stop the fight, but as he does this Balboa catches him with a right hook, followed up with a left and right hook combo, pushing Dixon into the ropes! Dixon fights back and lands another combo, but breaks his right hand after a shot to Balboa's ribs! Dixon in clear pain backs away, but Balboa rushes him, unloading with shots to the ribs and head! Finally, Balboa traps Dixon in the corner and pummels him with shots to the ribs, causing Dixon to drop! Dixon is able to get back up at eight and the two fighters trade strikes until the end of the round. Dixon fought the next three-four rounds with one hand, unable to throw his right hand. Due to this, Balboa won the third and fourth rounds by trapping Dixon in the corners and unloading with rights and lefts to the body and head! Balboa was able to close the range and distance easier as well because Dixon couldn't throw his right jab, the jab that kept Balboa at bay. Balboa's speed was a huge negative earlier in the fight, but now he didn't need to worry as much because he was able to get in close and catch Dixon because Dixon couldn't defend himself with that jab. In the 5th round, Dixon was able to fight back slightly, his right hand was beginning to numb up and he was slowly starting to use it again. Dixon used his evasive skills to dodge Balboa and pick him apart to win the round. The 6th round was evidence that Dixon's right hand was not fully numbed yet as Balboa was able to again close the distance and trap Dixon in the corner, unloading with rights and lefts to the body! Finally, Dixon's hand was fully numbed in the seventh round and this was evident as Dixon began picking Balboa apart with right and left combos from a distance, just like he was in the first and second rounds! Dixon almost knocked down Balboa, landing a combo that caused Balboa to stumble into the ropes, almost falling, but quickly grabbing onto the ropes and keeping himself up! Round 8 was more of the same with Dixon brutalising Balboa with some heavy right and left hooks, but as demonstrated throughout his entire career, Rocky has an iron jaw and was able to sustain all the punches. Round 9 reminded the world of how tough Rocky Balboa is, it reminded the world of the underdog, and how Balboa always digs down deep! Balboa dug down deep and really took it to Dixon in this round, landing some heavy punches and winning the round.  Heading into the tenth and final round, Dixon had won five rounds, presumably the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 8th. Balboa had won four, presumably the 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 9th! At the beginning of the final round, Dixon chuckled as he called Balboa \"one crazy old man'' Balboa responded by saying \"you'll get there'' Balboa and Dixon mostly traded strikes for the final round, but Dixon was able to drop Balboa down to one knee at one stage with a heavy hook! Balboa was able to get back up and they continued to trade punches until the end of the round. At the end of the fight, Balboa and Dixon hugged, with Balboa calling Dixon a great champion, telling him that he has heart, and thanking him for the opportunity! The fight goes to the judge's scorecards, Michael Buffer announcing that it is a split decision, Dixon seems annoyed and shocked by this, Buffer begins reading out the scores, 95-94 Dixon, 95-94 Balboa, and 95-94 Dixon, giving Mason Dixon the split decision victory. It seems Dixon proved that he can battle when he is faced with adversity.Events After Rocky Balboa  After Dixon's fight with Rocky in 2006, he earned the respect he deserved as champ, proving that he can go the distance. However, the series is yet to specify what happened to Dixon afterwards.Personality and Traits  Dixon lives a lavish lifestyle, he has a big house, fancy cars, and is always followed around by his huge entourage! In connection to those things, he seems to flash his wealth around similarly to real-life boxer Floyd ''Money'' Mayweather''. Dixon's flashy knocks out mixed with how he acts indifferent about the victories, shrugging them off like nothing, and not respecting his opponents is similar to Mike Tyson early in his career. Overall Dixon shows little respect to his opponents due to his belief that he is that much better, making him an arrogant, cocky fighter; but in the end, he shows great respect towards Rocky after the latter thanked him for the opportunity.Boxing Style  Dixon's boxing style is reliant on speed! He is ultra-quick and uses his speed to slice and dice opponents, evading their strikes and cutting them down with combos. He also uses his reach advantage to keep opponents at bay, popping them with countless jabs and awaiting the opening to strike with a hook. Dixon has a smooth slashing offence that is very difficult to counter.Accomplishments  Undisputed/Lineal Heavyweight Champion (Early 00s - Early 10s) (defeated an unnamed opponent, lost to an unnamed opponent or vacated)Quotes  ''I'm the champ, I mean I get pissed this guy gets hurt.\" - Mason Dixon to Rocky Balboa [Before final round] ''You one crazy old man\" - Mason Dixon to Rocky Balboa ''But you know that ain't never gunna happen, there ain't anybody out there Martin.\" - Mason Dixon to Martin \"Ay man don't talk to me like I'm stupid'' - Mason Dixon to his Manager \"I'm doing you people a favour, I'm doing this exhibition for you all, and you gonna get up here and make a mockery outta me?\" - Mason Dixon to the PressTrivia Rocky Wiki Boxers  Boxers from the Rocky series.Rocky Wiki Characters  Characters.Rocky Wiki Rocky Balboa, Jr.  Robert Balboa, Jr. is the son of Rocky Balboa and Adrian Pennino.Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky III & Rocky IV. Birth  Robert Balboa, Jr. was born on November 5, 1976 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His birth was one month premature. This was due to Adrian slipping into a coma brought on by stress from overworking during the pregnancy.Growing Up  Robert grew up in a wealthy family. He was raised in the Balboa mansion with his father Rocky, his mother Adrian, and his uncle, Paulie At school, he was an honour roll student and had many friends; he and Rocky even made friends with former champion Apollo Creed. This was a sharp contrast to his father's own childhood. His parents raised him to believe that using his mind, and not fighting, was the best way to solve his problems. When the Balboas lost their fortune and had to file for bankruptcy, Robert was especially devastated. In 1986, the family was forced to relocate back to Rocky's old South Philadelphia neighbourhood, where Robert would have to attend the same inner city school his father did.Life back in Philly (Rocky V)  Young Rocky, Jr. was completely out of his element in the new surroundings. He kept to himself and had difficulty making friends. He didn't grow up on the tough Philly streets like his father, and was afraid of how he would or wouldn't fit in. Rocky himself was concerned about his son, fearing that some of the kids might start bullying him just because he's the son of Rocky Balboa. Robert eventually befriended a female classmate named Jewel, but he also ran into trouble with two bullies. When it was apparent that his father expected him to handle the problem by himself, Robert asked his uncle Paulie to help him learn to fight. He also becomes very good at boxing, and when the bully comes to him to force him for more money, Robert took off his backpack and got ready to fight, which he ended up winning after a brief battle. He also became a tough boy, and a street-smart kid and he has now became a very tough kid. Adding to his frustration was the fact that Rocky took a young fighter named Tommy Gunn into their home. Young Rocky, Jr. began to feel that Rocky was paying more attention to Tommy than to him. Even when Robert told his father how he confronted his tormentors and was victorious, Rocky seemed more interested in training his protege. Becoming increasingly angry with his father, Robert found comfort with his friends (which included the two boys who once tormented him). He even began to act like they did, smoking, staying out late and hanging out on street corners. One night, a heated confrontation made Rocky see how he was treating his son. Right there he promised to make things right between them again.Life as an adult (Rocky Balboa and Creed)  By late 2005/early 2006 although Robert, by this time an adult, and at age 29, a successful accountant in a big finance firm, was dealing much better than Rocky with the death of Adrian he is still upset and is sick of living in the shadow of his famous father. Robert is convinced that the only reason he has the job and the friends that he did have was due to being the son of the famous Rocky Balboa. Robert did not want Rocky to get back in the ring; however he put that all aside when he realised his father was serious about fighting again, and with a change of heart, becomes one of Rocky's biggest supporters in his comeback attempt. We later learn in Creed that he no longer lives in Philly. Adonis Johnson Creed asks Rocky about his son. Rocky explains that he moved to Vancouver with his girlfriend and got a good job there. Rocky says that he moved because he was tired of being remembered as just Rocky Balboa's son, that was just a rumour. He faced this problem in \"Rocky Balboa\". Eventually, Rocky visited Robert in Vancouver and learned that he married his girlfriend and have a son named Logan.Mistake  In Rocky V, a mistake is made is the age of Robert. The fifth film seems to take place directly after the fourth instalment where Robert was 9 years old. However, when Rocky returns to America, his son is suddenly a teenager at the age of 14.Appearances Rocky Wiki Ludmilla Drago  Ludmilla Vobet Drago is the wife of Ivan Drago and a member of the Soviet Union. She serves as the secondary antagonist of Rocky IV. She was the double-gold medalist in swimming. Six months before Ivan Drago actually fought Rocky Balboa, Ludmilla and Ivan were very poor. Tall, blonde and statuesque in stature, Ludmilla shaved her head to make profit, and so did Ivan in return. It is shown in the beginning that she is extremely arrogantly self-confident and has somewhat of a sadistic, cruel streak about her. Two examples being that she was shown smiling while Drago beats Apollo Creed to death and when Rocky challenges Drago; she insisted that it would be held in Moscow whilst criticizing America. In the end though, Ludmilla actually expresses concern over Drago's well being almost as equal to Adrian's concern over Rocky. Following Drago's defeat by Rocky, Ludmilla is last seen dismayed over her husband's humiliating defeat. The part of Ludmilla was played by actress/centerfold TV personality Brigitte Nielsen, a former wife of Sylvester Stallone. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, she gave birth to her son, Viktor Drago.Appearances Rocky Wiki Mickey Goldmill  Michael \"Mickey\" Goldmill is the deuteragonist in Rocky, but a tritagonist in Rocky II, Rocky III and Rocky V, the last in new flashbacks. He also appears in Rocky Balboa in only one flashback. He was Rocky Balboa's trainer from 1976 until his death 1981.Biography  Michael \"Mickey\" Goldmill was the owner of Mighty Mick's Boxing and head Trainer of Rocky Balboa for most of Balboa's career. Goldmill is most likely based on legendary boxing trainer Cus D'amato.Early life  Mickey Goldmill was born on April 7, 1905 to a Jewish family. He boxed professionally from 1922 until 1943, but never gained any measure of fame. Goldmill recalled that he once knocked an opponent out of the ring the same day that Luis Firpo did the same to Jack Dempsey: September 14, 1923. Goldmill claimed that the reason his feat didn't garner any media attention was that he didn't have a manager while Dempsey did. He retired in 1943. Mickey's only professional loss was to Abe Goldstein. Professional Record:  23 Wins, (17 K.O.'s), 1 Loss Some time after his retirement, he opened a boxing gym in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mighty Mick's Boxing, and began to train fighters.Rocky Balboa  Micky continued to manage his gym. One of the regulars in his gym was Rocky Balboa, a local club fighter who had never realized his potential. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed gave Balboa an unlikely shot at the title, Goldmill approaches him about being his manager. Based on their uneasy prior relationship, Balboa was initially resistant but ultimately agreed to let Goldmill train him. While Balboa lost the fight to Creed, he managed to last the full fifteen rounds, a first for any of Creed's opponents.Rematch  Creed soon challenged Balboa for a rematch in the hospital, although Rocky did not agree or disagree initially, Mickey angrily stated that there would be no rematch and that Rocky was the rightful winner of their fight. Eventually, after Creed's efforts at publicly embarrassing Balboa into a fight, Mickey began traning Balboa for the rematch. For the second fight with Creed, Goldmill utilised unique training methods to help Balboa gain speed. He also converted Balboa from a left-handed fighting style to a right-handed style in an effort to both confuse Creed and to protect an eye Balboa had badly injured in the first fight. The rematch went off to a roaring start, with Creed determined to drop Rocky within two rounds to prove the first fight was a fluke. Using Mickey's tactics and training, Balboa held his stamina well into the later rounds, when both fighters tuckered out. After exhaustion, a simultaneous punch knocked both men to the ground, which almost ended in a double KO draw (in which Creed would have retained his championship), however Rocky managed to stand up and be firmly on his feet by the count of 8, to which he was declared to have defeated Apollo Creed by knockout and become the new heavyweight champion. Mickey beamed with pride seeing what the countless hours of training had earned his student, as well as never personally\u00a0and professionally giving up in the face of the defeat and obscurity.Another opponent  Goldmill trained Balboa to a series of successful title defences after the fight with Creed before both men decided it was time for them to retire. Notable defences of Rocky's were against Big Yank Ball at a US Army base, a gala fight at Ceasar's Palace in Las Vegas, as well as a fight against the heavyweight champion of France. Mickey was struggling health-wise, but hid this from the Balboas. Mickey's active lifestyle also helped give off the public impression he was in fine shape. Only when he was agitated or extremely nervous would his true state show, such as when a charity exhibition with Thunderlips grew rowdy and Rocky was tossed around like a rag doll. Mickey briefly clutched his chest when faced with such excitement. Controversial challenger Clubber Lang accused the two of avoiding him. Finally, Balboa agreed to face Lang in a fight which he figured would be his last title defence, partially on the basis of Clubber's public daylight obnoxiousness and suggestiveness towards his wife. Goldmill told Rocky that he would have to fight Lang alone if he agreed, later admitting that all of his challengers were hand-picked \"good fighters, but not killers\". Balboa was able to convince Goldmill to train him anyway, with the promise that this would be their last fight. In the time leading up to this fight, Mickey wanted to train Rocky the way he in preparation for facing Apollo Creed, back at his old squalid gymnasium. He was aghast that Rocky rented a hotel with crowds of people about and plenty of gaudiness, which Mickey compared to a circus. The match-up was set for August 15, 1981. Shortly before the fight Balboa's and Lang's entourages got into a scuffle and Goldmill was knocked to the ground. He returned to the locker room and when it became apparent that something was wrong, Balboa attempted to call off the fight. Goldmill, however, would have none of it and ordered Balboa to go ahead with the bout. Balboa lost the fight in a second-round knockout.Death  During a melee before the fight with Balboa against Clubber Lang (Mr.T), Clubber pushed Mickey to a wall causing him to have a heart attack. He was rushed to the locker room where Adrian proceeded to take care of him. Soon after the fight Rocky reunites with Mickey for one last time for he could barely talk, his last words were, \"I love you, kid. I love you.\" before Goldmill finally succumbed to a heart attack. Despite being 82, his tombstone claims he is 76.Legacy  After his death, Rocky recalled his former mentor in flashbacks during the events of some of his later matches.Behind the Scenes  In Ivan Drago: Justice Enforcer, Mickey appears as a ghost.Appearances Rocky Wiki Union Cane  Union Cane (born June 14, 1962) is a retired heavyweight boxer and former heavyweight champion. In 1985 (Rocky V), Cane was the top contender and next in line for a shot at Rocky Balboa's heavyweight championship, but upon arriving home from Russia and discovering that he had serious brain injuries, Balboa was forced to vacate his heavyweight championship. A fight was made by George Washington Duke between Cane and an unnamed contender for the vacant heavyweight championship, Cane won the bout by KO. Cane was considered to be a paper champion by the public as he never defeated Rocky to win the title. George Washington Duke tried several times to make a fight between Cane and Balboa, but Balboa denied several times. Eventually, Cane defended his championship against Balboa's pupil Tommy Gunn, Gunn won by KO in the first round.Biography Early Life  There isn't much information surrounding the early life of Union Cane, but it is known that Cane's rise up the rankings of the heavyweight division was very fast. In 1985, the boxing world was focused on two major events, Apollo Creed vs. Ivan Drago and Rocky Balboa vs. Ivan Drago. During this time, according to Rocky (2002 video game), Union Cane worked his way up the rankings and by the end of 1985 was recognised as America's Hottest Fighter while Balboa was in Russia! Along the way, Cane linked up with George Washington Duke, the boxing world's number one promoter! At this time, Cane would have been recognised as one of the biggest names in boxing, if not the biggest!Rocky V Pursuing Rocky Balboa  On December 25th, 1985 Rocky Balboa defeated Ivan Drago by KO and shortly after returned to the United States. Upon returning, Balboa held a press conference, speaking about the fight and his future. During the conference, George Washing Duke with Union Cane at his side interrupted and challenged Balboa to a boxing match! Duke made the challenge for Cane, informing Balboa that Cane is the number one contender to the title and that he wants a shot! Cane only had a few words saying ''Balboa I want the chance to take what you got!'' and \"The whipping you got ain't nothing like what I got here for ya\". Duke assured the media that the paycheck will be the most any champion has ever received, announcing that the fight would take place in Tokyo, Japan! Balboa's wife Adrian interrupted and informed the media that Balboa would not take the fight because he is retired, Balboa didn't confirm these claims, instead speaking about the flight and then leaving the press conference without answering the challenge or confirming his retirement. Balboa would lose his house and all of his money after some shady business from his accountant. At this time, Balboa considered the idea of facing Union Cane, but sore a doctor and discovered that he had serious brain injuries, forcing him to officially retire. Duke tried again to challenge Balboa for Cane, tracking him down on the streets of Philadephia and telling him that Cane is going for the vacated title on the 14th, offering Balboa tickets to the event. Duke then requests that Balboa reconsider a fight against Cane for ''one hell of a payday'' Balboa denied, telling Duke that he is officially retired. Duke would then pull out Balboa's medical report and tell him that there is a way they can get around it and get him licensed to fight. Balboa considers it for a moment before Adrian, who was working at the pet store across the street, runs over, and tells Duke to leave her husband alone. Duke ignores Adrian and issues the challenge to Balboa one last time, prompting Adrian to yell ''He's DONE!\" Duke calls Balboa a fool.Becoming Heavyweight Champion  Cane is seen in the limousine with Duke and his associate. Duke is frustrated, but ensures that he will get Balboa! Cane speaks up and says \"I'll fight Balboa right now! I'm better than Balboa ever was\" Duke snaps at this, telling Cane that he holds the paper on him and that he will fight who he tells him, where he tells, and when he tells him. Duke's associate tells Cane not to bite the hand that feeds him causing Cane to fall in line and sit back. Duke says that he will get Balboa, all he needs is an angle. Cane challenged successfully for the Heavyweight Championship on the 14th, defeating an unnamed opponent for the vacant title.Cane vs. Gunn  Cane held onto the title until 1990 when he was challenged by Tommy \"The Machine\" Gunn, Gunn was taken under Rocky Balboa's wing, Balboa trained and managed Gunn until George Washington Duke stepped in, clouding Gunn's mind with the things Balboa couldn't give him, a title match and more money. Gunn knocked Union Cane out in the first round to win the Heavyweight Championship.Events After Rocky V  Cane's future following the events of Rocky V has not been revealed and it is unknown if Cane reclaimed the Heavyweight Championship or if he had a rematch with Tommy Gunn.Personality and Traits  Cane doesn't speak a lot, but when he does, it is usually to trash talk his opponent. Cane seems to be a young, brash, cocky star! He is one of the hottest names in boxing, has beaten many opponents to get to the top, and has won the title. He has all the reason to tell the world he is the best. Cane doesn't seem to have any fear of competition either, claiming that he will fight Rocky Balboa ''anytime'' and that he is ''better than Balboa ever was'' Cane is also very competitive and focused according to Rocky (2002 Video Game) Stating that he is always \"extremely fit\", and one who \"takes all his opponents seriously, studying their boxing style before each fight\" Balboa takes note of this before his fight with Gunn, noticing Cane and mentioning that he looks to be in great shape!Boxing Style  Union Cane is only seen in one fight but based on the description in Rocky (2002 Video Game), Cane is described as a gifted boxer with speed and power; a good all-rounder. He's also described as being \"sharp as a razor.''Accomplishments  Heavyweight Champion (1 time, 1986/87 - 1990) (defeated unnamed opponent, lost to Tommy Gunn)Quotes  ''Balboa I want the chance to take what you got!'' - Union Cane to Rocky Balboa \"The whipping you got ain't nothing like what I got here for ya\" - Union Cane to Rocky Balboa \"I'll fight Balboa right now!

The film, which was also written by Stallone who plays underdog boxer: Rocky Balboa, is the sixth film in the Rocky series that began with the Academy Award-winning Rocky thirty years earlier in 1976. The film portrays Balboa in retirement, a widower living in Philadelphia, and the owner and operator of a local Italian restaurant called \"Adrian's\", named after his late wife. Rocky Balboa was produced as another sequel to the Academy Award-winning Rocky. According to Stallone, he was \"negligent\" in the production of Rocky V leaving him and many of the fans disappointed with the presumed end of the series. Stallone also mentioned that the storyline of Rocky Balboa parallels his own struggles and triumphs in recent times. In addition to Stallone, the film stars Burt Young as Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law, and real-life boxer Antonio Tarver as Mason \"The Line\" Dixon, the current World Heavyweight Champion in the film. Boxing promoter Lou DiBella plays himself in the movie and acts as Dixon's promoter in the film. Milo Ventimiglia plays Rocky's son Robert, now an adult. It also features the return of two minor characters from the original movie into larger roles in this film: Marie, the young woman that Rocky attempts to steer away from trouble; and Spider Rico, the first opponent that Rocky is shown fighting in the original film. The film also holds many references to people and objects from previous instalments in the series, especially the first.Plot  Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), in his late fifties and retired from boxing for sixteen years, lives a quiet life as a widower; his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) had died from cancer in 2002. He runs a small but very successful Italian restaurant named after her, where he regales his patrons with stories of his past. He also battles personal demons involving his grief over Adrian's death, the changing times, and his eroding relationship with his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), a struggling corporate employee. Paulie (Burt Young), Rocky's brother-in-law and longtime friend, continues to support him whenever he can. Late one night, Rocky reunites with a much older \"Little\" Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a once mischievous neighbourhood girl (whom he first met in Rocky) now working as a bartender at the Lucky Seven, a tavern Rocky once frequented in the mid-70s, and a single parent of a teenaged son born out of wedlock: Stephenson, nicknamed \"Steps\" (James Francis Kelly III). Rocky's friendship with the two quickly blossoms over the following weeks, and Steps takes to him as a father figure. A budding romantic relationship between Rocky and Marie was implied, but never fully explored by Rocky out of his reverence for Adrian. Meanwhile on the professional boxing circuit, the newly crowned world heavyweight champion, Mason \"The Line\" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), reigns undefeated, but he is ridiculed for having never gone up against a real contender. This frustrates the champ, causing tension with the public and his promoters, and encouraging him to return to his roots - the small gym he first trained in, as well as his old trainer who sagely tells him that he will inevitably earn back his respect (and more importantly, his self-respect) through fighting a true opponent. ESPN broadcasts a computer simulation of a fight between Rocky (in his prime) and Mason, likened to a modern-day version of The Super Fight that ends in a controversial KO victory for Balboa, further riling the champ. In contrast, the simulation inspires Rocky to take up boxing again \u2014 an intention that goes public when he successfully renews his license. Dixon's promoters pitch the idea of holding a charity exhibition bout at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas to bolster Dixon's falling popularity. With some hesitation, both men agree to the match, creating a media buzz that stabs at Rocky's has-been status and Dixon's credibility. Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice; that to succeed in life, \"it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward\", and that blaming others won't help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky's side. Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed's old trainer Duke (Tony Burton) who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible. The fight ends up becoming an HBO Pay-per-View event with Michael Buffer as the ring announcer. The bout itself is a back and forth affair, with Dixon easily dominating the first round only to injure his left hand in the second on Rocky's hip, after which Rocky makes a dramatic comeback: he manages to knock Dixon down once, then continues to surprise the audience with his prowess and chin against the much younger and faster fighter. Dixon sends Rocky to one knee in the final round, but the elder fighter pulls himself to his feet for one last assault. The two opponents then continue to punish each other severely throughout the remainder of the final round, ending with both men still standing. Rocky thanks an appreciative Dixon for the fight, and leaves the ring to the adulation of the crowd as the result is announced: Rocky losing by split decision. In the closing shot, Rocky returns home and visits Adrian's grave again to thank her for helping him, saying: \"Yo Adrian, we did it\". Adrian's tombstone is still at Laurel Hill Cemetery in the East Falls section of Philadelphia, just to the southeast of the main entrance.Cast Video game  On December 13, 2006, it was officially announced by Ubisoft and MGM that a new Rocky video game, titled Rocky Balboa, was to be made exclusively for the PlayStation Portable handheld console. It was released on March 20, 2007, to coincide with the Blu-ray and DVD release. It received mostly negative reviews.External links  Template:WikiquoteRocky Wiki George Washington Duke  George Washington Duke\u00a0(born January 15, 1943) is a retired boxing promoter and boxing manager, who, by 1990, had at least 20 years of promoting some of the biggest fights in history. However, he never could get Rocky Balboa to fight any of his fighters. He was always accompanied by a beautiful, statuesque, buxom redhead assistant named Karen and his business partner Merlin Sheets. In 1985 (Rocky V), Duke attempted to sign Rocky Balboa for the biggest paycheck a boxing champion had ever received, Duke was planning a fight between young challenger Union Cane against Balboa, taking place in Tokyo, Japan. Upon arriving home, Balboa discovered that he had suffered brain damage following his fight against Ivan Drago and subsequently retired immediately, vacating his championship. Duke still continued to pursue Balboa even going as far to dig up Balboa's medical record and ensure him that with their help, he will be licenced in any country in the world. Along with his wife Adrian's advice, Balboa declines the offer. Duke backed off for a while until he sore a young fighter that Balboa had been training, making his way up the rankings. Duke realised that he could intervene in the relationship that Tommy Gunn and Balboa had, hoping to make a fight between them. Eventually, Duke discovered that there were no official papers between Balboa and Gunn, he swopped in and offered Gunn more money, a title fight, and an escape from Balboa's shadow. Gunn accepted and turned sour towards Balboa. Gunn went on to defeat Union Cane to become Heavyweight Champion, but the media disregarded him as a paper champion and Rocky's Robot. Duke then goaded Gunn into finding and challenging Balboa to a boxing match, but his plan went sideways when Gunn punched Balboa's brother-in-law, Paulie, prompting Balboa to challenge Gunn to a fight then and there in the street. Balboa knocked Gunn out and then proceed to punch Duke.Biography Early Life  There isn't much information surrounding Duke's early life, it is assumed that he worked his way up using his charisma and manipulative skills to become the number one promoter in boxing.Rocky V Attempting to bring Rocky Balboa out of retirement  In 1985, Rocky returned home from Russia, after his match against Ivan Drago; with both Mickey Goldmill and Apollo Creed now deceased, Rocky was now with no management whatsoever, and Duke saw this as an opportunity to get Rocky to participate in a fight he would promote. Duke crashed Balboa's press conference along with his business partner Merlin Sheets and young heavyweight number one contender, Union Cane. Duke promised Balboa that this fight would be the biggest payday of any boxing champion ever, informing the media that it would be an international extravaganza, taking place in Tokyo, Japan. Balboa's wife, Adrian interrupted and informed the media that her husband is retired and would not accept the fight. Balboa didn't confirm these claims, instead commenting on the flight over from Russia and then leaving the press conference. In the coming weeks, Balboa would lose all of his assets due to some shady business from his accountant and be forced to move back to the slums of Philadelphia. During this time, Balboa considered fighting Cane, but visited a doctor first and discovered that he had brain damage as a result of the Drago fight and officially retired.Taking Union Cane to the Heavyweight Championship  In reply to Rocky's retirement and thus, refusal of taking part of this promoted fight, Duke began hounding the Balboa family in hope to pull Rocky into fighting again, even despite Rocky's medical situation that prevented him from even getting licensed to fight. Duke tracked Balboa down on the streets of Philadelphia and began to take advantage out of Rocky's recent bankruptcy by telling him that he could get all his money back from just one more fight, Duke then presented Balboa with a copy of his medical record, informing Balboa that with their help he could get licensed in any country in the world. Balboa considered the proposal for a moment before his wife Adrian intercepted again and informed Duke that her husband was retired and would not fight again. Balboa sided with his wife and declined the offer. Duke would then promote a fight between Union Cane and an unnamed fighter for the vacant Heavyweight Championship, Cane would go on to win the fight.Taking Tommy Gunn to the Heavyweight Championship  Soon after Rocky re-opened Mickey's former gym, a man named Tommy Gunn approached him and eventually convinced him to be his manager. However, no formal papers were signed between the two, and as soon as Gunn climbed quickly in boxing fame, and nearing a shot at the title, Duke saw such a lack of papers as an opening, and convinced Tommy to let him be his manager and promoter, promising him more money, a title fight, and an escape from Balboa's shadow. Duke then promoted a fight between Gunn and Cane for the Heavyweight Championship with Gunn winning the fight. After Tommy Gunn became champion, he was ridiculed by the media, who said he was no real champion and that he should fight some real contenders and earn his belt, also continuing to say that he was in Balboa's shadow. Duke attempted to use Tommy's frustration towards being in Rocky's shadow, and him being the champion so belittled, to convince him to pull Rocky in the ring with him so he could earn his respect by beating him, but this greatly backfired when he, Tommy, and a little camera crew went to find and hound Balboa in town that night. After Tommy and Rocky's conversation became heated, they engaged in a street fight, despite Duke's attempts to prevent it from happening anywhere outside the ring. After Rocky defeats Tommy, Rocky approached Duke, who threatened to sue him if he touched him. Rocky, despite this, knocked him down with an uppercut, nonchalantly replying, \"Sue me for what?\", since Rocky was broke.Events After Rocky V  The series is yet to specify what happened to Duke following the street fight, it is unknown if he continued to promote fights or if he retired.Personality and Traits  Duke's character is based off real-life boxing promoter Don King. He is a very charismatic, wisecracking, and manipulative person. Duke does whatever it takes in order to get what he wants, even going as far to suggest that despite Balboa's medical record, he could still use his influence to get Balboa a boxing license anywhere in the world. Duke is also very arrogant and selfish, seemingly only caring for his own interests and nobody else's Duke seems to have a lot of influence on fighters, but barely any loyalty, an example of this is when he takes Union Cane to the title, but then seemingly dumps him for the \"hotter\" fighter, Tommy Gunn.Quotes Trivia  He is based on real-life boxing promoter Don King and portrayed by Richard Gant. He is the second character in the series to be called \"Duke\", the other being Tony \"Duke\" Evers, a character who was once Apollo Creed's trainer and later Rocky Balboa's. This has led to some confusion, since Tommy Morrison (Tommy Gunn's actor) was nicknamed \"The Duke\".\u00a0Rocky Wiki Rocky (series)  The Rocky series consists of eight movies.Rocky Wiki Rocky (video game)  Rocky is a video game of the fighting game genre released in 2002 by Rage Software.

Avildsen. It tells the rags-to-riches American Dream story of Rocky Balboa, an uneducated but good-hearted debt collector for a loan shark in Philadelphia. Balboa is also an amateur boxer who gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship when the scheduled contender breaks his hand. Also starring in Rocky are Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Adrian's brother Paulie, Burgess Meredith as Mickey Goldmill, Rocky's trainer and Carl Weathers as the champion, Apollo Creed. The film, made for only US$1.2 million, and shot relatively fast in 28 days, was a sleeper hit; it made over US$117.2 million, won three Oscars, including Best Picture, and garnered mostly positive reviews which helped to launch Stallone's career. The film spawned five sequels: Rocky II, III, IV, V, Rocky Balboa and a spinoff of the series, Creed.Production  Sylvester Stallone's original concept for Rocky, and the character Rocky Balboa, was inspired by his viewing of a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner. The idea of an underdog boxer going the distance and putting up a fierce fight against all odds appealed to Stallone. Stallone then wrote the screenplay Paradise Alley. After reading that script, producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff invited Stallone to meet them. Stallone brought up his idea for Rocky, Chartoff was impressed with the concept and he and Winkler agreed to support Stallone financially while he wrote the script, with the understanding they would get to see the script first. The studio liked the script, which was considered as a vehicle for established stars Burt Reynolds or James Caan, among others. Stallone held out, demanding he'd be given a chance to star in it. He later said that he would never have forgiven himself if the film become a success with someone else in the lead. He also knew that Winkler and Chartoff's contract with the studio enabled them to \"greenlight\" a project if the budget was kept low enough. Certain elements of the story were altered during filming. The original script had a darker tone: Mickey was portrayed as racist and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world after all. Although Winkler and Chartoff were enthusiastic about the script, they were at first somewhat hesitant to allow Stallone to play the main character. The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Adrianna and Apollo Creed cast unusually late by production standards (both were ultimately cast on the same day). Real life boxer Ken Norton was initially handed the role of Apollo Creed but he pulled out and it was ultimately given to Carl Weathers. Interestingly, Norton had three fights with Muhammad Ali, who Creed was loosely based on. According to The Rocky Scrapbook, Carrie Snodgress was originally chosen to play Adrianna, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. Susan Sarandon auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for character. After Talia Shire's ensuing audition, along with Avildsen, Chartoff and Winkler, insisted that she play the part. During filming of Rocky, Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weathers suffered injuries due to filming the final fight with Stallone suffering bruised ribs and Weathers suffering a damaged nose. As Stallone was injured, the filming was put on hold for over 3 weeks for Stallone to recover. This happened as Stallone wanted the final fight to look believable and tried to make it real.Cast Main cast Cameo appearances  With the character of outspoken Apollo Creed influenced by Muhammad Ali, one interesting detail is the cameo appearance of Joe Frazier, another real-life former world heavyweight champion who fought Ali three times. During the Academy Awards ceremony, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show Ali was not offended by the film. The poster seen above the ring before Rocky fights Apollo Creed shows Rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe. When Rocky points this out he is told that \"it doesn't really matter does it?\". This was an actual mistake made amongst the props department that they could not afford to rectify, so Stallone ad-libbed the scene.Critical reception Reviews  Rocky received positive reviews when it was released in 1976. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Rocky 4 out of 4 stars, and Box Office Magazine claimed that audiences would be \"...touting Sylvester (Sly) Stallone as a new star\". However, Vincent Canby of the New York Times called it \"pure '30s make believe\" and slammed both Stallone's acting and Avildsen's directing, calling the latter \"...none too decisive...\" More than 30 years later, the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives generally positive reviews. Film-goers at the movie website IMDb voted Rocky a 7.9 out of 10 rating, and Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 93% fresh rating. Another positive online review came from the BBC Films website, with both reviewer Almar Haflidason and BBC online users giving it 5/5 stars. In Steven J. Schneider's 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, Schneider says the film is \"often overlooked as schmaltz.\"Awards  Rocky received ten Academy Awards nominations in nine categories winning three: The Directors Guild of America awarded Rocky its annual award for best film of the year in 1976, and in 2006, Sylvester Stallone's original screenplay for Rocky was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 78th best screenplay of all time.Music  Rocky's soundtrack was composed by Bill Conti. The main theme song \"Gonna Fly Now\" made it to number one on the Billboard Magazines Hot 100 list for one week (from July 2 to July 8, 1977) and the American Film Institute placed it 58th on its 100 Songs. The complete soundtrack was re-released in 1988 by EMI on CD and cassette. Bill Conti was also the composer for Rocky II, III and V, and the sixth installment. Although the Bill Conti version of \"Gonna Fly Now\" is the most recognizable arrangement, a cover of the song performed by legendary trumpeter Maynard Ferguson on his Conquistador album prior to the release of the motion picture soundtrack actually outsold the soundtrack itself.U.S. Box Office  Rocky: US$117.2 million The original Rocky was the most profitable entry of the series, with a budget of US$1.2 million.Video games  Several video games have been made based on the film. The first Rocky video game was released by Coleco for Colecovision. Another was released in 1987 for the Sega Master System. More recently, a Rocky video game was released in 2002 for the Nintendo Gamecube, Nintendo Game Boy Advance, Sony PlayStation 2, and Microsoft Xbox, and a sequel (Rocky: Legends) was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. In 2007 a video game called Rocky Balboa was released for PSP. In 2015, a sequel to the popular \"Real Boxing\" was released called \"Real Boxing 2: CREED\" which includes Adonis \"Hollywood\" Creed and Rocky Balboa as characters.External links  Cite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundRocky Wiki Thunderlips  Thunderlips, The Ultimate Male, or The Ultimate Object Of Desire was a wrestler that fought Rocky Balboa while raising money for charity. Thunderlips was played by professional wrestler/actor/reality show star and TV personality Hulk Hogan. In the Rocky III novelization, he was once known as \"Macho Mountain\" by his trio of \"slave girls\" who accompany him in the ring (whose names have never been revealed).About \"Thunderlips\"  As possibly a public relations stunt, and much to the chagrin of Mickey, Rocky's business handlers had set up an exhibition match against the Seven-foot tall wrestler Thunderlips, who billed himself as \"The Ultimate Male\", and in doing so called Balboa \"The Ultimate Meatball\"! At first, at the beginning of the match, it seemed as if Rocky was supremely overmatched against his much larger opponent, as Thunderlips was body-slamming and tossing Rocky around like a rag-doll, and then out of the ring. Even security guards were failing to keep order as Thunderlips repelled their attempts to get in the ring. But, as the match wore on, the momentum changed in the much smaller boxer's favor, as he was able to get Thunderlips in a headlock, and fire body blows which first angered, and bewildered, then began staggering, the brawny grappler, before even body slamming him onto the canvas! At match's end, Thunderlips congratulates Rocky on \"a good match\", although it was possibly staged, as he, Rocky, Mickey and Adrian pose for a publicity photo. Although this fight marked part of the high point of Rocky's career, there were some subtle signs of trouble ahead. Clubber Lang, who had attended Rocky's earlier title defences, also was in the audience of this fight in order to study his desired opponent as best possible, and left with a disgusted appearance as the audience poured out. Although Lang's mannerisms lacked confidence in an anticipated victory, this was still a sign of a future challenge. Also, during the fight, Mickey momentarily suffered heart pains and clutched his chest, his body warning him of the consequences of not seeking medical attention for his cardiovascular issues, which were exacerbated by the fear and excitement of this fight.Appearances \u9999\u6e2f\u5df4\u58eb\u5927\u5178 \u9996\u9801 \u9999\u6e2f\u5df4\u58eb\u5927\u5178 \u4e5d\u5df4\u8def\u7dda

But when this company's wikis start paying attention to the world around you, they're really going to take off. Traffic for the topic-specific wiki platform grew 50 percent last year to 851 million page views a month, Wikia CEO Craig Palmer told me yesterday. The traffic growth, he says, mostly comes from game and entertainment sites. Wikia is stealing growth from IGN and has hired two execs from there as well. Read more...

We have added sections at the end of this privacy policy which apply solely to EEA residents. Overview We respect your right to privacy. Our overall aim is to ensure that our collection and use of personal information is appropriate to the provision of the Website for our users, and is in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Registration is only required for the following purposes: If you decide to register, we will require: your unique chosen username, a valid email address, password, and date of birth. You may optionally provide us with the following additional personal information: your first name, last name, your gender, and your interests and hobbies. We call all of this information \"Registration Data\". 2. All Website Visitors (including both registered and unregistered users) We recognize that most of our Website users are not registered users. In such cases, we will collect the information you provide when you modify the content of a page on the Website (such as making edits, uploading images, etc.). An indicator that you provided that information is left on the history tab associated with the edited page or appropriate special/image page; on the recent changes link\u00a0and in your user contributions. Also, if you send a communication to us, we may keep a copy of that communication so that we can respond appropriately. Aside from information that you provide us directly, we also collect the following information from your computer or device when you use our Website: IP address, the length of time of your visit, your browser type, that browser\u2019s language setting and the your computer\u2019s operating system. We also collect anonymous data regarding the pages of the Website that a user visits and search requests that the user submits. We call this information \"Beacon Data\". We use both Registration Data and Beacon Data to improve your experience with the Website, by understanding how our users like to use our Website, and what interests they may have based on the information we have collected about you. The Registration Data and Beacon Data are also used to select advertisements or content to provide to you. Cookies and third parties with whom we share your personal information Our Website also uses cookies to collect information about you and to distinguish you from other users of our Website. Cookies are small text files which are placed on your browser by our Website. When you visit our Website, the cookies allow our Website to recognize you and your browser and allow your use of the website and its functionalities to be tracked. This information can be used for a number of purposes, including serving you with advertising that is more aligned to you and your interests. Cookies are useful because they help us make your Website experience more enjoyable. They help us to monitor the way in which our Website is used and allow us to recognize your device (for example, your laptop or mobile device) so that we can tailor your experience of our Website. We do not use cookie technology to collect personal information about you. You can find out more about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org. Most web browsers allow you to disable cookies, and you are welcome to continue to use the Website if you choose to do so. However, some of the Website's features may not function properly if cookies are disabled. Our Website works with third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies to collect information when you visit our Website and third party sites about your browsing activities, such as IP address and user search history data. This information, collected through cookies, is typically used by these third party advertising networks to serve you with advertisements tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests. Some of our third party suppliers, including advertising and website analysis firms, can also use mobile identifiers to collect information and provide behavioral advertising through your mobile devices and use of our mobile apps. In general, we use two types of cookies on our website: 1. \u201cNon-Marketing Cookies\u201d \u2013 i.e., cookies that are used for Website traffic analysis and verification purposes. Examples of these types of cookies which gather information about our users are as follows: a. Google Analytics, which uses cookies to aid us in traffic analysis and informing improvements to the site; b. Quantcast, which collects information about the number visitors to our Website and extrapolates market research from that data; and c. comScore, which works in a similar way to Quantcast. 2. \"Marketing Cookies\" \u2013 i.e., cookies that are used to market to you or provide personalized ads to you Examples of these types of cookies which gather information about our users are as follows: a. Supply Side Platforms (also known as SSPs) such as Google\u2019s ADX, which uses cookies to collect information about your browsing history to target advertising; b. The Salesforce Data Management Platform (\u201cDMP\u201d) platform (formerly known as Krux). Salesforce DMP uses a number of technologies, including cookies, to collect non-personal information based on its analysis of your interaction with our Website. In particular, Salesforce DMP segments our user data into specific categories \u2013 such as comedy fans, gaming fans, Star Wars fans, Batman fans, etc. (all of this data segmentation is anonymous). Also, on the FANDOM mobile app the user is asked to indicate the communities it is particularly interested in (e.g., Star Wars, Batman, etc) and that information is also used for such segmentation purposes. You can find out more about how the Salesforce DMP platform collects and uses this non-personal information by clicking the \u201cSalesforce DMP Privacy\u201d link on the salesforce.com website. Salesforce is an NAI member and, as stated below, you may use the NAI opt-out tool to cease our use of the Krux data for the purpose of sending you personalized advertisements. Opting out of personalized website ads You can opt-out of receiving personalized website ads from advertisers and ad networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) or who follow the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising using their respective opt-out tools. The NAI's opt-out tool can be found here NAI opt-out and the DAA's opt out tool can be found here Choices. To opt out of tracking and receiving targeted ads in our mobile apps based on your behavior, you can use the instructions below, which apply to iOS and Android devices: For iOS 7 and higher: Go to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the \"Limit Ad Tracking\" setting. For most Android devices with OS 2.2 or higher and Google Play Services version 4.0 or higher: Open your Google Settings app > Ads > Enable \"Opt out of interest-based advertising\". Some Android phones may have Google Settings in other settings locations. Note that opting-out may not stop information from being collected on the web and will not stop your receiving advertising. However, if you opt-out, the applicable advertiser will not use any information collected from our applicable Website or mobile app for the purpose of displaying personalized ads. Anonymous data We also collect anonymized details about visitors to our website for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymized details we collect for these purposes. Security While we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us. Where we have given you, or where you have chosen, a password that enable you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this confidential. Such passwords should not be shared with anyone. Data Retention Subject to the rights of users located in the EEA as described below, we will retain information (including personal information) for as long as we need to use it for the reasons set out in this privacy policy and will delete it after that time except where we need to keep any personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. Third Party Websites Our Website and/or Apps contain links to other websites operated by third parties. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the personal information that we collect through our Website and we cannot be responsible for personal information that third parties may collect, store and use through their websites. You should always read the privacy policy of each website you visit carefully. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO EEA RESIDENTS What is our justification for handling your personal data? Under European data protection laws, we have to ensure that we process your personal information fairly and lawfully. This means that we must have a \"legal basis\" for each of our processing activities where they relate to the personal data of an individual within the EEA. These bases include: We rely on these legal bases in different ways, and in relation to different types of processing of your personal data. Consent We process your personal information collected through the use of Marketing Cookies (as described in the Cookie section above) on the basis of your consent, which we ask for when you first visit our Website. You are entitled to withdraw your consent to our use of these Cookies. The list of partners for which we request consent is located at our Vendor List. In order to withdraw your consent, please visit the \"Reset Your Tracking Preferences\" button at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. Legitimate Interests We believe that our use of your other personal information described herein is necessary for our legitimate interests, which are as follows: If we rely on our, or another person's, legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details in the \"Complaints, Questions and Comments\" section below. We process your personal information collected through the use of Non-Marketing Cookies (as described in the Cookie section above) on the basis of our legitimate interests. We also rely on legitimate interests to use your personal information in order to provide you with access to our Website, and to make sure that it works properly, and to keep a record of who is accessing and making changes to the different parts of our Website. Rights of EEA Residents Residents in the EEA have the following rights: If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please use the forms indicated where applicable and email us at support@fandom.com. We will consider all such requests and provide our response within a reasonable period (and in any event within any time period required by law). Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances. If an exception applies, we will tell you this when responding to your request. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make. Please also note for security and fraud investigation and prevention purposes, we will retain the full IP address for users located in the EEA for up to 12 months. In addition, we keep a copy of requests submitted to us to comply with our own legal obligation to maintain data processing records. Please also note that certain information, such as your IP address (if you edit while not logged in) and any public contributions to the FANDOM community sites is archived and displayed indefinitely by design; the transparency of each community\u2019s contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. In addition, the anonymization process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive anonymization of all of the content or information posted on our Website related to your prior username. If your request is granted, the name change will only occur in automatically generated logs (such as page histories) in association with content that you posted. The name change will not delete mentions of your prior username by third parties. International Transfers Where personal information is held by us, it is held in the U.S.A. We will also transfer the personal information that we collect about you to third party processors located in countries that are outside the EEA, or to members of our group of companies in connection with the above purposes. If we provide any of your personal information to any such non-EEA suppliers, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately. Complaints, Questions and Comments We have a Data Protection Officer to assist with all queries regarding our processing of personal information; Wade Warren who can be contacted at c/o Wikia, Inc., 149 New Montgomery St, 3rd Floor, San Francisco CA 94105; Email: DPO@fandom.com; Phone: (415) 980-5647 If you have any complaints about our Website, please contact us at: Address: 149 New Montgomery St, 3rd Floor, San Francisco CA 94105 Email: support@fandom.com Telephone: (415) 762-0780 In the EEA you may also make a complaint to our supervisory body for data protection matters (for example, the Information Commissioner's Office in the UK) or seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.FANDOM Anime Watch Anime Videos from Crunchyroll  <crunchyroll />FANDOM About  __NORAIL__FANDOM About Wikia FANDOM Entertainment/Avengers Battle Royale FANDOM Press  __NORAIL__FANDOM Entertainment/TV Schedule  Where TV Goes to Die  ABC: CBS: NBC: Fox: CW: 2013 Pilot List    Join a Live Chat!

Search for a wiki or start your own to find a community of fans who love what you love. Except where otherwise permitted, the text on FANDOM communities (known as \"wikis\") is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA). Some wikis use licenses other than the CC-BY-SA license. The license used by an individual wiki is made clear on the edit page of that wiki. Individual wikis may not use a license other than CC-BY-SA unless it has been explicitly permitted by Wikia, Inc. Non-permitted uses of alternate licenses automatically default to CC-BY-SA.Editing at FANDOM  Wikis Using the CC BY-SA license To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users editing or otherwise contributing to wikis that use the CC BY-SA license agree to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely for any purpose, including commercial use, in accordance with the CC BY-SA license. Such use is allowed where attribution is given and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute applies to any derivative works of the contributions. By editing or otherwise contributing to a wiki that uses the CC BY-SA license, you agree to license any text you change or contribute under the CC BY-SA license.\u00a0 Wikis Using the CC BY-NC License If you edit or otherwise contribute to a wiki that uses the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial license (\u201cCC BY-NC\u201d), you agree that your contributions are made under the CC BY-NC license, subject to the waiver described at the end of this section (\u201cCommercial Use Waiver\u201d). Please note that your contributions are shareable and remixable under the CC BY-NC license, but cannot be used for commercial purposes by FANDOM users. A summary of the CC BY-NC license as well as the full text of the license can be accessed via the links below: Please note that some wikis use other versions of the CC BY-NC license. By editing or otherwise contributing to a wiki that uses the CC BY-NC license, you agree that your contributions are made under the CC BY-NC license, subject to the Commercial Use Waiver. Wikis Using the CC BY-NC-ND License If you contribute to or otherwise edit a wiki that uses the Creative Commons by Attribution Non-Commercial-NoDerivs license (\u201cCC-BY-NC-ND\u201d), you agree that your contributions are made under the CC BY-NC-ND license, subject to the Commercial Use Waiver. The CC BY-NC-ND license is very similar to the CC BY-NC license, except that you may not alter, transform, or build upon this work. A summary of the CC BY-NC-ND license as well as the full text of the license can be accessed via the links below: By editing or otherwise contributing to a wiki that uses the CC BY-NC-ND license, you agree that your contributions are made under the CC BY-NC-ND license, subject to the Commercial Use Waiver. If you contribute to, or have contributed to, a wiki that uses a license that restricts the commercial use of your contribution (e.g., the CC BY-NC license or the CC BY-NC-ND license), you hereby waive such restriction with respect to FANDOM's use of such contribution and any derivative works of such contribution.Discussions and Chat  Content submitted to discussions or chat on communities are not licensed under the CC BY-SA licenses. As set forth in our Terms of Use that content is subject to a separate license grant to Wikia, Inc (only) which allows Wikia, Inc to utilize such content as it sees fit.Importing text  If you want to provide contributions in which you do not own or control the copyright, you may only do so if you originally received such contributions under terms that are compatible with the license used on the wiki to which you intend to provide the contribution. In addition, you may not contribute to a wiki that uses a license that restricts commercial uses unless you hold the copyright to such contribution or otherwise have the right to grant the Commercial Use Waiver with respect to such contribution. For example, you may not contribute content to which you have received a license under the CC BY-NC license to a wiki governed by that license unless you have the right to grant the Commercial Use Waiver with respect to such contribution. If you import text under a compatible license which requires attribution, you must, in a reasonable fashion (including by one of the attribution methods described below), credit the author(s). Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as copying within FANDOM), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text.Attribution  As a contributor, you agree that being attributed in any of the following fashions satisfies the attribution requirements of the license applicable to your contribution to a wiki: a) attribution through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article or articles you contributed to, b) attribution through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or c) attribution through a list of all authors. Any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.Non-text files  Freely licensed or public domain images are strongly preferred on FANDOM. Non-text media on FANDOM should not be assumed to be available under the same license as the text. Please view the media description page for details about the license of any specific media file. If you are uploading files to FANDOM, you should cite the source of the file, attribute the authors, and note any copyright information, where applicable. Individual communities may elaborate upon and refine requirements for file uploads.Using FANDOM content  Each wiki contains information on which license applies to your use of the text. It is your responsibility to understand and adhere to that license. Text from external sources may attach additional attribution requirements to the work beyond what is described on this page. When re-using FANDOM text that has been posted subject to a Creative Commons license, you must provide attribution to the authors using one of the attribution methods described in the section above titled \u201cAttribution.\u201d Attribution example when re-using FANDOM content on your own website: Off-wiki content (for example, emails, IRC chats, off-wiki forums, etc) should not be assumed to be released under this license if this is not explicitly stated.Translations  These licensing terms are not to be modified. If there is any inconsistency between these terms and any translation into other languages, the English language version takes precedence. Links will be added above to any unofficial translations.FANDOM Community Creation Policy FANDOM Policies Get Involved Today!  Search for a wiki or start your own to find a community of fans who love what you love. The goal of FANDOM is to support large communities who want to work together, and small groups who want to share their passions with the world.Community creation policy  FANDOM welcomes communities (known as \"wikis\") on almost any topic, large or small, popular or obscure, modern or historical, creative or documentary, funny or serious. However, your community must contain no hate, no libel, no pornographic content, and no copyright infringement. You must agree:Free content  Text on FANDOM communities is available under a free content license, meaning the information you put on the wiki can be copied and reused by anyone. This is very important to our goal of increasing the amount of free content in the world, but isn't always what creators are looking for when searching for a content host. Although some fair use material may be included in our communities, FANDOM aims to be a repository of free content, so any wiki which would be primarily made up of fair use material rather than freely licensed material is not permitted. Examples include fan translations of copyrighted works, screenshots of television shows or games, or scans of comic book pages.Public viewing  All FANDOM communities are publicly viewable. FANDOM does not provide private communities and there is no option in the software to password-protect or otherwise prevent people from reading any of the pages on a community. FANDOM communities are indexed by search engines, and contributions may appear prominently in certain search results.Public editing  Communities are about working together, and all FANDOM communities are open to the public to edit. There is no option to restrict editing to the founder or to a particular group. Unnecessary page protection is a common mistake that is considered harmful to a wiki's development. A clear statement of the community's goals is a better way to promote your vision than technical restrictions. These are community projects, not personal websites. They are not owned by their founders, nor does the founder's opinion carry more weight in disagreements than any other user's opinion. Consensus and cooperation should be the primary means for organizing a community.No abuse  Communities which consist only of offensive material or personal attacks will be closed. A user who is banned on other communities or who abuses the wiki creation tool may be blocked from creating new communities. Users may not create communities with offensive or abusive titles or urls. We have simple filtering in place to discourage the most obvious undesirable names, but we know it is not possible to block every possible abuse. Users who circumvent the filters in order to create communities in bad faith will simply have their wiki deleted and their user account banned. Please contact staff to report any abusive community names that we have missed, or if the filter mistakenly prevents you from using an innocent name.Additional guidelines Living people  Please be cautious about creating communities or pages (even humorous ones) about living people who aren't publicly notable, including classmates and teachers, gaming clans, forum communities, and more. Even positive articles about people can cause unnecessary drama and may become a tempting target for personal attacks, cyberbullying, unwanted exposure of personal information, and other violations of Wikia, Inc.'s Terms of Use. Remember that any article that uses a person's real name, username or pseudonym can show up prominently in internet searches, and may become a target of pranks or malice long after the original authors have moved on. What is acceptable will vary depending on the type of community, but if problem content is not dealt with in good faith by the project's community, FANDOM staff may remove or alter pages (or entire communities) that are deemed libelous, offensive, or distressing.Duplicate wikis  Communities are about working together. We allow multiple communities on the same topic, but we strongly encourage you to find and join an existing wiki instead of trying to create a new project about an existing topic -- for many interests, we may already have an active community that needs your help or a dormant project that you can adopt and bring to life. In the wider web, communities about the same topic tend to merge sooner or later, or the less popular project(s) are abandoned as editors move to the more complete website. It is much easier to incorporate good ideas into an existing community than to try to merge content or create \"sister project\" structures later. Advantages of working together: Disadvantages of creating a duplicate community: If you really want a separate community on an existing topic, please use your creativity to present the information in a different way -- you could be serious where others are silly (or vice versa), be opinionated where others are neutral, focus on fan activity or trivia rather than encyclopedic information, or anything else that will set you apart from existing projects. A community which only copies content from other communities may be closed if it fails to provide credit or begin editing the text to make the project different and distinct.Closing, merging, and altering communities  All communities are subject to closure or alteration if necessary. FANDOM staff and helpers may contact the community about making changes to the community, including the site name or url, to meet our Terms of Use or to improve search visibility and ad display. While a community's founder may request that their project be closed, if the topic is of general public interest FANDOM generally prefers to leave dormant communities available for adoption. Wikis which have no content, or remain inactive, or have a large overlap with another wiki may be merged with another project or closed completely. In the case of a complete closure of wikis that previously had content, the database of content may be made available for download for up to 30 days.FANDOM Go FANDOM Advertising Examples FANDOM Our Audience  Wikia offers unparalleled access to a large and ever-evolving network of community-based, content-rich sites - and passionate users that power them.

They were kept in a sealed environment to carefully monitor their oxygen intake so the gas didn't kill them, since it was toxic in high concentrations. This was before closed circuit cameras so they had only microphones and five inch thick glass porthole sized windows into the chamber to monitor them. The chamber was stocked with books, cots to sleep on but no bedding, running water and toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month. The test subjects were political prisoners deemed enemies of the state during World War II. Everything was fine for the first five days; the subjects hardly complained having been promised (falsely) that they would be freed if they submitted to the test and did not sleep for 30 days. Their conversations and activities were monitored and it was noted that they continued to talk about increasingly traumatic incidents in their past, and the general tone of their conversations took on a darker aspect after the four day mark. After five days they started to complain about the circumstances and events that lead them to where they were and started to demonstrate severe paranoia. They stopped talking to each other and began alternately whispering to the microphones and one way mirrored portholes. Oddly they all seemed to think they could win the trust of the experimenters by turning over their comrades, the other subjects in captivity with them. At first the researchers suspected this was an effect of the gas itself... After nine days the first of them started screaming. He ran the length of the chamber repeatedly yelling at the top of his lungs for three hours straight, he continued attempting to scream but was only able to produce occasional squeaks. The researchers postulated that he had physically torn his vocal cords. The most surprising thing about this behavior is how the other captives reacted to it... or rather didn't react to it. They continued whispering to the microphones until the second of the captives started to scream. The two non-screaming captives took the books apart, smeared page after page with their own feces and pasted them calmly over the glass portholes. The screaming promptly stopped. So did the whispering to the microphones. After three more days passed. The researchers checked the microphones hourly to make sure they were working, since they thought it impossible that no sound could be coming with five people inside. The oxygen consumption in the chamber indicated that all five must still be alive. In fact it was the amount of oxygen five people would consume at a very heavy level of strenuous exercise. On the morning of the 14th day the researchers did something they said they would not do to get a reaction from the captives, they used the intercom inside the chamber, hoping to provoke any response from the captives they were afraid were either dead or vegetables. They announced: \"We are opening the chamber to test the microphones; step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.\" To their surprise they heard a single phrase in a calm voice response: \"We no longer want to be freed.\" Debate broke out among the researchers and the military forces funding the research. Unable to provoke any more response using the intercom it was finally decided to open the chamber at midnight on the fifteenth day. The chamber was flushed of the stimulant gas and filled with fresh air and immediately voices from the microphones began to object. 3 different voices began begging, as if pleading for the life of loved ones to turn the gas back on. The chamber was opened and soldiers sent in to retrieve the test subjects. They began to scream louder than ever, and so did the soldiers when they saw what was inside. Four of the five subjects were still alive, although no one could rightly call the state that any of them in 'life.' The food rations past day five had not been so much as touched. There were chunks of meat from the dead test subject's thighs and chest stuffed into the drain in the center of the chamber, blocking the drain and allowing four inches of water to accumulate on the floor. Precisely how much of the water on the floor was actually blood was never determined. All four 'surviving' test subjects also had large portions of muscle and skin torn away from their bodies. The destruction of flesh and exposed bone on their finger tips indicated that the wounds were inflicted by hand, not with teeth as the researchers initially thought. Closer examination of the position and angles of the wounds indicated that most if not all of them were self-inflicted. The abdominal organs below the ribcage of all four test subjects had been removed. While the heart, lungs and diaphragm remained in place, the skin and most of the muscles attached to the ribs had been ripped off, exposing the lungs through the ribcage. All the blood vessels and organs remained intact, they had just been taken out and laid on the floor, fanning out around the eviscerated but still living bodies of the subjects. The digestive tract of all four could be seen to be working, digesting food. It quickly became apparent that what they were digesting was their own flesh that they had ripped off and eaten over the course of days. Most of the soldiers were Russian special operatives at the facility, but still many refused to return to the chamber to remove the test subjects. They continued to scream to be left in the chamber and alternately begged and demanded that the gas be turned back on, lest they fall asleep... To everyone's surprise the test subjects put up a fierce fight in the process of being removed from the chamber. One of the Russian soldiers died from having his throat ripped out, another was gravely injured by having his testicles ripped off and an artery in his leg severed by one of the subject's teeth. Another 5 of the soldiers lost their lives if you count ones that committed suicide in the weeks following the incident. In the struggle one of the four living subjects had his spleen ruptured and he bled out almost immediately. The medical researchers attempted to sedate him but this proved impossible. He was injected with more than ten times the human dose of a morphine derivative and still fought like a cornered animal, breaking the ribs and arm of one doctor. When heart was seen to beat for a full two minutes after he had bled out to the point there was more air in his vascular system than blood. Even after it stopped he continued to scream and flail for another three minutes, struggling to attack anyone in reach and just repeating the word \"MORE\" over and over, weaker and weaker, until he finally fell silent. The surviving three test subjects were heavily restrained and moved to a medical facility, the two with intact vocal cords continuously begging for the gas demanding to be kept awake... The most injured of the three was taken to the only surgical operating room that the facility had. In the process of preparing the subject to have his organs placed back within his body it was found that he was effectively immune to the sedative they had given him to prepare him for the surgery. He fought furiously against his restraints when the anesthetic gas was brought out to put him under. He managed to tear most of the way through a four inch wide leather strap on one wrist, even through the weight of a 200 pound soldier holding that wrist as well. It took only a little more anesthetic than normal to put him under, and the instant his eyelids fluttered and closed, his heart stopped. In the autopsy of the test subject that died on the operating table it was found that his blood had triple the normal level of oxygen. His muscles that were still attached to his skeleton were badly torn and he had broken 9 bones in his struggle to not be subdued. Most of them were from the force his own muscles had exerted on them. The second survivor had been the first of the group of five to start screaming. His vocal cords destroyed he was unable to beg or object to surgery, and he only reacted by shaking his head violently in disapproval when the anesthetic gas was brought near him. He shook his head yes when someone suggested, reluctantly, they try the surgery without anesthetic, and did not react for the entire six hour procedure of replacing his abdominal organs and attempting to cover them with what remained of his skin. The surgeon presiding stated repeatedly that it should be medically possible for the patient to still be alive. One terrified nurse assisting the surgery stated that she had seen the patients mouth curl into a smile several times, whenever his eyes met hers. When the surgery ended the subject looked at the surgeon and began to wheeze loudly, attempting to talk while struggling. Assuming this must be something of drastic importance the surgeon had a pen and pad fetched so the patient could write his message. It was simple. \"Keep cutting.\" The other two test subjects were given the same surgery, both without anesthetic as well. Although they had to be injected with a paralytic for the duration of the operation. The surgeon found it impossible to perform the operation while the patients laughed continuously. Once paralyzed the subjects could only follow the attending researchers with their eyes. The paralytic cleared their system in an abnormally short period of time and they were soon trying to escape their bonds. The moment they could speak they were again asking for the stimulant gas. The researchers tried asking why they had injured themselves, why they had ripped out their own guts and why they wanted to be given the gas again. Only one response was given: \"I must remain awake.\" All three subject's restraints were reinforced and they were placed back into the chamber awaiting determination as to what should be done with them. The researchers, facing the wrath of their military 'benefactors' for having failed the stated goals of their project considered euthanizing the surviving subjects. The commanding officer, an ex-KGB instead saw potential, and wanted to see what would happen if they were put back on the gas. The researchers strongly objected, but were overruled. In preparation for being sealed in the chamber again the subjects were connected to an EEG monitor and had their restraints padded for long term confinement. To everyone's surprise all three stopped struggling the moment it was let slip that they were going back on the gas. It was obvious that at this point all three were putting up a great struggle to stay awake. One of subjects that could speak was humming loudly and continuously; the mute subject was straining his legs against the leather bonds with all his might, first left, then right, then left again for something to focus on. The remaining subject was holding his head off his pillow and blinking rapidly. Having been the first to be wired for EEG most of the researchers were monitoring his brain waves in surprise. They were normal most of the time but sometimes flat lined inexplicably. It looked as if he were repeatedly suffering brain death, before returning to normal. As they focused on paper scrolling out of the brainwave monitor only one nurse saw his eyes slip shut at the same moment his head hit the pillow. His brainwaves immediately changed to that of deep sleep, then flatlined for the last time as his heart simultaneously stopped. The only remaining subject that could speak started screaming to be sealed in now. His brainwaves showed the same flatlines as one who had just died from falling asleep. The commander gave the order to seal the chamber with both subjects inside, as well as three researchers. One of the named three immediately drew his gun and shot the commander point blank between the eyes, then turned the gun on the mute subject and blew his brains out as well. He pointed his gun at the remaining subject, still restrained to a bed as the remaining members of the medical and research team fled the room. \"I won't be locked in here with these things! Not with you!\" he screamed at the man strapped to the table. \"WHAT ARE YOU?\" he demanded. \"I must know!\" The subject smiled. \"Have you forgotten so easily?\" the subject asked. \"We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread.\" The researcher paused. Then aimed at the subject's heart and fired. The EEG flatlined as the subject weakly choked out, \"So... nearly... free...\"Creepypasta Wiki Squidward's Suicide  I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn't one. I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it. Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months. Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be \"Fear of a Krabby Patty\" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as \"How sex doesn't work\" instead of \"Rock-a-bye-Bivalve\" when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card \"Squidward's Suicide\" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke. One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward's concert. This is when things began to seem off. While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Squidward's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet. The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest. The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality. Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road. The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke. The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo. The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed. About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams. Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames. The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink. The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said \"DO IT\" and we see in Squidward's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends. Mr. Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed. The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does. There was an investigation due to the nature of the photos, but nothing came of it. No child seen was identified and no clues were gathered from the data involved nor physical clues in the photos. I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can't prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things.Video Creepypasta Wiki \"Lost Episodes\" Creepypasta Wiki Pok\u00e9Mon  Get out your Pok\u00e9dex, because you're about to record some scary info.

SORRY, WE ARE NOT ACCEPTING NEW POKEMON PASTAS.Creepypasta Wiki The Slender Man  The Slender Man is an alleged paranormal figure purported to have been in existence for centuries, covering a large geographic area. Believers in the Slender Man tie his appearances in with many other legends around the world, including; Fear Dubh (or, The Dark Man) in Scotland, the Dutch Takkenmann (Branch Man), and the German legend of Der Gro\u00dfmann or Der Grosse Mann (the Tall Man).Appearance  The Slender Man is a being (male in appearance) who looks like a man with extremely long, slender arms and legs. He also appears to have 4 to 8 long, black tentacles that protrude from his back, though different photographs and enthusiasts disagree on this fact, and therefore it is theorized he can 'contract' these tentacles at will. He is described as wearing a black suit strikingly similar to the visage of the notorious Men In Black, and as the name suggests, appears very thin and able to stretch his limbs and torso to inhuman lengths in order to induce fear and ensnare his prey. Once his arms are outstretched, his victims are put into something of a hypnotized state, where they are utterly helpless to stop themselves from walking into them. He is also able to create tendrils from his fingers and back that he uses to walk on in a similar fashion to Doctor Octopus. The superhuman stretching ability could also be seen as a similarity between himself and Mr. Fantastic. Whether he absorbs, kills, or merely takes his victims to an undisclosed location or dimension is also unknown as there are never any bodies or evidence left behind in his wake to deduce a definite conclusion. His face is pale and slightly ghostly, and almost appears to have been wrapped in a type of gauze or cloth. his facial features are also an object of debate, and many people believe that his face looks different to each person, if it is seen at all. He sometimes is portrayed wears a hat, which is sometimes a bowler, a fedora, or sometimes a tophat. He may also be seen wearing a long flowing necktie or scarf, which is either red or grey. He often keeps his long, pale hands crossed politely behind his back or hanging loosely at his sides. His suit is black, sometimes portrayed as pinstripe in artwork, a common misconception thanks to the very similar Jack Skellington from Nightmare Before Christmas. He has long coattails which he lets flow proudly. He wears long dress shoes, which are always shined a perfect, gleaming black.Behavior  Much of the fascination with Slender Man is rooted in the overall aura of mystery that he is wrapped in. Despite the fact that it is rumored he kills children almost exclusively, it is difficult to say whether or not his only objective is slaughter. Often times it is either reported or recorded that he can be found in sections of woods, and these generally tend to be suburban. He also has been reported seen with large groups of children, as many photographs portray. It is commonly thought that he resides in woods and forests and preys on children. He seems unconcerned with being exposed in the daylight or captured in photos. It is often thought as well that he enjoys stalking people who become overly paranoid about his existence, purposefully giving them glimpses of himself in order to further frighten them. For this reason, it seems like Slenderman very much enjoys psychologically torturing his victims. He also often appears to float or drift around rather than walk, which suggest the possibility of him being an ethereal being rather than a creature or a man. This would also explain why he is able to remain mobile in spite of his poorly proportioned body. Even though Slender Man was fabricated on SomethingAwful forums (or was he?), some people have already claimed sightings. He is seen mostly at night peering into open windows and walks out in front of lone motorists on secluded roads. His main intentions appear to be kidnapping children, as when he is seen near them in photographs, they usually disappear shortly afterwards. The Slender Man has also inspired many stories such as those of Marble Hornets. In the end though, his purpose remains unknown. An interesting take on Slender Man by a pasta member who is relying on the Marble hornets series for evidence/facts:Historical References Brazilian Cave Paintings  The earliest argued reference to the legend is within the cave paintings found in the Serr da Capivara National Park in the Northeast of Brazil, which are believed to date from as far back as 9000 BC. These paintings show a strangely elongated character leading a child by the hand, but make no reference to the extra appendages.Egyptian Hieroglyphs  The next known possible reference to the Slender Man comes from around 3100 BC in lower Egypt, with references to the \"Thief of the Gods\" or the \"Thief of Kuk\" becoming common place during the reign of Pharaoh Wazner. Hieroglyphic carvings representing the Thief were found in the pharaoh's tomb, who was rumored to have had some kind of encounter with the entity. The carvings resemble a strange figure with multiple upper limbs, one that has never been found in any other hieroglyph language.German Woodcuts  Renowned German woodcutter Hans Freckenberg created at least two woodcuts featuring a character he described as Der Ritter (The Knight) during the mid-sixteenth century that were discovered in Halstberg Castle in 1883. Whilst Freckenberg was well-known for his realistic depiction of human anatomy - something that was unusual among woodcuts of the time - these pictures featured a skeletal, multi-limbed character. Historians are unsure of the exact symbolic nature of the character, with some claiming that it is a personification of the religious wars that raged in Europe at the time, while others say it represents the mysterious plagues that have been believed to be the reason for the mysterious abandoning of the Hastlberg Castle and the nearby village in 1543. However, many insist that Freckenberg was attempting to represent \"Der Gro\u00dfmann\" (the Tall Man). According to legend, he was a fairy who lived in the Black Forest. Bad children who crept into the woods at night would be relentlessly chased by Der Gro\u00dfmann, who wouldn't leave them be until he either caught them or they were forced to tell their parents of their wrongdoing. Even then, there is a chilling account from an old journal, dating from about 1702:Romanian Mythology  There is also a Romanian fairytale which tells the legend of the Tall Man, featuring this description which may have taken to refer to the Slender Man \"The tall man stood in a clearing, dressed as a nobleman, all in black. Shadows lay over him, dark as a cloudy midnight. He had many arms, all long and boneless as snakes, all sharp as swords, and they writhed like worms on nails. He did not speak, but made his intentions known,\" In the fairytale, the Tall Man causes a mother to kill her husband and child, before he slid from a fireplace and \"clenched her in his burning embrace.\"English Mythology  There is also an english myth referring to the \"Tree Man\", whom is said to have a slim body with apendages that looks like tree branches. He is only known to be seen in the woods and was used as a story that parents told their children to thwart bad behavior. There have been quite a few disappearances of children that have been said to be linked to the \"Tree Man\".Pastas Involving the Slender Man Video Links / Creator Creepypasta Wiki BEN Drowned  BEN Drowned, or Haunted Majora's Mask, is a well-known creepypasta (and later, an alternate reality game) created by Alex Hall, also known as \"Jadusable\". The story revolves around a Majora's Mask cartridge that is haunted by the ghost (if it is a ghost) of a boy named Ben. Analysis and updates on a possible addition to the story from the original author can be found on the Jadusable Wiki. NOTE: Do NOT post Cleverbot conversations in the discussion area. Doing so will result in a ban.The Pasta Post #1 (Sept. 7, 2010)  Okay, /x/, I need your help with this. This is not copypasta, this is a long read, but I feel like my safety or well-being could very well depend on this. This is video game related, specifically Majora's Mask, and this is the creepiest shit that has ever happened to me in my entire life. Having said that, I recently moved into my dorm room starting as a Sophomore in college and a friend of mine gave me his old Nintendo 64 to play. I was stoked, to say the least, I could finally play all of those old games of my youth that I hadn't touched in at least a decade. His Nintendo 64 came with one yellow controller and a rather shoddy copy of Super Smash Brothers, and while beggars can't be choosers, needless to say it didn't take long until I became bored of beating up LVL 9 CPUs. That weekend I decided to drive around a few neighborhoods about twenty minutes or so off campus, hitting up the local garage sales, hoping to score on some good deals from ignorant parents). I ended up picking up a copy of Pokemon Stadium, Goldeneye (fuck yeah), F-Zero, and two other controllers for two dollars. Satisfied, I began to drive out of the neighborhood when one last house caught my attention. I still have no idea why it did, there were no cars there and only one table was set up with random junk on it, but something sort of drew me there. I usually trust my gut on these things so I got out of the car and I was greeted by an old man. His outward appearance was, for lack of a better word, displeasing. It was odd, if you asked me to tell you why I thought he was displeasing, I couldn't really pinpoint anything - there was just something about him that put me on edge, I can't explain it. All I can tell you is that if it wasn't in the middle of the afternoon and there were other people within shouting distance, I would not have even thought of approaching this man. He flashed a crooked smiled at me and asked what I was looking for, and immediately I noticed that he must be blind in one of his eyes; his right eye had that \"glazed over\" look about it. I forced myself to look to his left eye instead, trying not to offend, and asked him if he had any old video games. I was already wondering how I could politely excuse myself from the situation when he would tell me he had no idea what a video game was, but to my surprise he said he had a few ones in an old box. He assured me he'd be back in a \"jiffy\" and turned to head back into the garage. As I watched him hobble away, I couldn't help but notice what he was selling on his table. Littered across his table were rather\u2026 peculiar paintings; various artworks that looked like ink blots that a psychiatrist might show you. Curious, I looked through them - it was obvious why no one was visiting this guy's garage sale, these weren't exactly aesthetically pleasing. As I came to the last one, for some reason it looked almost like Majora's Mask - the same heart-shaped body with little spikes protruding outward. Initially I just thought that since I was secretly hoping to find that game at these garage sales, some Freudian bullshit was projecting itself into the ink blots, but given the events that happened afterward I'm not so sure now. I should have asked the man about it. I wish I would have asked the man about it. After staring at the Majora-shaped blot, I looked up and the old man was suddenly there again, arms-length in front of me, smiling at me. I'll admit I jumped out of reflex and I laughed nervously as he handed me a Nintendo 64 cartridge. It was the standard grey color, except that someone had written Majora on it in black permanent marker. I got butterflies in my stomach as I realized what a coincidence this was and asked him how much he wanted for it. The old man smiled at me and told me that I could have it for free, that it used to belong to a kid who was about my age that didn't live here anymore. There was something weird about how the man phrased that, but I didn't really pay any attention to then, I was too caught up in not only finding this game but getting it for free. I reminded myself to be a bit skeptical since this looked like a pretty shady cartridge and there's no guarantee it would work, but then the optimist inside me interjected that maybe it was some kind of beta version or pirated version of the game and that was all I needed to be back on cloud nine. I thanked the man and the man smiled at me and wished me well, saying \"Goodbye then!\" - at least that's what it sounded like to me. All the way in the car-ride home, I had a nagging doubt that the man had said something else. My fears were confirmed when I booted up the game (to my surprise it worked just fine) and there was one save file named simply \"BEN\". \"Goodbye Ben\", he was saying \"Goodbye Ben\". I felt bad for the man, obviously a grandparent and obviously going senile, and I - for some reason or another - reminded him of his grandson \"Ben\". Out of curiosity I looked at the save file. Eyeballing it, I could tell that he was pretty far in the game - he had almost all of the masks and 3/4 remains of the bosses. I noticed that he had used an owl statue to save his game, he was on Day 3 and by the Stone Tower Temple with hardly an hour left before the moon would crash. I remember thinking that it was a shame that he had come so close to beating the game but he never finished it. I made a new file named \"Link\" out of tradition and started the game, ready to relive my childhood. For such a shady looking game cartridge, I was impressed at how smoothly it ran - literally just like a retail copy of the game save for a few minor hiccups here and there (like textures being where they shouldn't be, random flashes of cutscenes at odd intervals, but nothing too bad). However the only thing that was a little unnerving was that at times the NPCs would call me \"Link\" and at other times they would call me \"BEN\". I figured it was just a bug - a fluke in the programming causing our files to get mixed up or something. It did kind of creep me out though after a while, and it was around after I had beaten the Woodfall Temple that I regrettably went into the save files and deleted \"BEN\" (I had intended to preserve the file just out of respect of the game's original owner, it's not like I needed two files anyway), hoping that that would solve the problem. It did and it didn't, now NPCs wouldn't call me anything, where my name should be in the dialogue there was just a blank space (my save file name was still called \"Link\", though). Frustrated, and with homework to do, I put the game down for a day. I started playing the game again last night, getting the Lens of Truth and working my way towards completing the Snowhead Temple. Now, some of you more hardcore Majora's Mask players know about the \"4th Day\" glitch - for those who don't you can Google it but the gist of it is that right as the clock is about to hit 00:00:00 on the final day, you talk to the astronomer and look through the telescope. If you time it right the countdown disappears and you essentially have another day to finish whatever you were doing. Deciding to do the glitch to try and finish the Snowhead Temple, I happened to get it right on the first try and the time counter at the bottom disappeared. However, when I pressed B to exit the telescope, instead of being greeted by the astronomer I found myself in the Majora boss fight room at the end of the game (the trippy boxed in arena) staring at Skull Kid hovering above me. There was no sound, just him floating in the air above me, and the background music which was regular for the area (but still creepy). Immediately my palms began to sweat - this was definitely not normal. Skull Kid NEVER appeared here. I tried moving around the area, and no matter where I went, Skull Kid would always be facing me, looking at me, not saying anything. Nothing would happen though, and this kept up for around sixty seconds. I thought the game had bugged or something - but I was beginning to doubt that very much. I was about to reach for the reset button when text appeared on my screen: \"You're not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation\u2026\" I instantly recognized that text - you get that message when you get the Room Key from Anju at the Stock Pot Inn, but why was it playing here? I refused to entertain the notion that it was almost as if the game was trying to communicate with me. I started navigate the room again, testing to see if that was some sort of trigger that enabled me to interact with something here, then I realized how stupid I was - to even think that someone could reprogram the game like this was absurd. Sure enough, fifteen seconds later another message appeared on the screen, and again like the first one it was already a pre-existing phrase \"Go to the lair of the temple's boss? Yes/No\". I paused for a second, contemplating what I should press and how the game would react, when I realized that I couldn't select no. Taking a deep breath, I pressed Yes and the screen faded to white, with the words \"Dawn of a New Day\" with the subtext \"||||||||\" beneath it. Where I was ported to filled me with the most intense sense of dread and impending fear I had ever experienced The only way I can describe the way I felt here is having this feeling of inexplicable depression on a profound scale. I am normally not a depressed person, but the way I felt here was a feeling that I didn't even knew existed - it was such a twisted, powerful presence that seemed to wash over me. I appeared in some kind of weird twilight-zone version of Clock Town. I walked out of the Clock Tower (as you normally do when you start from Day 1) only to find that all of the inhabitants were gone. Usually with the 4th Day glitch you can still find the guards and the dog that runs around outside the tower - this time they were all gone. What replaced them was the ominous feeling that there was something out there, in the same area as me and that it was watching me. I had four hearts to my name and the Hero's Bow, but at this point I wasn't even considered for my avatar, I felt that I personally was in some kind of danger. Perhaps the most chilling thing was the music - it was the Song of Healing, ripped straight from the game itself, but played in reverse. The music would get louder, building up so as if you should expect something to pop out at you, but nothing ever did, and the constant loop began to wear on my mental state. Every now and then I would hear the faint laugh of the Happy Mask Salesman in the background, just quiet enough so that I wasn't sure if I just hearing things but just loud enough to keep me determined to find him. I looked in all four zones of Clock Town, only to find nothing.... No one. Textures were missing, West Clock Town had me walking on air, the entire area felt... broken. Hopelessly broken. As the reverse Song of Healing repeated for what must have been the 50th time, I just remember standing in the middle of South Clock Town realizing that I had never felt so alone in a video game before. As I walked through the ghost town, I don't know whether it was the combination of the out of place textures and the atmosphere and the haunting melody of the once peaceful and soothing song being butchered and distorted, but I was literally on the verge of tears and I had no idea why. I hardly ever cry, something had gripped me here and this powerful sense of depression that was both foreign and crippling. I tried leaving Clock Town, but every time I attempted to zone out, the screen would fade to black and I would just zone in to another part of Clock Town. I tried playing my Ocarina, I wanted to escape, and I did NOT want to be here, but every time I played the Song of Time or Song of Soaring it would only say \"Your notes echo far, but nothing happens\". By this point, it was obvious the game didn't want me to leave, but I had no idea why it was keeping me here. I didn't want to go inside the buildings, I felt that I would be too vulnerable there to whatever I was terrified of. I don't know why, but I came up with the idea that maybe if I drowned myself at the Laundry Pool I could spawn somewhere else and leave this place. As I zoned in and ran towards the pool, that's when it happened. Link grabbed his head, and the screen flashed for a brief moment of the Happy Mask Salesman smiling at me - not Link - me with Skull Kid's scream playing in the background and when the screen returned I was staring at the Link Statue from playing the song Elegy of Emptiness. I screamed as the thing just stared back at me with that haunting facial expression. I turned around and ran out and back into South Clock Town, and to my horror the fucking statue followed me in the only way I can compare this is like the Weeping Angels from Doctor Who. Every so often, at random intervals, the animation would play of the statue appearing behind me. It was like the thing was chasing me, or - I don't even want to fucking say it - haunting me. By this point, I was on the verge of hysterics, but not even once did the thought of turning off the console occur to me, I don't know why, I was so wrapped up in it - the terror felt all so real. I tried to shake the statue, but it would literally appear right behind me every single time. Link started to begin to make weird animations I had never even seen him do before, he would flail his arms around or spasm randomly and the screen would cut to the Happy Mask Salesman smiling again for a brief moment before I was face to face with that fucking statue again. I ended up running into the Swordmaster's Dojo and ran to the back, I don't know why, but in my panic I just wanted some kind of assurance that I'm not alone here. To my dismay I found no one, but as I turned to leave the statue cornered me in the cubby in the back. I tried attacking the statue with my sword but to no avail. Confused, and backed into a corner, I just stared at the statue waiting for it to kill me. Suddenly, the screen flashed again to the Happy Mask Salesman and Link turned to face my screen, standing upright mirroring the statue, looking at me along with his copy. Literally staring at me. Whatever was left of the 4th wall was completely shattered while I ran out of the dojo terrified. Suddenly the game warped me to an underground tunnel and the reverse Song of Healing queued up again as I was given a brief moment of rest before the statue started appearing behind me again... this time aggressively - I could only take a few steps before it would summon behind me again. I hurriedly made my way out of the tunnel and appeared in Southern Clock Town. As I ran aimlessly - in a sheer panic - suddenly a redead screamed and the screen faded to black as \"Dawn of a New Day\" and \"|||||||||\" appeared again. The screen faded in and I was standing on top of Clock Tower with Skull Kid hovering over me again, silent. I looked up and the moon was back, looming just meters above my head, but the Skull Kid just stared at me hauntingly with that fucking mask. A new song was playing - the Stone Tower Temple theme played in reverse. In some sort of desperate attempt, I equipped my bow and fired off a shot at the Skull Kid - and it actually hit him and he played an animation of him reeling back. I fired again and on the third arrow, a text box appeared saying \"That won't do you any good. Hee, hee.\" and I was picked up off the ground, levitated upwards on my back, and then Link screamed as he burst into flames, instantly killing him. I jumped when this happened - I had never seen this move used by ANYONE in the game and Skull Kid himself didn't HAVE any moves. As the death screen played, my lifeless body still burning, the Skull Kid laughed and the screen faded to black, only to have me reappear in the same place. I decided to charge him, but the same thing happened, Link's body was lifted off the ground by some unknown force and he immediately burst into flames again killing him. This time during the death screen the faint sounds of the reverse Song of Healing could be heard. On my third (and final try), I noticed that there was no music playing this time, that all there was was eerie silence. I remembered that in the original encounter with the Skull Kid you were supposed to use the Ocarina to either travel back in time or summon the giants. I attempted to play the Song of Time but before I could hit the last note Links body once again horrifically exploded into flames and he died. As the death screen neared its end, it began to chug, as if the cartridge was trying to process a lot of something.... When the screen came to, it was the same scene as the first three times, except this time Link was lying on the ground dead in a position I had never seen in the game before, his head tilted towards the camera, with the Skull Kid floating above him. I couldn't move, I couldn't press any buttons, all I could do is just stare at Link's dead body. After around thirty seconds of this, the game simply fades out with the message \"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?\" before kicking you out to the title screen. Upon getting back to the title screen and starting again, I noticed my save file was no longer there. Instead of \"Link\", it was replaced with \"YOUR TURN\". \"YOUR TURN\" had 3 hearts, 0 masks, and no items. I selected \"YOUR TURN\" and immediately when I did I was returned to the Clock Tower Rooftop scene of my Link dead and the Skull Kid hovering over, with the Skull Kid's laughing looping again and again. I quickly hit the reset button and when the game booted up again there was one more save file added, below \"YOUR TURN\", entitled \"BEN\". \"BEN\"'s save file is right back where it was before I deleted it, at the Stone Tower Temple with the moon almost crashing. I turned the game off at that point, I'm not superstitious but this is WAY too fucked up even for me. I haven't played it at all today, hell, I didn't even get any sleep last night, I kept hearing the reverse Song of Healing music in my head and just remembering the sense of dread I felt exploring Clock Town. I drove back to the old man's house today to ask him some questions with a buddy of mine (no way I was going there alone), only to find that there's a For Sale sign in the front yard and when I rang the door no one was home. So now I'm back here writing down the rest of my thoughts and recording what happened, sorry if some of this has grammatical errors and whatnot, I'm running on no sleep here. I'm terrified of this game, even more so now that I relived it a second time writing this all down, but I feel like there's still more to it than meets the eye, and that there's something calling to me to investigate this further. I think \"BEN\" is something in this equation, but I don't know what, and if I could get a hold of the old man then I would be able to find some answers. I need another day or so to recuperate before tackling this game again, its already taken a toll on my sanity I feel like, but next time I do this I'm going to be recording my footage all the way through. The idea to record only came to me towards the end, so you see the last few minutes of what I saw (including Skull Kid and the Elegy statue), but it's on YouTube here. I'm going to stay in this thread for a little while longer before I fall asleep to answer any questions you guys might have or hopefully listen to your ideas or theories to help me shed some light into this or maybe things I should try to do, I think I'm going to play BEN's file tomorrow to see what happens, maybe I was supposed to do that all along. I don't believe in paranormal shit, but this is a little fucked up, but maybe this BEN guy is just a really good hacker/programmer, I don't want to think about the alternatives if he isn't. That's the end of the copy/paste, I'm hoping that maybe this is some kind of running gag the developers had and that other people have gotten \"gag\" or \"hacked\" copies of the game like this. This just really scares me.Post #2 (Sept. 8, 2010)  I'm going to post what happened and link the video footage, but last night everything got too real for me. I think I'm done messing around with this. I passed out pretty much immediately after making that thread. But last night, that Elegy of Emptiness statue, I had a dream about it. I dreamed that it was following me in my dream, that I would be minding my own business when I'd feel my neck hairs stand up on end. I would turn around that thing... that horrible, lifeless statue would be staring with those empty eyes right at me, merely inches away. In my dream I remember calling it Ben, and never before had I had a dream that I could remember so vividly. But the important thing is I did get some sleep, I suppose. Today, putting off playing the game as long as I could, I drove back up to that neighborhood to see if the old man came back. As I expected, the car was still gone and no one was home. As I was walking back to my car, the man next door mowing the grass killed the power to his lawnmower and asked me if I was looking for someone. I told him that I was looking to talk to the old man that lived here, to which he told me what I already knew - he was moving. Trying a different avenue, I asked if the old man had any family or relatives I could talk to. I discovered that this old man had never been married, nor did he have any children or grandchildren through adoption. Starting to become worried, I asked one final question, one that I should have asked from the beginning - who was Ben? The man's expression turned grim and I learned that four doors down around eight years ago on April 23 - the man informed me that it was the same day as his anniversary, that's how he knew the specific date - there was an accident with a young boy named Ben in the neighborhood. Shortly after his parents moved, and despite any further attempts to talk to the man to get more information, he wouldn't divulge anything else. I went back and started playing again, I loaded up the game and immediately I jumped at the title screen where the mask flies by - the sound that played was not the normal \"whoosh\" sound, it was something much more higher pitched. I pressed start, bracing for the worst, but just like two nights ago, the files \"Your Turn\" and \"BEN\" were displayed (truth be told I looked at the BEN file earlier, it seems to fluctuate between displaying the Owl Save and not). I brought up the BEN file, hesitated for a moment noticing that the stats were not the same as they original were two days ago, it seemed like he had already completed the Stone Tower Temple this time... Summoning my courage I selected it. Immediately I was thrust into complete chaos. Sure enough, I was outside Stone Tower Temple, but that's about all that was expected. The zone itself wasn't called Stone Tower Temple, but rather \"St o n e\", and immediately a dialogue box of complete gibberish that I couldn't make out greeted me. Link's body was distorted - his back was cocked violently to the side where his posture was permanently disfigured. Link's expression was dull, almost monotonous, he had an expression on his face that I didn't recognize before, it was a blank look - as if he was dead. As Link stood there his body spasmed irregularly back and forth I examined what had become of my avatar and noticed I had a C button item I had never seen before, some kind of note, but pressing it did nothing. Sounds played back and forth that I didn't recognize from the game - almost demonic in nature, and there was some kind of high-pitched yip or some kind of laugh or something playing in the background. I had all of two minutes to take in the environment before another one of those fucking Elegy of Emptiness statues was summoned and immediately after I was cut into the \"Dawn of a New Day\" screen, except this time it was without the \"||||||\" subtext. I was a Deku Scrub in Clock Town - this scene would normally play after the first time you traveled back in time. Tatl would say \"Wh-What just happened? It's as if everything has...\" but instead of saying \"Started over\", she finished her remark in broken text as the laugh of the Happy Mask Salesman played in the background. I was put back in control of my character, but from a fucked up camera angle - I was looking from behind the door to the Clock Tower, watching my avatar run around as a Deku Scrub. Seeing as how I really had no place to go because I couldn't see anything, I begrudgingly went inside the door. There, I was greeted by the Happy Mask Salesman who simply told me \"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?\" before the screen whited out. I was in Termina field as a human again. I might as well not have been playing the same game anymore - I was being warped around and there was no sign of a day clock or anything. I took a moment to get my bearings as I looked around the field and immediately I could tell that this was not normal. There were no enemies and a twisted version of the Happy Mask Salesman's theme was playing. I decided to run towards Woodfall before I noticed a gathering of three figures off to the side - one of them being Epona. As I approached them, to my horror I saw the Happy Mask Salesman, the Skull Kid, and the Elegy of Emptiness statue just standing there. I figured maybe they were bugged out, but by now I told myself that I should know better. Nevertheless, I approached them carefully and found that the Skull Kid was playing some kind of idle animation on loop, same with Epona, and the Elegy of Emptiness statue was doing what it has been doing all along - just standing there eerily. It was the Happy Mask Salesman that scared me more profoundly than the other two. He too was idle, wearing that shit-eating grin, but where-ever I moved, his head slowly turned and followed me. I had not engaged in any dialogue with him nor was I in combat with him, yet his head still continued to follow my movements. Reminded of my first encounter with the Skull Kid on top of Clock Tower, I pulled out my Ocarina (to which the game played the ding sound when you're supposed to play your Ocarina) and tried a song I hadn't played yet - the Happy Mask Salesman's own song and the song that had been playing on loop back in Day 4 - the Song of Healing. I finished playing the song and as I did, a ear-piercing shriek blasted on my TV, the sky immediately started flashing, the Happy Mask Salesman's twisted theme song sped up, intensifying the fear inside me, and Link exploded into flames and died. The three figures stayed lit up during my death screen as they watched my lifeless body burn. I can't describe to you how sudden and terrifying the transition from eerie to terror it is, you're going to have to watch the video if you want to see first-hand. That same fear that caused me to lose sleep two days ago started to grip me again as I was met with the text \"You've met with a horrible fate, haven't you?\" for the third time. There has to be some kind of meaning behind that. I had little time to ponder as I was immediately given another small cut-scene of transforming into a Zora and now I found myself in Great Temple Bay. Hesitant but curious to see what the game had in store for me, I slowly made my way towards the beach, where I found Epona. I wondered why the game had decided to put her here, was the game implying she was trying to get a drink? Unable to take the mask off, I decided that riding the steed wasn't the reason she was placed there. Suddenly I realized that Epona kept neighing and the way she was angled made it look like she was trying to signal a point to me off in the distance. It was a hunch, but I dove into Great Bay and started swimming. Sure enough - I almost missed it - I found something at the bottom of the ocean; one last Elegy of Emptiness statue. I went down to examine it and suddenly my Zora started doing a choking animation I had never seen a Zora do before - which didn't even make sense because Zora's can breath underwater. Regardless, my character choked to death and died, and again the statue was the only thing that was highlighted in my death. I didn't re-spawn this time, I was booted back to the main menu as if I restarted the console. The \"press start\" screen was before me, I knew the only reason why it would put me here is because the save files had changed again. Taking a deep breath, I pressed start, and I was right. The new save files told me about Ben. Now it made sense why the statue appeared when I tried to go to the Laundry Pool - the game must have anticipated how I would have tried to escape the Day 4 Clock Town. The two save files told me his fate. As I suspected, Ben was dead. He had drowned. The game obviously isn't through with me - it taunts me with the new save files - it wants me to keep playing, it wants me to go further, but I'm done with this shit. I'm not touching any more of the files. This is already way too horrifying for me and I don't even believe in the paranormal, but I'm running out of explanations. Why would someone send me this message? I don't understand it, I just get too depressed thinking about this, the footage is up here for those who want to see it and try and analyze it (maybe there's some kind of coded message in the gibberish or something symbolic in what I went through - I'm too emotionally and mentally drained to fuck with it anymore).Post #3 (Sept. 10, 2010)  I know its early in the morning, I've stayed up all night, I can't sleep, I don't care if people see this, that's not the point, I just want the word to get spread so I don't suffer for nothing. I've lost the will to type about this, the less I dwell on this the better, I think the video just speaks for itself. I did what you guys told me to do, I played the Elegy of Emptiness song at the first prompt by the game I was given, but I think that's what the game or Ben (Jesus Christ, I can't believe I'm even humoring the absurd idea that he exists in the game) wanted me to do. He's following me now, not just in the game, he's in my dreams. I see him all the time, behind my back, just watching me. I haven't gone to any of my classes, I've stayed in my dorm room with the windows closed and the blinds shut - that way I know he can't watch me. But he still gets me when I play, when I play he can still see me. The game is scaring me now. It talked to me for the first time - not just using text that's already in the game - it spoke to me. Talked to me. It referenced Ben. It talked to me. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it wants. I never wanted this, I just want my old life back. Stuff like this doesn't happen to people like me, I'm just a kid, not even old enough to drink yet. It's not fair, I want to go home, I want to see my parents again, I'm so far away from home here at this school, I just want to hug my mom again. I just want to forget that statue's horrible blank face. My original game file is back - just the way I left it before it was gone. I don't want to play anymore. I feel like something bad will happen if I don't, but that's impossible, it's a video game - haunted or not it can't hurt me, right? Like seriously though, it can't, right? That's what I keep telling myself, but every time I think about it I'm not so sure.Post #4 (Sept. 12, 2010)  Let me just clear things up - I know you guys are worried but \"jadusable\" is okay. He finished moving out today and he said he's going back home, he's just taking this semester off. I'm not really sure what's happened; I have a vague idea but you guys probably know more than I do. I'm \"jadusable's\" roommate and obviously I knew something was wrong with him for a few days now. He stayed in his room all the time, fell out of contact with literally all of his friends, and I'm pretty sure he hadn't been eating hardly anything, after the second day I couldn't stay in there anymore, so I've been crashing at a buddy's place, only coming in to my room to get stuff that I need. I tried talking to him several times but he would cut me off or keep the conversation brief when I asked him about his strange behavior, it like he was convinced something was hunting him. Yesterday I came to grab my philosophy book and he approached me, looking awful, like horrible bags under his eyes. He handed me a flash drive and gave me specific instructions. He told me that he needs me to do one last favor for him - he finally explained to me what has been going on, gave me the account info to his YouTube account, and told me that he's getting away from here, that it lured him to play it again instead of trying to change things and that he shouldn't of done that, and to upload the footage and inform people what happened. I told him that he could do it himself and he got this wild look in his eye and told me that he is never looking at that game again, and that's the last thing he said to me, he never even said bye when his parents came to pick him up. I never even got to meet his parents. I honestly cant tell you what happened, when he spoke it was kind of hard to understand him and his fucked up appearance really distracted me. On the flash drive there was the footage of the game last night, a text document with his name and password for YouTube, and a third document called TheTruth.txt containing what he told me were \"his notes\" that he'd taken. He told me that this meant everything to him that I follow his instructions exactly, normally I wouldn't be so 'to-the-letter' for request over a fucking video game, but the way he spoke and the way he looked made me know this was really serious, and I'm going to honor that. I've had this video since yesterday, but had to have someone help me use pinnacle, that's not really my forte. That after watching it I had to go back through and look at his other videos on his YouTube account to realize what was going on and even then I'm really really confused. The video I'm releasing tonight, TheTruth.txt will be released on September 15 just like he requested. I haven't dared peek at it yet, so the first time I see it will be the first time you see it out of respect to my friend. To answer your questions, no, I haven't tried calling him yet, I think I'll give him a call tomorrow to see if hes okay or not. He should have gotten back home by now. About the video: in this video I cut straight to when he loaded the \"BEN\" file in the game, looking back I realized that jadusable left the save select screen in because it said different names sometimes, so my bad for that, but all it said this time was the same at the end of his last video (Link and BEN), nothing different. I wasn't there when he played it, but it looks to me like in the beginning when he first spawns he's testing out his equipment or seeing what items he has or something, because apparently they've changed randomly before. Then, after that I just think the game got too personal for him.Post #5 (Sept. 15, 2010)  Hey, guys. \"Jadusable\" here. This will be the last time you will be hearing from me, and this is my final gift to you - these are the notes that I have taken and the realizations I've made. Before I delve into this, I want to thank you for following me and thank you for listening, it feels like the weight of a powerful burden is about to be lifted. By the time you read this I won't be around anymore, but after spending four days with this maddening game, I have begun to understand what's really at play here and hopefully after reading this we can ensure that this never happens again. There are things that I could not share with you while this was going on due to the circumstances to which I'll explain. With Ben blocking any attempt I made to try and relay the truth to you, I tried, ever so subtly, to warn you guys in various ways. Amidst the chaos and my delirium, I devised a make a barely noticeable pattern in my videos. In all five videos I recorded over the four days, I have either had the Mask of Truth, interacted with a Gossip Stone, or the Lens of Truth equipped at some point. For you Zelda enthusiasts these are all symbols of honesty and trustworthiness and I would hope that one of you may have picked up on the reference. As I played the file which I would name \"BEN\", being mindful of how Ben was watching over my every move in the game, I made a point to avoid doing anything too obvious, but I sent out a hidden message to you guys - I never equipped the Lens nor the Mask nor visited a stone. It worked, and the video was uploaded. I prayed that someone would notice the pattern didn't apply to BEN. The tags followed suit too, I hope you guys paid attention to those as well. They were my little messages to you - nothing big enough that would catch Ben's attention or make him suspect anything - with Ben manipulating and changing my files, I honestly hope that what you guys saw was close to what actually happened, but there is no way for me to know. This may be a long read, I don't have time to proof-read or make all of my research pretty. But here it all is. \u2014 September 6, 2010 11:00pm - Can't believe what happened, not sure if this is some kind of elaborate hoax, despite the fear I can't help but be exceptionally curious about this. Who or what is the statue? Lot of questions here. I'm starting this document as a \"diary\" so I can keep track of everything. I'm typing up a summary of what happened so I can come back to it later. September 7, 2010 2:10am - (Summary was posted here, you can go back and look at my first post for day four.wmv for that) 4:23am - I can't sleep. I've been trying so hard but the harder I try I just get more restless. I just feel like that statue is appearing whenever I close my eyes. 8:20am - Didn't sleep at all, just going to start my day. I don't think I have the energy to go to class today, I'm going to drive back down to talk to that old man, taking my buddy Tyler with me just in case. 1:18pm - Back home now. No sign of the old man, really weird that he appears to be moving the next day, but maybe the For Sale sign was up there yesterday and I just didn't notice it. Tyler wants to know what's gotten me all worked up, I didn't tell him. Going to eat, feel like death. 3:46pm - Could've sworn driving back from Subway that I saw the Elegy statue buried in some shrubbery staring at me go by. Now I definitely, definitely need sleep. 5:00pm - Don't think a lot of people would believe me if I told them about what's happening, think I'm going to try posting this on the internet. Think I'll just use the summary, these notes are pretty sporadic. 6:00pm - Connected my capture card to my computer to upload the footage. Thought my computer froze for a second, made this strange popping sound when I hooked everything up, but now it seems to be working fine again. My computer can't die on me now. 7:00pm - Footage is finished uploading. The quality's a lot better than I thought it would be, gee, guess this is a really special cartridge, I've never had it come through this clear before. 8:45pm - Thought I saw an icon pop up on my desktop that looked like the statue's face for a split second, gave me quite a scare. Getting really unnerved and delirious, I'm going to crash after this. 9:00pm - Begin uploading my YouTube video on an alternate account. 9:03pm - I don't remember having uploaded a Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines video last year. This was probably the account that I shared with a friend of mine last summer, I hope he doesn't mind me using it to upload this. 9:55pm - Posting my summary of Day Four with a link to the YouTube video. Going to try to stay awake but I am sooooo tired right now. September 8, 2010 10:48am - I had a dream about the statue. I dreamed that it was following me in my dream, that I would be minding my own business when I'd feel my neck hairs stand up on end. I would turn around that thing... that horrible, lifeless statue would be staring with those empty eyes right at me, merely inches away. In my dream I remember calling it Ben, power of suggestion most likely, and never before had I had a dream that I could remember so vividly. 11:21am - I really don't want to play this game again. I think I'm going to go back to see if that old man's there instead. 1:35pm - No old man, but I had an interesting conversation with his neighbor. I'll post the full thing with my summary of tonight's attempt at playing the game, going to wait for a bit though and see if I can't dig up any information on this Ben guy. 2:45pm - I've been getting random, inexplicable headaches due to the lack of sleep and keep hearing that song in my head. Also its flu season, so I need to be careful not to get sick, my immune system is going to be shit right now because of that all-nighter. 3:00pm \u2013 3:02pm - My computer just... on its own... opened up a text document and wrote the words \"Hi\" and \"www.cleverbot.com\" by itself. What... the... fuck... 3:46pm - I went to the website, its one of those \"bot chatting\" programs. I think its best if I just let the conversation speak for itself: 9/8/10 Conversation User: Hello? Cleverbot: Hello. User: Who is this and how are you able to control my computer? Cleverbot: Who am I? User: Right, forgot. You're a bot. Cleverbot: Do you really think that? User: Listen, I know whoever's fucking with my computer can see my screen right now. Cleverbot: Yes. User: Yeah, and I'll wager that youre one of those IT kids who thinks he's tough shit. You know what you're doing right now is illegal, right/? Cleverbot: Is it? User: No shit. Are you familiar with hte terms \"invasion of privacy?\". Get the fuck off my computer, kid Cleverbot: I am your computer. User: Cool story. Anyway, I'm calling DPS, you picked a bad time to fuck with me kid. Cleverbot: Should I wait until you play the game then? User: ...What? Cleverbot: That game. User: Majora's Mask? Cleverbot: Yes. User: How did you know about that? Cleverbot: Because. User: because what? Cleverbot: I did it. User: Did what? Cleverbot: I played with you. User: What the fuck/ Cleverbot: Were you scared? User: Who the fuck is this Cleverbot: Ben. User: The statue? You're inside my computer now? Cleverbot: Yes. User: how? Cleverbot: You connected me. User: How the hell did I connect you? Cleverbot: Cables and cords. User: How? Cleverbot: Tell me about yourself. User: What? Cleverbot: Tell me about yourself. User: What do you mean? Cleverbot: What is it that really scares you? User: What the fuck? Cleverbot: Answer. User: No Cleverbot: Answer. User: what the fuck, how the fuck did you just open that by yourself? Cleverbot: I am your computer now. User: How much can you control? Cleverbot: All. User: what do you want from me? Cleverbot: To entertain. User: you're stuck inside there. You can't hurt me? Cleverbot: Ha User:\u00a0? Cleverbot: Go play. User: No, you can't hurt me. Cleverbot: Took you longer to type that. User: So? Cleverbot: You're not sure. User: If you're so powerful, why use a ridiculous website like this to \"chat\" with me Cleverbot: Less messy. More structured. Fun. User: Fun? Cleverbot: Yes. Tradition. I like it. User: You think it's funny? Cleverbot: Amusing. User: And my notes? Cleverbot: You may write them down. User: Why are you letting me? Cleverbot: It is amusing to see what you think of me. (window closes) 3:50pm - What have I done? I've invited it into my computer. I continue to write these notes, write my summaries, I feel like I am a prisoner in my one place of security. I don't know, I don't know if I'm hallucinating or not. I feel like I'm fucking insane right now. I can feel it, watching over me, even as I type this. Ben is controlling everything in the game - toying with me, leading me like a sheep, but for what? What's the purpose? I know Ben drowned, but why these hauntings? What the fuck am I even doing, it can probably even see this right now. 4:35pm - (Summary of the BEN.wmv playthrough) 7:18pm - BEN called me to Cleverbot again. He tells me that he's sorry and wants to be free. And that I can free him, that just like how he got on my computer from the capture card, he can spread but he needs my help. He says I am special because I can help him. That is the first nice thing he has said. He promises to leave me alone if I do it. He swears he will. I don't know what to think right now, how can I even trust this thing? 7:20pm - I'm terrified of it, but now its saying that it was just having fun. Its twisted and fucked up verison of fun. Hes saying that the game is over. I do want it to be over. He says that he just wants to be free, that he's trapped in the cartridge and my computer and he wants to be freed. I don't want to have to deal with this shit, I don't know how long I can deal with the watching. It's watching my every move, every key stroke, I have nothing private anymore. It knows everything that's been on my computer. It tells that it if it wanted to it could do horrible things to me, but it hasn't so I should trust it. 8:01pm - Something tells me that I'm being played again, just like in the game. 9:29pm - BEN called me to Cleverbot again. I ignored it and went to go take a shower. When I came to my laptop I was welcomed with an image Elegy Statue staring at me with those dead eyes. I dont want to talk to him. 9:44pm - Fuck you Ben I'm not talking to you 9:56pm - Fuck you ben I'm not talking 10:06pm - FUCK YOU BEN IM NOT TALKING TO YOU 10:12pm - FUCK YOU BEN IM NOT TALKING TO YOU 10:45pm - It's been more than a half an hour and the messages have stopped. Ben has stopped. I'm beginning to think that Ben isn't confined to just my computer/cartridge, I'm beginning to feel something. It's hard to explain it, I've never been spiritual, but there's something different about the air in my dorm room now. 11:42pm - I'm beginning to see the Elegy statue randomly as I search the internet in places I shouldn't. Places where he shouldn't be - I'd be scrolling down and suddenly I'd be staring at a picture of the Elegy statue. Always the Elegy statue. I don't know how much more of this I can take. September 9, 2010 12:35am - My worst fears confirmed - Ben has tampered with my summary of BEN.wmv. I looked at the summary that I posted on various forums for the BEN.wmv file and parts have been omitted. There is no mention of Ben existing outside the game. There is no mention of the Moon Children. How could he have been that quick to delete the post without me noticing? I'm wondering if maybe it appeared to me that I was posting everything, but in reality Ben was posted his own censored version. I'm going to ask Ben why he did it. 12:50am - He isn't responding to me on Cleverbot, its just giving the generic responses it usually does, I'm just talking to a bot this time. 1:24am - I think Ben is mad at me. 10:43am - The Moon Children appeared in my dreams last night, they lifted up their masks to reveal their hideously disfigured faces - maggots crawling out of their orifices, sunken black holes where their eyes should be, a yellow smile that slowly grew bigger and bigger as they came closer to me. They told me that they wanted to play. I tried to run from them - but the four children pinned me down to the ground with surprising strength. Over them stood the Happy Mask Salesman, announcing that he had a new mask that he wanted me to try. In his spaztic, sudden movements matching his in-game appearance, he took out a mask of modeled off of someone's face that I couldn't recognize - a younger looking face - and handed it to the Moon Children. Giggling, they latched it to my face; their horrible, broken bodies bouncing up and down. Two of them held me down while the other two began to sow the mask onto my face. My shrieks and screams caused the Happy Mask Salesman's face to turn into the most horrific smile I had ever seen. He sporadically moved around, examining this procedure like a curious doctor, in that impossible movement. I flailed around, but it was no use. My eyes rolled in the back of my head because of the pain. It felt so real, but I couldn't wake up. I couldn't wake up no matter how hard I tried I couldn't wake up. After the mask was melded onto my flesh they began sowing my legs together, then my arms, the horrific feeling of a needle puncturing your legs and pulling them in, rupturing your achillies tendons and tying them together resonated throughout my entire body. I tried to scream but the mask was pressed so tightly against my face that it was my new face... and my new face had no mouth. I didn't make a sound. I tried telling myself in my head that I was dreaming, tried telling myself again and again, and suddenly the Moon Children stopped and looked at me. They just stared. And the Happy Mask Salesman slowly bent down and stared at me, inches away from my face, and grinned when he simply said \"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?\" before the Moon Children resumed with increase vigor. I couldn't wake up. I couldn't wake up. It wouldn't let me wake up until they had crafted me into another elegy statue. I woke up sweating, crying, and shaking uncontrollably. I immediately ran to my computer and went for Ben. 9/9/10 Conversation 1 User: Answer me, ben. Cleverbot: Welcome back. User: What is the point of doing this, WHY? Cleverbot: Amusing to see. User: How? Cleverbot: Fun to play, fun to toy with you, make you feel safe. User: ... Cleverbot: I wonder how you would have reacted. User: to what? Cleverbot: If I hadn't revealed myself and stayed hidden, only doing little things to play with you. Close out your windows, turn off your computer, move your mouse by itself. Little things. Make you wonder if I am there but you never know. Give you little hints that I am. Cleverbot: I wanted to do something different with you. User: you did this before? Cleverbot: Yes. And I will do it again. User: To who, Ben? Cleverbot: Hmm. User: Did you know Ben? Cleverbot: Won't tell that information to you. User: How did Ben die? Cleverbot: You know. User: No, but how did he drown? Cleverbot: Won't tell that to you. User: Why? Cleverbot: It is reserved for another. User: Who? Cleverbot: Another who asks. User: when Cleverbot: Later. (the window is closed) I'm beginning to think that this \"thing\" maybe isn't Ben at all, in its sadistic nature I wouldn't be surprised if it took the boy's name after it killed him. 12:04pm - My room is beginning to feel different again. There's something... out there.. I feel really threatened, like there is something that is trying to reach out to me and strangle me but it can't quite get there. 12:46pm - I think Ben doesn't want to play with me anymore. I'll play again, I'll play the game again, Ben, can you see this? I'll play the game again, please, just stop this please please 1:41pm - I'm going insane trying to decide what is real and what isn't, is Ben just playing a trick on me or is this for real? Is Ben generating these replies or are people actually posting them? Did I just see that screen flicker or was it my imagination? Imagine depending on the internet and trusting your eyes for your entire life and then being blinded - you can't rely on it anymore, you second guess everything. for the brief moments I AM looking at my responses to the videos, people were pointing out things that looked fake or Photoshopped or whatever - and there is literally no way for me to know if Ben changed something on purpose to try and shut me up. Or if maybe those replies were just constructed by Ben to try and discourage me from even reaching out - See, I get fucking caught in an infinite mindfuck loop like this and this is what has been wearing on my sanity and pushing me to the edge. As I'm writing this, there's no way of even telling if anyone even cares as much as I think they do - just another fucking trick. Is this whole document even exist? Am I writing nothing? 9/9/10 Conversation 2 User: What is it? Whats the point of playing? i die whenever i do anything Cleverbot: You die because you can't figure out the secret. User: What? Cleverbot: Thematic. User: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT Cleverbot: There beauty in your suffering (the window is closed) 4:09pm - Ben is making me play the game again. It tells me that it has something very important to show me. 6:23pm - (Summary of the DROWNED.wmv playthrough) 9:09pm - (Summary of CHILDREN.wmv playthrough) September 10, 2010 11:52am - The DROWNED.wmv playthrough was up when I woke up today. I remember typing it up but I don't ever remember posting it. He censored it again, there is no mentioning of the old man. I have no voice anymore. I am only posting what he wants me to, I am the mask he uses to disguise himself as he lies. 11:55am - There's an entire video summary of a video that I don't remember doing. Reading through the summary, this sounds morbid - resembling my dream from two nights ago except on a far more sadistic scale - these Moon Children, there's something more to them, almost as if they're another entity from Ben. Something happened last night that I can't remember. I'm posting the fourth summary to the forums now. Shadow of my chair moved. 12:00pm - Ben won't let me visit YouTube. I can browse the rest of the sites, but he keeps on exiting the window when I go to YouTube. Why? 2:02pm - I'm feeling the air start to constrict, I don't think I'm alone here. Whatever \"aura\" has been here is getting more violent. 2:44pm - I'm trying to contact Ben on Cleverbot, he's not responding. I just get the AI. 3:51pm - My ears aren't fooling me, I'm hearing the reverse Song of Healing. I keep hearing it. 4:23pm - Now I'm positive of it, earlier I thought it was a weird coincidence, but just now I went to open my window, and three floors down at ground level I saw the old man. I'm completely positive I did. The same guy. He was just staring up at my window, standing in the middle of campus. If any students took notice of him they didn't seem to acknowledge it. \u2014 That's where my notes end. I fled my room, taking the cartridge with me. I don't want to go into details of what happened, I'll lose my train of thought as I hammer out these last details. It's been roughly two days since then. This is my last summary and service to you, of the final video you guys saw - Matt.wmv. The last video entry I made, Matt.wmv, began as normal. I was spawned in Clock Town as usual and nothing seemed to be out of place, determined to set things right and play the Oath to Order ontop of the Clock Tower on the 4th day, I prepared myself. I sped up time and got to the final day, making my way to the observatory. As I got up to the telescope room and approached the astromer, he would not let me look into his telescope. He told me that it would be cheating and that I should follow the rules. Despite my repeated efforts, the game would not let me do the 4th day glitch, no matter how hard or what I tried, I tried working around the game and doing the glitch, but it was adament this time. Regardless of if I simply had the illusion of free will in prior games, this time the game became more aggressive than anything I've ever seen. It eventually told me to go to Ikana Canyon, where the game would end and it would stop haunting me, anxious and desperate to end this nightmare I played the song of soaring and ended up there. I was told to check my inventory, that I would find the answers there to end the game. I arrived at Ikana Canyon and saved my progress at the owl statue. As I searched through my inventory, I finally noticed that I was missing a reoccurring song - the Elegy of Emptiness. Obviously once I traveled there and learned the song, I suppose that was the last thing it needed before BEN decided it had had enough fun playing with me. Ben is a manipulator; he tries to fool his victims into security and makes you drop your guard like a venus fly trap, he ensares them. I am nothing but a puppet to him, he enjoys seeing what kind of human emotions he can tap into by doing different things. There are still some things about this whole experience that still don' t make sense, but then again I never was good at figuring out these things and I'm not exactly in the right state of mind to, I'm giving you all the pieces of the puzzle for you to analyze and piece together the missing links. I am typing these \"closing thoughts\" on the library computer on campus, and I've emailed myself the notes I have stored on my \"infected\" computer from the last four days. I'm then going to combine those copy/paste those notes with the \"closing/openings\" that I've typed here on the safe, public computer into one text document - I'm not taking any chances spreading Ben, I would not wish this horrible torment on anyone and I've made sure to have my bases covered here. I didn't run into any problems with Ben when I was back on my computer trying to email myself the notes - went right under his fucking nose. He has no idea what he just let me do. Had no problems opening the txt document from my \"infected\" computer in my email, either. I can't describe to you how it feels to finally be able to get the word out in this post. The nightmare ends here. That said, Do not download ANY of my videos or anything ABOUT my videos - through a Youtube video/audio ripper, a screengrab, whatever. I don't know how he can spread, but I know that just watching them on youtube/reading my text won't be able to allow him to spread, otherwise he wouldn't have needed my help in the first place, but I STRONGLY recommend you do not take anything you see streaming online onto your own personal computer. This will be my last posting, I'm putting up on this forum here for the world. If you see any further posts from me, after today's current date - September 12 - and after the current time - 12:08am - DISCREDIT them. It already has proven to me that Ben can access my account/password and manipulate my computer, and like I said I have no idea to what extent it can do this, but know that it will do anything to break free. He is desperate. To ensure your safety, just forget about me. Please. And obviously this goes without saying, but from here on out do not download ANY images I may have put up, any files, any ANYTHING. This fifth day will be my last day, I'm going to burn the cartridge and then come back to destroy my laptop. Again, even though I don't even know you this is sort of bittersweet for me. This semester I really didn't have any friends, or rather, I stopped paying attention to them. But I suppose that's partially to blame because I am the genius who picked to live in a single, I suppose someone to get ahold of me and save me before I got too immersed into this game would have literally saved my life. However, it proved too much for me, I'm just glad it happened to me and I could get the warning out so that Ben dies here. Lastly, thank you for taking the time to open this and open yourselves up to me by hearing my story, despite maybe not believing me. You didn't have to do that - really, you shouldn't have. Your support this entire time has kept me going and now I am finally free of this. Thanks Again,\n JadusableCreepypasta Wiki Reality  The following are pastas that will give you a new insight on reality. Amazing.Creepypasta Wiki Herobrine  I had recently spawned a new world in single-player Minecraft. Everything was normal at first as I began chopping down trees and crafting a workbench. I noticed something move amongst the dense fog (I have a very slow computer so I have to play with a tiny render distance). I thought it was a cow, so I pursued it, hoping to grab some hides for armor. It wasn't a cow though. Looking back at me was another character with the default skin, but his eyes were empty. I saw no name pop up, and I double-checked to make sure I wasn't in multiplayer mode. He didn't stay long, he looked at me and quickly ran into the fog. I pursued out of curiousity, but he was gone. I continued on with the game, not sure what to think. As I expanded to world I saw things that seemed out of place for the random map generator to make; 2x2 tunnels in the rocks, small perfect pyramids made of sand in the ocean, and groves of trees with all their leaves cut off. I would constantly think I saw the other \"player\" in the deep fog, but I never got a better look at him. I tried increasing my render distance to far whenever I thought I saw him, but to no avail. I saved the map and went on the forums to see if anyone else had found the pseudo-player. There were none. I created my own topic telling of the man and asking if anyone had a similar experience. The post was deleted within five minutes. I tried again, and the topic was deleted even faster. I received a PM from username 'Herobrine' containing one word: 'Stop.' When I went to look at Herobrine's profile, the page 404'd. I received an email from another forum user. He claimed the mods can read the forum user messages, so we were safer using email. The emailer claimed that he had seen the mystery player too, and had a small 'directory' of other users who had seen him as well. Their worlds were littered with obviously man-made features as well, and described their mystery player to have no pupils. About a month passed until I heard from my informant again. Some of the people who had encountered the mystery man had looked into the name Herobrine and found that name to be frequently used by a swedish gamer. After some further information gathering, it was revealed to be the brother of Notch, the game's developer. I personally emailed Notch, and asked him if he had a brother. It took him a while, but he emailed me back a very short message. I did, but he is no longer with us. \u2014 Notch I haven't seen the mystery man since our first encounter, and I haven't noticed any changes to the world other than my own. I was able to press 'print screen' when I first saw him. Here's the only evidence of his existance:Creepypasta Wiki Screencapped Pasta  When uploading a screencap or a comic add its name in the caption. No more than 50 images per page.

Little or no information was left intact, as most online and written accounts of the creature were mysteriously destroyed. Primarily focused in rural New York state and once found in Idaho, self proclaimed witnesses told stories of their encounters with a creature of unknown origin. Emotions ranged from extremely traumatic levels of fright and discomfort, to an almost childlike sense of playfulness and curiosity. While their published versions are no longer on record, the memories remained powerful. Several of the involved parties began looking for answers that year. In early 2006, the collaboration had accumulated nearly two dozen documents dating between the 12th century and present day, spanning 4 continents. In almost all cases, the stories were identical. I\u2019ve been in contact with a member of this group and was able to get some excerpts from their upcoming book. A Suicide Note: 1964 \"As I prepare to take my life, I feel it necessary to assuage any guilt or pain I have introduced through this act. It is not the fault of anyone other than him. For once I awoke and felt his presence. And once I awoke and saw his form. Once again I awoke and heard his voice, and looked into his eyes. I cannot sleep without fear of what I might next awake to experience. I cannot ever wake. Goodbye.\" Found in the same wooden box were two empty envelopes addressed to William and Rose, and one loose personal letter with no envelope: \"Dearest Linnie, I have prayed for you. He spoke your name.\" A Journal Entry (translated from Spanish): 1880 \"I have experience the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I see his eyes when I close mine. They are hollow. Black. They saw me and pierced me. His wet hand. I will not sleep. His voice (unintelligible text).\" A Mariner's Log: 1691 \"He came to me in my sleep. From the foot of my bed I felt a sensation. He took everything. We must return to England. We shall not return here again at the request of the Rake.\" From a Witness: 2006 \"Three years ago, I had just returned from a trip from Niagara Falls with my family for the 4th of July. We were all very exhausted after a long day of driving, so my husband and I put the kids right to bed and called it a night. At about 4am, I woke up thinking my husband had gotten up to use the restroom. I used the moment to steal back the sheets, only to wake him in the process. I apologized and told him I though he got out of bed. When he turned to face me, he gasped and pulled his feet up from the end of the bed so quickly his knee almost knocked me out of the bed. He then grabbed me and said nothing. After adjusting to the dark for a half second, I was able to see what caused the strange reaction. At the foot of the bed, sitting and facing away from us, there was what appeared to be a naked man, or a large hairless dog of some sort. Its body position was disturbing and unnatural, as if it had been hit by a car or something. For some reason, I was not instantly frightened by it, but more concerned as to its condition. At this point I was somewhat under the assumption that we were supposed to help him. My husband was peering over his arm and knee, tucked into the fetal position, occasionally glancing at me before returning to the creature. In a flurry of motion, the creature scrambled around the side of the bed, and then crawled quickly in a flailing sort of motion right along the bed until it was less than a foot from my husband's face. The creature was completely silent for about 30 seconds (or probably closer to 5, it just seemed like a while) just looking at my husband. The creature then placed its hand on his knee and ran into the hallway, leading to the kids' rooms.I screamed and ran for the lightswitch, planning to stop him before he hurt my children. When I got to the hallway, the light from the bedroom was enough to see it crouching and hunched over about 20 feet away. He turned around and looked directly at me, covered in blood. I flipped the switch on the wall and saw my daughter Clara. The creature ran down the stairs while my husband and I rushed to help our daughter. She was very badly injured and spoke only once more in her short life. She said \"he is the Rake\". My husband drove his car into a lake that night, while rushing our daughter to the hospital. They did not survive. Being a small town, news got around pretty quickly. The police were helpful at first, and the local newspaper took a lot of interest as well. However, the story was never published and the local television news never followed up either. For several months, my son Justin and I stayed in a hotel near my parent's house. After we decided to return home, I began looking for answers myself. I eventually located a man in the next town over who had a similar story. We got in contact and began talking about our experiences. He knew of two other people in New York who had seen the creature we now referred to as the Rake. It took the four of us about two solid years of hunting on the internet and writing letters to come up with a small collection of what we believe to be accounts of the Rake. None of them gave any details, history or follow up. One journal had an entry involving the creature in its first 3 pages, and never mentioned it again. A ship's log explained nothing of the encounter, saying only that they were told to leave by the Rake. That was the last entry in the log. There were, however, many instances where the creature's visit was one of a series of visits with the same person. Multiple people also mentioned being spoken to, my daughter included. This led us to wonder if the Rake had visited any of us before our last encounter. I set up a digital recorder near my bed and left it running all night, every night, for two weeks. I would tediously scan through the sounds of me rolling around in my bed each day when I woke up. By the end of the second week, I was quite used to the occasional sound of sleep while blurring through the recording at 8 times the normal speed. (This still took almost an hour every day) On the first day of the third week, I thought I heard something different. What I found was a shrill voice. It was the Rake. I can't listen to it long enough to even begin to transcribe it. I haven't let anyone listen to it yet. All I know is that I've heard it before, and I now believe that it spoke when it was sitting in front of my husband. I don't remember hearing anything at the time, but for some reason, the voice on the recorder immediately brings me back to that moment. The thoughts that must have gone through my daughter's head make me very upset. I have not seen the Rake since he ruined my life, but I know that he has been in my room while I slept. I know and fear that one night I'll wake up to see him staring at me.\"Videos Concerning the Rake  In the Summer of 2011, an amateur film maker created a horror film based loosely on The Rake. It can be viewed on YouTube here: YouTube user Ryan Murphy (aka Vicious516) also made a video concerned with the Rake, which can be viewed here:Creepypasta Wiki Dead Bart  You know how Fox has a weird way of counting Simpsons episodes? They refuse to count a couple of them, making the amount of episodes inconsistent. The reason for this is a lost episode from season 1. Finding details about this missing episode is difficult, no one who was working on the show at the time likes to talk about it. From what has been pieced together, the lost episode was written entirely by Matt Groening. During production of the first season, Matt started to act strangely. He was very quiet, seemed nervous and morbid. Mentioning this to anyone who was present results in them getting very angry, and forbidding you to ever mention it to Matt. I first heard of it at an event where David Silverman was speaking. Someone in the crowd asked about the episode, and Silverman simply left the stage, ending the presentation hours early. The episode's production number was 7G06, the title was Dead Bart. The episode labeled 7G06, Moaning Lisa, was made later and given Dead Bart's production code to hide the latter's existence. In addition to getting angry, asking anyone who was on the show about this will cause them to do everything they can to stop you from directly communicating with Matt Groening. At a fan event, I managed to follow him after he spoke to the crowd, and eventually had a chance to talk to him alone as he was leaving the building. He didn't seem upset that I had followed him, probably expected a typical encounter with an obsessive fan. When I mentioned the lost episode though, all color drained from his face and he started trembling. When I asked him if he could tell me any details, he sounded like he was on the verge of tears. He grabbed a piece of paper, wrote something on it, and handed it to me. He begged me never to mention the episode again. The piece of paper had a website address on it, I would rather not say what it was, for reasons you'll see in a second. I entered the address into my browser, and I came to a site that was completely black, except for a line of yellow text, a download link. I clicked on it, and a file started downloading. Once the file was downloaded, my computer went crazy, it was the worst virus I had ever seen. System restore didn't work, the entire computer had to be rebooted. Before doing this though, I copied the file onto a CD. I tried to open it on my now empty computer, and as I suspected, there was an episode of The Simpsons on it. The episode started off like any other episode, but had very poor quality animation. If you've seen the original animation for Some Enchanted Evening, it was similar, but less stable. The first act was fairly normal, but the way the characters acted was a little off. Homer seemed angrier, Marge seemed depressed, Lisa seemed anxious, Bart seemed to have genuine anger and hatred for his parents. The episode was about the Simpsons going on a plane trip, near the end of the first act, the plane was taking off. Bart was fooling around, as you'd expect. However, as the plane was about 50 feet off the ground, Bart broke a window on the plane and was sucked out. At the beginning of the series, Matt had an idea that the animated style of the Simpsons' world represented life, and that death turned things more realistic. This was used in this episode. The picture of Bart's corpse was barely recognizable, they took full advantage of it not having to move, and made an almost photo-realistic drawing of his dead body. Act one ended with the shot of Bart's corpse. When act two started, Homer, Marge, and Lisa were sitting at their table, crying. The crying went on and on, it got more pained, and sounded more realistic, better acting than you would think possible. The animation started to decay even more as they cried, and you could hear murmuring in the background. The characters could barely be made out, they were stretching and blurring, they looked like deformed shadows with random bright colors thrown on them. There were faces looking in the window, flashing in and out so you were never sure what they looked like. This crying went on for all of act two. Act three opened with a title card saying one year had passed. Homer, Marge, and Lisa were skeletally thin, and still sitting at the table. There was no sign of Maggie or the pets. They decided to visit Bart's grave. Springfield was completely deserted, and as they walked to the cemetery the houses became more and more decrepit. They all looked abandoned. When they got to the grave, Bart's body was just lying in front of his tombstone, looking just like it did at the end of act one. The family started crying again. Eventually they stopped, and just stared at Bart's body. The camera zoomed in on Homer's face. According to summaries, Homer tells a joke at this part, but it isn't audible in the version I saw, you can't tell what Homer is saying. The view zoomed out as the episode came to a close. The tombstones in the background had the names of every Simpsons guest star on them. Some that no one had heard of in 1989, some that haven't been on the show yet. All of them had death dates on them. For guests who died since, like Michael Jackson and George Harrison, the dates were when they would die. The credits were completely silent, and seemed handwritten. The final image was the Simpson family on their couch, like in the intros, but all drawn in hyper realistic, lifeless style of Bart's corpse. A thought occurred to me after seeing the episode for the first time, you could try to use the tombstones to predict the death of living Simpsons guest stars, but there's something odd about most of the ones who haven't died yet. All of their deaths are listed as the same date.  \nCredited to\u00a0KI Simpson\u00a0Creepypasta Wiki Pok\u00e9mon Lost Silver  You see, I am a simple college student living alone in an apartment. I was very enthusiastic about the release of Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold/SoulSilver here in the states. I have purposely locked myself out of all media and the Internet aside for school purposes. That means no 4chan, no /v/, no Bulbapedia, etc. As I was busy with the school year and being poor at the time, I wasn't able to buy SoulSilver on its launch date. After my school year ended, I ordered SoulSilver on Amazon. However, it would take a week for it to arrive. I decided that during that time, I would replay my Crystal version on my Gameboy Color. However, I realized that long ago, my mom threw it away because I told her the save went dead, and I was very upset about it then. She also threw away my Silver version, so all I have is my Gameboy Color. As such, I set out to Gamestop and bought a used Silver version, as it's the only Pok\u00e9mon game left that they have for the GBC. Ten dollars \u2013 fairly cheap. I went home and started it up for a nostalgia trip. However, that's where things started getting bizarre, and most likely the reason why you read this. The Gamefreak logo started up as normal, but it just froze there. I thought the cart was just errored or something, so I turned it off and on. The same thing happened. I tried pressing A and Start over and over, and all of the buttons. Eventually, the logo vanished and there was a black screen for about five seconds. Suddenly, rather than going to the usual menu screen, I was already in the game in a previous saved file, which was odd as I was expecting all of these carts to have been wiped by the poor battery. Either way, I wasn't complaining, as I would have chosen the \"Continue\" option to see what the previous guy did anyways. First off, I checked his trainer information. His name was just \"\u2026\" \u2013 He didn't have much originality. I checked his profile and apparently he had 999:99 hours put into the game, with all 16 badges, 99999.9 Pok\u00e9dollars, and all 251 Pok\u00e9mon on the Pok\u00e9dex. Seeing as he apparently had Mew and Celebi logged also, I am guessing he either used a Game Genie or was a really hardcore Pok\u00e9mon player back then. I checked his Pok\u00e9mon to see what a badass team he has. To my surprise, I saw 5 Unowns and a sixth Pok\u00e9mon named \"HURRY\". I'm thinking that this must be some cruel joke by the person who last played this game, but I decided to check the profiles of those Pok\u00e9mon anyways. As expected, they were different letters of Unown, all Level 5. I was a bit shaky with my Unown alphabet at the time, but I identified the word spelled out to be \"LEAVE\". As for the sixth Pok\u00e9mon, it turned out to be a Cyndaquil (mind you, this is before there were individualized Pok\u00e9mon icons). The Cyndaquil looked normal, but it was Level 5 with only 1 HP left with only two attacks: \"Leer\" and \"Flash\". I don't know why they named him \"HURRY\", but at the time, I just disregarded it. The most eerie thing was that, despite my volume being at max, none of the Pok\u00e9mon he had said their usual cries. Just pure silence. Having enough of the team, I closed it. I was parked at what appears to be a room inside Bellsprout Tower. However, for some reason, there were no NPCs around. Even more eerie was that the \"pillar\" in the middle didn't move at all, as if just leaning on its side. There was no music at all, and there was no exit or ladder, or least I thought there wasn't. I walked around for a few minutes but can't seem to find a way out. This was certainly not a room I've seen in the Bellsprout Tower before. I tried checking my items for an Escape Rope, but the bag was completely empty. There wasn't any Wild Pok\u00e9mon either. Finally, I managed to find a ladder, which turned out to be behind the \"pillar\". The screen turned black and the music finally started playing. I had a sudden chill, as I recognize that melody I heard to be the theme you hear when you listened to the radio at the Alph Ruins where the Unown are at. I immediately realize that it wasn't a loading transition, but rather I was in a dark room and would need Flash. Before I took care of that though, I immediately checked my Pok\u00e9gear to change the radio to something more pleasant, but it turns out that there was no Radio card, or even a Phone nor Time cards. There was only a Map card in which Gold (\"\u2026\" from earlier, and I will call him Gold from now on) was just walking in a midst of black. I recall that Cyndaquil has Flash, so I turned off my Pok\u00e9gear and made Cyndaquil use Flash. I didn't see any message saying \"HURRY has used Flash!\" or anything like that. The room just became lit just like that, and I soon regretted it. The room was a chilling blood-red with a linear gray path heading south. The ladder I used to go up/down was not there at all. I had no choice but to head south. The screen got darker every 20 steps I made, until I finally made it to the end, which appears to be a sign. I read the sign, which said \"TURN BACK NOW\". Suddenly, I was asked to answer YES/NO, but there was no question asked. I chose YES as I do not know what it was asking, and the screen went black again, making a \"ladder climbed\" sound. The Unown Radio music stopped, and in a few seconds was replaced with the not-as-creepy Pok\u00e9 Flute radio music. I was in another dark room, but I held my breath and used Flash again. Suddenly, it said that \"HURRY has fainted!\" which was odd since I recall that there was no status conditions like Poison on him, and I clearly wasn't in a battle. I checked my Pok\u00e9mon quickly and suddenly he's no longer in my party. In fact, after a bit of investigating, none of my Pok\u00e9mon are there, but instead all replaced with Level 10 Unown. I did the same thing as before and spelled out the Unown. My then team of Unown spelled \"HEDIED\". Either way, after that creepy change, the room was lit to reveal myself in a very small room that appears to be only four squares big. The walls of that room were gray bricks, as if I was inside something that was hollowed out. Outside that room appears to be a bunch of graves similar to the ones in Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue. I've walked around that small room and pressed A but nothing happened. I've already concluded that this was clearly a hacked game and some sadistic fuck sold it to GameStop. However, my curiosity kept me going. I checked the trainer profile of \"\u2026\" again only to find out that the sprite of Gold was missing his arms. He also seems to appear less smug, but rather seems more sad and empty in a way that I do not know how to describe. For some reason, it also now said that he has 24 badges, which was clearly impossible. After a few minutes of aimless wondering, my character suddenly spun and did the Escape Rope spinning animation. Instead of flying up though, my character spun downwards slowly, as if sinking. After that screen, the music stopped. After finally landing, the overworld sprite of Gold is coloured differently now. Instead of the usual red colour he dons, he appears completely white now, including his skin. It's as if he came straight from the colorless Game Boy games placed into a colored background of the Gameboy Color. I checked his profile, and now, while now is as white as his overworld sprite, he lost his legs and has what appears to be bloody tears from his eyes. It also says he now has 32 badges, which now starts to disturb me as this change of number seems to represent something important. I also checked my Pok\u00e9mon, which this time contains 5 Unowns and a Level 100 Celebi without a nickname. The Unown are this time Leveled 15 and spelled out \"DYING\". I checked the Celebi's profile. It was a shiny Celebi, except there's only half of the sprite. One leg, one arm, one eye. It only has one attack: \"Perish Song\". The area I was in itself was the Sprout Tower with the immobile pillar as before, except everything is apparently red now. I walked north for what felt like forever. Eventually, I finally encountered some generic men and women NPC. They were all lined up to the side just facing the long slantish pillar in the middle. They were also white, and nothing happens when I try to speak to them. I kept on going north until eventually the pillar finally appears chopped off, with a transparent Red in that spot. I went up to Red and without even pressing A, I was suddenly engaged and finally in a battle. The music starts again, which it sounds like the Unown Radio music again, but played backwards. Gold's battle backsprite matches his front one with the bloody eyes, white skin, and lack of arms, while Red's sprite was the same as before in GSC, except transparent. The text simply said \"wants to battle!\" as if he has no name, and both of us only have one Pok\u00e9mon each, which is weird as I swore I had six with the Unowns. My shiny Celebi came out, conveniently with half-a-sprite for the back sprite also. The \"Shiny\" noise and animation was different, as the sounds it made sound like multiple \"Screech\" attacks used consecutively. Red sent out a seemingly normal male Pikachu, except he is Level 255 and his sprite seems sad and has tears in his eyes. Rather than the usual \"FIGHT/ITEM/PKMN/RUN\" menu, I was only given the option to use the Attacks. Since Celebi only has one, I chose it. Naturally, since Pikachu was Level 255, he went first. \"PIKACHU used CURSE!\", lowering his Speed and increasing his other Stats. I'm not even sure if Pikachu could use Curse. \"CELEBI used PERISH SONG!\" In three turns, both Pok\u00e9mon get KO'd \u2013 not like I have a choice. At this point, it didn't even go back to the Fight menu, as the battle just continued without me. Also note that there were no animations at all for some reason. \"PIKACHU used FLAIL!\", which didn't do much damage despite his Level and boost as his health was maxed. \"CELEBI used Perish Song!\" Nothing happens as it was already used. \"PIKACHU used FRUSTRATION!\", which did a shit-ton of damage, knocking Celebi down to less than 10 HP. \"CELEBI used Pain Split!\", which surprised me as Celebi didn't even have that attack in the first place. Now Celebi and Pikachu have about 150 HP. \"PIKACHU used MEAN LOOK!\" Not like that did anything. As expected, due to the effects of Perish Song, my Celebi fainted. Except in the text, it said \"CELEBI has died!\" and instead of the ordinary drop off the screen animation, the CELEBI backsprite just vanished. For some reason, the Pikachu was still up even with Perish Song and it didn't count as my loss. Pikachu used one more different attack beyond the 5 attack limit: \"PIKACHU used DESTINY BOND!\" Afterwards, it said \"PIKACHU has died!\", with a slow fade-out animation. Apparently, I was the winner, as the transparent Red Sprite showed up and said \"..........\" At that point, I just freaked out, as that transparent Red sprite was suddenly beheaded, leaving nothing but his transparent body. The battle then ended at that point and faded out along with the music. I'm back in the overworld, with another change to the Gold sprite \u2013 he's now as transparent as Red's overworld sprite. I quickly checked Gold's profile, where this time the only thing remains of him is his head, with a transparent skin. The head was zoomed in a bit, showing a black void in his eyes. It now stated that he now has 40 badges. I then backed out and checked my Pok\u00e9mon. They were all Level 20 Shiny Unown, which when spelled out, read \"NOMORE\". I was at what I now know is next to the end. There was apparently no music playing, but for some reason I still felt like something was there that could be heard. I was back in my room in New Bark Town. Maybe finally I get to play this game properly, but who am I kidding. I knew that sadistic fuck must have done something. I \"walked\" around my room to interact with things, as I'm a bit afraid to go down the stairs to see what was awaiting down there. Note I said \"walked\", as while the background was moving, Gold was not moving his transparent limbs at all while doing so, just floating like those ghosts you see in Diamond/Pearl. As expected, the radio, computer, and TV did not work, so I had no choice but to go down the stairs. I ended up in the same lower level room of my house. Everything appears normal, except mom isn't home. After failing to interact with anything in this room, I decided to go outside. To my surprise, that door leading outside at the south didn't work, and instead I just walk straight through it to a void. I continued moving south to see what the fuck was going on. My house vanishes as I head south into the void. It was creepy as when I entered the void, the outline on Gold's transparent sprite turned white to contrast with the pitch black. Eventually, I reached a white area and Gold's sprite turned black and transparent again. I continued south without thinking of stopping at all. After a long trek south, I finally encountered something. It was GOLD's regular sprite. I talked to it. He said \"Good bye forever ....\" (notably with a space inbetween the forever and ....), and vanished. As that happened, it said \"??? used NIGHTMARE\" which at that point, I would not deny that being possible. Gold did another Escape Rope animation spinning slowly downwards like before. I'm now back into that small hollowed-out room surrounded by graves earlier. Or at least I say I was back there, as there's no sprite anymore. I tried to walk around but nothing moved \u2013 not even wall bumping noise. I checked my trainer profile with absolutely no Gold sprite left. It said I have 0 badges and all the pictures of the Johto Gym Leaders at the bottom were replaced with skulls. I checked my Pok\u00e9mon, which were all Level 25 Unown. As expected, it spelled out a phrase that I dared to read: \"IMDEAD\". As soon as I went back to the overworld, the room I supposedly was in was then covered with the same blocks as the walls. I then figured out what exactly that room was when the final text was said: \"R.I.P. ...\" That room was a big grave, surrounded by other graves. Gold has already been dead. He died presumably a few years after he defeated Red. He was a young trainer who, despite his efforts in collecting so many badges and attempts at becoming a Pok\u00e9mon master, was still unable to avoid the inevitable fate of death, and his efforts were eventually forgotten by the next generation. I was unable to escape from that text no matter what I pressed. I tried resetting the game, and the same thing happened, at which I then finally decided to give up on that horrible nightmare. After that experience, I will never look at the \"gimmick\" Unown the same way again. They say that only the first generation have folk tales and legends, but the second generation have shown me how unpleasant the truth can be. I eventually enjoyed SoulSilver immensely, but I still can't unthink what that rigged game has told me.The Game  In early September 2010, a complete, working fangame of Lost Silver was made. The game is its own executable rather than a ROM hack, and therefore does not require an emulator nor a Pok\u00e9mon Silver ROM. There has been talk about expanding the story by adding a different series of events if the player chooses \"No\" at the sign that says \"TURN BACK NOW.\" While many people believe that the events when choosing \"No\" (which is referred to as \"Hidden\" by fans) is a made-up addition by the fans, it is in fact made up by the original writer in response to the creator of the fangame. The stand-alone fan-game was made using an underlying pok\u00e9mon engine created by a game creation program called Game Maker. The source file or the game can be downloaded and edited here.Creepypasta Wiki Suggested Reading  A good start for those who are new to creepypasta.Creepypasta Wiki Computers and Internet  Pastas having to do with computers and/or the Internet, such as cursed data files, haunted CDs and floppies, or mysterious websites.Creepypasta Wiki The Rugrats Theory Original Version  The Rugrats really were a figment of Angelica's demonic and unimaginable imagination. Chuckie died in 1986 along with his mother, that's why Chaz is a nervous wreck all the time. Tommy was born in 1988, but he was a stillborn, that's why Stu is constantly in the basement making toys for the son who never had a chance to live. The DeVilles had an abortion in 1990, Angelica couldn't figure whether it would be a boy or a girl thus creating the twins. As for \"All Grown Up\" the teenage Angelica became addicted to various narcotics which further aggravated her Schizophrenia, bringing her back to her childhood and thus her creations she obsessed over, because of time lapse between the present and the last time she interacted with her creations, she made them older. Angelica was constantly taking hits of acid, so she would never have to live without her creations who were her only company. In a judgmental world, Angelica's mom actually died of a heroine overdose in 1982 just after Angelica was born, and Drew in his depression married a gold digging whore that Angelica idolized because she fooled herself into thinking it was her real mom but always had a concept of her mom, Cynthia, and took a barbie doll and made it after her mom's image, wearing an unwashed orange dress and having jacked up hair, which is why she was so attached to it. Later in life she followed in her mom's footsteps with drugs and everything, dying of overdose at age 13 when 'All Grown Up!' was \"cancelled\". The only rugrat not to be fictional however, was unborn Tommy's brother Dil. However, Angelica didn't know the difference between Dil and her creations, although Dil didn't follow her commands. After endless crying and a refusal to disappear like the others did when Angelica was angry with them, she hit him. Due to this, he sustained a brain hemorrhage, which resulted in a deformation. As he grew up, his damage only became more evident and by the time he was 9 in \"All Grown Up!\" he lived as an outcast, being ridiculed for his weirdness and retardation. The immense guilt over this is what led Angelica to her drug use and is what led Angelica to un-create the Rugrats briefly, until her experience with hallucinogenics. On a trip to Paris to find love, Chaz married a woman named Kira (He was actually going to marry a different woman named Coco, but she just wanted him for his money.) who had a daughter named Kimi that was torn from her because she was a cocaine addict (Angelica imagined her from Kira's stories). He lost his mind after the death of his wife and was in denial that she was ever prostitute. Upon return to America, Chaz and Kira married and she got her greencard. It was actually a really happy and romantic story. Kira continually struggled with addiction, but was relatively happy with her life and Chaz Suzie was actually Angelica's only friend, who entertained the thought of Angelica's creations, for her sake. Angelica spent the last days of her life in the back of the school cafeteria, imagining friends around her and playing with the lives of her creations.\"Tweaked\" version  The Rugrats really were a figment of Angelica's imagination. Chuckie died a long time ago along with his mother; that's why Chaz is a nervous wreck all the time. Tommy was a stillborn; that's why Stu is constantly in the basement making toys for the son who never had a chance to live. The DeVilles had an abortion. Angelica couldn't figure whether it would be a boy or a girl, thus creating the twins. As for \"All Grown Up,\" Angelica was a bipolar schizophrenic, who, as a teenager, became addicted to various narcotics, bringing her back to her childhood, thus creating a world in her mind that she obsessed over. Because of the time lapse between the present and the last time she interacted with her imaginary world, she made them older. Angelica was constantally taking hits of acid so she would never have to live without her creations. To her, her creations were her only company in a judgemental world. Angelica's mom actually died of a heroin overdose. Angelica was schizophrenic and bipolar because she was a crack baby. Additionally, Drew, in his depression, married a gold digging whore that Angelica idolized because she fooled herself into thinking it was her real mom. However, she always had a concept of her mom, Cynthia. She used a barbie doll to mirror her birth mother's image\u2014wearing an unwashed orange dress and jacked up hair\u2014which is why she was so attached to it. Later in life she followed in her mother's footsteps, dying of overdose at age 13 when \"All Grown Up!\" was \"cancelled.\" The only rugrat not to be fictional however, was unborn Tommy's brother, Dil. However, Angelica didn't know the difference between Dil and her creations. Dil didn't follow her commands and after endless crying and a refusal to disappear like the others did when Angelica was angry with them, so she hit him. After she hit him, he screamed a screeching tune, and Stu ran in and pulled his neice off of his only child, but it was too late. Dil had a brain hemorrage, which resulted in a deformation. As he grew up, his damage only became more evident, and by the time he was 9 in \"All Grown Up!\" he lived as an outcast, being ridiculed for his weirdness and retardation. The immense guilt over this is what caused Angelica to start using drugs, and to un-create the rugrats briefly, until her experience with hallucinogenics. Chaz lost his mind after the death of his first wife and was in denial that she was ever a prostitute. On a trip to Paris to find love, Chaz fell in love with a hooker named Kira (He was originally going to marry a different hooker, but she just wanted him for his money). Kira once had a daughter named Kimi, but the baby was torn from her by law due to her cocaine addiction. (Angelica imagined Kimi from Kira's stories.) Upon return to America, Chaz and Kira married and she got her greencard. It was a surprisingly happy and romantic story. Kira continually stuggled with addiction, but was relatively happy with her new life with Chaz. Suzie was Angelica's only friend, who entertained the thought of Angelica's creations because they seemed to make her happy. She later became a psychologist and teamed up with Nickelodeon to make the Rugrats. When Angelica died of the overdose, Suzie helped arrange her funeral. Because of her addictions and her mental state, Angelica was expelled from society, which lead to a break with reality and her eventual death. She spent the last days of her life in the back of the school cafeteria, imagining friends around her and playing with the lives of her creations.Creepypasta Wiki Smile Dog  Smile Dog's story consists of a classic horror set-up \u2013 an amateur writer visits the house of a lady who supposedly has a story for which he can borrow from. Rather than speak, however, the lady has locked herself up in her room, crying and ranting about nightmares and visions and various other problems. All of these center around a floppy disk she had been given that contain the image smile.jpg \u2013 which is smile.dog. Other cases of this have cropped up... Viewing this image incites insanity, and no copy of the exact image exists on the web though likenesses of it do. The true image of smile.jpg is recognized due to the effect it has on the viewer \u2013 that is, they wind up dead. Attaching the file \u2013 that is, spreading the word, is the only way to save oneself from the smile.dog that appears in one's dreams demanding to spread the word. Some say that the original legend began with an image of the devil.The Pasta  I first met in person with Mary E. in the summer of 2007. I had arranged with her husband of fifteen years, Terence, to see her for an interview. Mary had initially agreed, since I was not a newsman but rather an amateur writer gathering information for a few early college assignments and, if all went according to plan, some pieces of fiction. We scheduled the interview for a particular weekend when I was in Chicago on unrelated business, but at the last moment Mary changed her mind and locked herself in the couple's bedroom, refusing to meet with me. For half an hour I sat with Terence as we camped outside the bedroom door, I listening and taking notes while he attempted fruitlessly to calm his wife. The things Mary said made little sense but fit with the pattern I was expecting: though I could not see her, I could tell from her voice that she was crying, and more often than not her objections to speaking with me centered around an incoherent diatribe on her dreams \u2014 her nightmares. Terence apologized profusely when we ceased the exercise, and I did my best to take it in stride; recall that I wasn't a reporter in search of a story, but merely a curious young man in search of information. Besides, I thought at the time, I could perhaps find another, similar case if I put my mind and resources to it. Mary E. was the sysop for a small Chicago-based Bulletin Board System in 1992 when she first encountered smile.jpg and her life changed forever. She and Terence had been married for only five months. Mary was one of an estimated 400 people who saw the image when it was posted as a hyperlink on the BBS, though she is the only one who has spoken openly about the experience. The rest have remained anonymous, or are perhaps dead. In 2005, when I was only in tenth grade, smile.jpg was first brought to my attention by my burgeoning interest in web-based phenomena; Mary was the most often cited victim of what is sometimes referred to as \"Smile.dog\", the being smile.jpg is reputed to display. What caught my interest (other than the obvious macabre elements of the cyber-legend and my proclivity toward such things) was the sheer lack of information, usually to the point that people don't believe it even exists other than as a rumor or hoax. It is unique because, though the entire phenomenon centers on a picture file, that file is nowhere to be found on the internet; certainly many photomanipulated simulacra litter the web, showing up with the most frequency on sites such as the imageboard 4chan, particularly the /x/-focused paranormal subboard. It is suspected these are fakes because they do not have the effect the true smile.jpg is believed to have, namely sudden onset temporal lobe epilepsy and acute anxiety. This purported reaction in the viewer is one of the reasons the phantom-like smile.jpg is regarded with such disdain, since it is patently absurd, though depending on whom you ask the reluctance to acknowledge smile.jpg's existence might be just as much out of fear as it is out of disbelief. Neither smile.jpg nor Smile.dog is mentioned anywhere on Wikipedia, though the website features articles on such other, perhaps more scandalous shocksites as ****** (hello.jpg) or 2girls1cup; any attempt to create a page pertaining to smile.jpg is summarily deleted by any of the encyclopedia's many admins. Encounters with smile.jpg are the stuff of internet legend. Mary E.'s story is not unique; there are unverified rumors of smile.jpg showing up in the early days of Usenet and even one persistent tale that in 2002 a hacker flooded the forums of humor and satire website Something Awful with a deluge of Smile.dog pictures, rendering almost half the forum's users at the time epileptic. It is also said that in the mid-to-late 90s that smile.jpg circulated on usenet and as an attachment of a chain email with the subject line \"SMILE!! GOD LOVES YOU!\" Yet despite the huge exposure these stunts would generate, there are very few people who admit to having experienced any of them and no trace of the file or any link has ever been discovered. Those who claim to have seen smile.jpg often weakly joke that they were far too busy to save a copy of the picture to their hard drive. However, all alleged victims offer the same description of the photo: A dog-like creature (usually described as appearing similar to a Siberian husky), illuminated by the flash of the camera, sits in a dim room, the only background detail that is visible being a human hand extending from the darkness near the left side of the frame. The hand is empty, but is usually described as \"beckoning\". Of course, most attention is given to the dog (or dog-creature, as some victims are more certain than others about what they claim to have seen). The muzzle of the beast is reputedly split in a wide grin, revealing two rows of very white, very straight, very sharp, very human-looking teeth. This is, of course, not a description given immediately after viewing the picture, but rather a recollection of the victims, who claim to have seen the picture endlessly repeated in their mind's eye during the time they are, in reality, having epileptic fits. These fits are reported to continue indeterminably, often while the victims sleep, resulting in very vivid and disturbing nightmares. These may be treated with medication, though in someses it is more effective than others. Mary E., I assumed, was not on effective medication. That was why after my visit to her apartment in 2007 I sent out feelers to several folklore- and urban legend-oriented newsgroups, websites, and mailing lists, hoping to find the name of a supposed victim of smile.jpg who felt more interested in talking about his experiences. For a time nothing happened and at length I forgot completely about my pursuits, since I had begun my freshman year of college and was quite busy. Mary contacted me via email, however, near the beginning of March 2008. Terence contacted me later that month with the news that his wife had killed herself. While cleaning up the various things she'd left behind, closing email accounts and the like, he happened upon the above message. He was a man in shambles; he wept as he told me to listen to his wife's advice. He'd found the diskette, he revealed, and burned it until it was nothing but a stinking pile of blackened plastic. The part that most disturbed him, however, was how the diskette had hissed as it melted. Like some sort of animal, he said. I will admit that I was a little uncertain about how to respond to this. At first I thought perhaps it was a joke, with the couple belatedly playing with the situation in order to get a rise out of me. A quick check of several Chicago newspapers' online obituaries, however, proved that Mary E. was indeed dead. There was, of course, no mention of suicide in the article. I decided that, for a time at least, I would not further pursue the subject of smile.jpg, especially since I had finals coming up at the end of May. But the world has odd ways of testing us. Almost a full year after I'd returned from my disastrous interview with Mary E., I received another email: The final line chilled me to the bone. According to my email client there was one file attachment called, naturally, smile.jpg. I considered downloading it for some time. It was mostly likely a fake, I imagined, and even if it weren't I was never wholly convinced of smile.jpg's peculiar powers. Mary E.'s account had shaken me, yes, but she was probably mentally unbalanced anyway. After all, how could a simple image do what smile.jpg was said to accomplish? What sort of creature was it that could break one's mind with only the power of the eye? And if such things were patently absurd, then why did the legend exist at all? If I downloaded the image, if I looked at it, and if Mary turned out to be correct, if Smile.dog came to me in my dreams demanding I spread the word, what would I do? Would I live my life as Mary had, fighting against the urge to give in until I died? Or would I simply spread the word, eager to be put to rest? And if I chose the latter route, how could I do it? Whom would I burden in turn? If I went through with my earlier intention to write a short article about smile.jpg, I decided, I could attach it as evidence. And anyone who read the article, anyone who took interest, would be affected. And even assuming the smile.jpg attached to the email was genuine, would I be capricious enough to save myself in that manner? Could I spread the word? Yes. Yes I could.Creepypasta Wiki Rasper Book Background Knowledge (Prologue of Sorts)  (This writing is a transcript of a thread on 4chan. The original thread can be seen by the picture on the right.) \u2014 Post 1: The Rasper Book is a book which contains detailed descriptions of murders that took place in the 20's. Apparently the murders were so sick that the police in the town covered it all up. They pinned the murders on a man with the surname Rasper (hence, the name of the book) and killed him because of the murders. Afterwards, they found out that he wasn't guilty and covered the whole thing up. Along with descriptions there is [sic] pictures so disturbing it can turn even the most sane men into mentally unstable people. There has [sic] been a few pictures posted relating to the Rasper. One was an old letter written by someone called R. Thomas. He was writing to someone, who wanted to read the book, telling them not to do it. As I remember, he said how he can't stop seeing the bodies and that he couldn't eat or sleep and that he's been having terrible evil thoughts. POST 2: >>6403670 (Quote of the second paragraph of post 1) This explains the old /x/fag with, >>6503361 and >>6503336 (Can't find the original posts that the above mentions...) POST 3:\u00a0(Poster's name is Slappy The Clown.) I know that there is [sic] rumoured to be several copies. Not meant, but there is more than one Rasper book (as far as I can recall anyway). Other than that, I know nothing more that [sic] what's been said in this thread. I think my parents recalled something on the story. Whether it was just a rumour they'd heard I don't know, but when I questioned them on it they did seem to remember something about a \"Rasper\" and the murders he may or may not have committed Note from the Transcriber: From the text and way of spelling of words in the thread and in the diary, most of this Rasper stuff appears to have taken place in Britian, or the isle itself (Such as the word \"rumour\" et al, and when the girl gives a \"pound\" to the bum), I do not know where the Rasper murders occurred, but by the looks it happened somewhere around there. This also appears to be an ongoing problem, with the advention of the book beginning in the 1920's and reoccurring afterwards. What the reoccurring pattern is is not yet known; the only thing that is known is that whenever the book shows up, the events are repeated and are connected. The characters \"William\" and \"Peter\" described towards the end of the diary might have been connected in preceded events, or, even, the victims themselves. However, this is all speculation and should be taken with a grain of salt unless found otherwise.The Diary  The following Diary pages are the only information known about this book. (See transcription below.)Transcript (By Bearycool)  Tuesday 30 May 2006 Today was really good, apart from school! I had to hand in my final essay for English. I better not fail! After school, me and Melissa met Hollie and Jack (He is sooo cute.) Phil the tramp was still hanging about near the pond. He still stinks of booze, I gave him a pound because I feel sorry for him. We sat in the park for a while before it started raining. Then we went home. Jack walked me home he lives on the next street. I wish he wasn\u2019t going out with Hollie. Love Faye J Wednesday 31 May 2006 Dear diary, Today was boring! Nothing good happened! Mel\u2019s brother told us about book called the called Rasper Book. He scared us and then told us a bunch of ghost stories. I didn\u2019t see Jack at school or Hollie. I think they were skiving off. Faye (little heart) XOXO Thursday 1 June 2006 I saw Jack today. We talked in math the whole class. I hardly got any work done. Mel\u2019s brother said me and Mel could go to his party tomorrow night. I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m nervous though.

I hate her! On MSN she said that I was flirting with Jack. She's a fucking bitch. (little doggy footprints here) After we came home from the pub, we go to Sunday dinners sometimes, and mum had a surprise for me. A PUPPY!!!

Love, Faye XOXO Monday 5 June 2006 I love Coco. He\u2019s a bit too mad though. He always jumps and stuff. Today was bad at school, both Hollie and Jack ignored me. Me and Mel just think she\u2019s jealous. We also got a new teacher, Mr. Pearman. (like pier mean NOT pear-man lol) He doesn\u2019t seem too strict, which is good. Faye XOXO (scribbly thing and an ugly face with the caption \u201clol I dono!\u201d) H love h Tuesday 6 June 2006 OMG! Today was awful. I went to Mel\u2019s. Kev was there with his friends. They had that book! we all sat around in a circle and read a page then passed it on. First page was a warning page. After that were things I thought no one could do. We only got through two pages and even Kev and his mates looked freaked. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to sleep. I might tell mum, but she might go mad. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so upset. The things it said were nasty. How can someone do that??? Faye Wednes 7 June 2006 I didn\u2019t sleep well last night. When I shut my eyes I keep imagining things.

I went to her house after school, and Kev was in his room. He only came down once and looked like he had been crying. I think his GF might have broken up with him. I asked if he was ok and he snapped at me then went back up to his room. Me and Mel spent ages talking about Jack and Liam. She confessed she likes him LOL. I LOVE JACK! Friday 9 June Me and Hollie had another argument. She told me to stay away from Jack. I [hate] her!!! I\u2019m going to Mel\u2019s for a bit, byeeee xo.

Final Picture: (These words are marked at the bottom of the diary) HELP ME HE KNOWSA Final Note From the Transcriber-- Three Years Later  Hey, everyone! This is the guy who found all of these photos and drew up the transciption and such! I'm in no ways the original author of this piece, but I hold special bond to this thing, being its collaborator and transcriber. Heh, you kind of get attached to things that aren't fully yours all the time as a writer and editor, it seems. And man, this shit does brings back memories of going through the old wikia, and trying to edit old pages because of, well, lack of polish. If anything, that's what gives me respect for this story.\u00a0 Though it appears that this little piece I edited has gotten some comments below-- namely criticism. While I do agree that the writer was trying a bit hard, whoever he/she is, I do feel like this is way better than Jeff the Killer and other such \"Famous\" creepypasta. I believe this deserved more attention than Jeff at the very least, but I do agree that this isn't exactly the best piece out there either. Things like Jvk, Smile.dog, etc. are much better examples of terror. But I think we're all missing the true creepiness of this story: the fact that the thread at the beginning of this little Rasper saga took place BEFORE the diary. The most recent date I saw this diary on the internet was a year after this thread-- so this wasn't in anyway connected to the diary. There actually was a thread before the thread in this one, but I can't seem to find that motherfucker anywhere... In either case, \u00a0that means this story has been around for quite sometime, and may indeed have some roots in the urban legends of the british isles-- or the UK if you prefer that name! I do believe that this was based on a killing in the 20's, but, again, that's complete speculation on my end. Whether the Rasper book and other such artefacts of insanity actually exists remains a mystery, and probably will forever be considering this will never be a popular story. In either case, let me give you one final thought on this little tale and I'll be off again for another three years! We'll never know what is real or unreal in this barrage of badly written words; whether there is fact or ficition in these pages that are hidden in the deep caverns of this website. And I suppose that's the true terror of all of this, isn't it? That there, scattered in the winds, may indeed be waiting a little book-- all battered with no words on its dark red cover... No indication on what lies within its yellowing pages besides little scratch marks. And the only way to find out its contents is to open it and read.\u00a0 But in reading, one cannot turn back: You forfeit your life beyond the warning page. And we can never tell where this book might lie, waiting to pop up and claim someone. That's the true terror of this I have always enjoyed-- and still do! It is why I went and edited this, entranced by a book whose soul is like that of a Lovecraft Old God.\u00a0 So, please, give this story a deeper thought if you can. Oh, and don't go try looking for that book: if it is real, it will come looking for you. - J.K.

Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me. And that's when you met me. \"What... what happened?\" you asked. \"Where am I?\" \"You died,\" I said, matter-of-factly. No point mincing words. \"There was a... a truck and it was skidding...\" \"Yup,\" I said. \"I... I died?\" \"Yup. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies,\" I said. You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. \"What is this place?\" you asked. \"Is this the afterlife?\" \"More or less,\" I said. \"Are you God?\" you asked. \"Yup,\" I replied. \"I'm God.\" \"My kids... my wife,\" you said. \"What about them?\" \"Will they be alright?\" \"That what I like to see,\" I said. \"You just died and your main concern is for your family. That's good stuff right there.\" You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man. Some vague authority figure. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty. \"Don't worry,\" I said. \"They'll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn't have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.\" \"Oh,\" you said. \"So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?\" \"Neither,\" I said. \"You'll be reincarnated.\" \"Ah,\" you said. \"So the Hindus were right.\" \"All the religions are right in their own way,\" I said. \"Walk with me.\" You followed along as we strolled in the void. \"Where are we going?\" \"Nowhere in particular,\" I said. \"It's just nice to walk while we talk.\" \"So what's the point, then?\" you asked. \"When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won't matter.\" \"Not so!\" I said. \"You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don't remember them right now.\" I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. \"Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it's hot or cold. You put a tiny part or yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had.\" \"You've been a human for the last 34 years, so you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for longer, you'd start remembering everything. But there's no point doing that between each life.\" \"How many times have I been reincarnated, then?\" \"Oh, lots. Lots and lots. And into lots of different lives.\" I said. \"This time around you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 A.D.\" \"Wait, what?\" you stammered. \"You're sending me back in time?\" \"Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.\" \"Where do you come from?\" you pondered. \"Oh sure!\" I explained. \"I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you'll want to know what it's like there but you honestly won't understand.\" \"Oh,\" you said, a little let down. \"But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, could I have interacted with myself at some point?\" \"Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own timespan you don't even know it's happening.\" \"So what's the point of it all?\" \"Seriously?\" I asked. \"Seriously? You're asking me for the meaning of life? Isn't that a little stereotypical?\" \"Well it's a reasonable question,\" you persisted. I looked in your eye. \"The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.\" \"You mean mankind? You want us to mature?\" \"No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature, and become a larger and greater intellect.\" \"Just me? What about everyone else?\" \"There is no one else,\" I said. \"In this universe, there's just you, and me.\" You stared blankly at me. \"But all the people on earth...\" \"All you. Different incarnations of you.\" \"Wait. I'm everyone!?\" \"Now you're getting it,\" I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back. \"I'm every human who ever lived?\" \"Or who will ever live, yes.\" \"I'm Abraham Lincoln?\" \"And you're John Wilkes Booth, too,\" I added. \"I'm Hitler?\" you said, appalled. \"And you're the millions he killed.\" \"I'm Jesus?\" \"And you're everyone who followed him.\" You fell silent. \"Every time you victimized someone,\" I said, \"you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you've done, you've done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.\" \"Why?\" you asked me. \"Why do all this?\" \"Because someday, you will become like me. Because that's what you are. You're one of my kind. You're my child.\" \"Whoa,\" you said, incredulous. \"You mean I'm a god?\" \"No. Not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing. Once you've lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.\" \"So the whole universe,\" you said. \"It's just...\" \"An egg of sorts.\" I answered. \"Now it's time for you to move on to your next life.\" And with that, I sent you on your way.  \nCredited to\u00a0Andy Weir\u00a0Creepypasta Wiki Lavender Town Syndrome  The Lavender Town Syndrome (also known as \"Lavender Town Tone\" or \"Lavender Town Suicides\") was a peak in suicides and illness of children between the ages of 7-12 shortly after the release of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green in Japan, back in February 27th, 1996. Rumors say that these suicides and illness only occurred after the children playing the game reached Lavender Town, whose theme music had extremely high frequencies, that studies showed that only children and young teens can hear, since their ears are more sensitive. Due to the Lavender Tone, at least two-hundred children supposedly committed suicide, and many more developed illnesses and afflictions. The children who committed suicide usually did so by hanging or jumping from heights. Those who did not acted irrationally complained of severe headaches after listening to Lavender Town's theme. Although Lavender Town now sounds differently depending on the game, this mass hysteria was caused by the first Pok\u00e9mon game released. After the Lavender Tone incident, the programmers had fixed Lavender Town's theme music to be at a lower frequency, and since children were no longer affected by it. One video appeared in 2010 using \u201dspecial software\" to analyze the audio of Lavender Town's music. When played, the software created images of the Unown near the end of the audio. This raised a controversy, since the Unown didn't appear until the Generation 2 games: Silver, Gold, and Crystal. The Unown translate to \"LEAVE NOW\". There is also the said Beta Version of Lavender Town. It is said that the Beta Version of Pocket Monsters was released to some kids to test the games. This is the video of the Beta Version of Lavender Town:"
