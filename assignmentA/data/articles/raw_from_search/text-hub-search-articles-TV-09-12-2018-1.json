If you look at the disclaimers on the homepage of the wiki, it notes that not all information is available, due to lack of licensing for 5th edition. As of now (July 2015), Wizards of the Coast has yet to release a license for 5th edition, meaning anything that is NOT made freely available through their website (i.e. the D&D Basic Rules) is most likely protected by copyright.
