Sarah takes on Beth's identity and occupation as a\npolice detective after Beth's death. During the first season, Sarah\ndiscovers that she is a clone, that she has many 'sister' clones\nspread throughout North America and Europe, and that someone is\nplotting to kill them and her. Alongside her foster brother, Felix\nDawkins, and two of her fellow clones, Alison Hendrix and Cosima\nNiehaus, Sarah discovers the origin of the clones: a scientific\nmovement called Neolution. The movement believes that human beings\ncan use scientific knowledge to direct their evolution as a species.\nThe Neolutionists thus advocate eugenics. The movement has an\ninstitutional base in the large, influential, and wealthy bio-tech\ncorporation, the Dyad Institute. The Dyad Institute conducts basic\nresearch, lobbies political institutions, and promotes its eugenics\nprogram, aided by the clone Rachel Duncan. But it also seeks to\nprofit from the technology the clones embody. It has thus placed\n\"monitors\"\ninto\nthe clones' personal lives, allegedly to study them scientifically\nbut also to keep them under surveillance.\nSarah\neventually discovers that she's also wanted by the police and by a\nsecret religious group, the Proletheans. A faction of the Proletheans\ncarries out the clone assassinations. They use a clone, Helena, to\nkill the other clones. Yet Sarah and Helena share a surrogate birth\nmother and are twins both genetically and with respect to their early\nmaternal environment. The Proletheans assassinate clones because they\nbelieve they are abominations.\nEventually,\nthe Dyad Institute and the Proletheans learn that Sarah has a\ndaughter, Kira, the only known offspring of a clone, all other clones\nbeing sterile by design. The plot lines of the series revolve around\nSarah and Kira's efforts to avoid capture by the clearly sinister\nNeolutionists and Proletheans as well as around the efforts made by\neach clone to give sense to her life and origin. The attempt to\ncontrol the creation of human life is a dominant theme that drives\nvarious story lines. A second key theme forms around the intrigues\nmade by the Dyad Group and the Proletheans along with the earlier\nintrigues made by the authors of Project Leda (see the Greek myth\nLeda and the Swan) and Mrs. S., Sarah\u2019s foster mother, and her\npolitical network.Both themes intersect in the effort to control the\ncreation of human life. Sarah, who matures because of her struggles,\ndefends the bond between parent and child against the Neolutionists\nand Proletheans.", "image": "https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150403223850/orphanblack/images/4/48/Wikia-hero-image", "wam_score": "42.9496", "original_dimensions": {"width": 850, "height": 315}}, {"id": 1162966, "name": "Orphan Black Wikia", "hub": "TV", "language": "de", "topic": "Entertainment", "domain": "de.orphan-black.wikia.com", "wordmark": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/orphan-black/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png/revision/latest?cb=20171120142533&path-prefix=de", "title": "Orphan Black Wikia", "url": "http://de.orphan-black.wikia.com", "stats": {"edits": 525, "articles": 62, "pages": 361, "users": 16447317, "activeUsers": 0, "images": 83, "videos": 7, "admins": 1, "discussions": 1}, "topUsers": [34761322], "founding_user_id": "24326730", "creation_date": "2015-04-04 10:22:51", "headline": null, "lang": "de", "flags": [], "desc": "", "image": "", "wam_score": 0}, {"id": 1459243, "name": "Wikia Orphan Black", "hub": "TV", "language": "es", "topic": "TV", "domain": "es.orphan-black.wikia.com", "wordmark": "https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/orphan-black/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png/revision/latest?cb=20160911171107&path-prefix=es", "title": "Wikia Orphan Black", "url": "http://es.orphan-black.wikia.com", "stats": {"edits": 170, "articles": 8, "pages": 145, "users": 16519025, "activeUsers": 0, "images": 27, "videos": 0, "admins": 1, "discussions": 1}, "topUsers": [], "founding_user_id": "24759031", "creation_date": "2016-09-11 16:54:10", "headline": null, "lang": "es", "flags": [], "desc": "", "image": "", "wam_score": 0}, {"id": 1603902, "name": "Wiki Orphan Black", "hub": "TV", "language": "fr", "topic": "Entertainment", "domain": "fr.orphan-black.wikia.com", "wordmark": "https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/orphan-black/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png/revision/latest?cb=20170731151319&path-prefix=fr", "title": "Wiki Orphan Black", "url": "http://fr.orphan-black.wikia.com", "stats": {"edits": 508, "articles": 38, "pages": 377, "users": 16555972, "activeUsers": 0, "images": 217, "videos": 25, "admins": 1, "discussions": 0}, "topUsers": [], "founding_user_id": "9511296", "creation_date": "2017-07-31 14:34:16", "headline": null, "lang": "fr", "flags": [], "desc": "", "image": "", "wam_score": 0}], "next": 0, "total": 4, "batches": 1, "currentBatch": 1}
