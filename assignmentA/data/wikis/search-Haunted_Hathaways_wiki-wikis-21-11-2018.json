After Michelle goes through a divorce, she moves her family from New York City to New Orleans and opens a bakery, only to discover a family of three already living in the house that they move into. Single father Ray Preston and his two sons Miles and Louie, ages 13 and 9 respectively, are very proud of this home because it is where the boys were born and where they have spent their entire lives and afterlives! Yes, the Prestons are ghosts, and together with the Hathaways become The Brady Bunch with a supernatural twist.\n\nHere at the Haunted Hathaways Wiki, we document everything there is to know about the show.
