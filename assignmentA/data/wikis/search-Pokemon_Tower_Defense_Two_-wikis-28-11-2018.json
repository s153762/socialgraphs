Similarly, the tower defense genre is comparable in its popularity and the number of fans that it has around the world. Although these two very different styles of game initially seem incompatible, \"Sam and Dan Games\" managed to bring a very successful marriage of the two, designing the extremely addictive and incredibly popular series of Pok\u00e9mon Tower Defense 2. The response was overwhelmingly positive that this sequel is put forward over PTD1's success. Pok\u00e9mon Tower Defense 2 is arguably the best realisation of browser-based Pok\u00e9mon action in existence, and is a heavy-hitter in the competitive realm of the tower defense games.", "image": "https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20161102154215/pokemontowerdefensetwo/images/f/fa/Wikia-Visualization-Main%2Cpokemontowerdefensetwo.png", "wam_score": "48.3641", "original_dimensions": {"width": 640, "height": 324}}], "next": 0, "total": 1, "batches": 1, "currentBatch": 1}
