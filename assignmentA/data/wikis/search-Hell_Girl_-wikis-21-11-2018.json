It has also been adapted later on into a manga series which is still ongoing, a live-action television series which has finished airing with a total of 12 episodes, and a few games and mini-games. These adaptations are not canon to the anime series and follow different storylines instead, though with core similarities to the anime. The story of the anime (and in fact the whole series) has a recurring theme of injustice, hatred, suffering, and revenge. Elements like violence, harsh language, trickery, blackmail, animal cruelty, torture, insanity, twisted and complex human emotions, and such are found from time to time. Therefore, the anime is not suitable for younger audiences and viewers, and is rated R-17+.", "image": "https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20161102143719/hell-girl/images/a/ad/Wikia-Visualization-Main%2Chell_girl.png", "wam_score": "0.1331", "original_dimensions": {"width": 977, "height": 713}}, {"id": 772751, "name": "Wiki Jigoku Shoujo", "hub": "TV", "language": "es", "topic": "Anime", "domain": "hell-girl.fandom.com", "wordmark": "", "title": "Wiki Jigoku Shoujo", "url": "https://hell-girl.fandom.com/es/", "stats": {"edits": 328, "articles": 52, "pages": 228, "users": 15850057, "activeUsers": 0, "images": 14, "videos": 2, "admins": 1}, "topUsers": [60618, 35703214], "founding_user_id": "4712396", "creation_date": "2013-06-19 01:39:57", "headline": null, "lang": "es", "flags": [], "desc": "", "image": "", "wam_score": 0}, {"id": 1814568, "name": "GIRL'S SQUAD Wiki", "hub": "Music", "language": "en", "topic": "Entertainment", "domain": "hellogirls.wikia.com", "wordmark": "", "title": "GIRL'S SQUAD Wiki", "url": "http://hellogirls.wikia.com", "stats": {"edits": 86, "articles": 1, "pages": 83, "users": 17605720, "activeUsers": 1, "images": 0, "videos": 0, "admins": 1, "discussions": 0}, "topUsers": [8], "founding_user_id": "36981916", "creation_date": "2018-09-22 07:53:46", "headline": null, "lang": "en", "flags": [], "desc": "", "image": "", "wam_score": 0}], "next": 0, "total": 3, "batches": 1, "currentBatch": 1}
