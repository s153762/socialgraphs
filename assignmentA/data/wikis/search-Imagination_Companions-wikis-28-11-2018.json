Leading the way is Blooregard Q. Kazoo (a/k/a \"Bloo\" for short), who along with his creator, Mac, join other imaginary friends like Wilt, a one-armed basketball player; Eduardo, who protects those from everything but is scared of even houseflies; the sanity-challenged Coco, created by a stranded child as a companion as a hybrid of a bird, an airplane and a tree; the stuffy Mr. Herriman, an amorphized rabbit who still lives in the Edwardian era, and Madame Foster's human granddaughter, the overworked and lovable Frankie, who takes care of everyone.\n\nOther friends that have been part of the residence are Fluffer Nutter, a pink squirrel; The New Guy, who once took ofense to Bloo's sense of humor (or so it seems); one imaginary Prince Charming, who used lame pick-up lines on Frankie when he first arrived; and Jackie Khones, a green one-eyed stick figure with a deep voice.", "image": "https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20161104092833/fhif/images/2/2e/Wikia-Visualization-Main%2Cfhif.png", "wam_score": "58.3070", "original_dimensions": {"width": 517, "height": 377}}], "next": 0, "total": 1, "batches": 1, "currentBatch": 1}
