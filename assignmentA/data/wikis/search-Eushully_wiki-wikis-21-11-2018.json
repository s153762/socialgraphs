It was originally part of Arkham Products, but went independent with its sister studio Anastasia and became a brand under their own company named Eukleia.\nIt's known for taking time to develop blockbuster titles, primarily in the RPG, SRPG, and SLG genres. It's focus on \"games\" and lack of any ADV (\"visual novel\") titles in its lineup distinguishes it from the majority of its brethren in the eroge industry.\n\nAs a rule, every single female character in Eushully games, regardless of their importance in the game (ranging from the main heroine to a generic old woman or a female merchant) are voiced.
