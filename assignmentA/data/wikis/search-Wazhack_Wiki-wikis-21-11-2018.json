This is not a twitcher - you can spend all the time you need contemplating what to do in any situation - and with over 250 different types of items to be found, there is no shortage of solutions to problems. With over 100 different types of monsters, there is no shortage of problems either. But this is no puzzler - you will have to fight your adrenaline and use your sword or staff as much as your inventory. It's not a game of plodding to the end and winning (though it is winnable), it's about experiencing the attempt... and learning lessons that will help your next valiant attempt!", "image": "https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20161102154632/wazhack/images/a/a3/Wikia-Visualization-Main%2Cwazhack.png", "wam_score": "0.6155", "original_dimensions": {"width": 480, "height": 320}}], "next": 0, "total": 1, "batches": 1, "currentBatch": 1}
